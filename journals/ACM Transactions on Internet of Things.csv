SCVS: On AI and Edge Clouds Enabled Privacy-preserved Smart-city Video Surveillance Services,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141041237&doi=10.1145%2f3542953&partnerID=40&md5=2a5c2f37d4aff6148db7789ea0a48fb8,"Video surveillance systems are increasingly becoming common in many private and public campuses, city buildings, and facilities. They provide many useful smart campus/city monitoring and management services based on data captured from video sensors. However, the video surveillance services may also breach personally identifiable information, especially human face images being monitored; therefore, it may potentially violate the privacy of human subjects involved. To address this privacy issue, we introduced a large-scale distributed video surveillance service model, called Smart-city Video Surveillance (SCVS). SCVS is a video surveillance data collection and processing platform to identify important events, monitor, protect, and make decisions for smart campus/city applications. In this article, the specific research focus is on how to identify and anonymize human faces in a distributed edge cloud computing infrastructure.To preserve the privacy of data during video anonymization, SCVS utilizes a two-step approach: (i) parameter server-based distributed machine learning solution, which ensures that edge nodes can exchange parameters for machine learning-based training. Since the dataset is not located on a centralized location, the data privacy and ownership are protected and preserved. (ii) To improve the machine learning model's accuracy, we presented an asynchronous training approach to protect data and model privacy for both data owners and data users, respectively. SCVS adopts an in-memory encryption approach, where edge computing nodes collect and process data in the memory of edge nodes in encrypted form. This approach can effectively prevent honest but curious attacks. The performance evaluation shows the presented privacy protection platform is efficient and effective compared to traditional centralized computing models as presented in Section 5. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",computer vision; deep-learning; distributed training; edge cloud; IoT; personally-identifiable information (PII); privacy preservation,Cloud computing; Computer vision; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Internet of things; Monitoring; Privacy-preserving techniques; Security systems; Video signal processing; Deep-learning; Distributed training; Edge clouds; Edge nodes; IoT; Personally identifiable information; Personally-identifiable information; Privacy preservation; Surveillance services; Video surveillance; Smart city
Integrating IoT-Sensing and Crowdsensing with Privacy: Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Sensing for Smart Cities,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140763036&doi=10.1145%2f3549550&partnerID=40&md5=b6713a5f7f355e8e1d2fbbe57fa2136b,"Data sensing and gathering is an essential task for various information-driven services in smart cities. On the one hand, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can be deployed at certain fixed locations to capture data reliably but suffer from limited sensing coverage. On the other hand, data can also be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary users but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users' contributions. In this article, we explore an integrated paradigm called “hybrid sensing” that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary manner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not covered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in calibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that can be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In this article, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user privacy-IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private user data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a privacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of our system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available parking spaces in outdoor parking lots. We implemented our hybrid sensing system for smart parking and conducted extensive empirical evaluations. Finally, our hybrid sensing system can be potentially applied to other information-driven services in smart cities. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",crowdsensing; crowdsourcing; hybrid sensing; IoT; machine learning; Privacy; smart cities; smart parking,Crowdsourcing; Hybrid systems; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Smart city; Crowdsensing; Data gathering; Data sensing; Hybrid sensing; Machine-learning; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Sensing coverage; Sensing systems; Smart parking; Internet of things
Model-driven Self-adaptive Deployment of Internet of Things Applications with Automated Modification Proposals,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141044295&doi=10.1145%2f3549553&partnerID=40&md5=45466d852d4c6e1adbbf6a470fc5b593,"Today's Internet of Things (IoT) applications are mostly developed as a bundle of hardware and associated software. Future cross-manufacturer app stores for IoT applications will require that the strong coupling of hardware and software is loosened. In the resulting IoT applications, a quintessential challenge is the effective and efficient deployment of IoT software components across variable networks of heterogeneous devices. Current research focuses on computing whether deployment requirements fit the intended target devices instead of assisting users in successfully deploying IoT applications by suggesting deployment requirement relaxations or hardware alternatives. This can make successfully deploying large-scale IoT applications a costly trial-and-error endeavor. To mitigate this, we have devised a method for providing such deployment suggestions based on search and backtracking. This can make deploying IoT applications more effective and more efficient, which, ultimately, eases reducing the complexity of deploying the software surrounding us. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Novel Approach for Classification in Resource-Constrained Environments,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141303346&doi=10.1145%2f3549552&partnerID=40&md5=636f48f065edc48c569dbdf6ed4d94e5,"Internet of Things' (IoT) deployments are increasingly dependent upon learning algorithms to analyse collected data, draw conclusions, and take decisions. The norm is to deploy such learning algorithms on the cloud and have IoT nodes interact with the cloud. While this is effective, it is rather wasteful in terms of energy expended and temporal latency. In this article, the endeavour is to develop a technique that facilitates classification, an important learning algorithm, within the extremely resource constrained environments of IoT nodes. The approach comprises selecting a small number of representative data points, called prototypes, from a large dataset and deploying these prototypes over IoT nodes. The prototypes are selected in a manner that they appropriately represent the complete dataset and are able to correctly classify new, incoming data. The novelty lies in the manner of prototype selection for a cluster that not only considers the location of datapoints of its own cluster but also that of datapoints in neighboring clusters. The efficacy of the approach is validated using standard datasets and compared with state-of-the-art classification techniques used in constrained environments. A real world deployment of the technique is done over an Arduino Uno-based IoT node and shown to be effective. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",classification; clustering; constrained environment; IoT,Classification (of information); Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Classification technique; Clusterings; Constrained environment; Datapoints; Energy; Internet of thing'; Large datasets; Prototype selection; Real world deployment; State of the art; Internet of things
Who's Controlling My Device? Multi-User Multi-Device-Aware Access Control System for Shared Smart Home Environment,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137779850&doi=10.1145%2f3543513&partnerID=40&md5=6cfa66b8a441caba3e348455cb9fdf36,"Multiple users have access to multiple devices in a smart home system-typically through a dedicated app installed on a mobile device. Traditional access control mechanisms consider one unique, trusted user that controls access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and dynamically-changing demands on multiple devices that cannot be handled by traditional access control techniques. Moreover, smart devices from different platforms/vendors can share the same home environment, making existing access control obsolete for smart home systems. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce Kratos+, a novel multi-user and multi-device-aware access control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access control demands. Kratos+ has four main components: user interaction module, backend server, policy manager, and policy execution module. Users can easily specify their desired access control settings using the interaction module that are translated into access control policies in the back-end server. The policy manager analyzes these policies, initiates automated negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands, and generates final policies to enforce in smart home systems. We implemented Kratos+ as a platform-independent solution and evaluated its performance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with a rich set of configurations (337 different policies including 231 demand conflicts and 69 restriction policies). These configurations also included five different threats associated with access control mechanisms. Our extensive evaluations show that Kratos+ is very effective in resolving conflicting access control demands with minimal overhead. We also performed an extensive user study with 72 smart home users to better understand the user's needs before designing the system and a usability study to evaluate the efficacy of Kratos+ in a real-life smart home environment. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",access control; internet-of-things; policy language; privilege escalation; Smart home system,Automation; Internet of things; Managers; Access control mechanism; Control demands; Home environment; Home users; Multi user multi devices; Multiple devices; Policy language; Privilege escalation; Smart homes; Smart-home system; Access control

Network and system administrators must correctly identify which devices are functional, need security updates, or are vulnerable to specific attacks. IoT profiling is an emerging technique to identify and validate the connected devices' specific behaviour and isolate the suspected and vulnerable devices within the network for further monitoring. This article provides a comprehensive review of various IoT device profiling methods and provides a clear taxonomy for IoT profiling techniques based on different security perspectives. We first investigate several current IoT device profiling techniques and their applications. Next, we analyzed various IoT device vulnerabilities, outlined multiple features, and provided detailed information to implement profiling algorithms' risk assessment/mitigation stage. By reviewing approaches for profiling IoT devices, we identify various state-of-the-art methods that organizations of different domains can implement to satisfy profiling needs. Furthermore, this article also discusses several machine learning and deep learning algorithms utilized for IoT device profiling.

In this study, we conduct 13 semi-structured interviews and survey 508 individuals from a variety of backgrounds to discover and categorize how consumer IoT devices are affecting interpersonal relationships in the United States. We highlight several themes, providing exploratory data about the pervasiveness of interpersonal costs and benefits of consumer IoT devices.

Green Planning of IoT Home Automation Workflows in Smart Buildings,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141038924&doi=10.1145%2f3549549&partnerID=40&md5=ddbb835b989bbc614eb676140a863ac6,"The advancement of renewable energy infrastructure in smart buildings (e.g., photovoltaic) has highlighted the importance of energy self-consumption by energy-demanding IoT-enabled devices (e.g., heating/cooling, electromobility, and appliances), which refers to the process of intelligently consuming energy at the time it is available. This stabilizes the energy grid, minimizes energy dissipation on power lines but more importantly is good for the environment as energy from fossil sources with a high CO2 footprint is minimized. On the other hand, user comfort levels expressed in the form of Rule Automation Workflows (RAW), are usually not aligned with renewable production patterns. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, coined IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF+), which aims to bridge this gap and balance the trade-off between comfort, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. The IMCF+ framework incorporates an innovative Green Planner (GP) algorithm, which is an AI-inspired algorithm that schedules energy consumption with a variety of amortization strategies. We have implemented IMCF+ and GP as part of a complete IoT ecosystem in openHAB and our extensive evaluation shows that we achieve a CO2 reduction of 45-59% to satisfy the comfort of a variety of user groups with only a moderate ≈ 3% in reducing their comfort levels. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",green energy planning; renewable energy self-consumption; Smart IoT,Automation; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Energy dissipation; Energy policy; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Comfort level; Energy; Energy planning; Green energy; Green energy planning; Meta controls; Renewable energies; Renewable energy self-consumption; Smart IoT; Work-flows; Energy utilization
A Classification Strategy for Internet of Things Data Based on the Class Separability Analysis of Time Series Dynamics,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134876714&doi=10.1145%2f3533049&partnerID=40&md5=e08eae7a269901c10e75dbb619aa0e63,"This article proposes TSCLAS, a time series classification strategy for the Internet of Things (IoT) data, based on the class separability analysis of their temporal dynamics. Given the large number and incompleteness of IoT data, the use of traditional classification algorithms is not possible. Thus, we claim that solutions for IoT scenarios should avoid using raw data directly, preferring their transformation to a new domain. In the ordinal patterns domain, it is possible to capture the temporal dynamics of raw data to distinguish them. However, to be applied to this challenging scenario, TSCLAS follows a strategy for selecting the best parameters for the ordinal patterns transformation based on maximizing the class separability of the time series dynamics. We show that our method is competitive compared to other classification algorithms from the literature. Furthermore, TSCLAS is scalable concerning the length of time series and robust to the presence of missing data gaps on them. By simulating missing data gaps as long as 50% of the data, our method could beat the accuracy of the compared classification algorithms. Besides, even when losing in accuracy, TSCLAS presents lower computation times for both training and testing phases. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bandt-Pompe transformation; class separability index; Internet of Things; ordinal patterns transformation; time series classification; time series dynamics,Classification (of information); Data mining; Dynamics; Metadata; Time series; Time series analysis; Bandt-pompe transformation; Class separability; Class separability index; Classification algorithm; Ordinal pattern; Ordinal pattern transformation; Pattern transformations; Separability index; Time series classifications; Time series dynamics; Internet of things

The IEEE 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) link layer protocol allows the nodes to change their physical channel after each transmission to eliminate interference and multi-path fading on the channels. However, due to this feature, new nodes (aka pledges) take more time to join the 6TiSCH network, resulting in significant energy consumption and inefficient data transmission, which makes the communication unreliable. Therefore, the formation of 6TiSCH network has gained immense interest among the researchers. To date, numerous solutions have been offered by various researchers in order to speed up the formation of 6TiSCH networks. This article briefly discusses about the 6TiSCH network and its formation process, followed by a detailed survey on the works that considered 6TiSCH network formation. We also perform theoretical analysis and real testbed experiments for a better understanding of the existing works related to 6TiSCH network formation.

Performance Evaluation of Group OSCORE for Secure Group Communication in the Internet of Things,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134881343&doi=10.1145%2f3523064&partnerID=40&md5=0932700ff7d59d1f43e279d6b33772ed,"The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a major application-layer protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). The recently standardized security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) efficiently provides end-to-end security of CoAP messages at the application layer, also in the presence of untrusted intermediaries. At the same time, CoAP supports one-to-many communication, targeting use cases such as smart lighting and building automation, firmware update, or emergency broadcast. Securing group communication for CoAP has additional challenges. It can be done using the novel Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) security protocol, which fulfills the same security requirements of OSCORE in group communication environments. While evaluations of OSCORE are available, no studies exist on the performance of Group OSCORE on resource-constrained IoT devices.This article presents the results of our extensive performance evaluation of Group OSCORE over two popular constrained IoT platforms, namely Zolertia Zoul and TI Simplelink. We have implemented Group OSCORE for the Contiki-NG operating system and made our implementation available as open source software. We compared Group OSCORE against unprotected CoAP as well as OSCORE.

This approach both protects against event sensor faults and sophisticated attackers.To validate our system's performance, we set up a ""smart home""in an office environment. We recognize 22 event types using 48 sensors over the course of two weeks. Using data from the physical sensors, we verify the event stream supplied by the event sensors to detect both masking and spoofing attacks.We consider three threat models: a zero-effort attacker, an opportunistic attacker, and a sensor-compromise attacker who can arbitrarily modify live sensor data. For spoofed events, we achieve perfect classification for 9 out of 22 events and achieve a 0% false alarm rate at a detection rate exceeding 99.9% for 15 events. For 11 events the majority of masking attacks can be detected without causing any false alarms. We also show that even a strong opportunistic attacker is inherently limited to spoofing few select events and that doing so involves lengthy waiting periods. Finally, we demonstrate the vulnerability of a single-classifier system to compromised sensor data and introduce a more secure approach based on sensor fusion. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Runtime Resource Management and Provisioning Middleware for Fog Computing Infrastructures,2022,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134877774&doi=10.1145%2f3506718&partnerID=40&md5=22509c4bfa99a116df09ce1d8d015340,"The pervasiveness and growing processing capabilities of mobile and embedded systems have enabled the widespread diffusion of the Fog Computing paradigm in the Internet of Things scenario, where computing is directly performed at the edges of the networked infrastructure in distributed cyber-physical systems. This scenario is characterized by a highly dynamic workload and architecture in which applications enter and leave the system, as well as nodes and connections. This article proposes a runtime resource management and provisioning middleware for the dynamic distribution of the applications on the processing resources. The proposed middleware consists of a two-level hierarchy: (i) a global Fog Orchestrator monitoring the architecture status and (ii) a Local Agent on each node, performing a fine-grain tuning of its resources. The co-operation between these components allows one to dynamically adapt and exploit the fine-grain nodes view for fulfilling the defined system-level goals, for example, minimizing power consumption while meeting Quality of Service requirements such as application throughput. This hierarchical architecture and the adopted policies offer a unified optimization strategy that is unique with regard to existing approaches that typically focus on a single aspect of resource management at runtime.

One such application is monitoring a fleet of vehicles in real time to predict their remaining useful life. The consensus self-organized models (COSMO) approach is an example of a predictive maintenance system. The present work proposes a novel Internet of Things based architecture for predictive maintenance that consists of three primary nodes: the vehicle node, the server leader node, and the root node, which enable on-board vehicle data processing, heavy-duty data processing, and fleet administration, respectively. A minimally viable prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented and deployed to a local bus garage in Gatineau, Canada.The present work proposes improved consensus self-organized models (ICOSMO), a fleet-wide unsupervised dynamic sensor selection algorithm. To analyze the performance of ICOSMO, a fleet simulation was implemented. The J1939 data gathered from a hybrid bus was used to generate synthetic data in the simulations. Simulation results that compared the performance of the COSMO and ICOSMO approaches revealed that in general ICOSMO improves the average area under the curve of COSMO by approximately 1.5% when using the Cosine distance and 0.6% when using Hellinger distance. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Controller Area Network; fleet management; Internet of Things; J1939; machine learning; predictive analytics; predictive maintenance; sensor selection,Buses; Control system synthesis; Fleet operations; Internet of things; Maintenance; Network architecture; Predictive analytics; Controller-area network; Dynamic sensor; Fleet management; J1939; Machine-learning; Modeling approach; Performance; Predictive maintenance; Self-organized models; Sensor selection; Machine learning

At the moment, the most widespread standard for such scenarios is MQTT. We also register an increasing interest in IoT-enabled Location-Based Services, where data must be disseminated over a target area and its spatial relevance and the current positions of the consumers must be taken into account. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol does not support location awareness, and hence it may result in notifying consumers that are geographically far from the data source, causing increased network overhead and poor Quality of Service (QoS). We address the issue by proposing LA-MQTT, an extension to standard MQTT supporting spatial-aware publish-subscribe communications on IoT scenarios. LA-MQTT is broker-agnostic and fully backward compatible with standard MQTT. As monitoring the position of subscribers over time may cause privacy concerns, LA-MQTT carefully supports location privacy preservation, for which the optimal tradeoff with the QoS of the spatial notifications is addressed via a learning-based algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LA-MQTT by experimentally evaluating its features via large-scale hybrid simulations, including real and virtual components.

Many devices deployed in homes, vehicles, industrial sites, and hospitals carry a great risk of damage to property, harm to a person, or breach of security if they behave faultily. We propose a general fault handling system named IoTRepair, which shows promising results for effectiveness with limited latency and power overhead in an IoT environment. IoTRepair dynamically organizes and customizes fault-handling techniques to address the unique problems associated with heterogeneous IoT deployments. We evaluate IoTRepair by creating a physical implementation mirroring a typical home environment to motivate the effectiveness of this system. Our evaluation showed that each of our fault-handling functions could be completed within 100 milliseconds after fault identification, which is a fraction of the time that state-of-the-art fault-identification methods take (measured in minutes). The power overhead is equally small, with the computation and device action consuming less than 30 milliwatts. This evaluation shows that IoTRepair not only can be deployed in a physical system, but offers significant benefits at a low overhead. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The adoption of edge computing can help the cloud deliver services that meet time critical application requirements. However, it is challenging to meet the IoT application demands while using the resources smartly to reduce energy consumption at the edge of the network. In this context, we propose a fully distributed resource allocation algorithm for the IoT-edge-cloud environment, which (i) increases the infrastructure resource usage by promoting the collaboration between edge nodes, (ii) supports the heterogeneity and generic requirements of applications, and (iii) reduces the application latency and increases the energy efficiency of the edge. We compare our algorithm with a non-collaborative vertical offloading and with a horizontal approach based on edge collaboration.

In this paper, we present QID, the first system that can identify a Qi-compliant mobile device during wireless charging in real-time. QID extracts features from the clock oscillator and control scheme of the power receiver and employs light-weight algorithms to classify the device. QID adopts a 2-dimensional motion unit to emulate a variety of multi-coil designs of Qi, which allows for fine-grained device fingerprinting.

There has been extensive research to address this problem with Domain Adaptation (DA) for learning domain invariant features. However, when considering advances for time series, those methods remain limited to the use of hard parameter sharing (HPS) between source and target models, and the use of domain adaptation objective function. To address these challenges, we propose a soft parameter sharing (SPS) DA architecture with representation learning while modeling the relation as non-linear between parameters of source and target models and modeling the adaptation loss function as the squared Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed architecture advances the state-of-the-art for time series in the context of activity recognition and in fields with other modalities, where SPS has been limited to a linear relation. An additional contribution of our work is to provide a study that demonstrates the strengths and limitations of HPS versus SPS.

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, such anomalies often concur with dynamic offloading events where computation tasks are migrated from well-occupied Fog nodes to less-occupied ones to reduce the overall computation time latency and improve the throughput. Such concurrences jointly affect the system behaviors, which makes anomaly detection inaccurate. We propose a qualitative and quantitative (QQ) control chart to monitor system anomalies through identifying the changes of monitored runtime metric relationship (quantitative variables) under the presence of dynamic offloading (qualitative variable) using a risk-adjusted monitoring framework.

Such schemes allow one device to verify proximity of another device without user assistance utilizing their physical context (e.g., audio). The state-of-the-art copresence detection schemes suffer from two major limitations: (1) They cannot accurately detect copresence in low-entropy context (e.g., empty room with few events occurring) and insufficiently separated environments (e.g., adjacent rooms), (2) They require devices to have common sensors (e.g., microphones) to capture context, making them impractical on devices with heterogeneous sensors. We address these limitations, proposing Next2You, a novel copresence detection scheme utilizing channel state information (CSI). In particular, we leverage magnitude and phase values from a range of subcarriers specifying a Wi-Fi channel to capture a robust wireless context created when devices communicate. We implement Next2You on off-the-shelf smartphones relying only on ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipsets and evaluate it based on over 95 hours of CSI measurements that we collect in five real-world scenarios. Next2You achieves error rates below 4%, maintaining accurate copresence detection both in low-entropy context and insufficiently separated environments. We also demonstrate the capability of Next2You to work reliably in real-time and its robustness to various attacks.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Channel state information; Context-based; Copresence detection; Internet of Things; Neural networks,Entropy; Internet of things; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Authentication systems; Channel-state information; Co-presence; Context-based; Copresence detection; Detection scheme; Low entropy; Neural-networks; State of the art; User assistance; Channel state information

However, the current process to onboard IoT devices is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which makes the process vulnerable to human errors and security risks. In order to have a streamlined onboarding process, we need a mechanism to reliably associate each digital identity with each physical device. We design an onboarding mechanism called MAIDE to fill this technical gap. MAIDE is an Augmented Reality (AR)-facilitated app that systematically selects multiple measurement locations, calculates measurement time for each location and guides the user through the measurement process. The app also uses an optimized voting-based algorithm to derive the device-to-ID mapping based on measurement data. This method does not require any modification to existing IoT devices or the infrastructure and can be applied to all major wireless protocols such as BLE, and WiFi. Our extensive experiments show that MAIDE achieves high device-to-ID mapping accuracy. For example, to distinguish two devices on a ceiling in a typical enterprise environment, MAIDE achieves ∼95% accuracy by measuring 5 seconds of Received Signal Strength (RSS) data for each measurement location when the devices are 4 feet apart.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",AR; IoT; Mobile; Onboarding; RSS; Wireless,Augmented reality; Electronic document identification systems; Location; Mapping; Wi-Fi; 'current; Human errors; Human securities; Labour-intensive; Measurement locations; Mobile; Mobile systems; Network infrastructure; Onboarding; Received signal strength; Internet of things

To address such a gap, we propose the Elk Audio OS as a novel and open source OS in this space. It is a Linux-based OS optimized for ultra-low-latency and high-performance audio and sensor processing on embedded hardware, as well as for handling wireless connectivity to local and remote networks.

With the help of precise in situ information, agricultural practices, such as irrigation, fertilization, and plant protection, can be dynamically adapted to the changing needs of individual sites, thereby supporting yield increases and resource optimization. Nowadays, IoT technology with networked sensors deployed in greenhouses and farmlands already contributes to in situ information. In addition to existing soil sensors for moisture or nutrient monitoring, there are also (mainly optical) sensors to assess growth developments and vital conditions of crops. This article presents a novel and complementary approach for a low-cost crop sensing that is based on temporal variations of the signal strength of low-power IoT radio communication. To this end, the relationship between crop growth, represented by the leaf area index (LAI), and the attenuation of signal propagation of low-cost radio transceivers is investigated. Real-world experiments in wheat fields show a significant correlation between LAI and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) time series. Moreover, influencing meteorological factors are identified and their effects are analyzed. Including these factors, a multiple linear model is finally developed that enables an RSSI-based LAI estimation with great potential. © 2020 ACM.",humidity; Internet-of-Things (IoT); leaf area index (LAI); link quality (LQ); precision agriculture; radio propagation; received signal strength indicator (RSSI); temperature; vegetation; wireless sensor network (WSN),Agricultural technology; Costs; Crops; Farms; Internet of things; Moisture control; Precision agriculture; Radio communication; Radio transceivers; Radio transmission; Radio waves; Vegetation; Internet-of-thing; Leaf area index; Link quality; Low-costs; Precision Agriculture; Received signal strength indicator; Received signal strength indicators; Wireless sensor network; Wireless sensor networks

In this article, we consider the problem of deploying wireless camera networks inside a complex indoor setting for surveillance applications. We formulate the problem of the minimum connected guarding network whose objective is to place a minimum number of cameras satisfying both visual coverage of the domain and wireless network connectivity. We prove that finding the minimum connected guarding network is NP-hard in both the geometric and discrete settings. We also give a 2-approximation algorithm to the geometric minimum guarding network problem. Motivated by the connection of this problem with the watchman tour problem and the art gallery problem, we developed two algorithms to calculate the locations of camera deployment. By deploying a prototype testbed, we verify the feasibility of the system design. Using simulations on 20 real floor plans, we demonstrate that our solutions reduce the number of cameras by up to 28%, and reduce the number of relay nodes by up to 47%. © 2020 ACM.",Camera network deployment; visibility coverage; wireless connectivity,Constraint satisfaction problems; Security systems; Wireless networks; Camera network; Camera network deployment; Network deployment; Real systems; Surveillance applications; System deployment; Visibility coverage; Visual coverages; Wireless camera networks; Wireless connectivities; Visibility
An evaluation of the 6TiSCH distributed resource management mode,2020,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097336520&doi=10.1145%2f3395927&partnerID=40&md5=caa55a30a0e54bf1c95010614fe2052b,"The IETF is currently defining the 6TiSCH architecture for the Industrial Internet of Things to ensure reliable and timely communication. 6TiSCH relies on the IEEE TSCH MAC protocol and defines different scheduling approaches for managing TSCH cells, including a distributed (neighbor-to-neighbor) scheduling scheme, where cells are allocated by nodes in a cooperative way. Each node leverages a Scheduling Function (SF) to compute the required number of cells, and the 6top (6P) protocol to negotiate them with neighbors. Currently, the Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF) is under consideration for standardization. However, multiple SFs are expected to be used in real deployments, in order to accommodate the requirements of different use cases. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of 6TiSCH distributed scheduling to assess its performance under realistic conditions. Firstly, we derive an analytical model to assess the 6P protocol, and we show that 6P transactions take a long time to complete and may also fail. Then, we evaluate the performance of MSF and other distributed SFs through simulations and real experiments. The results show that their performance is affected by the failure of 6P transactions and the instability of the routing protocol, which may lead to congestion from which the network is unable to recover. Finally, we propose a new SF (E-OTF) and show, through simulations and real experiments, that it can effectively improve the overall performance, by allowing nodes to quickly recover from congestion. © 2020 ACM.",6TiSCH; 6top; distributed scheduling function; MSF; OTF; RPL,Function evaluation; Medium access control; Titanium compounds; 6TiSCH; 6top; Distributed scheduling; Distributed scheduling function; Minimal scheduling function; OTF; Performance; RPL; Scheduling functions; Scheduling
An All-wireless SDN framework for BLE Mesh,2020,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107178278&doi=10.1145%2f3403581&partnerID=40&md5=357a5d16a0b9c5ad40a225173f139ea6,"The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm combines the interconnection of massive amounts of battery-constrained and low-computational-power devices with low-latency and high-reliability network requirements. Additionally, diverse end-to-end services and applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are expected to coexist in the same network infrastructure. Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a paradigm designed to solve these problems, but its implementation in wireless networks and especially in the resource-constrained IoT systems is extremely challenging and has seen very limited adoption, since it requires isolation of data and control plane information flows and a reliable and scalable control plane. In this work, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh is introduced as an adequate technology for an all-wireless SDN-BLE implementation, which is a technology that has become the de-facto standard for IoT. The proposed SDN-BLE framework uses a routing network slice for the data plane information flow and a flooding network slice for the control plane information flow, ensuring their isolation while still being transmitted over the wireless medium. The design and implementation of all the classical SDN layers on a hybrid BLE mesh testbed is given, where the data plane is formed by the BLE nodes and the control plane can be centralized on a server or distributed over several WiFi gateways. Several controllers are described and implemented, allowing the framework to obtain end-to-end network knowledge to manage individual nodes over the air and configure their behavior to meet application requirements. An experimental characterization of the SDN-BLE framework is given, where the impact of the different parameters of the system on the network reliability, overhead, and energy consumption is studied. Additionally, the distributed versus centralized control plane operation modes are experimentally characterized, and it is shown that the distributed approach can provide the same performance as the centralized one when careful system design is performed. Finally, a proof of concept for the SDN-BLE framework is presented, where a network congestion is automatically detected and the nodes responsible of such congestion are identified and reconfigured over the air, bypassing the congested links, to resume regular network performance. © 2020 ACM.",BLE; BLE mesh; FruityMesh; IoT; SDN; testbed design; trickle; WSN,Energy utilization; Mesh generation; Quality of service; Testbeds; Bluetooth low energy; Bluetooth low energy mesh; Control planes; Fruitymesh; Lower energies; Software-defined networkings; Testbed design; Trickle; WSN; Internet of things

In this domain, energy harvesting and infrastructure-less communication enable truly autonomous and maintenance-free operation of sensor nodes gathering long-term environmental data. Due to the infrastructure-less nature of the communication, receivers are not always available. The variable energy provided by the environment and the receiver's mobility lead to non-deterministic node availability. In this work, we study infrastructure-less data transmission schemes to optimize communication when both senders and receivers exhibit intermittent behavior. We rely on the notion of data utility, describing the importance of sensed data to the receiver, to determine an optimal communication scheme. Deriving the communication policy that maximizes the utility of the received data is shown to be a convex optimization problem. The resulting scheme is implemented and validated on a batteryless Bluetooth Low Energy sensor node that communicates to commodity smartphones. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model accurately captures the application scenario with a maximum root-mean-square error of less than 0.016 in data reception probability. The communication scheme's adaptiveness to variable harvesting conditions is experimentally demonstrated under varying harvesting conditions and is shown to significantly increase the data utility. © 2020 ACM.",batteryless; energy harvesting; infrastructure-less; Internet of Things; optimization; Wireless sensing,Convex optimization; Internet of things; Mean square error; Sensor nodes; Battery-less; Communication schemes; Condition; Data utilities; Infrastructure-less; Long term monitoring; Optimal communication; Optimisations; Sensing systems; Wireless sensing; Energy harvesting

Existing methods using encryption keys may be inapplicable on these resource-constrained devices that cannot afford the computationally expensive encryption operations. Thus, in this article, we design a key-free communication method for such devices in a smart home. In particular, we introduce the Home-limited Channel (HLC) that can be accessed only within a house yet inaccessible for outside-house attackers. Utilizing HLCs, we propose HlcAuth, a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate the communications between smart devices without keys. The advantages of HlcAuth are low cost, lightweight as well as key-free, and requiring no human intervention. According to the security analysis, HlcAuth can defeat replay attacks, message-forgery attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, among others. We further evaluate HlcAuth in four different physical scenarios, and results show that HlcAuth achieves 100% true positive rate (TPR) within 4.2m for in-house devices while 0% false positive rate (FPR) for outside attackers, i.e., guaranteeing a high-level usability and security for in-house communications. Finally, we implement HlcAuth in both single-room and multi-room scenarios. © 2020 ACM.",challenge-response; home-limited channel; key-free; Smart home,Automation; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Challenge response; Exposed to; Home devices; Home-limited channel; Key-free; Limited channels; Radio frequency channels; Smart homes; Spoofing attacks; Various attacks; Cryptography

The remarkable expansion of the embedded ICT market, together with the rise and breakthroughs of Artificial Intelligence (AI), have put the focus on the Edge as it stands as one of the keys for the next technological revolution: the seamless integration of AI in our daily life. However, training and deployment of custom AI solutions on embedded devices require a fine-grained integration of data, algorithms, and tools to achieve high accuracy and overcome functional and non-functional requirements. Such integration requires a high level of expertise that becomes a real bottleneck for small and medium enterprises wanting to deploy AI solutions on the Edge, which, ultimately, slows down the adoption of AI on applications in our daily life. In this work, we present a modular AI pipeline as an integrating framework to bring data, algorithms, and deployment tools together. By removing the integration barriers and lowering the required expertise, we can interconnect the different stages of particular tools and provide a modular end-to-end development of AI products for embedded devices. Our AI pipeline consists of four modular main steps: (i) data ingestion, (ii) model training, (iii) deployment optimization, and (iv) the IoT hub integration. To show the effectiveness of our pipeline, we provide examples of different AI applications during each of the steps. Besides, we integrate our deployment framework, Low-Power Deep Neural Network (LPDNN), into the AI pipeline and present its lightweight architecture and deployment capabilities for embedded devices.

Particularly, monitoring and tracking the observed signals in continuous form are common tasks for a variety of near real-time processing IoT devices, such as in smart homes, body-area, and environmental sensing applications. However, these systems are likely low-cost resource-constrained embedded systems, equipped with compact memory space, whereby the ability to store the full information state of continuous signals is limited. Hence, in this article,∗we develop solutions of efficient timely processing embedded systems for online classification and tracking of continuous signals with compact memory space. Particularly, we focus on the application of smart plugs that are capable of timely classification of appliance types and tracking of appliance behavior in a standalone manner. We implemented a smart plug prototype using low-cost Arduino platform with small amount of memory space to demonstrate the following timely processing operations: (1) learning and classifying the patterns associated with the continuous power consumption signals and (2) tracking the occurrences of signal patterns using small local memory space.

TargetFinder: A Privacy Preserving System for Locating Targets through IoT Cameras,2020,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099584771&doi=10.1145%2f3375878&partnerID=40&md5=35d4a8a314cbe8103545995c193ad903,"With the proliferation of IoT cameras, it is possible to use crowdsourced videos to help find interested targets (e.g., crime suspect, lost child, lost vehicle) on demand. Due to the ubiquity of IoT cameras such as dash mounted and phone cameras, the crowdsourced videos have much better spatial coverage compared to only using surveillance cameras, and, thus, can significantly improve the effectiveness of target search. However, this may raise privacy concerns when workers (owners of IoT cameras) are provided with photos of the target. Also, the videos captured by the workers may be misused to track bystanders. To address this problem, we design and implement TargetFinder, a privacy preserving system for target search through IoT cameras. By exploiting homomorphic encryption techniques, the server can search for the target on encrypted information. We also propose techniques to allow the requester (e.g., the police) to receive images that include the target, while all other captured images of the bystanders are not revealed. Moreover, the target's face image is not revealed to the server and the participating workers. Due to the high computation overhead of the cryptographic primitives, we develop optimization techniques in order to run our privacy preserving protocol on mobile devices. We also formulate and solve a worker selection problem to maximize the probability of finding the target under some budget constraint. A real-world demo and extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of TargetFinder. © 2020 ACM.",crowdsourcing; IoT cameras; on-demand; Privacy preserving; target search; worker selection,Budget control; Crowdsourcing; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Security systems; Design and implements; IoT camera; On demands; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Spatial coverage; Surveillance cameras; Target search; Worker selection; Workers'; Cameras

Such devices offer limited or no security features, creating a large new attack surface. One key component in securing these devices is software integrity checking, which is typically attained with Remote Attestation (RA). RA is a security service that helps in detecting malware-infected IoT devices through remotely verifying their internal state by a trusted party. In the vast majority of IoT application domains, IoT devices operate in swarms or groups to achieve common tasks. Existing swarm attestation techniques are still rigid and not smart enough to address heterogeneity and adapt the different requirements of various IoT devices connected to a swarm, thus triggering the need for more efficient swarm attestation schemes. In this article, we present WISE, the first intelligent swarm attestation scheme that takes into account the various characteristics, differences, and requirements of connected devices in a swarm, aiming at minimizing the communication overhead while preserving an adequate level of security. WISE depends on a resource-efficient smart broadcast authentication scheme where devices are organized in fine-grained multi-clusters, and whenever needed, the most likely compromised devices are attested. The candidate devices are selected intelligently taking into account the attestation history and diverse characteristics and constraints of each device in the swarm. We show that WISE is suitable for resource-constrained embedded devices, highly efficient and scalable in static and dynamic heterogeneous IoT networks, and offers an adjustable level of security. © 2020 ACM.",Hidden Markov Model; Internet of Things (IoT); malware detection; online learning; remote attestation; scalability; security; swarm attestation,E-learning; Internet of things; Malware; Network security; Swarm intelligence; Embedded device; Hidden-Markov models; Intelligent swarm; Internet of thing; Low-costs; Malware detection; Online learning; Remote attestation; Security; Swarm attestation; Hidden Markov models

Our work successfully addresses the problem of onboard and autonomous path planning - which conventional UAV-based systems are not capable of - during stand-alone operations and without preloaded Global Positioning SYstem (GPS) markers for flight path waypoints. Our aerial system visually identifies non-electronically and singularly tagged agricultural plots and assesses the enclosing boundaries of the identified plot. Subsequently, an onboard path planning module autonomously generates GPS waypoints for traversing the identified plot with minimal overlaps and maximal coverage. Our proposed system exhibits an area coverage efficiency of 95.39%, performs pixel-to-GPS coordinate conversion with an accuracy of 90.35%, and has high agricultural potential in applications such as surveying crop health conditions and spraying pesticide/herbicides.

Reactive programming is well suited for the development of event-driven applications, yet current reactive programming frameworks require developers to predict event arrival time-boundaries at compile time, which is impractical, if not impossible, for CPS. Thus, there is a tradeoff between timeliness and completeness of complex event computations, e.g., operational efficiency in a manufacturing plant: Waiting too long until all individual events arrive can fail to produce a useful result, while not waiting long enough may lead to faults due to incomplete status information. In this article, we propose (a) a set of extensions to state-of-the-art reactive programming frameworks, which remove the burden of specifying timeouts at compile time by utilizing (b) Khronos, a middleware that automatically determines timeouts by taking into account variations in event arrival times due to the underlying infrastructure. Evaluation on a physical testbed shows that the extensions significantly decrease developer effort and that Khronos considerably improves timeliness under varying network configurations and conditions, while still satisfying the application's tolerance to missed events. © 2020 ACM.",Cyber-physical systems; event-driven programming; late arrivals; middleware; reactive programming; time management,Embedded systems; Middleware; Application development; Arrival time; Compile time; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Event-driven programming; Late arrival; Programming framework; Reactive programming; Time management; Cyber Physical System

The emerging class of smart musical instruments (SMIs) can address this challenge. Thanks to direct internet connectivity and embedded processing, SMIs can send requests to repositories and reproduce the response for improvisation, composition, or learning purposes. We present a smart guitar prototype that allows retrieving songs from large online music databases using criteria different from conventional music search, which were derived from interviewing 30 guitar players. We investigate three interaction methods coupled with four search criteria (tempo, chords, key and tuning) exploiting intelligent capabilities in the instrument: (i) keywords-based retrieval using an embedded touchscreen; (ii) cloud-computing where recorded content is transmitted to a server that extracts relevant audio features; (iii) edge-computing where the guitar detects audio features and sends the request directly. Overall, the evaluation of these methods with beginner, intermediate, and expert players showed a strong appreciation for the direct connectivity of the instrument with an online database and the approach to the search based on the actual musical content rather than conventional textual criteria, such as song title or artist name. © 2020 ACM.",Internet of musical things; music information retrieval; smart musical instruments,Database systems; Music; Query processing; Audio features; Creative Commons; Embedded processing; Internet connectivity; Internet of musical thing; Large music collections; Music database; Music information retrieval; Online music; Smart musical instrument; Musical instruments

The latter allows one to collect behavioral data that is not contaminated by the artificiality of a laboratory experiment. Using IoT devices in ordinary environments also brings the benefits of reduced cost, as compared with lab experiments, and less disturbance to the participants' daily routines, which in turn helps with recruiting them into the research. However, in this case, it is essential to have an IoT infrastructure that can be easily and swiftly installed and from which real-time data can be securely and straightforwardly collected. In this article, we present MakeSense, an IoT testbed that enables real-world experimentation for large-scale social research on indoor activities through real-time monitoring and/or situation-aware applications.

However, widespread use of RFIDs as sensors requires significant instrumentation to deploy tethered readers, which limits usability in mobile settings. Our solution is WearID, a low-power wrist-worn backscatter reader that bridges this gap and allows ubiquitous sensing of interaction with tagged objects. Our end-to-end design includes innovations in hardware architecture to reduce power consumption and deal with wrist attenuation and blockage, as well as signal processing architecture to reliably detect grasping, touching, and other hand-based interactions. We show via exhaustive characterization that WearID is roughly 6× more power efficient than state-of-art commercial readers, provides 3D coverage of 30 to 50 cm around the wrist despite body blockage, and can be used to reliably detect hand-based interactions. We also open source the design of WearID with the hope that this can enable a range of new and unexplored applications of wearables. © 2020 ACM.",IoT; Wireless sensor networks,Backscattering; Computer architecture; Internet of things; Network architecture; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Continuous measurements; Health and wellness; Home automation; IoT; Low Power; Measurements of; Mobile settings; Physical world; RFID-tag; Tagged object; Augmented reality

In this work, we experimentally study the latency of BLE communications in the presence of radio interference and show that applications may incur long and unpredictable transmission delays. To mitigate this problem, we devise a model capturing the timeliness of connection-based BLE communications in noisy RF channels by expressing the impact of radio interference in terms of the number of connection events necessary to complete a successful data transmission (nCE). We show that this quantity can be estimated using the timing information of commands sent over the host controller interface of common BLE devices, hence without additional communication overhead or energy expenditure. We further show that a BLE device can make use of our BLE timeliness model and recent nCE measurements to adapt its BLE communication parameters at runtime, thereby improving its performance in the presence of dynamic radio interference. We implement such an adaptive scheme on the popular nRF52840 platform and perform an extensive experimental study in multiple indoor environments using three different BLE platforms. Our results show that a BLE application can, indeed, make use of the proposed model and recent nCE measurements to adapt its connection interval at runtime to increase the timeliness of its communications, reducing the number of delayed packets in noisy RF environments by up to a factor of 40. © 2020 ACM.",BLE; Bluetooth low energy; dependability; interference,Radio interference; Radio transmission; Safety engineering; Bluetooth low energy; Delay bound; Dependability; Energy applications; Energy devices; Interference; Lower energies; Runtimes; Bluetooth

Low-power wireless protocols for residential Health Internet of Things applications are characterized by high reliability requirements, the need for energy-efficient operation, and the need to operate robustly in diverse environments in the presence of external interference. We enhance and experimentally evaluate the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping protocol from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard to address these challenges.

Evaluation in a test house shows that the enhanced system is suitable for our e-Health application and compares favorably with state-of-the-art options. The schedule provides higher reliability compared with the minimal scheduling function from the IETF 6TiSCH Working Group and has a better energy-efficiency/reliability tradeoff than the Orchestra scheduler. Results from 29 long-term residential deployments confirm the suitability for the application and show that the system is able to adapt and avoid channels used by WiFi.

Hence, they could benefit from a virtual coach that provides personalized feedback about the execution of their training exercises. As a first step towards this goal, we developed an algorithm to detect and classify goalkeeper training exercises using a wearable inertial sensor attached to a goalkeeper glove. We collected data from 14 goalkeeper trainees while performing a series of training exercises (e.g., dives, catches, throws). Our approach first detects the exercises using an event detection algorithm based on a high-pass filter, a peak detector, and Dynamic Time Warping to detect and eliminate irrelevant motion instances. Then, it extracts a set of statistical and heuristic features to describe the different exercises and train a machine learning classifier. Our exercise detection approach retrieves 93.8% of the relevant exercises with 90.6% precision and classifies the detected exercises with an accuracy of 96.5%.

A classification approach helps to predict the class label of an incoming MTS. Due to the large dimension and different sampling rate of the sensors in a given MTS, a classifier takes time to predict the class label. Some IoT applications may require early prediction of the class label where the classifier starts the prediction once the minimum number of data points are collected. In this article, we address the problem of early prediction of the class label of an MTS in IoT. This work considers the sensors with different sampling rate to generate the MTS. Each sensor generates a time series (component) of the MTS. We propose a Divide-and-Conquer-based early classification approach for classifying such MTS. The approach constructs an ensemble classifier using a probabilistic classifier and hierarchical clustering. The ensemble classifier employs a Divide-and-Conquer method to handle the different sampling rate components during the prediction of class label. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the existing approaches on real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics. © 2020 ACM.",Classification; earliness; Internet of Things; multivariate time series,Forecasting; Time series; Class labels; Classification approach; Divide-and-conquer; Earliness; Early prediction; Ensemble-classifier; Large dimensions; Multivariate time series; Number of datum; Sampling rates; Internet of things

Several research efforts have been made to reduce residential energy consumption, including demand response and smart residential environments. However, recent research has shown that these approaches may actually cause an increase in the overall consumption, due to the complex psychological processes that occur when human users interact with these energy management systems. In this article, using an interdisciplinary approach, we introduce a perceived-value driven framework for energy management in smart residential environments that considers how users perceive values of different appliances and how the use of some appliances are contingent on the use of others. We define a perceived-value user utility used as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and provide a heuristic method called COndensed DependencY (CODY). We validate our results using synthetic and real datasets, large-scale online experiments, and a real-field experiment at the Missouri University of Science and Technology Solar Village. Simulation results show that our approach achieves near optimal performance and significantly outperforms previously proposed solutions.

Indoor environments differ from outdoor spaces in two aspects: spaces are smaller and there are many structural objects such as walls, doors, and furniture. To model the indoor environments in a proper manner, novel data acquisition concepts and data modeling algorithms have been devised to meet the requirements of indoor spatial applications. In this realm, several research efforts have been exerted. Nevertheless, these efforts mostly suffer either from adopting impractical data acquisition methods or from being limited to 2D modeling. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the MapSense approach, which automatically derives indoor models from 3D point clouds collected by individuals using mobile devices, such as Google Tango, Apple ARKit, and Microsoft HoloLens. To this end, MapSense leverages several computer vision and machine learning algorithms for precisely inferring the structural objects. In MapSense, we mainly focus on improving the modeling accuracy through adopting formal grammars that encode design-time knowledge, i.e., structural information about the building. In addition to modeling accuracy, MapSense considers the energy overhead on the mobile devices via developing a probabilistic quality model through which the mobile devices solely upload high-quality point clouds to the crowd-sensing servers. To demonstrate the performance of MapSense, we implemented a crowd-sensing Android App to collect 3D point clouds from two different buildings by six volunteers. The results showed that MapSense can accurately infer the various structural objects while drastically reducing the energy overhead on the mobile devices. © 2020 ACM.",crowd-sensing; formal grammars; Indoor mapping; machine learning; QoS-aware sensing,Data acquisition; Indoor positioning systems; Learning algorithms; Location based services; Quality of service; Telecommunication services; 3D point cloud; Crowd-sensing; Formal grammars; Indoor environment; Indoor mapping; Machine-learning; Modeling accuracy; QoS-aware; QoS-aware sensing; Structural objects; Machine learning

Since activities accumulate energy in the capacitor at different rates, the charging rate of the capacitor can be used to detect the activities. The key advantage of the proposed capacitor-based activity sensing mechanism, called CapSense, is that it obviates the need for sampling the motion signal at a high rate, and thus, significantly reduces power consumption of the wearable device. The challenge we face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which leads to significant variations in the charging rates. We solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate in the charging cycles that are approximately linear. We design and implement a kinetic-powered shoe and conduct experiments with 10 subjects. Our results show that CapSense can classify five different daily activities with 95% accuracy while consuming 57% less system power compared to conventional motion-sensor-based approaches. © 2020 ACM.",activity recognition; capacitor; Kinetic energy harvesting; wearable IoTs,Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Wearable sensors; Activity recognition; Activity sensing; Charging rate; Energy; Energy storage components; Human activities; Kinetic energy harvesting; Motion signals; Sensing mechanism; Wearable iots; Energy harvesting

But most existing studies rely on a key requirement: The object of interest needs to carry an optical receiver (camera or photodiode). We remove this requirement and investigate the possibility of achieving accurate positioning in a passive manner - that is, without requiring objects to carry any optical receiver. To achieve this goal, we propose PassiveVLP, in which we exploit the reflective surfaces of objects and the unique propagation properties of LED luminaires. We present geometric models, a testbed implementation, and empirical evaluations to showcase the opportunities and challenges posed by this new type of passive positioning. Overall, we show that our PassiveVLP can track with high accuracy (a few centimeters) a subset of an object's trajectory, and it can also identify passively the object's ID. © 2020 ACM.",evaluation; implementation; passive; reflection of light; system design; visible light communication (VLC); Visible light positioning (VLP),Light; Evaluation; Implementation; Light positioning; Passive; Passive positioning; Reflection of light; Reflective surfaces; Visible light; Visible light communication; Visible light positioning; Visible light communication

However, relatively little has been explored on the problem of ensuring availability even when edge computers that provide key security services (e.g., authentication and authorization) become unavailable themselves. This article proposes a resilient authentication and authorization framework to enhance the availability of IoT services under DoS attacks or failures. The proposed approach leverages a technique called secure migration, which allows an IoT device to migrate to another trusted edge computer when its own local authorization service becomes unavailable. Specifically, we describe the design of a secure migration framework and its supporting mechanisms, including (1) automated migration policy construction and (2) protocols for preparing and executing the secure migration. We formalize secure migration policy construction as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and show its effectiveness using a case study on smart buildings, where the proposed solution achieves significantly higher availability under simulated attacks on authorization services. © 2020 ACM.",edge computing; Internet of things; resiliency; secure migration,Authentication; Authorization; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Integer programming; Network architecture; Network security; Authentication and authorization; Authorization frameworks; Authorization services; Denialof- service attacks; Edge computing; Migration policy; Network failure; Resiliency; Secure migration; Security services; Internet of things

To illustrate the idea, a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based gait recognition service is designed and implemented following the GRaaS concept. Novel tag selection algorithms and attention-based Long Short-term Memory (At-LSTM) models are designed to realize the device layer and edge layer, achieving a robust recognition with 96.3% accuracy.

However, there remains a significant obstacle that hinders its adoption as a truly ubiquitous technology: the ability of constrained devices to unambiguously exchange data with shared meaning.

However, such an architecture does not cover all possible use cases and still has important limitations. This article specifically addresses these issues. In particular, it discusses the design and implementation of a solution that extends the Web of Things architecture to achieve a higher level of semantic interoperability for the Internet of Things. The proposed solution relies on a human-assisted translation process and defines an architecture that enhances the semantic compatibility between components in the World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force.

This creates a fundamental tension: the success of smart environments will become increasingly dependent on equity of access to data-driven insights and consideration of the privacy expectations of sensed individuals. These concerns highlight the need to bring equity to all stakeholders of smart environments, which in turn would preserve public trust in these smart spaces. In this work, we explored several approaches to identity-obscuring visual representations through a progressive series of experiments. We designed and validated a series of visual representations through stakeholder interactions and tested the ability of these visual representations to limit identification via a crowdsourced study. An evaluation across three months of data gathered within our organization also showed that the identity-obscured data could still be leveraged to accurately count group size. Our contributions lay the groundwork for sensing frameworks that bring utility to all stakeholders of shared spaces while being cognizant of their diverse privacy expectations.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

TONARI: Reactive Detection of Close Physical Contact Using Unlicensed LPWAN Signals,2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193726729&doi=10.1145%2f3648572&partnerID=40&md5=2a06a620c4734a150237a7718541a038,"Recognizing if two objects are in close physical contact (CPC) is the basis of various Internet-of-Things services such as vehicle proximity alert and radiation exposure reduction. This is achieved traditionally through tailor-made proximity sensors that proactively transmit wireless signals and analyze the reflection from an object. Despite its feasibility, the past few years have witnessed the prosperity of reactive CPC detection techniques that do not need spontaneous signal transmission and merely exploit received wireless signals from a target. Unlike existing approaches entailing additional effort of multiple antennas, dedicated signal emitters, human intervention, or a back-end server, this article presents TONARI, an effortless CPC detection framework that performs in a reactive manner. TONARI is developed for the first time with LoRa, the representative of unlicensed low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, as the wireless signal for CPC detection. At the heart of TONARI lies a novel feature arbitrator that decides whether two devices are in CPC or not by distinguishing different types of LoRa chirp-based additive sample magnitude sequences. Software-defined radio-based experiments are conducted to show that the achievable CPC detection accuracy via TONARI can reach 100% in most practical cases.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Reinforcement Learning Based Approaches to Adaptive Context Caching in Distributed Context Management Systems,2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193724262&doi=10.1145%2f3648571&partnerID=40&md5=4725ea165ce8a547b9caf69e12d6bc43,"Real-time applications increasingly rely on context information to provide relevant and dependable features. Context queries require large-scale retrieval, inferencing, aggregation, and delivery of context using only limited computing resources, especially in a distributed environment. If this is slow, inconsistent, and too expensive to access context information, the dependability and relevancy of real-time applications may fail to exist. This paper argues, transiency of context (i.e., the limited validity period), variations in the features of context query loads (e.g., the request rate, different Quality of Service (QoS), and Quality of Context (QoC) requirements), and lack of prior knowledge about context to make near real-time adaptations as fundamental challenges that need to be addressed to overcome these shortcomings. Hence, we propose a performance metric driven reinforcement learning based adaptive context caching approach aiming to maximize both cost- and performance-efficiency for middleware-based Context Management Systems (CMSs). Although context-aware caching has been thoroughly investigated in the literature, our approach is novel because existing techniques are not fully applicable to caching context due to (i) the underlying fundamental challenges and (ii) not addressing the limitations hindering dependability and consistency of context. Unlike previously tested modes of CMS operations and traditional data caching techniques, our approach can provide real-time pervasive applications with lower cost, faster, and fresher high quality context information. Compared to existing context-aware data caching algorithms, our technique is bespoken for caching context information, which is different from traditional data. We also show that our full-cycle context lifecycle-based approach can maximize both cost- and performance-efficiency while maintaining adequate QoC solely based on real-time performance metrics and our heuristic techniques without depending on any previous knowledge about the context, variations in query features, or quality demands, unlike any previous work. We demonstrate using a real world inspired scenario and a prototype middleware based CMS integrated with our adaptive context caching approach that we have implemented, how realtime applications that are 85% faster can be more relevant and dependable to users, while costing 60.22% less than using existing techniques to access context information. Our model is also at least twice as fast and more flexible to adapt compared to existing benchmarks even under uncertainty and lack of prior knowledge about context, transiency, and variable context query loads.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Designing Privacy-Aware IoT Applications for Unregulated Domains,2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193716757&doi=10.1145%2f3648480&partnerID=40&md5=101827eceaef0cf0ecc376fec8d49008,"Internet of Things (IoT) applications (apps) are challenging to design because of the heterogeneous systems on which they are deployed. IoT devices and apps may collect and analyse sensitive personal data, which is often protected by data privacy laws, some within highly regulated domains such as healthcare. Privacy-by-design (PbD) schemes can be used by developers to consider data privacy at the design stage. However, software developers are not widely adopting these approaches due to difficulties in understanding and interpreting them. There are currently a limited number of tools available for developers to use in this context. We believe that a successful PbD tool should be able to (i) assist developers in addressing privacy requirements in less regulated domains, as well as (ii) help them learn about privacy as they use the tool. The findings of two controlled lab studies are presented, involving 42 developers. We discuss how such a PbD tool can help novice IoT developers comply with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and follow privacy guidelines (e.g., privacy patterns). Based on our findings, such tools can help raise awareness of data privacy requirements at design. This increases the likelihood that subsequent designs will be more aware of data privacy requirements.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"Authentication, Authorization, Access Control, and Key Exchange in Internet of Things",2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193703455&doi=10.1145%2f3643867&partnerID=40&md5=e029568c730781bec212401562707d15,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic network of devices and infrastructure supporting instances composed to platforms being based on cloud/fog and blockchain technologies. Its intervention in more and more sensitive areas requires IoT entities (devices and platform instances) to communicate with each other via secure channels generally established by using cryptographical methods. This needs an authentic key exchange, which in turn requires an authentication process. Moreover, it has to be ensured that client entities can access only authorized services provided by authorized server entities. Additionally, requirements specifically introduced by IoT complicate realizing these security goals even more. This article introduces a novel approach providing authentication, authorization, access control, and key exchange in instance-to-instance, device-to-instance, and device-to-device communications to handle cloud/fog-based and blockchain-based platforms. In contrast to related work, realizations of these security goals are not disjunct processes and are integrated with each other in our approach combining zero-knowledge and identity-based schemes while meeting the IoT security requirements. Thus, it does not require any public data pre-distribution or secret pre-sharing between communicating entities, and no entity has to hold any device-specific or instance-specific data to be used for authentication or authorization. While supporting the autonomous character of IoT, our approach is independent of application and platform types without requiring additional components or procedures. Moreover, it is resistant to active man-in-the-middle attacks and does not include costly cryptographic operations. This article also demonstrates the high performance of our approach with regard to multiple affecting factors.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

MiSleep: Human Sleep Posture Identification from Deep Learning Augmented Millimeter-wave Wireless Systems,2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193699267&doi=10.1145%2f3643866&partnerID=40&md5=e9821d7c5b0a29d5fbb037a03ef29d74,"In this work, we propose MiSleep, a deep learning augmented millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless system to monitor human sleep posture by predicting the 3D location of the body joints of a person during sleep. Unlike existing vision- or wearable-based sleep monitoring systems, MiSleep is not privacy-invasive and does not require users to wear anything on their body. MiSleep leverages knowledge of human anatomical features and deep learning models to solve challenges in existing mmWave devices with low-resolution and aliased imaging and specularity in signals. MiSleep builds the model by learning the relationship between mmWave reflected signals and body postures from thousands of existing samples. Since a practical sleep also involves sudden toss-turns, which could introduce errors in posture prediction, MiSleep designs a state machine based on the reflected signals to classify the sleeping states into rest or toss-turn and predict the posture only during the rest states. We evaluate MiSleep with real data collected from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf mmWave devices for eight volunteers of diverse ages, genders, and heights performing different sleep postures. We observe that MiSleep identifies the toss-turn events start time and duration within 1.25 s and 1.7 s of the ground truth, respectively, and predicts the 3D location of body joints with a median error of 1.3 cm only and can perform even under the blankets, with accuracy on par with the existing vision-based system, unlocking the potential of mmWave systems for privacy-noninvasive at-home healthcare applications.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"A Two-Mode, Adaptive Security Framework for Smart Home Security Applications",2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193692030&doi=10.1145%2f3617504&partnerID=40&md5=bbfa3c06d91c567302c8a7969ea8f3bb,"With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of cyber attacks on the Internet is on the rise. However, the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and their networks makes many classical security systems ineffective or inapplicable. We introduce TWINKLE, a two-mode, adaptive security framework that allows an IoT network to be in regular mode for most of the time, which incurs a low resource consumption rate, and to switch to vigilant mode only when suspicious behavior is detected, which potentially incurs a higher overhead. Compared to the early version of this work, this article presents a more comprehensive design and architecture of TWINKLE, describes challenges and details in implementing TWINKLE, and reports evaluations of TWINKLE based on real-world IoT testbeds with more metrics. We show the efficacy of TWINKLE in two case studies where we examine two existing intrusion detection and prevention systems and transform both into new, improved systems using TWINKLE. Our evaluations show that TWINKLE is not only effective at securing resource-constrained IoT networks, but can also successfully detect and prevent attacks with a significantly lower overhead and detection latency than existing solutions.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Crowd-sourcing has emerged as a low-cost and scalable approach for collecting mapping data utilizing widely available dashcams and other sensing devices. However, it is still a non-trivial task to utilize crowdsourced data, such as dashcam images and video, to efficiently create or update high-quality point clouds using technologies like Structure from Motion (SfM). This study assesses and compares different image matching options available in open-source SfM software, analyzing their applicability and limitations for mapping urban scenes in different practical scenarios. Furthermore, the study analyzes the impact of various camera setups (i.e., the number of cameras and their placement) and weather conditions on the quality of the generated 3D point clouds in terms of completeness and accuracy. Based on these analyses, our study provides guidelines for creating more accurate point clouds.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Resilient Intermediary-Based Key Exchange Protocol for IoT,2024,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183332396&doi=10.1145%2f3632408&partnerID=40&md5=92670cdd88082393d567a538dff0762c,"Due to the limited resources of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Symmetric Key Cryptography (SKC) is typically favored over resource-intensive Public Key Cryptography (PKC) to secure communication between IoT devices. To utilize SKC, devices need to execute a key exchange protocol to establish a session key before initiating communication. However, existing SKC-based key exchange protocols assume that communication devices have a pre-shared secret or there are trusted intermediaries between them; neither is always realistic in IoT. We introduce a new SKC-based key exchange protocol for IoT devices. While also intermediary based, our protocol fundamentally departs from existing intermediary-based solutions in that intermediaries between two key exchange devices may be malicious, and moreover, our protocol can detect cheating behaviors and identify malicious intermediaries. We prove our protocol is secure under the universally composable model, and show that it can detect malicious intermediaries with probability 1.0.We implemented and evaluated our protocol on different IoT devices. We show that our protocol has significant improvements in computation time and energy cost. Compared to the PKC-based protocols ECDH, DH, and RSA, our protocol is 2.3 to 1,591 times faster on one of the two key exchange devices and 0.7 to 4.67 times faster on the other. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AudioGuard: Omnidirectional Indoor Intrusion Detection Using Audio Device,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183326601&doi=10.1145%2f3625305&partnerID=40&md5=b99314c80e51bdb26eb69838d62f4ed3,"Indoor intrusion detection is a critical task for home security. Previous works in intrusion detection suffer from the problems such as blind spots in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas, restricted device locations, massive offline training required, and privacy concern. In this article, we design and implement an omnidirectional indoor intrusion detection system, named AudioGuard, using only a pair of speaker and microphone. Au- dioGuard is able to detect both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS intrusions. Our observation of acoustic signal propagation in an indoor environment shows that there exist abundant multipath reflections and human movement introduces Doppler shift in echo signals. We hence capture periodical Doppler shift caused by intruder's walking motion to detect intrusion. Specifically, we first extract the Doppler shift embedded in echo signals, and we then propose a periodicity polarization method to cancel out the impact of the change of radial angle and the distance on periodicity of Doppler shift. Finally, we detect intrusion by measuring periodicity of Doppler shift over time. Extensive experiments show that AudioGuard achieves a miss report rate of 0% and 1.75% for LOS and NLOS intrusion, respectively, and a false alarm rate of 4.17%.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Non-contact Monitoring of Fatigue Driving Using FMCW Millimeter Wave Radar,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183317909&doi=10.1145%2f3614442&partnerID=40&md5=9440422654ef66e030c41db9057f30d5,"Fatigue driving is the leading cause of severe traffic accidents, which is considered as an important point of the research. Although a precise definition of fatigue is lacking, it is possible to detect the physiological characteristics of the human body to determine whether a person is fatigued, such as head shaking, yawning, and a significant drop in breathing. In our study, fatigue actions were collected first, and then the different micro-Doppler characteristics produced by human activity were used to classify and recognize the fatigue action using the fine-tuning convolution neural network (FT-CNN) model. The collected signals in the breathing mode were preprocessed to judge whether the person was fatigued according to the estimated value of the respiratory rate. Data in different environments were collected to verify the proposed method. Our results showed that the accuracy of fatigue detection can reach 91.8% in the laboratory environment and 87.3% in realistic scenarios.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

I Am an Earphone and I Can Hear My User's Face: Facial Landmark Tracking Using Smart Earphones,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183324188&doi=10.1145%2f3614438&partnerID=40&md5=2837a4fcb862e58f13c1ce9d8e944231,"This article presents EARFace, a system that shows the feasibility of tracking facial landmarks for 3D facial reconstruction using in-ear acoustic sensors embedded within smart earphones. This enables a number of applications in the areas of facial expression tracking, user interfaces, AR/VR applications, affective computing, and accessibility, among others. Although conventional vision-based solutions break down under poor lighting and occlusions, and also suffer from privacy concerns, earphone platforms are robust to ambient conditions while being privacy-preserving. In contrast to prior work on earable platforms that perform outer-ear sensing for facial motion tracking, EARFace shows the feasibility of completely in-ear sensing with a natural earphone form factor, thus enhancing the comfort levels of wearing. The core intuition exploited by EARFace is that the shape of the ear canal changes due to the movement of facial muscles during facial motion. EARFace tracks the changes in shape of the ear canal by measuring ultrasonic channel frequency response of the inner ear, ultimately resulting in tracking of the facial motion. A transformer-based machine learning model is designed to exploit spectral and temporal relationships in the ultrasonic channel frequency response data to predict the facial landmarks of the user with an accuracy of 1.83 mm. Using these predicted landmarks, a 3D graphical model of the face that replicates the precise facial motion of the user is then reconstructed. Domain adaptation is further performed by adapting the weights of layers using a group-wise and differential learning rate. This decreases the training overhead in EARFace. The transformer-based machine learning model runs on smart phone devices with a processing latency of 13ms and an overall low power consumption profile. Finally, usability studies indicate higher levels of comforts of wearing EARFace's earphone platform in comparison with alternative form factors.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Online Learning for Dynamic Impending Collision Prediction using FMCW Radar,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183321129&doi=10.1145%2f3616018&partnerID=40&md5=ee195ea34515ae212642da7ff5dd6a09,"Radar collision prediction systems can play a crucial role in safety critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart helmets for contact sports, by predicting an impending collision just before it will occur. Collision prediction algorithms use the velocity and range measurements provided by radar to calculate time to collision. However, radar measurements used in such systems contain significant clutter, noise, and inaccuracies which hamper reliability. Existing solutions to reduce clutter are based on static filtering methods. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach using frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar and inertial sensing that learns the environmental and user-specific conditions that lead to future collisions. We present a process of converting raw radar samples to range-Doppler matrices (RDMs) and then training a deep convolutional neural network that outputs predictions (impending collision vs. none) for any measured RDM. The system is retrained to work in dynamically changing environments and maintain prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach of using the information from radar data to predict impending collisions in real-time via real-world experiments, and show that our method achieves an F1-score of 0.91 and outperforms a traditional approach in accuracy and adaptability.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Efficient IoT Traffic Inference: From Multi-view Classification to Progressive Monitoring,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183321882&doi=10.1145%2f3625306&partnerID=40&md5=aacd3f15f353baca64272607fa3f412a,"Machine learning-based techniques have proven to be effective in Internet-of-Things (IoT) network behavioral inference. Existing works developed data-driven models based on features from network packets and/or flows, but mainly in a static and ad-hoc manner, without adequately quantifying their gains versus costs. In this article, we develop a generic architecture that comprises two distinct inference modules in tandem, which begins with IoT network behavior classification followed by continuous monitoring. In contrast to prior relevant works, our generic architecture flexibly accounts for various traffic features, modeling algorithms, and inference strategies. We argue quantitative metrics are required to systematically compare and efficiently select various traffic features for IoT traffic inference. This article1 makes three contributions: (1) For IoT behavior classification, we identify four metrics, namely, cost, accuracy, availability, and frequency, that allow us to characterize and quantify the efficacy of seven sets of packet-based and flow-based traffic features, each resulting in a specialized model. By experimenting with traffic traces of 25 IoT devices collected from our testbed, we demonstrate that specialized-view models can be superior to a single combined-view model trained on a plurality of features by accuracy and cost. We also develop an optimization problem that selects the best set of specialized models for a multiview classification. (2) For monitoring the expected IoT behaviors, we develop a progressive system consisting of one-class clustering models (per IoT class) at three levels of granularity. We develop an outlier detection technique on top of the convex hull algorithm to form custom-shape boundaries for the one-class models. We show how progression helps with computing costs and the explainability of detecting anomalies. (3) We evaluate the efficacy of our optimally selected classifiers versus the superset of specialized classifiers by applying them to our IoT traffic traces. We demonstrate how the optimal set can reduce the processing cost by a factor of six with insignificant impacts on the classification accuracy. Also, we apply our monitoring models to a public IoT dataset of benign and attack traces and show they yield an average true-positive rate of 94% and a false-positive rate of 5%. Finally, we publicly release our data (training and testing instances of classification and monitoring tasks) and code for convex hull-based one-class models.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ViWise: Fusing Visual and Wireless Sensing Data for Trajectory Relationship Recognition,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181479070&doi=10.1145%2f3614441&partnerID=40&md5=d0ec4b0258180a839d1698734ade7f16,"People usually form a social structure (e.g., a leader-follower, companion, or independent group) for better interactions among them and thus share similar perceptions of visible scenes and invisible wireless signals encountered while moving. Many mobility-driven applications have paid much attention to recognizing trajectory relationships among people. This work models visual and wireless data to quantify the trajectory similarity between a pair of users. We design a visual and wireless sensor fusion system, called ViWise, which incorporates the first-person video frames collected by a wearable visual device and the wireless packets broadcast by a personal mobile device for recognizing finer-grained trajectory relationships within a mobility group. When people take similar trajectories, they usually share similar visual scenes. Their wireless packets observed by ambient wireless base stations (called wireless scanners in this work) usually contain similar patterns. We model the visual characteristics of physical objects seen by a user from two perspectives: micro-scale image structure with pixel-wise features and macro-scale semantic context. However, we model characteristics of wireless packets based on the encountered wireless scanners along the user’s trajectory. Given two users’ trajectories, their trajectory characteristics behind the visible video frames and invisible wireless packets are fused together to compute the visual-wireless data similarity that quantifies the correlation between trajectories taken by them.

CH-MAC: Achieving Low-latency Reliable Communication via Coding and Hopping in LPWAN,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181482476&doi=10.1145%2f3617505&partnerID=40&md5=2cd26a0ec02b5a9735694b785b54f213,"Wireless sensing has emerged as a powerful environmental sensing technology that is vulnerable to the impact of all kinds of ambient noises. LoRa is a novel interference-resilient technology of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), which has attracted wide attention from scientific and industrial communities. However, LoRa transmission suffers from serious latency in those complex wireless sensing environments requiring transmission reliability. In this article, we present CH-MAC, the first MAC-layer protocol based on the local corruption nature of packets and the time-varying nature of channels to reduce end-to-end transmission latency in LPWAN with reliable communication requirements. Specifically, CH-MAC employs Luby Transform code to divide and encode the payload into several blocks such that the receiver can retain part of the coded information in the corrupted packets. In addition, CH-MAC utilizes hopping to transmit different blocks of a packet with various channels to avoid sudden noise collision. Moreover, CH-MAC adopts a dynamic packet length adjustment mechanism to mitigate network congestion. Extensive evaluations on a real-world hardware testbed and a simulation platform show that CH-MAC can reduce end-to-end transmission latency by 2.63× with a communication success rate requirement of >95% compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",coding; LoRa; low-latency; reliable communication; Wireless sensing,Environmental technology; Low power electronics; Simulation platform; Coding; End-to-end transmission latencies; Environmental sensing; Lora; Low latency; Low Power; Reliable communication; Sensing technology; Wide-area networks; Wireless sensing; Wide area networks

Offline electronic signatures are vulnerable to copy or replay attacks. Contact-based online electronic signatures are limited by indirect contact such as handwriting pads and may threaten the health of users. Consider combining hand shape features and writing process features to form electronic signatures, the article proposes an in-air handwritten signature verification system with millimeter-wave(mmWave) radar, namely mmHSV. First, the biometrics of the handwritten signature process are modeled, and phase-dependent biometrics and behavioral features are extracted from the mmWave radar mixture signal. Secondly, a handwritten feature recognition network based on few-sample learning is presented to fuse multi-dimensional features and determine user legitimacy. Finally, mmHSV is implemented and evaluated with commercial mmWave devices in different scenarios and attack mode conditions. Experimental results show that the mmHSV can achieve accurate, efficient, robust and scalable handwritten signature verification. Area Under Curve (AUC) is 98.96%, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is 5.1% at the fixed threshold, AUC is 97.79% for untrained users. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",authentication; Handwritten; millimeter-wave radar; siamese network; signature verification,Biometrics; Character recognition; Millimeter waves; Copy attacks; Electronic signatures; Handwritten; Handwritten signature verification; Identity authentication; Millimeter-wave radar; Millimetre-wave radar; Offline; Siamese network; Signature verification; Authentication
mmDrive: Fine-grained Fatigue Driving Detection Using mmWave Radar,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181481599&doi=10.1145%2f3614437&partnerID=40&md5=d23c16333d5b73c841fd7ed51b6c78e0,"Early detection of fatigue driving is pivotal for the safety of drivers and pedestrians. Traditional approaches mainly employ cameras and wearable sensors to detect fatigue features, which are intrusive to drivers. Recent advances in radio frequency (RF) sensing enable non-intrusive fatigue feature detection from the signal reflected by driver’s body. However, existing RF-based solutions only detect partial or coarse-grained fatigue features, which reduces the detection accuracy. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a mmWave-based fatigue driving detection system, called mmDrive, which can detect multiple fine-grained fatigue features from different body parts. However, achieving accurate detection of various fatigue features during driving encounters practical challenges. Specifically, normal driving activities and driver’s involuntary facial movements inevitably cause interference to fatigue features. Thus, we exploit unique geometric and behavioral characteristics of fatigue features and design effective signal processing methods to remove noises from fatigue-irrelevant activities. Based on the detected fatigue features, we further develop a fatigue determination algorithm to decide the driver’s fatigue state. Extensive experiment results from both simulated and real driving environments show that the average accuracy for detecting nodding and yawning features is about 96%, and the average errors for estimating eye blink, respiration, and heartbeat rates are around 2.21bpm, 0.54bpm, and 2.52bpm, respectively.

Recent research on acoustic emanation-based techniques has greatly improved the accessibility by non-professional adversaries. However, these approaches either require multiple smartphones or require specific placement of the smartphone relative to the keyboards, which tremendously restricts the application scenarios. In this article, we propose UltraSnoop, a training-free, transferable, and placement-agnostic scheme that manages to infer user’s input using a single smartphone placed within the range covered by a microphone and speaker. The innovation of Ultrasnoop is that we propose an ultrasonic anchor-keystroke positioning method and a Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients clustering algorithm, synthesis of which could infer the relative position between the smartphone and the keyboard. Along with the keystroke time difference of arrival, our method could infer the keystrokes and even gradually improve the accuracy as the snooping proceeds. Our real-world experiments show that UltraSnoop could achieve more than 85% top-3 snooping accuracy when the smartphone is placed within the range of 30–60 cm from the keyboard. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Keystroke snooping; smartphone; system implementation; ultrasonic tracking and localization,Clustering algorithms; Application scenario; Keystroke snooping; Localisation; Positioning methods; Recent researches; Sensitive informations; Smart phones; Systems implementation; Ultrasonic sonar; Ultrasonic tracking and localization; Smartphones

How to turn fine-grained vibration perception into visualization, and further predict mechanical failures and reduce property losses based on visual vibration information, which has aroused our thinking. In this article, the phase information generated by the tag is processed and analyzed, and MFD is proposed, a real-time vibration monitoring and fault-sensing discrimination system. MFD extracts phase information from the original RF signal and converts it into a Markov transition map by introducing White Gaussian Noise and a low-pass filter for denoising. To accurately predict the failure of machinery, a deep and machine learning model is introduced to calculate the accuracy of failure analysis, realizing real-time monitoring and fault judgment. The test results show that the average recognition accuracy of vibration can reach 96.07%, and the average recognition accuracy of forward rotation, reverse rotation, oil spill, and screw loosening of motor equipment during long-term operation can reach 98.53%, 99.44%, 97.87%, and 99.91%, respectively, with high robustness. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",contactless state detection; IoT; passive sensing; RFID,Deep learning; Gaussian noise (electronic); Internet of things; Low pass filters; Object detection; Oil spills; Contact less; Contactless state detection; Features recognition; Frequency features; IoT; Multiobject; Passive sensing; Phase information; Recognition accuracy; State Detection; Vibration analysis
airBP: Monitor Your Blood Pressure with Millimeter-Wave in the Air,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181516538&doi=10.1145%2f3614439&partnerID=40&md5=72922b1af7b0e3d45901b16f440404f8,"Blood pressure (BP), an important vital sign to assess human health, is expected to be monitored conveniently. The existing BP monitoring methods, either traditional cuff based or newly emerging wearable based, all require skin contact, which may cause unpleasant user experience and is even injurious to certain users. In this article, we explore contactless BP monitoring and propose airBP, which emits millimeter-wave signals toward a user’s wrist, and captures the reflected signal bounded off from the pulsating artery underlying the wrist. By analyzing the reflected signal strength of the signal, airBP generates the arterial pulse and further estimates BP by exploiting the relationship between the arterial pulse and BP. To realize airBP, we design a new beam-forming method to keep focusing on the tiny and hidden wrist artery, by leveraging the inherent periodicity of the arterial pulse. Moreover, we custom design a pre-training and neural network architecture, to combat the challenges from the arterial pulse sparsity and ambiguity, so as to estimate BP accurately. We prototype airBP using a coin-size commercial off-the-shelf millimeter-wave radar and perform extensive experiments on 41 subjects. The results demonstrate that airBP accurately estimates systolic and diastolic BP, with a mean error of –0.30 mmHg and –0.23 mmHg, as well as a standard deviation error of 4.80 mmHg and 3.79 mmHg (within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA’s AAMI protocol), respectively, at a distance up to 26 cm. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Blood pressure; contactless sensing; millimeter-wave sensing,Blood; Mercury compounds; Millimeter waves; Network architecture; Arterial pulse; Blood-pressure monitoring; Contact less; Contactless sensing; Human health; Millimeter wave sensing; Monitoring methods; Reflected signal; Skin contact; Vital sign; Blood pressure
Query Interface for Smart City Internet of Things Data Marketplaces: A Case Study,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173226162&doi=10.1145%2f3609336&partnerID=40&md5=c4a269450782d9a90bd4feb9620e1b16,"Cities are increasingly becoming augmented with sensors through public, private, and academic sector initiatives. Most of the time, these sensors are deployed with a primary purpose (objective) in mind (e.g., deploy sensors to understand noise pollution) by a sensor owner (i.e., the organization that invests in sensing hardware, e.g., a city council). Over the past few years, communities undertaking smart city development projects have understood the importance of making the sensor data available to a wider community - beyond their primary usage. Different business models have been proposed to achieve this, including creating data marketplaces. The vision is to encourage new startups and small and medium-scale businesses to create novel products and services using sensor data to generate additional economic value. Currently, data are sold as pre-defined independent datasets (e.g., noise level and parking status data may be sold separately). This approach creates several challenges, such as (i) difficulties in pricing, which leads to higher prices (per dataset); (ii) higher network communication and bandwidth requirements; and (iii) information overload for data consumers (i.e., those who purchase data). We investigate the benefit of semantic representation and its reasoning capabilities toward creating a business model that offers data on demand within smart city Internet of Things data marketplaces. The objective is to help data consumers (i.e., small and medium enterprises) acquire the most relevant data they need. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by integrating it into a real-world IoT data marketplace (developed by the synchronicity-iot.eu project). We discuss design decisions and their consequences (i.e., tradeoffs) on the choice and selection of datasets. Subsequently, we present a series of data modeling principles and recommendations for implementing IoT data marketplaces.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In traditional desktop and mobile contexts, the primary user interface is a screen; however, in IoT devices, screens are rare or very small, invalidating many existing approaches to protecting user privacy. Privacy visualizations are a common approach for assisting users in understanding the privacy implications of web and mobile services. To gain a thorough understanding of IoT privacy, we examine existing web, mobile, and IoT visualization approaches. Following that, we define five major privacy factors in the IoT context: type, usage, storage, retention period, and access. We then describe notification methods used in various contexts as reported in the literature. We aim to highlight key approaches that developers and researchers can use for creating effective IoT privacy notices that improve user privacy management (awareness and control). Using a toolkit, a use case scenario, and two examples from the literature, we demonstrate how privacy visualization approaches can be supported in practice.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

It is, therefore, necessary to fingerprint and identify IoT devices connected to private or critical networks. With the proliferation of massive but heterogeneous IoT devices, it is getting challenging to detect vulnerable devices connected to networks. Current machine learning-based techniques for fingerprinting and identifying devices necessitate a significant amount of data gathered from IoT networks that must be transmitted to a central cloud. Nevertheless, private IoT data cannot be shared with the central cloud in numerous sensitive scenarios. Federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising paradigm for decentralized learning and has been applied in many different use cases. It enables machine learning models to be trained in a privacy-preserving way. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserved IoT device fingerprinting and identification mechanisms using FL; we call it FL4IoT. FL4IoT is a two-phased system combining unsupervised-learning-based device fingerprinting and supervised-learning-based device identification. FL4IoT shows its practicality in different performance metrics in a federated and centralized setup. For instance, in the best cases, empirical results show that FL4IoT achieves ĝ1/499% accuracy and F1-Score in identifying IoT devices using a federated setup without exposing any private data to a centralized cloud entity. In addition, FL4IoT can detect spoofed devices with over 99% accuracy. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",federated learning; fingerprinting; identification; Internet of things; machine learning,Machine learning; Palmprint recognition; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Centralised; Critical networks; Decentralized learning; Device fingerprinting; Federated learning; Fingerprinting; Identification; Machine-learning; Private networks; Internet of things

However, performance comparison between these MAC protocols rarely has gone beyond a simulation phase. This work presents the results of such a comparison on physically deployed networks using the facilities of the FIT-IoTLab. The evaluation includes fully implementing an IIoT protocol stack based on MQTT in Contiki-NG. It comprises the integration of DSME as part of Contiki-NG's software stack through OpenDSME, the only publicly available implementation of DSME. Results show that both protocols suit IIoT applications, particularly for data collection.

It is challenging to run any high-end security protocol(s) on Edge devices. These devices are highly vulnerable toward numerous cyber-attacks. IoT network nodes need peer-to-peer security, which is possible if there exists proper mutual authentication among network devices. A secure session key needs to be established among source and destination nodes before sending the sensitive data. To generate these session keys, a strong cryptosystem is required to share parameters securely over a wireless network. In this article, we utilize a Rubik's cube puzzle-based cryptosystem to exchange parameters among peers and generate session key(s). Blockchain technology is incorporated in the proposed model to provide anonymity of token transactions, on the basis of which the network devices exchange services. A session key pool randomizer is used to avoid network probabilistic attacks. Our hybrid model is capable of generating secure session keys that can be used for mutual authentication and reliable data transferring tasks.

Unfortunately, most prior research requires subjects to stay at a fixed distance from radar sensors and to remain still during monitoring. These restrictions limit the applications of radar vital sign monitoring in real life scenarios. In this article, we address these limitations and present Pi-ViMo, a non-contact Physiology-inspired Robust Vital Sign Monitoring system, using mmWave radars. We first derive a multi-scattering point model for the human body, and introduce a coherent combining of multiple scatterings to enhance the quality of estimated chest-wall movements. It enables vital sign estimations of subjects at any location in a radar's field of view (FoV). We then propose a template matching method to extract human vital signs by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities. The proposed method is capable to separate respiration and heartbeat in the presence of micro-level random body movements (RBM) when a subject is at any location within the field of view of a radar. Experiments in a radar testbed show average respiration rate errors of 6% and heart rate errors of 11.9% for the stationary subjects, and average errors of 13.5% for respiration rate and 13.6% for heart rate for subjects under different RBMs.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Many efforts have been paid to provision some merging public network services at the network edge. We reveal that it is very common that specific users call for private and isolated edge services to preserve data privacy and enable other security intentions. However, it still remains open to fulfill such kind of mixed requests in edge computing. In this article, we propose a cooperative edge computing framework, i.e., HyEdge, to offer both public and private edge services systematically. To fully exploit the benefits of this novel framework, we define the problem of optimal request scheduling over a given placement solution of hybrid edge servers to minimize the response delay. This problem is further modeled as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP), which is typically NP-hard. Accordingly, we propose the partition-based optimization method, which can efficiently solve this NP-hard problem via the problem decomposition and the branch and bound strategies. We finally conduct extensive evaluations with a real-world dataset to measure the performance of our method. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves elegant performance with low computation complexity.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Furthermore, nodes may in many scenarios only communicate with the Internet-attached gateway via multiple hops. If an energy-efficient short-range modulation scheme is used, nodes that are reachable only via high-path-loss links cannot communicate. Using a more energy-demanding long-range modulation allows connecting more nodes but would be inefficient for nodes that are easily reachable via low-path-loss links. Combining multiple modulations is challenging, as low-power radios usually only support the use of a single modulation at a time. In this article, we present the Long-Short-Range (LSR) protocol which supports low-power multi-hop communication using multiple modulations and is suited for networks with inhomogeneous link characteristics. To reduce the inherent redundancy of long-range modulations, we present a method to determine the connectivity graph of the network during regular data communication without adding significant overhead. In simulations, we show that LSR allows for reducing power consumption significantly for many scenarios when compared to a state-of-the-art multi-hop communication protocol using a single long-range modulation. We demonstrate the applicability of LSR with an implementation on real hardware and a testbed with long-range links.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesLow-power; FlockLab; IoT; LoRa; LSR; multi-hop; multi-modulations; wireless sensor network,Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Low power electronics; Sensor nodes; Additional key word and phraseslow-power; Flocklab; IoT; Key words; Long-short-range; Lora; Multi-hops; Multi-modulation; Power; Range modulation; Energy efficiency

For this aggregated data to be useful to each person, we need a multi-modality association of the devices' physical ID (i.e., location, the user holding it, visual appearance) with a virtual ID (e.g., IP address/available services). Existing approaches for multi-modality association often require intentional interaction or direct line-of-sight to the device, which is infeasible for a large number of users or when the device is obscured by clothing.We present IDIoT, a calibration-free passive sensing approach that fuses motion sensor information with camera footage of an area to estimate the body location of motion sensors carried by a user. We characterize results across three baselines to highlight how different fusing methodology results better than earlier IMU-vision fusion algorithms. From this characterization, we determine IDIoT is more robust to errors such as missing frames or miscalibration that frequently occur in IMU-vision matching systems.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesDatasets; gaze detection; neural networks; text tagging,Internet of things; Virtual addresses; Wearable technology; Additional key word and phrasesdataset; Daily lives; Gaze detection; Key words; Motion sensors; Multi-modality; Multimodal frameworks; Neural-networks; Text tagging; Wearable devices; Association reactions
Upscaling Fog Computing in Oceans for Underwater Pervasive Data Science Using Low-Cost Micro-Clouds,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164241978&doi=10.1145%2f3575801&partnerID=40&md5=0525deea8ea944fc28180cd68f46987f,"Underwater environments are emerging as a new frontier for data science thanks to an increase in deployments of underwater sensor technology. Challenges in operating computing underwater combined with a lack of high-speed communication technology covering most aquatic areas means that there is a significant delay between the collection and analysis of data. This in turn limits the scale and complexity of the applications that can operate based on these data. In this article, we develop underwater fog computing support using low-cost micro-clouds and demonstrate how they can be used to deliver cost-effective support for data-heavy underwater applications. We develop a proof-of-concept micro-cloud prototype and use it to perform extensive benchmarks that evaluate the suitability of underwater micro-clouds for diverse underwater data science scenarios. We conduct rigorous tests in both controlled and field deployments, using river and sea waters. We also address technical challenges in enabling underwater fogs, evaluating the performance of different communication interfaces and demonstrating how accelerometers can be used to detect the likelihood of communication failures and determine which communication interface to use. Our work offers a cost-effective way to increase the scale and complexity of underwater data science applications, and demonstrates how off-the-shelf devices can be adopted for this purpose.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesCloudlets; aquatic environments; cloud computing; computation offloading; edge computing,Cost effectiveness; Data Science; Fog; Fog computing; Seawater; Additional key word and phrasescloudlet; Aquatic environments; Cloud-computing; Communication interface; Computation offloading; Cost effective; Edge computing; Key words; Low-costs; Upscaling; Computation offloading
WatchDog: Real-time Vehicle Tracking on Geo-distributed Edge Nodes,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150275298&doi=10.1145%2f3549551&partnerID=40&md5=b801ad71b3a3ac5ed1c32c2cddecf22f,"Vehicle tracking, a core application to smart city video analytics, is becoming more widely deployed than ever before thanks to the increasing number of traffic cameras and recent advances in computer vision and machine-learning. Due to the constraints of bandwidth, latency, and privacy concerns, tracking tasks are more preferable to run on edge devices sitting close to the cameras. However, edge devices are provisioned with a fixed amount of computing budget, making them incompetent to adapt to time-varying and imbalanced tracking workloads caused by traffic dynamics. In coping with this challenge, we propose WatchDog, a real-time vehicle tracking system that fully utilizes edge nodes across the road network. WatchDog leverages computer vision tasks with different resource-accuracy tradeoffs, and decomposes and schedules tracking tasks judiciously across edge devices based on the current workload to maximize the number of tasks while ensuring a provable response time-bound at each edge device. Extensive evaluations have been conducted using real-world city-wide vehicle trajectory datasets, achieving exceptional tracking performance with a real-time guarantee.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesEdge computing; neural networks; real-time system; road network,Budget control; Cameras; Computer vision; Interactive computer systems; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Additional key word and phrasesedge computing; Edge nodes; Key words; Neural-networks; Real - Time system; Real- time; Road network; Traffic camera; Video analytics; Vision learning; Real time systems

Moreover, latency-sensitive services constrain the type and location of edge devices that can provide the needed resources. When available resources are scarce there is a possibility that some resource allocation requests are denied.In this work, we propose the VioLinn system to tackle the joint problems of task placement, service placement, and edge device provisioning. Dealing with latency-sensitive services is achieved through proximity-aware algorithms that ensure the tasks are handled close to the end-user. Moreover, the concept of spare edge device is introduced to handle sudden load variations in time and space without having to continuously overprovision. Several spare device selection algorithms are proposed with different cost/performance tradeoffs.Evaluations are performed both in a Kubernetes-based testbed and using simulations and show the benefit of using spare devices for handling localized load spikes with higher quality of service (QoS) and lower computing resource usage. The study of the different algorithms shows that it is possible to achieve this increase in QoS with different tradeoffs against cost and performance.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesEdge/fog computing; elasticity; Kubernetes; resource management,Commerce; Resource allocation; Additional key word and phrasesedge/fog computing; Computing resource; Computing system; Edge computing; Key words; Kubernetes; Quality-of-service; Resource management; Resources allocation; Service placements; Quality of service

In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation.

Could Tierless Languages Reduce IoT Development Grief?,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150237621&doi=10.1145%2f3572901&partnerID=40&md5=557b5223fad767c5d79a338e27a6ebd5,"Internet of Things (IoT) software is notoriously complex, conventionally comprising multiple tiers. Traditionally an IoT developer must use multiple programming languages and ensure that the components interoperate correctly. A novel alternative is to use a single tierless language with a compiler that generates the code for each component and ensures their correct interoperation.We report a systematic comparative evaluation of two tierless language technologies for IoT stacks: one for resource-rich sensor nodes (Clean with iTask) and one for resource-constrained sensor nodes (Clean with iTask and mTask). The evaluation is based on four implementations of a typical smart campus application: two tierless and two Python-based tiered.(1) We show that tierless languages have the potential to significantly reduce the development effort for IoT systems, requiring 70% less code than the tiered implementations. Careful analysis attributes this code reduction to reduced interoperation (e.g., two embedded domain-specific languages and one paradigm versus seven languages and two paradigms), automatically generated distributed communication, and powerful IoT programming abstractions. (2) We show that tierless languages have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of IoT systems, describing how Clean iTask/mTask maintains type safety, provides higher-order failure management, and simplifies maintainability. (3) We report the first comparison of a tierless IoT codebase for resource-rich sensor nodes with one for resource-constrained sensor nodes. The comparison shows that they have similar code size (within 7%), and functional structure.

Design of a Robust MAC Protocol for LoRa,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150278912&doi=10.1145%2f3557048&partnerID=40&md5=54fb3da2a3d3ba83c78bb109647143ea,"Low-power wide-area networks enable large-scale deployments of low-power wireless devices. LoRaWAN is a long-range wireless technology that has emerged as a low-power and low data rate solution to support Internet of Things applications. Although LoRaWAN provides a low-power and cost-efficient networking solution, recent literature shows that it performs poorly in terms of reliability and security in dense deployments due to the uncoordinated (ALOHA-based) nature of the MAC (medium access control) protocol. Furthermore, LoRaWAN is not robust against selective jamming attacks. This article proposes CRAM: a time-synchronized cryptographic frequency hopping MAC protocol designed for the LoRa physical layer. CRAM reduces the contention by fairly exploiting the available frequency space and maximizes the entropy of the channel hopping algorithm. We develop a large physical testbed and a simulator to thoroughly evaluate the proposed protocol. Our evaluations show that CRAM significantly improves reliability and scalability and increases channel utilization while making selective jamming difficult to perform compared to the standard LoRaWAN protocol.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesLow-power wide-area networks (LPWANs); co-existence; Internet of Things (IoT); LoRa; medium access control (MAC); scalability; selective jamming; time-synchronized channel hopping (TSCH),Computing power; Frequency hopping; Internet protocols; Jamming; Low power electronics; Medium access control; Network layers; Network security; Scalability; Wide area networks; Additional key word and phraseslow-power wide-area network (LPWAN); Channel hopping; Co-existence; Internet of thing; Key words; Lora; Medium access control; Power; Selective jamming; Time-synchronized channel hopping; Wide-area networks; Internet of things
A Closed-loop Hybrid Supervision Framework of Cryptocurrency Transactions for Data Trading in IoT,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150277649&doi=10.1145%2f3568171&partnerID=40&md5=ea7a15d732f3fadead668de44aa1b8bb,"The Device-as-a-service (DaaS) Internet of Things (IoT) business model enables distributed IoT devices to sell collected data to other devices, paving the way for machine-to-machine (M2M) economy applications. Cryptocurrencies are widely used by various IoT devices to undertake the main settlement and payment task in the M2M economy. However, the cryptocurrency market, which lacks effective supervision, has fluctuated wildly in the past few years. These fluctuations are breeding grounds for arbitrage in IoT data trading. Therefore, a practical cryptocurrency market supervision framework is very imperative in the process of IoT data trading to ensure that the trading is completed safely and fairly. The difficulty stems from how to combine these unlabeled daily trading data with supervision strategies to punish abnormal users, who disrupt the data trading market in IoT. In this article, we propose a closed-loop hybrid supervision framework based on the unsupervised anomaly detection to solve this problem. The core is to design the multi-modal unsupervised anomaly detection methods on trading prices to identify malicious users. We then design a dedicated control strategy with three levels to defend against various abnormal behaviors, according to the detection results. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliability of this framework, we evaluate the detection rate, accuracy, precision, and time consumption of single-modal and multi-modal detection methods and the contrast algorithm Adaptive KDE [19]. Finally, an effective prototype framework for supervising is established. The extensive evaluations prove that our supervision framework greatly reduces IoT data trading risks and losses.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",arbitrage-free; cryptocurrency market; hybrid supervision model; IoT data trading; unsupervised anomaly detection,Anomaly detection; Electronic money; Arbitrage-free; Business models; Closed-loop; Cryptocurrency market; Device as a services; Hybrid supervision model; Internet of thing data trading; Multi-modal; Supervision models; Unsupervised anomaly detection; Internet of things

Adopting Agile Software Development practices for IoT projects may provide this competitive advantage, as it enables organizations to respond to change, while being dynamic and innovative. Applying a mixed-methods approach, agile IoT practitioners around the world and from diverse industries were surveyed and interviewed. Our study recommends that Agile Software Development team makeup, practices, and methods should be tailored to the specific industry, culture, people, and IT application of an organization. People play an important role in the success of agile projects; therefore, our research focuses on identifying the critical attributes of agile teams to maximize success.

Exploiting Multi-modal Contextual Sensing for City-bus's Stay Location Characterization: Towards Sub-60 Seconds Accurate Arrival Time Prediction,2023,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150237778&doi=10.1145%2f3549548&partnerID=40&md5=9f6c1ece940afc2a63ab90590bfe2195,"Intelligent city transportation systems are one of the core infrastructures of a smart city. The true ingenuity of such an infrastructure lies in providing the commuters with real-time information about citywide transport like public buses, allowing them to pre-plan their travel. However, providing prior information for transportation systems like public buses in real-time is inherently challenging because of the diverse nature of different stay-locations where a public bus stops. Although straightforward factors like stay duration extracted from unimodal sources like GPS at these locations look erratic, a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 1,335.365 km at the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban city in India, reveals that several other fine-grained contextual features can characterize these locations accurately. Accordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing the stay-locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using this multi-modal information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual features that allows the system to differentiate among the different stay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected in-house dataset indicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different stay-locations such as regular bus stops, random ad hoc stops, stops due to traffic congestion, stops at traffic signals, and stops at sharp turns. Additionally, we develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop to analyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a critical piece of information required to pre-plan travel at any given bus stop. Subsequent analysis of the PoC framework, through simulation over the test dataset, shows that characterizing the stay-locations indeed helps make more accurate arrival time predictions with deviations less than 60 seconds from the ground-truth arrival time.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesIntelligent transportation; machine learning; multi-modal sensing; smartphone computing; stay-location detection,Bus transportation; Forecasting; Location; Machine learning; Real time systems; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Traffic signals; Additional key word and phrasesintelligent transportation; Bus stop; Key words; Location detection; Machine-learning; Multimodal sensing; Public bus; Smart phones; Smartphone computing; Stay-location detection; Smartphones

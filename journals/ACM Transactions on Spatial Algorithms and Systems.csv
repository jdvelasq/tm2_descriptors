Efficient geo-fencing via hybrid hashing: A combination of bucket selection and in-bucket binary search,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051111494&doi=10.1145%2f2774219&partnerID=40&md5=2fddad08760d8343c6d31926c6df4630,"Geo-fencing, as a spatial join between points (moving objects) and polygons (spatial range), is widely used in emerging location-based services to trigger context-aware events. It faces the challenge of real-time processing a large number of time-variant complex polygons, when points are constantly moving. Following the filter-and-refine policy, in our previous work, we proposed to organize edges per polygon in hash tables to improve the performance of the refining stage. The number of edges, however, is uneven among buckets. As a result, some points that happen to match big buckets with many edges will have much longer responses than usual. In this article, we solve this problem from two aspects: (i) Constructing multiple parallel hash tables and dynamically selecting the bucket with fewest edges and (ii) sorting edges in a bucket so as to realize the crossing number algorithm by binary search. We further combine the two to suggest a hybrid hashing scheme that takes a better tradeoff between real-time pairing points with polygons and system overhead of building hash tables. Extensive analyses and evaluations on two real-world datasets confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the pairing time in terms of both the average and distribution. © 2015 ACM.",Crossing number algorithm; Geo-fencing; Geographic information system; Hashing; Indexing; Selection diversity; Spatial join,Data structures; Geographic information systems; Geometry; Indexing (of information); Telecommunication services; Crossing number; Geo-fencing; Hashing; Selection diversity; Spatial join; Location based services
TRIFL: A generic trajectory index for flash storage,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047147812&doi=10.1145%2f2786758&partnerID=40&md5=41193c81d722cf010140ff037f5ac3e3,"Due to several important features, such as high performance, low power consumption, and shock resistance, NAND flash has become a very popular stable storage medium for embedded mobile devices, personal computers, and even enterprise servers. However, the peculiar characteristics of flash memory require redesigning the existing data storage and indexing techniques that were devised for magnetic hard disks. In this article, we propose TRIFL, an efficient and generic TRajectory Index for FLash. TRIFL is designed around the key requirements of trajectory indexing and flash storage. TRIFL is generic in the sense that it is efficient for both simple flash storage devices such as SD cards and more powerful devices such as solid state drives. In addition, TRIFL is supplied with an online self-tuning algorithm that allows adapting the index structure to the workload and the technical specifications of the flash storage device to maximize the index performance. Moreover, TRIFL achieves good performance with relatively low memory requirements, which makes the index appropriate for many application scenarios. The experimental evaluation shows that TRIFL outperforms the representative indexing methods on magnetic disks and flash disks. © 2015 ACM.",Flash memory; Partitioning; Range queries; Trajectory indexing,Green computing; Indexing (of information); Magnetic storage; Personal computers; Trajectories; Virtual storage; Application scenario; Experimental evaluation; Low-power consumption; On-line self-tuning; Partitioning; Range query; Technical specifications; Trajectory indexing; Flash memory

Several algorithms have been suggested in the past for solving them efficiently or with minimal errors. Meanwhile, a new wave on the technological frontier has brought about general-purpose computing on GPUS. In this article, we describe how accumulated cost surfaces can be solved with CUDA. To verify the performance of our solution, we performed an experimental comparison against implementations run on a CPU.

In many fields, moving regions representing real-world phenomena are collected using sensors that take temporally encoded snapshots of regions. We provide a novel algorithm that creates a moving region between any two complex regions. The proposed algorithm has worst-case time bounds of O(n2), but can use approximation techniques to achieve O(nlg n) in practice, space bounds of O(n), and output size bounded by O(n) (where n is the number of line segments that define the boundaries of the regions). © 2015 ACM.",Moving regions; Polygon morphing; Region interpolation,Approximation algorithms; Image coding; Approximation techniques; Line segment; Morphing; Moving regions; Novel algorithm; Real-world; Space bounds; Spatio-temporal data; Object recognition
A path-based distance for street map comparison,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030863116&doi=10.1145%2f2729977&partnerID=40&md5=009bae7cd895e0d414e1c1da864a41dc,"Comparing two geometric graphs embedded in space is important in the field of transportation network analysis. Given street maps of the same city collected from different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they differ. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based on structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their local connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding. This ignores a key property of road networks since the similarity of travel over two road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding. Likewise, many current algorithms specific to street map comparison either do not provide quality guarantees or focus on spatial embeddings only. Motivated by road network comparison, we propose a new path-based distance measure between two planar geometric graphs that is based on comparing sets of travel paths generated over the graphs. Surprisingly, we are able to show that using paths of bounded link-length, we can capture global structural and spatial differences between the graphs. We show how to utilize our distance measure as a local signature in order to identify and visualize portions of high similarity in the maps. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our distance measure and its local signature on street map data from Berlin, Germany and Athens, Greece. © 2015 ACM.",Geometric graphs; Map comparison; Street maps,Geometry; Graphic methods; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Technology transfer; Degree distributions; Experimental evaluation; Geometric graphs; Map comparison; Planar geometric graphs; Spatial differences; Street maps; Transportation network; Graph theory
Symbolic trajectories,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961216551&doi=10.1145%2f2786756&partnerID=40&md5=fdaea7a6889e96e5abf23dd4638360b1,"Due to the proliferation of GPS-enabled devices in vehicles or with people, large amounts of position data are recorded every day and the management of such mobility data, also called trajectories, is a very active research field. A lot of effort has gone into discovering ""semantics"" from the raw geometric trajectories by relating them to the spatial environment or finding patterns, for example, by data mining techniques. A question is how the resulting ""meaningful"" trajectories can be represented or further queried. In this article, we propose a systematic study of annotated trajectory databases. We define a very simple generic model called symbolic trajectory to capture a wide range of meanings derived from a geometric trajectory. Essentially, a symbolic trajectory is just a time-dependent label; variants have sets of labels, places, or sets of places. They are modeled as abstract data types and integrated into a well-established framework of data types and operations for moving objects. Symbolic trajectories can represent, for example, the names of roads traversed obtained by map matching, transportation modes, speed profile, cells of a cellular network, behaviors of animals, cinemas within 2km distance, and so forth. Symbolic trajectories can be combined with geometric trajectories to obtain annotated trajectories. Besides the model, the main technical contribution of the article is a language for pattern matching and rewriting of symbolic trajectories. A symbolic trajectory can be represented as a sequence of pairs (called units) consisting of a time interval and a label. A pattern consists of unit patterns (specifications for time interval and/or label) and wildcards, matching units and sequences of units, respectively, and regular expressions over such elements. It may further contain variables that can be used in conditions and in rewriting. Conditions and expressions in rewriting may use arbitrary operations available for querying in the host DBMS environment, which makes the language extensible and quite powerful. We formally define the data model and syntax and semantics of the pattern language. Query operations are offered to integrate pattern matching, rewriting, and classification of symbolic trajectories into a DBMS querying environment. Implementation of the model using finite state machines is described in detail. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the implementation. In particular, it shows dramatic improvements in storage space and response time in a comparison of symbolic and geometric trajectories for some simple queries that can be executed on both symbolic and raw trajectories. © 2015 ACM.",Moving objects; Pattern matching; Rewritin; Semantic trajectories; Trajectories,Abstract data types; Abstracting; Data mining; Database systems; Digital storage; Geometry; Pattern matching; Semantics; Experimental evaluation; Geometric trajectory; Moving objects; Rewritin; Semantic trajectories; Spatial environments; Technical contribution; Transportation mode; Trajectories
A server-assigned spatial crowdsourcing framework,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976609538&doi=10.1145%2f2729713&partnerID=40&md5=c80f671439eea070f09960fd88eefc1b,"With the popularity of mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing is rising as a new framework that enables human workers to solve tasks in the physical world. With spatial crowdsourcing, the goal is to crowdsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (i.e., tasks related to time and location) to a set of workers, which requires the workers to physically travel to those locations in order to perform the tasks. In this article, we focus on one class of spatial crowdsourcing, in which the workers send their locations to the server and thereafter the server assigns to every worker tasks in proximity to the worker's location with the aim of maximizing the overall number of assigned tasks. We formally define this maximum task assignment (MTA) problem in spatial crowdsourcing, and identify its challenges. We propose alternative solutions to address these challenges by exploiting the spatial properties of the problem space, including the spatial distribution and the travel cost of the workers. MTA is based on the assumptions that all tasks are of the same type and all workers are equally qualified in performing the tasks. Meanwhile, different types of tasks may require workers with various skill sets or expertise. Subsequently, we extend MTA by taking the expertise of the workers into consideration. We refer to this problem as the maximum score assignment (MSA) problem and show its practicality and generality. Extensive experiments with various synthetic and two real-world datasets show the applicability of our proposed framework. © 2015 ACM.",Crowdsourcing; Mobile crowdsourcing; Participatory sensing; Spatial crowdsourcing; Spatial task assignment,Location; Spatial distribution; Alternative solutions; Maximum score; Mobile crowdsourcing; Participatory Sensing; Physical world; Real-world datasets; Spatial properties; Task assignment; Crowdsourcing
Multirow boundary-labeling algorithms for panorama images,2015,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032018177&doi=10.1145%2f2794299&partnerID=40&md5=4ad3c4ea3579f0cfa6143813decd8b39,"Boundary labeling deals with placing annotations for objects in an image on the boundary of that image. This problem occurs frequently in situations in which placing labels directly in the image is impossible or produces too much visual clutter. Examples are annotating maps, photos, or technical/medical illustrations. Previous algorithmic results for boundary labeling consider a single layer of labels along some or all sides of a rectangular image. If, however, the number of labels is large or the labels are too long, multiple layers of labels are needed. In this article, we study boundary labeling for panorama images, where n points in a rectangle R are to be annotated by disjoint unit-height rectangular labels placed above R in K different rows (or layers). Each point is connected to its label by a vertical leader that does not intersect any other label. We present polynomial time algorithms based on dynamic programming that either minimize the number of rows to place all n labels or maximize the number (or total weight) of labels that can be placed in K rows for a given integer K. For weighted labels, the problem is shown to be (weakly) NP-hard; in this case, we give a pseudopolynomial algorithm to maximize the weight of the selected labels. We have implemented our algorithms; the experimental results show that solutions for realistically sized instances are computed instantaneously. We have also investigated two-sided panorama labeling, for which the labels may be placed above or below the panorama image. In this model, all of the aforementioned problems are NP-hard. For solving them, we propose mixed-integer linear program formulations. © 2015 ACM.",Information visualization; Point feature labeling,Dynamic programming; Information systems; Integer programming; Polynomial approximation; Boundary labeling; Information visualization; Mixed-integer linear program formulations; Multiple layers; Point features; Polynomial-time algorithms; Pseudopolynomial algorithms; Rectangular image; Image processing
Evaluating the Utility of High-Resolution Proximity Metrics in Predicting the Spread of COVID-19,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146430303&doi=10.1145%2f3531006&partnerID=40&md5=6ecd48c08e3fe532d198229548e0feb8,"High resolution mobility datasets have become increasingly available in the past few years and have enabled detailed models for infectious disease spread including those for COVID-19. However, there are open questions on how such mobility data can be used effectively within epidemic models and for which tasks they are best suited. In this paper, we extract a number of graph-based proximity metrics from high resolution cellphone trace data from X-Mode and use it to study COVID-19 epidemic spread in 50 land grant university counties in the US. We present an approach to estimate the effect of mobility on cases by fitting an ordinary differential equation based model and performing multivariate linear regression to explain the estimated time varying transmissibility. We find that, while mobility plays a significant role, the contribution is heterogeneous across the counties, as exemplified by a subsequent correlation analysis. We also evaluate the metrics' utility for case surge prediction defined as a supervised classification problem, and show that the learnt model can predict surges with 95% accuracy and an 87% F1-score.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",big data; computational epidemiology; COVID-19; individual mobility; machine learning,United States; Big data; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Ordinary differential equations; Supervised learning; Computational epidemiologies; Detailed models; Disease spread; Epidemic modeling; High resolution; Individual mobility; Infectious disease; Machine-learning; Mobility datum; Proximity metrics; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; epidemiology; viral disease; COVID-19
Modeling the Geospatial Evolution of COVID-19 using Spatio-temporal Convolutional Sequence-to-sequence Neural Networks,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146419325&doi=10.1145%2f3550272&partnerID=40&md5=208fdab7dbc0452fc5cc79090413b70b,"Europe was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and Portugal was severely affected, having suffered three waves in the first twelve months. Approximately between January 19th and February 5th 2021 Portugal was the country in the world with the largest incidence rate, with 14-day incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants in excess of 1,000. Despite its importance, accurate prediction of the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 remains a challenge, since existing analytical methods fail to capture the complex dynamics that result from the contagion within a region and the spreading of the infection from infected neighboring regions. We use a previously developed methodology and official municipality level data from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS), relative to the first twelve months of the pandemic, to compute an estimate of the incidence rate in each location of mainland Portugal. The resulting sequence of incidence rate maps was then used as a gold standard to test the effectiveness of different approaches in the prediction of the spatial-temporal evolution of the incidence rate. Four different methods were tested: a simple cell level autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, a cell level vector autoregressive (VAR) model, a municipality-by-municipality compartmental SIRD model followed by direct block sequential simulation, and a new convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network model based on the STConvS2S architecture. We conclude that the modified convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network is the best performing method in this task, when compared with the ARMA, VAR, and SIRD models, as well as with the baseline ConvLSTM model.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",compartmental models; convolutional neural networks; COVID-19; direct block sequential simulation; geospatial modeling; spatio-temporal convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural networks,Portugal; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Public health; Value engineering; Block-sequential; Compartmental modelling; Convolutional neural network; Direct block sequential simulation; Geospatial model; Incidence rate; Neural-networks; Sequential simulation; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network; artificial neural network; COVID-19; disease incidence; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; urban region; COVID-19
UniTE - The Best of Both Worlds: Unifying Function-fitting and Aggregation-based Approaches to Travel Time and Travel Speed Estimation,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146912411&doi=10.1145%2f3517335&partnerID=40&md5=09ec8d2e2d82610ece654e86bbac8d1b,"Travel time and speed estimation are part of many intelligent transportation applications. Existing estimation approaches rely on either function fitting or data aggregation and represent different tradeoffs between generalizability and accuracy.Function-fitting approaches learn functions that map feature vectors of, e.g., routes to travel time or speed estimates, which enables generalization to unseen routes. However, mapping functions are imperfect and offer poor accuracy in practice. Aggregation-based approaches instead form estimates by aggregating historical data, e.g., traversal data for routes. This enables very high accuracy given sufficient data. However, they rely on simplistic heuristics when insufficient data is available, yielding poor generalizability.We present a Unifying approach to Travel time and speed Estimation (UniTE) that combines function-fitting and aggregation-based approaches into a unified framework that aims to achieve the generalizability of function-fitting approaches and the accuracy of aggregation-based approaches when data is available. We demonstrate empirically that an instance of UniTE can improve the accuracies of travel speed and travel time estimation by 40-64% and 3-23%, respectively, compared to using only function fitting or data aggregation.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, most of the existing epidemiological models fail to capture this aspect by neither representing the sites visited by individuals explicitly nor characterizing disease transmission as a function of individual mobility patterns. In this work, we introduce a temporal point process modeling framework that specifically represents visits to the sites where individuals get in contact and infect each other. Under our model, the number of infections caused by an infectious individual naturally emerges to be overdispersed. Using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to estimate the transmission rate of infectious individuals at the sites they visit and in their households using Bayesian optimization (BO) and longitudinal case data. Simulations using fine-grained and publicly available demographic data and site locations from Bern, Switzerland showcase the flexibility of our framework. To facilitate research and analyses of other cities and regions, we release an open-source implementation of our framework.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",COVID-19; epidemiology; overdispersion; temporal point processes,Bern [Switzerland]; Switzerland; Epidemiology; Transmissions; Contact tracing; Disease transmission; Epidemiological modeling; Hotspots; Individual mobility; Mobility pattern; Overdispersion; Point process; Temporal point process; Transmission dynamics; COVID-19; disease transmission; dispersion; epidemiology; infectious disease; testing method; urban area; COVID-19
Effect of Migrant Labourer Inflow on the Early Spread of Covid-19 in Odisha: A Case Study,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146426921&doi=10.1145%2f3558778&partnerID=40&md5=3b9117012986724d9886ce7bb11c98fa,"Odisha is a state in the eastern part of India with a population of 46 million. Annually, a large number of people migrate to financial and industrial centers in other states for their livelihood earning. Bulk of them returned to Odisha during the early stage of national lockdown (March-June 2020) due to the Covid-19 outbreak as their places of work became Covid hotspots while Odisha was much less affected. This triggered the Odisha government to take precautionary measures such as mandatory quarantine of returning migrants, setting up of containment zones, and establishing temporary medical centres (TMC). Moreover, it was necessary for the government to devise a policy that could slow down the spread of Covid-19 in Odisha due to inflow of migrants. Being part of a task-force constituted by government to understand Covid-19 spread dynamics in Odisha, we predicted the number of people who would get infected primarily due to reverse-migration. This helped the government to make timely resource mobilisation. After analyzing reasons behind the rise in infections at various districts with large migrant population, we mapped the prediction problem to Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) of Abraham Wald. Our predictions were highly accurate when compared with real data that were obtained at a later stage. Two levels of SPRT were carried out over the data provided by the government. Use of SPRT for Covid-19 spread analysis is novel, particularly to predict the number of possible infections much ahead in time due to the sudden inflow of migrants.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Covid-19 prediction; labourer migration; Sequential Probability Ratio Test,India; Odisha; Case-studies; Covid-19 prediction; Hotspots; Laborer migration; Medical center; Number of peoples; Precautionary measures; Sequential probability ratio test; Spread dynamics; Task force; COVID-19; disease spread; government; infectious disease; labor migration; spatiotemporal analysis; Forecasting

Targeting on the research problem of bi-objective non-monotonic Euclidean TSP and based on the concept of the multi-agent-based approach, we propose a two-stage parallel matching approaching for solving TSP. Acting as a divide-and-conquer strategy, the merit lies in the simultaneously clustering and routing in the dividing process. Precisely, we first propose the Two-Stage Parallel Matching algorithm (TSPM) to deal with the bi-objective TSP. We then formulate the Grid-Based Two-Stage Parallel Matching (GRAPE) framework, which can synergize with TSPM, exact method, or other state-of-the-art TSP solvers, for solving large-scale Euclidean TSP. According to this framework, the original problem space is divided into smaller regions and then computed in parallel, which helps to tackle and derive solutions for larger-scale Euclidean TSP within reasonable computational resources. Preliminary evaluation based on TSPLIB testbed shows that our proposed GRAPE framework holds a decent quality of solutions in especially runtime for large-scale Euclidean TSP. Meanwhile, experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our proposed TSPM in solving the bi-objective non-monotonic TSP.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",grafting; grid processing; matching; routing problem; Traveling salesman problem (TSP),Combinatorial optimization; Multi agent systems; Bi objectives; Combinatorial optimization problems; Euclidean; Grid processing; Grid-based; Large-scales; Matching algorithm; Matchings; Routing problems; Traveling salesman problem; algorithm; image processing; optimization; two-dimensional modeling; Traveling salesman problem

Recently, an unprecedented amount of spatial and spatiotemporal data have been made available that can be used to improve our understanding of the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This understanding will be paramount to prepare for future pandemics through spatial algorithms and systems to collect, capture, curate and analyze complex, multi-scale human movement data to solve problems such as infectious diseases prediction, contact tracing, and risk assessment. In exploring and deepening the conversation around this topic, the five articles included in the second volume of this special issue employ diverse theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and frameworks, including but not limited to close contact modeling, infectious diseases spread prediction, mobility analysis, effective testing and intervention strategies. Rather than focusing on a narrow set of problems, these articles provide a glimpse into the diverse possibilities of leveraging spatial and spatiotemporal data for pandemic preparedness.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesInfectious diseases; geographical information systems; health informatics; pandemic preparedness; spatiotemporal systems,Geographic information systems; Information systems; Medical informatics; Risk assessment; Additional key word and phrasesinfectious disease; Geographical information; Geographical information system; Health informatics; Infectious disease; Key words; Pandemic preparedness; Spatial data; Spatio-temporal data; Spatio-temporal system; COVID-19; disease spread; GIS; infectious disease; spatiotemporal analysis; COVID-19
Data-driven Mobility Analysis and Modeling: Typical and Confined Life of a Metropolitan Population,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148038012&doi=10.1145%2f3517222&partnerID=40&md5=f44f4072699065610886a79ea4c2a427,"The idea of using mobile phone data to understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and that of the sanitary constraints associated with it on human mobility imposed itself as evidence in most countries. This work uses spatiotemporal aggregated mobile phone data provided by a major French telecom operator, covering a geographical region centered on Paris for early 2020, i.e., periods before and during the first French lockdown. An essential property of this data is its fine-grained spatial resolution, which, to the best of our knowledge, is unique in the COVID-related mobility literature. Contrarily to regions or country-wide resolution, it describes population mobility flows among zones ranging from 0.025∼km2 to 5.40∼km2, corresponding to 326 aggregated zones over the total area of 93.76∼km2 of the city of Paris. We perform a data-driven mobility investigation and modeling to quantify (in space and time) the population attendance and visiting flows in different urban areas. Second, when looking at periods both before and during the lockdown, we quantify the consequences of mobility restrictions and decisions on an urban scale. For this, per zone, we define a so-called signature, which captures behaviors in terms of population attendance in the corresponding geographical region (i.e., their land use) and allows us to automatically detect activity, residential, and outlier areas. We then study three different types of graph centrality, quantifying the importance of each zone in a time-dependent weighted graph according to the habits in the mobility of the population. Combining the three centrality measures, we compute per zone of the city, its impact-factor, and employ it to quantify the global importance of zones according to the population mobility. Our results firstly reveal the population's daily zone preferences in terms of attendance and mobility, with a high concentration on business and touristic zones. Second, results show that the lockdown mobility restrictions significantly reduced visitation and attendance patterns on zones, mainly in central Paris, and considerably changed the mobility habits of the population. As a side effect, most zones identified as mainly having activity-related population attendance in typical periods became residential-related zones during the lockdown, turning the entire city into a residential-like area. Shorter distance displacement restrictions imposed by the lockdown increased visitation to more ""local""zones, i.e., close to the population's primary residence. Decentralization was also favored by the paths preferences of the still-moving population. On the other side, ""jogging activities""allowing people to be outside their residences impacted parks visitation, increasing their visitation during the lockdown. By combining the impact factor and the signatures of the zones, we notice that areas with a higher impact factor are more likely to maintain regular land use during the lockdown. © 2022 held by the owner/author(s).

Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 Control Policies on Campus Occupancy and Mobility via WiFi Sensing,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133387576&doi=10.1145%2f3516524&partnerID=40&md5=3247dc8145cb6adbb1d0604809b5fa3a,"Mobile sensing has played a key role in providing digital solutions to aid with COVID-19 containment policies, primarily to automate contact tracing and social distancing measures. As more and more countries reopen from lockdowns, there remains a pressing need to minimize crowd movements and interactions, particularly in enclosed spaces. Many COVID-19 technology solutions leverage positioning systems, generally using Bluetooth and GPS, and can theoretically be adapted to monitor safety compliance within dedicated environments. However, they may not be the ideal modalities for indoor positioning. This article conjectures that analyzing user occupancy and mobility via deployed WiFi infrastructure can help institutions monitor and maintain safety compliance according to the public health guidelines. Using smartphones as a proxy for user location, our analysis demonstrates how coarse-grained WiFi data can sufficiently reflect the indoor occupancy spectrum when different COVID-19 policies were enacted. Our work analyzes staff and students' mobility data from three university campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore, and the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our results show that online learning, split-team, and other space management policies effectively lower occupancy. However, they do not change the mobility for individuals transitioning between spaces. We demonstrate how this data source can be a practical application for institutional crowd control and discuss the implications of our findings for policymaking. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",analysis; campus; COVID-19; large-scale; mobility; occupancy; WiFi,Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United States; Human resource management; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Analyse; Campus; Control policy; Digital solutions; Large-scales; Mobile sensing; Mobility; Occupancy; Safety compliances; Wifi; compliance; COVID-19; health and safety; health impact; health policy; infrastructure; public health; student; COVID-19
An RDMA-enabled In-memory Computing Platform for R-Tree on Clusters,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130553114&doi=10.1145%2f3503513&partnerID=40&md5=ba71ff5182209e2a4d46fc3874c21ff3,"R-Tree is a foundational data structure used in spatial databases and scientific databases. With the advancement of networks and computer architectures, in-memory data processing for R-Tree in distributed systems has become a common platform. We have observed new performance challenges to process R-Tree as the amount of multidimensional datasets become increasingly high. Specifically, an R-Tree server can be heavily overloaded while the network and client CPU are lightly loaded, and vice versa.In this article, we present the design and implementation of Catfish, an RDMA-enabled R-Tree for low latency and high throughput by adaptively utilizing the available network bandwidth and computing resources to balance the workloads between clients and servers. We design and implement two basic mechanisms of using RDMA for a client-server R-Tree data processing system. First, in the fast messaging design, we use RDMA writes to send R-Tree requests to the server and let server threads process R-Tree requests to achieve low query latency. Second, in the RDMA offloading design, we use RDMA reads to offload tree traversal from the server to the client, which rescues the server as it is overloaded. We further develop an adaptive scheme to effectively switch an R-Tree search between fast messaging and RDMA offloading, maximizing the overall performance. Our experiments show that the adaptive solution of Catfish on InfiniBand significantly outperforms R-Tree that uses only fast messaging or only RDMA offloading in both latency and throughput. Catfish can also deliver up to one order of magnitude performance over the traditional schemes using TCP/IP on 1 and 40 Gbps Ethernet. We make a strong case to use RDMA to effectively balance workloads in distributed systems for low latency and high throughput. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",R-Tree; RDMA,Computer architecture; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Forestry; Network architecture; Common platform; Computing platform; High-throughput; Low latency; Low-high; Performance; R-trees; RDMA; Scientific database; Spatial database; cluster analysis; computer simulation; data processing; data set; database; performance assessment; Decision trees

Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human health, especially COVID-19 that has became a serious worldwide health concern since the end of 2019. Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent its onward transmission. Contact tracing can help us better understand the transmission link of the virus, whereby better interrupting its transmission. Given the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, contact tracing has become one of the most critical measures to effectively curb the spread of the virus. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on contact tracing, with a detailed coverage of the recent advancements the models, digital technologies, protocols and issues involved in contact tracing. The current challenges as well as future directions of contact tracing technologies are also presented. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",contact tracing technologies; COVID-19; Infectious diseases; mobile applications; privacy issues; protocols,Diseases; Health risks; Surveys; Transmissions; Contact tracing; Contact tracing technology; COVID-19; Health concerns; Human health; Infectious disease; Mobile applications; Parasite-; Pathogenic microorganisms; Privacy issue; COVID-19; disease spread; disease transmission; health impact; infectious disease; mobile phone; survey method; Viruses

ASTRO: Reducing COVID-19 Exposure through Contact Prediction and Avoidance,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128111096&doi=10.1145%2f3490492&partnerID=40&md5=528f617512530d20dbe1a1d7d587a0da,"The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance and benefits of recommending paths that reduce the exposure to and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by avoiding crowded indoor or outdoor areas. Existing path discovery techniques are inadequate for coping with such dynamic and heterogeneous (indoor and outdoor) environments-they typically find an optimal path assuming a homogeneous and/or static graph, and hence they cannot be used to support contact avoidance. In this article, we pose the need for Mobile Contact Avoidance Navigation and propose ASTRO (Accessible Spatio-Temporal Route Optimization), a novel graph-based path discovering algorithm that can reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure by taking into consideration the congestion in indoor spaces. ASTRO operates in an A∗ manner to find the most promising path for safe movement within and across multiple buildings without constructing the full graph. For its path finding, ASTRO requires predicting congestion in corridors and hallways. Consequently, we propose a new grid-based partitioning scheme combined with a hash-based two-level structure to store congestion models, called CM-Structure, which enables on-The-fly forecasting of congestion in corridors and hallways. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ASTRO and the accuracy of CM-Structure's congestion models empirically with realistic datasets, showing up to one order of magnitude reduction in COVID-19 exposure. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",congestion forecasting; disability; graph processing; Indoor; outdoor; path recommendation,Coronavirus; Forecasting; Graph theory; SARS; Congestion forecasting; Congestion models; Coronaviruses; Disability; Graph processing; Indoor; Outdoor; Path recommendation; Route optimization; Spatio-temporal; algorithm; COVID-19; disability; forecasting method; prediction; Graphic methods
PCT-TEE: Trajectory-based Private Contact Tracing System with Trusted Execution Environment,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130526556&doi=10.1145%2f3490491&partnerID=40&md5=9fb5981b62dbb0522cca5cd3d51df818,"Existing Bluetooth-based private contact tracing (PCT) systems can privately detect whether people have come into direct contact with patients with COVID-19. However, we find that the existing systems lack functionality and flexibility, which may hurt the success of contact tracing. Specifically, they cannot detect indirect contact (e.g., people may be exposed to COVID-19 by using a contaminated sheet at a restaurant without making direct contact with the infected individual); they also cannot flexibly change the rules of ""risky contact,""such as the duration of exposure or the distance (both spatially and temporally) from a patient with COVID-19 that is considered to result in a risk of exposure, which may vary with the environmental situation.In this article, we propose an efficient and secure contact tracing system that enables us to trace both direct contact and indirect contact. To address the above problems, we need to utilize users' trajectory data for PCT, which we call trajectory-based PCT. We formalize this problem as a spatiotemporal private set intersection that satisfies both the security and efficiency requirements. By analyzing different approaches such as homomorphic encryption, which could be extended to solve this problem, we identify the trusted execution environment (TEE) as a candidate method to achieve our requirements. The major challenge is how to design algorithms for a spatiotemporal private set intersection under the limited secure memory of the TEE. To this end, we design a TEE-based system with flexible trajectory data encoding algorithms. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can process hundreds of queries on tens of millions of records of trajectory data within a few seconds. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Toward Accurate Spatiotemporal COVID-19 Risk Scores Using High-Resolution Real-World Mobility Data,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128007702&doi=10.1145%2f3481044&partnerID=40&md5=b4475b19de7c8612511bfd3dbcf406a1,"As countries look toward re-opening of economic activities amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim at developing risk scores either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics. Instead, in this article, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals. While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore, we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",COVID-19; disease spread simulation; mobility data; spatiotemporal risk scores,Cell proliferation; Economics; Risk perception; COVID-19; Disease spread; Disease spread simulation; Finer grains; High resolution; Mobility datum; Real-world; Reproduction numbers; Risk score; Spatiotemporal risk score; COVID-19; demography; disease spread; disease transmission; health risk; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; Population statistics

Geospatial Interlinking aims to cover this gap through space tiling techniques, which significantly restrict the search space. Yet, the state-of-The-Art techniques operate exclusively in a batch manner that produces results only after processing all their geometries. In this work, we address this issue by defining the task of Progressive Geospatial Interlinking, which produces results in a pay-As-you-go manner when the available computational or temporal resources are limited. We propose a static progressive algorithm, which employs a fixed processing order, and a dynamic one, whose processing order is updated whenever new topological relations are discovered. We equip both algorithms with a series of weighting schemes and explain how they can be adapted to massive parallelization with Apache Spark. We conduct a thorough experimental study over six large, real datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our techniques over the current state-of-The-Art.

Efficient 3D Spatial Queries for Complex Objects,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130541273&doi=10.1145%2f3502221&partnerID=40&md5=1306147da0c69cbf9af65014f5d0c6cb,"3D spatial data has been generated at an extreme scale from many emerging applications, such as high definition maps for autonomous driving and 3D Human BioMolecular Atlas. In particular, 3D digital pathology provides a revolutionary approach to map human tissues in 3D, which is highly promising for advancing computer-Aided diagnosis and understanding diseases through spatial queries and analysis. However, the exponential increase of data at 3D leads to significant I/O, communication, and computational challenges for 3D spatial queries. The complex structures of 3D objects such as bifurcated vessels make it difficult to effectively support 3D spatial queries with traditional methods. In this article, we present our work on building an efficient and scalable spatial query system, iSPEED, for large-scale 3D data with complex structures. iSPEED adopts effective progressive compression for each 3D object with successive levels of detail. Further, iSPEED exploits structural indexing for complex structured objects in distance-based queries. By querying with data represented in successive levels of details and structural indexes, iSPEED provides an option for users to balance between query efficiency and query accuracy. iSPEED builds in-memory indexes and decompresses data on-demand, which has a minimal memory footprint. iSPEED provides a 3D spatial query engine that can be invoked on-demand to run many instances in parallel implemented with, but not limited to, MapReduce. We evaluate iSPEED with three representative queries: 3D spatial joins, 3D nearest neighbor query, and 3D spatial proximity estimation. The extensive experiments demonstrate that iSPEED significantly improves the performance of existing spatial query systems. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",3D; digital pathology; in-memory computing; Spatial data management,Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Computer aided diagnosis; Information management; Pathology; Search engines; 3d; 3D object; Complexes structure; Digital pathologies; In-memory computing; Level-of-detail; On demands; Query systems; Spatial data management; Spatial queries; engine; pathology; spatial data; three-dimensional modeling; Nearest neighbor search

To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users' contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",contact tracing; COVID-19; privacy; security,Bluetooth; Computer viruses; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; As interfaces; Contact tracing; COVID-19; Interface usability; Lower energies; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Security; Security and privacy issues; COVID-19; disease spread; security; sustainability; viral disease; Viruses

The consensus has been reached by scientists that COVID-19 can be transmitted in an airborne way, and human-to-human transmission is the primary cause of the fast spread of COVID-19. Thus, mobility should be restricted to control the epidemic, and many governments worldwide have succeeded in curbing the spread by means of control policies like city lockdowns. Against this background, we propose a novel fine-grained transmission model based on real-world human mobility data and develop a platform that helps the researcher or governors to explore the possibility of future development of the epidemic spreading and simulate the outcomes of human mobility and the epidemic state under different epidemic control policies. The proposed platform can also support users to determine potential contacts, discover regions with high infectious risks, and assess the individual infectious risk.

A user in such a geo-social network can be attributed to an associated location (spatial), her preferences as keywords (textual), and the connectivity (social) with her friends. The fusion of social, spatial, and textual data of a large number of users in these networks provide an interesting insight for finding meaningful geo-social groups of users supporting many real-life applications, including activity planning and recommendation systems. In this article, we introduce a novel query, namely, Top-k Flexible Socio-Spatial Keyword-aware Group Query (SSKGQ), which finds the best k groups of varying sizes around different points of interest (POIs), where the groups are ranked based on the social and textual cohesiveness among members and spatial closeness with the corresponding POI and the number of members in the group. We develop an efficient approach to solve the SSKGQ problem based on our theoretical upper bounds on distance, social connectivity, and textual similarity. We prove that the SSKGQ problem is NP-Hard and provide an approximate solution based on our derived relaxed bounds, which run much faster than the exact approach by sacrificing the group quality slightly.

MFPMiner: Mining Meaningful Frequent Patterns from Spatio-textual Trajectories,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127018724&doi=10.1145%2f3498728&partnerID=40&md5=e8019c837fd96f42b268c63d6f9883c3,"In the second decade of this century, technical progress has led to a worldwide proliferation of devices for tracking the movement behavior of a person, a vehicle, or another kind of entity. One of the consequences of this development is a massive and still growing amount of movement and movement-related data recorded by cellphones, automobiles, vessels, aircraft, and further GPS-enabled entities. As a result, the requirements for managing and analyzing movement records also increase, serving commercial, administrative, or private purposes. Since the development of hardware components cannot keep pace with the data growth, exploring methods of analyzing such trajectory datasets has become a very active and influential research field.For many application scenarios, besides the spatial trajectory of an entity, it is desirable to take additional semantic information into consideration. These descriptions also change with time and may represent, e.g., the course of streets passed by a bus, the sequence of region names traversed by an aircraft, or the points of interest in proximity of the positions of a taxi. Such data may be directly recorded by a sensor (such as the altitude of an aircraft) or computed from the spatial trajectory combined with some underlying information (for example, street names). It is often helpful or even necessary to focus on such semantic information for efficient analyses, as changes usually occur less frequently than it is the case for the spatial trajectory, where data points usually arrive in very close temporal distances. However, any kind of querying requires a deep semantic knowledge of the dataset at hand, particularly for retrieving the set of trajectories that match a certain mobility pattern, that is, a sequence of temporal, spatial, and semantic specifications.In this article, we introduce a framework named MFPMiner1 for retrieving all mobility patterns fulfilling a user-specified frequency threshold from a spatio-textual trajectory dataset. The resulting patterns and their relative frequency can be regarded as a knowledge base of the considered data. They may be directly visualized or applied for a pattern matching query yielding the set of matching trajectories. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach in an application scenario and provide an experimental evaluation of its performance on real and synthetic datasets by comparing it to three competitive methods.

Bayesian Surface Warping Approach for Rectifying Geological Boundaries Using Displacement Likelihood and Evidence from Geochemical Assays,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117160888&doi=10.1145%2f3476979&partnerID=40&md5=cd52f4001ee0f73f9662cf8d0aba9c1e,"This article presents a Bayesian framework for manipulating mesh surfaces with the aim of improving the positional integrity of the geological boundaries that they seek to represent. The assumption is that these surfaces, created initially using sparse data, capture the global trend and provide a reasonable approximation of the stratigraphic, mineralization, and other types of boundaries for mining exploration, but they are locally inaccurate at scales typically required for grade estimation. The proposed methodology makes local spatial corrections automatically to maximize the agreement between the modeled surfaces and observed samples. Where possible, vertices on a mesh surface are moved to provide a clear delineation, for instance, between ore and waste material across the boundary based on spatial and compositional analysis using assay measurements collected from densely spaced, geo-registered blast holes. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution ultimately considers the chemistry observation likelihood in a given domain.

Utilization of Real Time Behavior and Geographical Attraction for Location Recommendation,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127026555&doi=10.1145%2f3484318&partnerID=40&md5=bf4b08db2321a17df120db99966ea808,"Personalized location recommendation is an increasingly active topic in recent years, which recommends appropriate locations to users based on their temporal and geospatial visiting patterns. Current location recommendation methods usually estimate the users' visiting preference probabilities from the historical check-ins in batch. However, in practice, when users' behaviors are updated in real-time, it is often cost-inhibitive to re-estimate and updates users' visiting preference using the same batch methods due to the number of check-ins. Moreover, an important nature of users' movement patterns is that users are more attracted to an area where have dense locations with same categories for conducting specific behaviors. In this paper, we propose a location recommendation method called GeoRTGA by utilizing the real time user behaviors and geographical attractions to tackle the problems. GeoRTGA contains two sub-models: real time behavior recommendation model and attraction-based spatial model. The real time behavior recommendation model aims to recommend real-time possible behaviors which users prefer to visit, and the attraction-based spatial model is built to discover the category-based spatial and individualized spatial patterns based on the geographical information of locations and corresponding location categories and check-in numbers. Experiments are conducted on four public real-world check-in datasets, which show that the proposed GeoRTGA outperforms the five existing location recommendation methods. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, monitoring and mapping of illumination levels in city streets during the nighttime is a tedious activity that is usually based on manual inspection reports. The advancement in smartphone technology comes up with a better way to monitor city illumination using a rich set of smartphone-equipped inexpensive but powerful sensors (e.g., light sensor, GPS, etc). In this context, the main objective of this work is to use the power of smartphone sensors and IoT-cloud-based framework to collect, store, and analyze nighttime illumination data from citizens to generate high granular city illumination map. The development of high granular illumination map is an effective way of visualizing and assessing the illumination of city streets during nighttime. In this article, an illumination mapping algorithm called Street Illumination Mapping is proposed that works on participatory sensing-based illumination data collected using smartphones as IoT devices to generate city illumination map. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world illumination dataset collected by participants in two different urban areas of city Kolkata. The results are also compared with the baseline mapping techniques, namely, Spatial k-Nearest Neighbors, Inverse Distance Weighting, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Artificial Neural Network. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Illumination mapping; Participatory sensing; Smartphone sensors,Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Inverse problems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Pedestrian safety; Smartphones; Illumination levels; Illumination mapping; Light sensor; Manual inspection; Participatory Sensing; Pedestrian movement; Power; Smart phones; Smartphone sensor; Vehicle movements; Internet; mobile phone; monitoring system; nightglow; remote sensing; visualization; Decision trees
FoodMatch: Batching and Matching for Food Delivery in Dynamic Road Networks,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127043212&doi=10.1145%2f3494530&partnerID=40&md5=c411a8e30c1b7968e8d4619a413b49f3,"Food delivery, today, is a multi-billion dollar industry. Minimizing food delivery time is a key contributor towards building positive customer experiences. More precisely, given a stream of food orders and available delivery vehicles, how should orders be assigned to vehicles so the delivery time is minimized? Several decisions have to be made: (1) assignment of orders to vehicles, (2) grouping orders into batches to cope with limited vehicle availability, (3) adapting to dynamic positions of delivery vehicles, and (4) ensuring scalability to the demands of real-world workloads. We show that the minimization problem is not only NP-hard but inapproximable in polynomial time. To mitigate this computational bottleneck, we develop an algorithm called FoodMatch, which maps the vehicle assignment problem to that of minimum weight perfect matching on a bipartite graph. To further reduce the quadratic construction cost of the bipartite graph, we deploy best-first search to only compute a subgraph that is highly likely to contain the minimum matching. The solution quality is further enhanced by reducing batching to a graph batching problem and anticipating dynamic positions of vehicles through angular distance. We perform extensive experiments on real food-delivery data from large metropolitan cities. Our results establish that FoodMatch imparts substantial improvements over baseline strategies across a host of metrics such as food delivery time, waiting time at restaurants, and orders delivered per kilometer. Furthermore, FoodMatch is efficient enough to handle real-world workloads. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

They are used to determine the location of online users when their precise location is unavailable. These databases are vital for a number of online services, including search engine personalization, content delivery, local ads, and fraud detection. However, IP geolocation databases are often inaccurate. In this work we present two novel approaches to improving IP geolocation by mining search engine click logs. First, we show that we can derive which URLs have local affinity by clustering clicks from IPs with known locations. We demonstrate that we can further propagate these URL locations to IP addresses with unknown locations. Our approach significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art commercial IP geolocation databases by 25 and 36 percentage points at a distance error of 10 kilometers, respectively. Second, we present an alternative method of assigning locations to URLs when IP location training data is not available, by instead extracting locations from the body of web documents. This second approach also outperforms the baselines by 7 and 17 percentage points, respectively, and has higher coverage than the first method. Finally, we also demonstrate that our two approaches outperform the academic state of the art based on mining query logs. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Public health officials and building managers had to decide how to best use their buildings while curtailing the infection risk for their occupants.In this article, we present a systematic simulation-based methodology for estimating the infection risk for a building's occupants under different scenarios of building usage. We have evaluated our simulations against some real-world building usage data from a university campus building; our experiments demonstrate the realism of our simulations. Based on this finding, we have developed a virus transmission model that estimates the potential infection transmission risk given the behaviors of a building's occupants. Our methodology enables building managers to simulate alternative building usage scenarios and estimate their relative infection transmission risk. We argue that such risk estimate comparisons can be useful in making decision about alternative building usage options. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",BIM; COVID-19; Occupancy simulation,Architectural design; Health risks; Risk perception; Transmissions; Viruses; BIM; Building managers; Building occupancy; Indoor environment; Infection transmission; Most likely; Occupancy densities; Occupancy simulation; Simulation and analysis; Systematic simulation; COVID-19; disease transmission; health risk; infectious disease; public health; risk factor; simulation; virus; COVID-19
A High-resolution Global-scale Model for COVID-19 Infection Rate,2022,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131456719&doi=10.1145%2f3494531&partnerID=40&md5=7a0f68e7004dab2f1eddb6b5087dcaf7,"Several models have correlated COVID-19 spread with specific climatic, geophysical, and air pollution conditions, and early models had predicted the lowering of infection cases in Summer 2020. These approaches have been criticized for their coarse assumptions and because they could produce biases if used without considering dynamic factors such as human mobility and interaction. However, human mobility and interaction models alone have not been able to suggest more innovative recommendations than simple social distancing and lockdown, and would definitely need to include information about the base environmental suitability of a World area to COVID-19 spread. This scenario would benefit from a global-scale high-resolution environmental model that could be coupled with dynamic models for large-scale and regional analyses. This article presents a 0.1 high-resolution global-scale probability map of low and high-infection-rates of COVID-19 that uses annual-average surface air temperature, precipitation, and CO2 as environmental parameters, and Italian provinces as training locations. A risk index calculated on this map correctly identifies 87% of the World countries that reported high infection rates in 2020 and 80% of the low and high infection-rate countries overall. Our model is meant to be used as an additional factor in other models for monthly weather and human mobility. It estimates the base environmental inertia that a geographical place opposes to COVID-19 when mobility restrictions are not in place and can support how much the monthly weather favors or penalizes infection increase. Its high resolution and extent make it consistently usable in global and regional-scale analyses, also thanks to the availability of our results as FAIR data and software as an Open Science-oriented Web service. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Coronavirus; COVID-19; Ecological niche modelling; maximum entropy; SARS-CoV-2,Regional planning; Web services; Condition; Coronaviruses; Ecological niche modeling; Global scale; High resolution; Human mobility; Humaninteraction; Infection rates; Maximum-entropy; Scale-model; COVID-19; dynamic analysis; ecological modeling; environmental modeling; infectious disease; maximum entropy analysis; niche; resolution; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Coronavirus; COVID-19

Repopulating the micro-spatial setting of an office building, with virus spread and transmission mitigation measures, is critical for a return to normalcy. Advice from public health experts, such as maintaining physical distancing from others and well-ventilated spaces, are essential, yet there is a lack of sound guidance on configuring office usage that allows for a safe return of workers. This paper highlights the potential for decision-making and planning insights through location analytics, particularly within an office setting. Proposed is a spatial analytic framework addressing the need for physical distancing and limiting worker interaction, supported by geographic information systems, network science, and spatial optimization. The developed modeling approach addresses dispersion of assigned office spaces as well as associated movement within the office environment. This can be used to support the design and utilization of offices in a manner that minimizes the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed model produces two main findings: (1) that the consideration of minimizing potential interaction as an objective has implications for the safety of work environments, and (2) that current social distancing measures may be inadequate within office settings. Our results show that leveraging exploratory spatial data analyses through the integration of geographic information systems, network science, and spatial optimization, enables the identification of workspace allocation alternatives in support of office repopulation efforts. © 2022 held by the owner/author(s).",exploratory spatial data analysis; health informatics; network science; spatial interaction; Spatial optimization,Decision making; Geographic information systems; Information analysis; Information systems; Information use; Medical informatics; Office buildings; Spatial variables measurement; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Exploratory spatial data analysis; Health informatics; Information systems networks; Network science; Spatial interaction; Spatial optimization; Virus spreads; Virus transmission; Workers'; COVID-19; GIS; optimization; public health; safety; spatial analysis; spatial data; workplace; COVID-19

However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic pandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this article, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask wearing, social distancing, and vaccination, and how these may result in sub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the chosen policies, and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: It is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when designing an effective solution. © 2022 held by the owner/author(s).

This data has been exploited in several important use cases in various application domains. This article supports geo-social personalized queries in streaming data environments. We define temporal geo-social queries that provide users with real-time personalized answers based on their social graph. The new queries allow incorporating keyword search to get personalized results that are relevant to certain topics. To efficiently support these queries, we propose an indexing framework that provides lightweight and effective real-time indexing to digest geo-social data in real time. The framework distinguishes highly dynamic data from relatively stable data and uses appropriate data structures and a storage tier for each. Based on this framework, we propose a novel geo-social index and adopt two baseline indexes to support the addressed queries. The query processor then employs different types of pruning to efficiently access the index content and provide a real-time query response. The extensive experimental evaluation based on real datasets has shown the superiority of our proposed techniques to index real-time data and provide low-latency queries compared to existing competitors.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",geo-social; indexing; query processing; real-time; Spatial; temporal,Digital storage; Indexing (of information); Query processing; Geo-social; Indexing; Keyword search; Location-aware technology; Real- time; Social datum; Social media platforms; Spatial; Streaming data; Temporal; algorithm; data assimilation; software; temporal analysis; Search engines

We aim to identify such outliers via the physical properties of the tracked entity, that is, we consider its physical possibility to visit combinations of measurements. We describe optimal algorithms to compute maximum subsequences of measurements that are consistent with (simplified) physics models. Our results are output-sensitive with respect to the number k of outliers in a trajectory of n measurements. Specifically, we describe an O(n log n log2 k)-time algorithm for 2D trajectories using a model with unbounded acceleration but bounded velocity, and an O(nk)-time algorithm for any model where consistency is ""concatenable"": a consistent subsequence that ends where another begins together form a consistent sequence. We also consider acceleration-bounded models that are not concatenable. We show how to compute the maximum subsequence for such models in O(n k2 log k) time, under appropriate realism conditions. Finally, we experimentally explore the performance of our algorithms on several large real-world sets of trajectories. Our experiments show that we are generally able to retain larger fractions of noisy trajectories than previous work and simpler greedy approaches. We also observe that the speed-bounded model may in practice approximate the acceleration-bounded model quite well, though we observed some variation between datasets.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",algorithms; experiments; Outlier detection; physics models,Anomaly detection; Statistics; Bounded model; Condition; Consistent sequence; Optimal algorithm; Output-sensitive; Performance; Physical sensors; Physics modeling; Real-world; Time algorithms; algorithm; methodology; spatial analysis; trajectory; Trajectories

This observational data suffers from huge storage footprints and makes global analysis challenging. Therefore, many information products have been designed in which observations are turned into global maps showing features such as land cover or land use, often with only a few discrete values and sparse spatial coverage like only within cities. Traditional coding of such data as a raster image becomes challenging due to the sizes of the datasets and spatially non-local access patterns, for example, when labeling social media streams. This article proposes GloBiMap, a randomized data structure, based on Bloom filters, for modeling low-cardinality sparse raster images of excessive sizes in a configurable amount of memory with pure random access operations avoiding costly intermediate decompression. In addition, the data structure is designed to correct the inevitable errors of the randomized layer in order to have a fully exact representation. We show the feasibility of the approach on several real-world datasets including the Global Urban Footprint in which each pixel denotes whether a particular location contains a building at a resolution of roughly 10m globally as well as on a global Twitter sample of more than 220 million precisely geolocated tweets. In addition, we propose the integration of a denoiser engine based on artificial intelligence in order to reduce the amount of error correction information for extremely compressive GloBiMaps.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",data sparsity and compression; geographic information systems; Image representation; machine learning; randomized data structures,Data structures; Geographic information systems; Image enhancement; Land use; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Data sparsity; Data sparsity and compression; Global scale; Image representations; Probabilistic data; Randomized data structure; Raster image; Satellite mission; Social media; Spatial data; data assimilation; data set; global change; mapping method; probability; raster; Error correction

VRPDiv: A Divide and Conquer Framework for Large Vehicle Routing Problems,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118414258&doi=10.1145%2f3474832&partnerID=40&md5=3b06afd7d025f587924d0ab3d412a377,"The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an NP hard problem where we need to optimize itineraries for agents to visit multiple targets. When considering real-world travel (road-network topology, speed limits and traffic), modern VRP solvers can only process small instances with a few hundred targets. We propose a framework (VRPDiv) that can scale any solver to support larger VRP instances with up to ten thousand targets (10k) by dividing them into smaller clusters. VRPDiv supports the multiple VRP scenarios and contains a pool of clustering algorithms from which it chooses the ideal one depending on properties of the instance. VRPDiv assigns agents based on cluster demand and targets compatibility (i.e. realizable time-windows and capacity limitations). We incorporate the framework into the Bing Maps Multi-Itinerary Optimization (MIO)1 online service. This architecture allows MIO to scale up from solving instances with a few hundred to over 10k targets in under 10 minutes. We evaluate our framework on public datasets and publish a new dataset ourselves, as large enough instances supporting real-world travel were impossible to find. We investigate multiple clustering methods and show that choosing the correct one is critical with differences of up to 60% in quality. We compare with relevant baselines and report a 40% improvement in target allocation and a 9.8% improvement in itinerary durations. We compare with existing scores and report an average delta of 10%, with lower values (<5%) in instances with low workload (few targets per agent), which are acceptable for an online service.  © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"The Impact of Stationarity, Regularity, and Context on the Predictability of Individual Human Mobility",2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116106175&doi=10.1145%2f3459625&partnerID=40&md5=4bfd4727e77dc3ad965d9e59496e4905,"Predicting mobility-related behavior is an important yet challenging task. On the one hand, factors such as one's routine or preferences for a few favorite locations may help in predicting their mobility. On the other hand, several contextual factors, such as variations in individual preferences, weather, traffic, or even a person's social contacts, can affect mobility patterns and make its modeling significantly more challenging. A fundamental approach to study mobility-related behavior is to assess how predictable such behavior is, deriving theoretical limits on the accuracy that a prediction model can achieve given a specific dataset. This approach focuses on the inherent nature and fundamental patterns of human behavior captured in that dataset, filtering out factors that depend on the specificities of the prediction method adopted. However, the current state-of-the-art method to estimate predictability in human mobility suffers from two major limitations: low interpretability and hardness to incorporate external factors that are known to help mobility prediction (i.e., contextual information). In this article, we revisit this state-of-the-art method, aiming at tackling these limitations. Specifically, we conduct a thorough analysis of how this widely used method works by looking into two different metrics that are easier to understand and, at the same time, capture reasonably well the effects of the original technique. We evaluate these metrics in the context of two different mobility prediction tasks, notably, next cell and next distinct cell prediction, which have different degrees of difficulty. Additionally, we propose alternative strategies to incorporate different types of contextual information into the existing technique. Our evaluation of these strategies offer quantitative measures of the impact of adding context to the predictability estimate, revealing the challenges associated with doing so in practical scenarios.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",contextual information; entropy estimators; Human mobility; predictability,Behavioral research; Contextual factors; Contextual information; Entropy estimator; Human mobility; Individual preference; Mobility predictions; Predictability; Social contacts; State-of-the-art methods; Stationarity; fundamental particle; human behavior; mobility; quantitative analysis; theoretical study; Forecasting
Riso-tree: An efficient and scalable index for spatial entities in graph database management systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122641466&doi=10.1145%2f3450945&partnerID=40&md5=3d96cd7d77949b7473673c353bcd9864,"With the ubiquity of spatial data, vertexes or edges in graphs can possess spatial location attributes side by side with other non-spatial attributes. For instance, as of June 2018, the Wikidata knowledge graph contains 48,547,142 data items (i.e., vertexes) and 13% of them have spatial location attributes. The article proposes Riso-Tree, a generic efficient and scalable indexing framework for spatial entities in graph database management systems. Riso-Tree enables the fast execution of graph queries that involve different types of spatial predicates (GraSp queries). The proposed framework augments the classic R-Tree structure with pre-materialized sub-graph entries. The pruning power of R-Tree is enhanced with the sub-graph information. Riso-Tree partitions the graph into sub-graphs based on their connectivity to the spatial sub-regions. The proposed index allows for the fast execution of GraSp queries by efficiently pruning the traversed vertexes/edges based upon the materialized sub-graph information. The experiments show that the proposed Riso-Tree achieves up to two orders of magnitude faster execution time than its counterparts when executing GraSp queries on real graphs (e.g., Wikidata). The strategy of limiting the size of each sub-graph entry (PNmax) is proposed to reduce the storage overhead of Riso-Tree. The strategy can save up to around 70% storage without harming the query performance according to the experiments. Another strategy is proposed to ensure the performance of the index maintenance (Irrelevant Vertexes Skipping). The experiments show that the strategy can improve performance, especially for slow updates. It proves that Riso-Tree is useful for applications that need to support frequent updates. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Database index; Graph database; Spatial data,Digital storage; Forestry; Graph Databases; Information management; Query processing; Database index; Graph database; Graph information; Non-spatial attributes; R-trees; Side by sides; Spatial data; Spatial entities; Spatial location; Subgraphs; algorithm; database; management practice; pruning; spatial analysis; Decision trees

This has led to the development of distributed spatial streaming systems. Existing systems are using static spatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time streamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are continuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to react to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This article introduces SWARM, a lightweight adaptivity protocol that continuously monitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the spatial data streaming system and redistributes and rebalances the workloads as soon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple query-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can directly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system's workload among its machines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial application. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets illustrate that, on average, SWARM achieves 2 improvement in throughput over a static grid partitioning that is determined based on observing a limited history of the data and query workloads. Moreover, SWARM reduces execution latency on average 4 compared with the other technique. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cluster utilization; Distributed streaming systems; Load balancing; Spatial continuous queries; Spatial stream processing,Resource allocation; Search engines; Spatial distribution; Telecommunication services; Cluster utilization; Continuous queries; Distributed streaming; Distributed streaming system; Load-Balancing; Spatial continuous query; Spatial data; Spatial stream processing; Stream processing; Streaming systems; adaptive management; experimental study; spatial data; spatial distribution; streaming potential; Location based services

We consider a scenario when sensing requests are originated from sensor aware applications that are hosted inside sensor-cloud infrastructures. These requests need to be satisfied using geographically distributed sensors. However, if the sensing resources are mobile, then sensing territory is not limited to a fixed region, rather spatially diverse. In this work, we present a generic scheme for integrating spatio-temporal information of mobile sensors for Internet of Things- (IoT) based environment monitoring system. A set of algorithms are proposed in this work to model spatial and temporal features of mobile resources and exploit resource mobility. We also propose probabilistic models to measure feasibility of a resource to sense a specific spatio-temporal phenomenon. We rank the resources based on their feasibility of satisfying the sensing requests and later use the information for efficient resource allocation and scheduling. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",GPS routes; Route similarity; Sensor cloud; Spatial merge,Cloud infrastructures; Cloud technologies; Distributed sensing; GPS route; Mobile resource; Route similarity; Sensor cloud; Sensor technologies; Spatial merge; Spatio-temporal; environmental monitoring; feasibility study; infrastructure; resource allocation; spatiotemporal analysis; territory; Internet of things
A practical index structure supporting Fréchet proximity queries among trajectories,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119183012&doi=10.1145%2f3460121&partnerID=40&md5=41bbb9ba6655209277d744825c08ebf9,"We present a scalable approach for range and k nearest neighbor queries under computationally expensive metrics, like the continuous Frechet distance on trajectory data. Based on clustering for metric indexes, we obtain a dynamic tree structure whose size is linear in the number of trajectories, regardless of the trajectory's individual sizes or the spatial dimension, which allows one to exploit low ""intrinsic dimensionality""of datasets for effective search space pruning. Since the distance computation is expensive, generic metric indexing methods are rendered impractical. We present strategies that (i) improve on known upper and lower bound computations, (ii) build cluster trees without any or very few distance calls, and (iii) search using bounds for metric pruning, interval orderings for reduction, and randomized pivoting for reporting the final results. We analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods with extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show improvement over state-of-the-art methods for exact queries, and even further speedups are achieved for queries that may return approximate results.

Spatial interpolation techniques on participatory sensing data,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110577756&doi=10.1145%2f3457609&partnerID=40&md5=590fa5e8889d39a79fba16bd6ad8dc2d,"Spatial distributions of data of natural phenomena can be estimated by using different spatial interpolation techniques. These techniques can be used for the purpose of developing urban noise pollution monitoring applications, so they can truly describe the actual urban noise pollution scenario of any region of interest to make effective and informed decisions. In this context, our aim is to use IoT-cloud based framework to generate dynamic (i.e., changes in terms of time and space) noise maps as a service with the help of spatial interpolation techniques. Noise map generation is an effective method for visualizing and assessing urban noise pollution. In this article, we have proposed three spatial interpolation techniques (GLIDW, I-GLIDW, GLIDW-OK) that work on participatory sensing-based noise pollution data collected using smartphones as IoT devices to generate dynamic noise maps. Proposed techniques can address diverse scenarios such as sparse datasets, high accuracy, better response time, and so on. Depending on the situation, we can choose an appropriate technique. We evaluate our proposed methods based on a real-world urban noise pollution dataset collected by participants over a period of two years in an urban area of the city Kolkata. The results are compared with inverse distance weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK) methods. The method GLIDW is proposed for a dense dataset. The results validate that in the case of a dense dataset GLIDW dominates over other methods. But, when the data sparsity level is medium, I-GLIDW performs well. However, if the dataset is very sparse, then GLIDW-OK dominates in terms of predictive accuracy. The results also show that Relative Improvement (RI) of I-GLIDW and GLIDW-OK is always positive compared to baseline methods IDW and OK. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cloud; IoT; Noise pollution monitoring; Participatory sensing; Smartphone; Spatial interpolation,India; Kolkata; West Bengal; Human computer interaction; Image segmentation; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Noise pollution; Smartphones; Interpolation techniques; Inverse distance weighting; Noise map; Noise pollution monitoring; Ordinary kriging; Participatory Sensing; Pollution monitoring; Sensing data; Smart phones; Spatial interpolation; baseline conditions; interpolation; map generalization; noise pollution; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; urban area; Internet of things
Combining Polygon Schematization and Decomposition Approaches for Solving the Cavity Decomposition Problem,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122565827&doi=10.1145%2f3462760&partnerID=40&md5=0082877ec6d64c0354e2c340222811c4,"The cavity decomposition problem is a computational geometry problem, arising in the context of modern electronic CAD systems, that concerns detecting the generation and propagation of electromagnetic noise into multi-layer printed circuit boards. Algorithmically speaking, the problem can be formulated so as to contain, as sub-problems, the well-known polygon schematization and polygon decomposition problems. Given a polygon P and a finite set C of given directions, polygon schematization asks for computing a C-oriented polygon P _ with ""low complexity""and ""high resemblance""to P, whereas polygon decomposition asks for partitioning P into a set of basic polygonal elements (e.g., triangles) whose size is as small as possible. In this article, we present three different solutions for the cavity decomposition problem, which are obtained by suitably combining existing algorithms for polygon schematization and decomposition, by considering different input parameters, and by addressing both methodological and implementation issues. Since it is difficult to compare the three solutions on a theoretical basis, we present an extensive experimental study, employing both real-world and random data, conducted to assess their performance. We rank the proposed solutions according to the results of the experimental evaluation, and provide insights on natural candidates to be adopted, in practice, as modules of modern printed circuit board design software tools, depending on the observed performance and on the different constraints on the desired output.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cavity decomposition problem; Computational geometry; Experimental analysis; Polygon decomposition; Polygon schematization,Computational electromagnetics; Computer aided design; Printed circuit boards; CAD system; Cavity decomposition problem; Decomposition approach; Decomposition problems; Electromagnetic noise; Experimental analysis; Geometry problems; Performance; Polygon decomposition; Polygon schematization; algorithm; decomposition analysis; polygon; spatial analysis; Computational geometry
A Map Inference Approach Using Signal Processing from Crowd-sourced GPS Data,2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100845441&doi=10.1145%2f3431785&partnerID=40&md5=d53e8d50dca56fabe58cf68722a8bb1d,"The amount of GPS data that can be collected is increasing tremendously, thanks to the increased popularity of Global Position System (GPS) devices (e.g., smartphones). This article aims to develop novel methods of converting crowd-sourced GPS traces into road topology maps. We explore map inference using a three-stage approach, which incorporates a novel Multi-source Variable Rate (MSVR) signal reconstruction mechanism. Unlike conventional map inference methods based on map graph theory, our approach, to the best of our knowledge, is the first use of estimation theory for map inference. In particular, our approach addresses the unique challenges of vehicular GPS data. This data is plentiful but suffers from noise in location and variable coverage of regions. This makes it difficult to differentiate between noise and sparsely covered regions when increasing coverage and reducing noise. Due to the asynchronous, variable sampling rate, and often under-sampled nature of the data, our MSVR approach can better handle inherent GPS errors, reconstruct road shapes more accurately, and better deal with variable GPS data density in empirical environments. We evaluated our method for map inference by comparing to Open Street Map maps as ground truth. We use the F-Measure, Precision, and Recall metrics to evaluate our method on Tsinghua University's Beijing Taxi Dataset and Shanghai Jiao Tong University's SUVnet Dataset. On these datasets, we obtained a mean<brk> F-Measure, Precision, and Recall of 0.7212, 0.9165, and 0.6021, respectively, outperforming a well-known method based on Kernel Density Estimation in terms of these evaluation metrics. © 2021 ACM.",GNSS; GPS; image processing; map inference; signal reconstruction,Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai; Crowdsourcing; Graph theory; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Roads and streets; Signal reconstruction; Taxicabs; Estimation theory; Evaluation metrics; Global position systems; Kernel Density Estimation; MAP inferences; Reducing noise; Tsinghua University; Variable sampling rates; GPS; mobile phone; precision; sampling; signal processing; signal-to-noise ratio; topology; urban transport; Global positioning system

In this article, we study the COkNN in obstructed space, which retrieves k obstructed nearest neighbors (ONNs) for every point on a query segment qI.,. The state-of-the-art approach, called <monospace>Euclidean based CONN (E-CONN)</monospace>, exploits an R-tree to traverse the dataset P in ascending order of their Euclidean distances to qI.,. Taking a different point of view, in this article, we explore the idea of Voronoi diagram to define the notion of obstructed Voronoi diagram (OVD). The Voronoi cells with obstacles are divided into visible and invisible regions for quickly answering nearest neighbor queries. To facilitate efficient retrieval of Voronoi cells and processing of continuous nearest neighbor (CONN) queries, we propose a new grid-based index, called Voronoi diagram with Obstacles in Grid (VO-Grid), which indexes Voronoi cells and associated obstacle information with a grid file. Based on VO-Grid, we propose an efficient algorithm, called <monospace>CONN with VO-Grid Acceleration (CONN-VOA)</monospace>, to accelerate the CONN query processing. Moreover, we extend <monospace>CONN-VOA</monospace> to the COkNN query, which also explores effective filtering and early termination for reducing redundant access of data objects. A comprehensive performance evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets is conducted to validate the proposed ideas and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.

Despite the considerable efforts made by a few scientific communities and the relevant results obtained so far, there are still many issues only partially solved that ask for general and quantitative methodologies to be addressed. A prominent aspect of scientific and practical relevance is how to characterize the mobility behavior of individuals. In this article, we look at the problem from a location-centric perspective: We investigate methods to extract, classify, and quantify the symbolic locations specified in telco trajectories and use such measures to feature user mobility. A major contribution is a novel trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations of interest, i.e., attractive, from symbolic trajectories. The method is built on a density-based trajectory segmentation technique tailored to telco data, which is proven to be robust against noise. To inspect the nature of those locations, we combine the two dimensions of location attractiveness and frequency into a novel location taxonomy, which allows for a more accurate classification of the visited places. Another major contribution is the selection of suitable entropy-based metrics for the characterization of single trajectories, based on the diversity of the locations of interest. All these components are integrated in a framework utilized for the analysis of 100,000+ telco trajectories. The experiments show how the framework manages to dramatically reduce data complexity, provide high-quality information on the mobility behavior of people, and finally succeed in grasping the nature of the locations visited by individuals. © 2020 ACM.",Human mobility; location diversity; trajectory segmentation,Ad hoc networks; Trajectories; Entropy based metrics; High quality information; Mobility behavior; Quantitative methodology; Scientific community; Study and applications; Trajectory segmentation; Transportation planning; classification; experimental study; population migration; segmentation; smart city; social network; species diversity; transportation planning; Location

We introduce a novel inverse procedural modeling algorithm for urban areas that addresses the problem of spatial data quality and uncertainty. Our method is fully automatic and produces a 3D approximation of an urban area given satellite imagery and global-scale data, including road network, population, and elevation data. By analyzing the values and the distribution of urban data, e.g., parcels, buildings, population, and elevation, we construct a procedural approximation of a city at a large-scale. Our approach has three main components: (1) procedural model generation to create parcel and building geometries, (2) parcel area estimation that trains neural networks to provide initial parcel sizes for a segmented satellite image of a city block, and (3) an optional optimization that can use partial knowledge of overall average building footprint area and building counts to improve results. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach on cities around the globe with widely different structures and automatically yield procedural models with up to 91,000 buildings, and spanning up to 150 km. We obtain both a spatial arrangement of parcels and buildings similar to ground truth and a distribution of building sizes similar to ground truth, hence yielding a statistically similar synthetic urban space. We produce procedural models at multiple scales, and with less than 1% error in parcel and building areas in the best case as compared to ground truth and 5.8% error on average for tested cities. © 2020 ACM.",3D urban modeling; content creation; deep learning; Procedural modeling; satellite imagery; uncertain spatial data; urban modeling,Buildings; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Inverse problems; Satellite imagery; Uncertainty analysis; Building footprint; Building geometry; Different structure; Procedural modeling; Procedural models; Spatial arrangements; Spatial data acquisition; Spatial data quality; algorithm; automation; data acquisition; data quality; optimization; satellite imagery; spatial data; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; Population statistics

Traditional routing algorithms provide the fastest, shortest, or most ecological route by calculating the lowest-cost path from A to B using an underlying network of weighted connections. Our implementation goes a step further and ranks a set of such routes. The ranking is the result of additional weighing based on governmental data sets, extracts of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database, or periodically adapted extracts ofweb services (e.g., Representational state transfer APIs). The selected data sets and their relative contributions to the overall ranking mechanism can be dynamically adapted by the end-user. Another major contribution toward a fully personalised navigation experience is the implementation of a road scene complexity scoring mechanism. Road complexity is estimated based on the combined input from geospatial data sources, traffic data, sensor analysis, and Street View-based complexity analysis. The latter input source uses Street View images as input for a Densenet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained on buildings using Bag-of-Words and Structure-from-motion features, outputting an image descriptor. The current version uses an adapted version of this network to predict road complexity scores.

We approach this problem for land-cover maps. Given two land-cover maps at two different scales, we want to find a sequence of small incremental changes that gradually transforms one map into the other. We assume that the two input maps consist of polygons, each of which belongs to a given land-cover type. Every polygon on the smaller-scale map is the union of a set of adjacent polygons on the larger-scale map. In each step of the computed sequence, the smallest area is merged with one of its neighbors. We do not select that neighbor according to a prescribed rule but compute the whole sequence of pairwise merges at once, based on global optimization. We have proved that this problem is NP-hard. We formalize this optimization problem as that of finding a shortest path in a (very large) graph. We present the Ag algorithm and integer linear programming to solve this optimization problem. To avoid long computing times, we allow the two methods to return non-optimal results. In addition, we present a greedy algorithm as a benchmark. We tested the three methods with a dataset of the official German topographic database ATKIS.

This metric is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true data-generating point process distribution and the model-generating distribution. We also introduce a theoretically based framework for the cost function to be minimized, a functional T(P) taking as arguments the probability distributions underlying the unknown clusters.

Due to different factors involved in their evolution, road networks exhibit complex structures, which result in problems such as inefficient traffic patterns, congestion, and environmental pollution. The existing metrics of road network analysis are found to be inadequate to reveal the complexity of networks that contributes to such problems. Therefore, we propose a new dimension for the road network analysis using road-types to understand such problems and analyze 57 cities from eight regions around the world: (i) India, (ii) North America, (iii) South America, (iv) Europe, (v) Asia, (vi) China, (vii) Japan, and (viii) Oceania. We define four new metrics: (i) Link Type Distribution, (ii) Link Type Demand, (iii) Preference Cost, and (iv) Type Closeness, for measuring the influence of road-types in the cities concerned. Link type distribution computes the share of each road-type in shortest paths while link type demand measures the type distribution considering the users' preference of road-types. The metric preference cost is defined to measure the additional cost users incur on choosing higher-quality roads and type closeness computes the minimum distance a user needs to travel to reach the preferred road-type. Our analysis shows that, in cities of India, Europe, Asia, China, and Oceania, the primary, secondary, and tertiary roads play a crucial role in the shortest paths in terms of link type distribution as well as link type demand. Also, the involvement of secondary road-type is an important feature among cities from all regions except Japan, where the distribution and demand concentrated in tertiary as well as unclassified types. Cities in North and South American regions provide more importance to residential roads besides the secondary type. In addition to distribution and demand, our analysis shows that the primary, secondary, and tertiary road-types with higher demands suffer from link type deficits while the least demanded types are offered with link type surpluses, which explains one of the reasons for inefficient traffic patterns in congested cities. As far as the additional cost incurred for higher-quality roads is concerned, cities in India and USA provide least preference cost while Chinese and South American cities incur high costs. Among the 57 road networks concerned, Japan shows uniqueness in terms of the proposed metrics due to their inclusion of tertiary and unclassified roads. © 2020 ACM.",complex networks; road networks; Road-types; transportation systems; type closeness; type demand; type dominance,China; Europe; India; Japan; North America; South America; United States; Complex networks; Graph theory; Motor transportation; Additional costs; Complex structure; Environmental pollutions; Important features; Influential factors; Minimum distance; Road network analysis; Type-based analysis; complexity; cost analysis; demand analysis; environmental issue; network analysis; road; road transport; traffic congestion; Roads and streets

Pedestrian counting often requires utilizing manual or technical means to count individuals in each location of interest. However, such methods do not scale to the size of a city and a new approach to fill this gap is here proposed. In this project, we used a large dense dataset of images of New York City along with computer vision techniques to construct a spatiooral map of relative person density. Due to the limitations of state-of-the-art computer vision methods, such automatic detection of person is inherently subject to errors. We model these errors as a probabilistic process, for which we provide theoretical analysis and thorough numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, within our assumptions, our methodology can supply a reasonable estimate of person densities and provide theoretical bounds for the resulting error. © 2020 ACM.",agent-based modelling; Computer vision; objects detection; simulation; urban computing,New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Errors; Large dataset; Urban transportation; Automatic Detection; Business development; Computer vision techniques; Pedestrian density; Probabilistic process; Theoretical bounds; Transportation network; Urban applications; automation; business; computer vision; data set; error analysis; estimation method; image analysis; numerical method; sensor; transportation system; Computer vision

The challenges of accurately predicting urban crowd flows come from both the nonlinear spatialoral correlations of the crowd flow data and the complex impact of the external context factors, such as weather, holidays, and POIs. It is even more challenging for most existing one-step prediction models to make an accurate prediction across multiple future time slots. In this article, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Generative Adversarial Nets model named SeqST-GAN to perform multi-step Spatialoral crowd flow prediction of a city. Motivated by the success of GAN in video prediction, we for the first time propose an adversarial learning framework by regarding the citywide crowd flow data in successive time slots as ""image frames.""Specifically, we first use a Seq2Seq model to generate a sequence of future ""frame""predictions based on previous ones. Then, by integrating the generation error with the adversary loss, SeqST-GAN can avoid the blurry prediction issue and make more accurate predictions. To incorporate the external contexts, an external-context gate module called EC-Gate is also proposed to learn region-level representations of the context features. Experiments on two large crowd flow datasets in New York demonstrate that SeqST-GAN improves the prediction performance by a large margin compared with the existing state-of-the-art. © 2020 ACM.",crowd flow prediction; deep learning; Generative adversarial nets,New York [United States]; United States; Forecasting; Large dataset; Accurate prediction; Adversarial learning; Context features; One-step predictions; Prediction performance; Real applications; Traffic management; Video prediction; accuracy assessment; correlation; data set; error analysis; experimental study; learning; mobility; performance assessment; prediction; traffic management; videography; Predictive analytics
Coupled IGMM-GANs with Applications to Anomaly Detection in Human Mobility Data,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090417391&doi=10.1145%2f3385809&partnerID=40&md5=6e9a78feb694ee53a54d46a84e626f24,"Detecting anomalous activity in human mobility data has a number of applications, including road hazard sensing, telematics-based insurance, and fraud detection in taxi services and ride sharing. In this article, we address two challenges that arise in the study of anomalous human trajectories: (1) a lack of ground truth data on what defines an anomaly and (2) the dependence of existing methods on significant pre-processing and feature engineering. Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) seem like a natural fit for addressing these challenges, we find that existing GAN-based anomaly detection algorithms perform poorly due to their inability to handle multimodal patterns. For this purpose, we introduce an infinite Gaussian mixture model coupled with (bidirectional) GANs-IGMM-GAN-that is able to generate synthetic, yet realistic, human mobility data and simultaneously facilitates multimodal anomaly detection. Through the estimation of a generative probability density on the space of human trajectories, we are able to generate realistic synthetic datasets that can be used to benchmark existing anomaly detection methods. The estimated multimodal density also allows for a natural definition of outlier that we use for detecting anomalous trajectories. We illustrate our methodology and its improvement over existing GAN anomaly detection on several human mobility datasets, along with MNIST. © 2020 ACM.",Bidirectional generative adversarial nets; infinite Gaussian mixture models; Mahalanobis distance; unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution; Motor transportation; Taxicabs; Trajectories; Adversarial networks; Anomalous activity; Anomaly detection methods; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Feature engineerings; Infinite Gaussian mixture models; Probability densities; Synthetic datasets; algorithm; benchmarking; data set; detection method; Gaussian method; mobility; outlier; probability; telemetry; transportation system; Anomaly detection

However, most work has been devoted to pointsets, whereas complex shapes have not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we focus on distance functions between discretized curves in Euclidean space: They appear in a wide range of applications, from road segments and molecular backbones to time-series in general dimension. For ℓp-products of Euclidean metrics, for any constant p, we propose simple and efficient data structures for ANN based on randomized projections: These data structures are of independent interest. Furthermore, they serve to solve proximity questions under a notion of distance between discretized curves, which generalizes both discrete Fréchet and Dynamic Time Warping distance functions. These are two very popular and practical approaches to comparing such curves. We offer, for both approaches, the first data structures and query algorithms for ANN with arbitrarily good approximation factor, at the expense of increasing space usage and preprocessing time over existing methods. Query time complexity is comparable or significantly improved by our methods; our algorithm is especially efficient when the length of the curves is bounded. Finally, we focus on discrete Fréchet distance when the ambient space is high dimensional and derive complexity bounds in terms of doubling dimension as well as an improved approximate near neighbor search. © 2020 ACM.",Approximate nearest neighbor; dynamic time warping; Fréchet distance; polygonal curves,Approximation algorithms; Curves (road); Data structures; Approximate nearest neighbors (ANN); Approximation factor; Computational problem; Doubling dimensions; Dynamic time warping distance; Efficient data structures; Near neighbor searches; Preprocessing time; algorithm; complexity; discrete element method; nearest neighbor analysis; time dependent behavior; time series analysis; Nearest neighbor search
Contrast Pattern Mining in Paired Multivariate Time Series of a Controlled Driving Behavior Experiment,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090400510&doi=10.1145%2f3397272&partnerID=40&md5=52627f41c1d22525345cc0f16fb16f5f,"The controlled experiment is an important scientific method for researchers seeking to determine the influence of the intervention, by interpreting the contrast patterns between the temporal observations from control and experimental groups (i.e., paired multivariate time series (PMTS)). Due to recent technological advances and the growing popularity of sensing technology such as in-vehicle sensors and activity trackers, time series data is experiencing explosive growth in both size and complexity. This is threatening to overwhelm the interpretation of control experiments, which conventionally rely on human analysts. Thus, it is imperative to develop automated methods that are expected to simultaneously characterize and detect the interpretable contrast patterns in PMTS generated by controlled experiments. However, a few challenges prohibit existing methods from directly addressing this problem: (1) handling the coupling of contrast identification and pattern characterization, (2) dynamically characterizing the patterns in PMTS, and (3) mining the contrast patterns in multiple PMTS with ubiquitous individual differences. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to mine interpretable contrast patterns based on the dynamic feature dependencies for PMTS through optimization. The proposed framework simultaneously characterizes the dynamic feature dependency networks for PMTS and detects the contrast patterns. Specifically, we characterize the generative process of PMTS as a probabilistic model defined by pairwise Markov random fields whose likelihoods are maximized using our group graphical lasso. The model is then generalized to handle multiple PMTS and solved by proposing a customized algorithm based on the expectation-maximization framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and interpretability of our approach. © 2020 ACM.",Contrast pattern; controlled experiment; driving behavior; dynamic feature dependency; multivariate time series,Data mining; Image segmentation; Markov processes; Maximum principle; Dynamic feature dependencies; Expectation-Maximization frameworks; Individual Differences; Multivariate time series; Pair-wise markov random fields; Pattern characterizations; Probabilistic modeling; Technological advances; algorithm; automation; complexity; data interpretation; data mining; experimental study; Markov chain; multivariate analysis; sensor; time series analysis; Time series

Such meshes arise in several application domains, such as 3D Geographic Information Systems (GISs), scientific visualization, and finite element analysis. To this aim, we propose Tetrahedral trees, a family of spatial indexes based on a nested space subdivision (an octree or a kD-tree) and defined by several different subdivision criteria. We provide efficient algorithms for spatial and topological queries on Tetrahedral trees and compare to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results indicate that Tetrahedral trees are an improvement over R∗-trees for querying tetrahedral meshes; they are more compact, faster in many queries, and stable at variations of construction thresholds.

Traditionally, ILI surveillance data are updated weekly and provided at a spatially coarse resolution. Producing timely and reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts for ILI is crucial for local preparedness and optimal interventions. We present Theory-guided Deep Learning-based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information (TDEFSI),1 an epidemic forecasting framework that integrates the strengths of deep neural networks and high-resolution simulations of epidemic processes over networks. TDEFSI yields accurate high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts using low-resolution time-series data. During the training phase, TDEFSI uses high-resolution simulations of epidemics that explicitly model spatial and social heterogeneity inherent in urban regions as one component of training data. We train a two-branch recurrent neural network model to take both within-season and between-season low-resolution observations as features and output high-resolution detailed forecasts. The resulting forecasts are not just driven by observed data but also capture the intricate social, demographic, and geographic attributes of specific urban regions and mathematical theories of disease propagation over networks. We focus on forecasting the incidence of ILI and evaluate TDEFSI's performance using synthetic and real-world testing datasets at the state and county levels in the USA. The results show that, at the state level, our method achieves comparable/better performance than several state-of-the-art methods. At the county level, TDEFSI outperforms the other methods.

Recently, an increasing number of sensors installed in parking spaces have provided big spatio-temporal data that be used to analyze parking situations in the city and help parking officers monitor parking violations. The traveling officer problem was customized to formulate a path-finding problem that aims to maximize the probability of catching overstayed cars before they leave. One of the challenges is to extract effective features from the big spatio-temporal data and provide a data-driven solution to replace conventional solutions such as a simple rule-based system or single optimization methods. In this article, we propose a seamless end-to-end learning and optimization framework that combines the long short-term memory auto-encoder neural network, clustering, and path-finding methods to solve the traveling officer problem.

We present a novel application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for modeling and generating human mobility data. We leverage actual ride requests from ride-sharing/hailing services from four major cities to train our GANs model. Our model captures the spatial and temporal variability of the ride request patterns observed for all four cities over a typical week. Previous works have characterized the spatial and temporal properties of human mobility datasets using the fractal dimensionality and the densification power law, respectively, which we utilize to validate our GANs-generated synthetic datasets. We also validate the synthetic datasets using a dynamic vehicle placement application.

SARDINE: A Self-Adaptive Recurrent Deep Incremental Network Model for Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Remote Sensing Data,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085984208&doi=10.1145%2f3380972&partnerID=40&md5=c62620c889e276ad274ceddbbfdaf6a0,"The timely and accurate prediction of remote sensing data is of utmost importance especially in a situation where the predicted data is utilized to provide insights into emerging issues, like environmental nowcasting. Significant research progress can be found to date in devising variants of neural network (NN) models to fulfil this requirement by improving feature extraction and dynamic process representation power. Nevertheless, all these existing NN models are built upon rigid structures that often fail to maintain tradeoff between bias and variance, and consequently, need to spend a lot of time to empirically determine the most appropriate network configuration. This article proposes a self-adaptive recurrent deep incremental network model (SARDINE) which is a novel variant of the deep recurrent neural network with intrinsic capability of self-constructing the network structure in a dynamic and incremental fashion while learning from observed data samples. Moreover, the proposed SARDINE is able to model the spatial feature evolution while scanning the data in a single pass manner, and this further saves significant time when dealing with remote sensing imagery containing millions of pixels. Subsequently, we employ SARDINE in combination with a spatial influence mapping unit to accomplish the prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of predicting a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-5 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite imagery. The experimental result demonstrates that the SARDINE-based prediction is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost. © 2020 ACM.",evolving RNN; incremental model; remote sensing; Spatio-temporal prediction,Forecasting; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Structures (built objects); Incremental networks; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Network configuration; Neural network model; Normalized difference vegetation index datum; Remote sensing imagery; Spatio-temporal prediction; artificial neural network; data assimilation; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; pixel; prediction; remote sensing; sampling bias; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; Terra (satellite); Recurrent neural networks
MapLUR: Exploring a New Paradigm for Estimating Air Pollution Using Deep Learning on Map Images,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085979518&doi=10.1145%2f3380973&partnerID=40&md5=ff1540083259a95183c799f5458ce156,"Land-use regression (LUR) models are important for the assessment of air pollution concentrations in areas without measurement stations. While many such models exist, they often use manually constructed features based on restricted, locally available data. Thus, they are typically hard to reproduce and challenging to adapt to areas beyond those they have been developed for. In this article, we advocate a paradigm shift for LUR models: We propose the Data-driven, Open, Global (DOG) paradigm that entails models based on purely data-driven approaches using only openly and globally available data. Progress within this paradigm will alleviate the need for experts to adapt models to the local characteristics of the available data sources and thus facilitate the generalizability of air pollution models to new areas on a global scale. To illustrate the feasibility of the DOG paradigm for LUR, we introduce a deep-learning model called MapLUR. It is based on a convolutional neural network architecture and is trained exclusively on globally and openly available map data without requiring manual feature engineering. We compare our model to state-of-the-art baselines like linear regression, random forests and multi-layer perceptrons using a large data set of modeled NO2 concentrations in Central London. Our results show that MapLUR significantly outperforms these approaches even though they are provided with manually tailored features. Furthermore, we illustrate that the automatic feature extraction inherent to models based on the DOG paradigm can learn features that are readily interpretable and closely resemble those commonly used in traditional LUR approaches. © 2020 ACM.",air pollution; deep learning; Land-use regression,Air pollution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Land use; Network architecture; Air pollution models; Automatic feature extraction; Data-driven approach; Feature engineerings; Land use regression; Local characteristics; Multi-layer perceptrons; Pollution concentration; artificial neural network; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; data acquisition; data assimilation; data set; geological mapping; land use change; paradigm shift; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; Deep learning

The goal is to find the roads that belong to an interchange, such as the slip roads and the highway roads connected to the slip roads. To go further than state-of-the-art vector-based techniques, this article proposes to use raster-based deep learning techniques to recognize highway interchanges. The contribution of this work is to study how to optimally convert vector data into small images suitable for state-of-the-art deep learning models. Image classification with a convolutional neural network (i.e., is there an interchange in this image or not?) and image segmentation with a u-net (i.e., find the pixels that cover the interchange) are experimented and give better results than existing vector-based techniques in this specific use case (99.5% against 74%). © 2020 ACM.",deep neural networks; highway interchange; map generalization; Spatial data enrichment,Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Image segmentation; Interchanges; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Roads and streets; Vectors; Learning models; Learning techniques; Line features; Road network; Spatial analysis; Spatial data; Spatial database; State of the art; database; image analysis; image classification; pattern recognition; pixel; raster; remote sensing; road; segmentation; spatial data; spatial resolution; vector; Deep learning

Ubiquitous geo-location, localization technology, and availability of big-data-ready computing infrastructure have enabled the development of more sophisticated models to characterize human mobility in urban areas. In this work, our main goal is to extract spatio-temporal features that characterize user mobility and, based on the similarity of these features, identify user communities. To this end, we propose a novel approach that leverages image processing techniques to represent user geographical preferences as images and then apply deep convolutional autoencoders to extract latent spatio-temporal mobility features from these images. These features are then fed to a clustering algorithm that identifies the underlying community structures. We use a diverse urban mobility dataset to validate the proposed framework. Our results show that the proposed framework is able to significantly increase the similarity between intra-community nodes (by up to 107%) as well as dissimilarity between inter-community nodes (up to 54%) when compared against no pre-processing of the datasets, i.e without pre-processing the datasets through any feature fusion method. Moreover, it was also able to reach up to 100% improvement when compared against community identification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results also show that the proposed approach yields significant increase in contact time amongst users belonging to the same community, by up to 80% when compared to the average contact time when not considering community structures, and by up to 150% when compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to consider deep convolutional autoencoding to perform automatic extraction of non-linear spatio-temporal mobility features characterizing individual users from raw mobility datasets with the goal of identifying user communities. © 2020 ACM.",autoencoder; clustering algorithm; convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; geographical preference; human mobility; mobility feature extraction; principal component analysis; T-sne; user community,Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Image processing; Principal component analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Urban planning; Community identification; Community structures; Computing infrastructures; Environmental planning; Feature fusion method; Image processing technique; Localization technologies; Spatio temporal features; algorithm; artificial neural network; data interpretation; environmental planning; geographical knowledge; identification method; image processing; principal component analysis; social mobility; urban planning; Deep learning

The minimum number of bus passengers required to receive priority is obtained using deterministic queueing theory for the two cases of green extension and red truncation. VISSIM simulation software is used to evaluate the performance of the developed TSP approach, comparing it with: existing, unconditional, and no-TSP scenarios. This evaluation assessed performance measures for major streets, crossing streets, and the network level.

MSPs differ from TTS with the core idea of using technology to optimally match riders with drivers, features like ride-sharing and surge pricing, and are not entry-regulated. It is of great significance to understand how MSPs operate and how we can integrate them with TTS for efficient urban mobility. Unfortunately, little is known about MSPs due to limited data revealed by them. In this study, we collect and mine the trajectory data of online drivers who serve Uber (one of the largest MSP) to demystify how Uber drives their drivers. We analyze the trip patterns of different Uber services and reveal their market share, trip metrics, and the spatial distributions of trip origins and destinations.We explore how MSPs improve the driver-rider matching efficiency and empirically validate the enormous efficiency gap between TTS andMSPs. In the end,we debunk the surge price as an instrument to restore driver-rider balance theory and show that drivers choose to chase or avoid the high surge areas depending on various other factors such as traffic congestion, time and location, and availability of alternate travel options as well.

However, it is not always clear which spatial features should be employed, and substantial effort can be invested into designing features that may or may not provide insight.

Efficient DropBox Deployment toward Improving Post-Disaster Information Exchange in a Smart City,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080900275&doi=10.1145%2f3373645&partnerID=40&md5=6639e6ebfab5331965668300deeedf39,"In the face of a disaster, the already installed gadgets in a smart city can be leveraged to gather post-disaster situational information. However, owing to the typical disruption of cellular and Internet connectivity during disasters, the possibility of transmitting situational information using conventional communication infrastructure is almost ruled out. The networking research community has strongly proposed the use of delay tolerant networks (DTN) in such challenged network scenario. In this article, we exploit the movement of volunteers carrying smartphones in such a scenario to form a DTN and propose a utility-based DropBox deployment scheme toward improving post-disaster situational information exchange. In this scheme, Drop-Boxes are deployed across the network at high utility locations. Since the effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be evaluated accurately considering an appropriate post-disaster mobility model suitable for smart cities, we present a human movement model for a post-disaster scenario in a smart city. This movement model is shown to have better performance over other competing movement models in a post-disaster smart city environment. An extensive simulation is performed using ONE simulator to evaluate the comparative performance of the proposed DropBox deployment scheme with some state-of-the-art existing deployment schemes using the presented movement model. Simulation results justify the proposed DropBox deployment scheme improves network performances in terms of delivery ratio, overhead ratio, and average residual energy at the cost of tolerable latency. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Delay tolerant networks; dropbox deployment; human mobility model; post-disaster scenario; smart city,Disasters; Information dissemination; Smart city; Wireless networks; Average residual energy; Communication infrastructure; Comparative performance; dropbox deployment; Extensive simulations; Human mobility; Internet connectivity; Post disasters; artificial neural network; connectivity; disaster; information; infrastructure; networking; numerical model; scenario analysis; simulation; smart city; Delay tolerant networks
Semi-supervised Trajectory Understanding with POI Attention for End-to-End Trip Recommendation,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080904889&doi=10.1145%2f3378890&partnerID=40&md5=7630030d30547ce5e95d8d9bcc7be543,"Trip planning/recommendation is an important task for a plethora of applications in urban settings (e.g., tourism, transportation, social outings), relying on services provided by Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN). To provide greater context-awareness in trajectory planning, LBSNs combine historical trajectories of users for generating various hand-crafted features-e.g., geo-tags of photos taken by tourists and textual characteristics derived from reviews. Those features are used to learn tourists' preferences, which are then used to generate a travel plan recommendation. However, many such features are extracted based on prior knowledge or empirical analysis specific to particular datasets, rendering the corresponding solutions not to be generalizable to diverse data sources. Thus, one important question for managing mobility is how to learn an accurate tour planning model based solely on POI visits or user check-ins and without the efforts of hand-crafted feature engineering. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning in sequence learning, we develop a solution to the tour planning problem based on the semi-supervised learning paradigm. An important aspect of our solution is that it does not involve any feature engineering. Specifically, we propose the Trip Recommendation method via trajectory Encoder and Decoder-a novel end-to-end approach encoding historical trajectories into vectors, while capturing both the intrinsic characteristics of individual POIs and the transition patterns among POIs. We also incorporate historical attention mechanism in our sequence-tosequence trip recommendation task to improve the effectiveness. Experiments conducted on multiple publicly available LBSN datasets demonstrate significantly superior performance of our method. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",attention mechanism; encoder-decoder; recurrent neural networks; semi-supervised learning; Trip recommendation,Decoding; Location based services; Recurrent neural networks; Signal encoding; Trajectories; Urban transportation; Attention mechanisms; Corresponding solutions; Encoder-decoder; Feature engineerings; Intrinsic characteristics; Location-based social networks; Recommendation methods; Trip recommendation; artificial neural network; data set; empirical analysis; knowledge; planning process; supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning
A Social Force Based Pedestrian Motion Model Considering Multi-Pedestrian Interaction with a Vehicle,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080878711&doi=10.1145%2f3373646&partnerID=40&md5=96dd8e27602518b51412ef8da6f2a228,"Pedestrian motionmodeling in mixed traffic scenarios is crucial to the development of autonomous systems in transportation related applications. This work investigated how pedestrian motion is affected by surrounding pedestrians and vehicles, i.e., vehicle-pedestrian interaction. A social force based pedestrian motion model was proposed, in which the effect of surrounding pedestrians was improved and the effect of vehicles was newly designed. Variable constraints dependent on vehicle influence as well as nearby pedestrian density were imposed on the velocity and acceleration of the pedestrian motion. This work focuses on fundamental patterns of multi-pedestrian interaction with a low speed vehicle (front, back, and lateral interaction in open space). In other words, the application of the model is not restricted to specific scenarios such as crosswalks. Parameters of the proposed model were calibrated by the genetic algorithm (GA) based on trajectory data of the same vehicle-pedestrian interaction patterns from controlled experiments. The proposed model is able to simulate complex self-designed vehicle-pedestrian interaction scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed model was validated by comparing the simulated trajectories with ground truth trajectories under the same initial conditions, and by evaluating the pedestrian behavior of avoiding vehicle in the simulation of selfdesigned scenarios. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",genetic algorithm; Pedestrian motion; social force; vehicle-pedestrian interaction,Genetic algorithms; Trajectories; Vehicles; Controlled experiment; Fundamental patterns; Interaction pattern; Lateral interactions; Pedestrian motion; Simulated trajectories; social force; Variable constraints; genetic algorithm; model; modeling; pedestrian; simulation; social movement; Pedestrian safety
Turbo-GTS: A fast framework of optimizing task throughput for large-scale mobile crowdsourcing,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079902739&doi=10.1145%2f3363450&partnerID=40&md5=a2c492d8915d47a5bfab2fda4fe2115d,"In mobile crowdsourcing, workers are financially motivated to perform as many self-selected tasks as possible to maximize their revenue. Unfortunately, the existing task scheduling approaches in mobile crowdsourcing fail to consider task execution duration and do not scale for massive tasks and large geographic areas. In this article, we propose a novel framework, Turbo-GTS, in support of large-scale geo-task scheduling, with the objective of identifying an optimal task assignment for each worker to maximize the total number of tasks that can be completed for an entire worker group, given the geographic locations of each task and each worker. Since the exact solution to the geo-task scheduling problem is computationally intractable, we first propose two sub-optimal approaches (least cost neighbor with particle filtering and non-urgency degree particle filtering with iterative clustering) based on particle filtering and DBSCAN for the single-worker geo-task scheduling problem. We then extend our work to solve the multi-worker geo-task scheduling problem by proposing two space partitioning-based methods (QT-NNH and QT-NUD), which leverage point-region quadtree to ensure workload balancing. The effectiveness and efficiency of the four proposed approximate solutions are verified by our extensive experiments using both real and synthetic data. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed solutions are able to return a higher number of completed tasks for the worker group while reducing the computation cost by up to three orders of magnitude when coping with massive tasks distributed in large geographic areas. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Mobile crowdsourcing; Particle filtering; Quadtree,Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Multitasking; Scheduling algorithms; Approximate solution; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Mobile crowdsourcing; Particle Filtering; Quad trees; State-of-the-art approach; Task scheduling problem; Three orders of magnitude; computer; cost analysis; crowdsourcing; filter; filtration; financial services; optimization; Crowdsourcing

This has encouraged the practice of releasing/publishing trajectory datasets among data owners. However, an ill-informed publication of such rich datasets may have serious privacy implications for individuals. Balancing privacy and utility, as a major goal in the data exchange process, is challenging due to the richness of spatio-temporal datasets. In this article, we focus on an individual's stops as the most sensitive part of the trajectory and aim to preserve them through spatio-temporal perturbation. We model a trajectory as a sequence of stops and moves and propose an efficient algorithm that either substitutes sensitive stop points of a trajectory with moves from the same trajectory or introduces a minimal detour if no safe Point of Interest (POI) can be found on the same route. This hinders the amount of unnecessary distortion, since the footprint of the original trajectory is preserved as much as possible. Our experiments shows that our method balances user privacy and data utility: It protects privacy through preventing an adversary from making inferences about sensitive stops while maintaining a high level of similarity to the original dataset. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Unlike loop controllers that can generally be only used for detection and movement of vehicles, cameras can provide rich information about the traffic behavior. Vision-based frameworks for multiple-object detection, object tracking, and near-miss detection have been developed to derive this information. However, much of this work currently addresses processing videos offline. In this article, we propose an integrated two-stream convolutional networks architecture that performs real-time detection, tracking, and near-accident detection of road users in traffic video data. The two-stream model consists of a spatial stream network for object detection and a temporal stream network to leverage motion features for multiple-object tracking. We detect near-accidents by incorporating appearance features and motion features from these two networks. Further, we demonstrate that our approaches can be executed in real-time and at a frame rate that is higher than the video frame rate on a variety of videos collected from fisheye and overhead cameras. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Using deep learning for big spatial data partitioning,2020,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091328311&doi=10.1145%2f3402126&partnerID=40&md5=2fe26cd30ecdd5600d8163768d570c0c,"This article explores the use of deep learning to choose an appropriate spatial partitioning technique for big data. The exponential increase in the volumes of spatial datasets resulted in the development of big spatial data frameworks. These systems need to partition the data across machines to be able to scale out the computation. Unfortunately, there is no current method to automatically choose an appropriate partitioning technique based on the input data distribution. This article addresses this problem by using deep learning to train a model that captures the relationship between the data distribution and the quality of the partitioning techniques.We propose a solution that runs in two phases, training and application. The offline training phase generates synthetic data based on diverse distributions, partitions them using six different partitioning techniques, and measures their quality using four quality metrics. At the same time, it summarizes the datasets using a histogram and well-designed skewness measures. The data summaries and the quality metrics are then use to train a deep learning model. The second phase uses this model to predict the best partitioning technique given a new dataset that needs to be partitioned.We run an extensive experimental evaluation on big spatial data, andwe experimentally showthe applicability of the proposed technique.We showthat the proposed model outperforms the baseline method in terms of accuracy for choosing the best partitioning technique by only analyzing the summary of the datasets. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Data synopsis; Deep learning; Skewed data; Spatial partitioning,Deep learning; Learning systems; Statistical methods; Baseline methods; Data distribution; Experimental evaluation; Exponential increase; Off-line training; Partitioning techniques; Spatial datasets; Spatial partitioning; automation; baseline survey; computer system; data assimilation; design method; experimental study; qualitative analysis; spatial data; algorithm; computer simulation; data set; machine learning; spatial analysis; Data handling

Regrocket: Scalable multinomial autologistic regression with unordered categorical variables using Markov logic networks,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077793061&doi=10.1145%2f3366459&partnerID=40&md5=36b150e434e4d9d9927064a30ba83762,"Autologistic regression is one of the most popular statistical tools to predict spatial phenomena in several applications, including epidemic diseases detection, species occurrence prediction, earth observation, and business management. In general, autologistic regression divides the space into a two-dimensional grid, where the prediction is performed at each cell in the grid. The prediction at any location is based on a set of predictors (i.e., features) at this location and predictions from neighboring locations. In this article, we address the problem of building efficient autologistic models with multinomial (i.e., categorical) prediction and predictor variables, where the categories represented by these variables are unordered. Unfortunately, existing methods to build autologistic models are designed for binary variables in addition to being computationally expensive (i.e., do not scale up for large-scale grid data such as fine-grained satellite images). Therefore, we introduce RegRocket: a scalable framework to build multinomial autologistic models for predicting large-scale spatial phenomena. RegRocket considers both the accuracy and efficiency aspects when learning the regression model parameters. To this end, RegRocket is built on top of Markov Logic Network (MLN), a scalable statistical learning framework, where its internals and data structures are optimized to process spatial data. RegRocket provides an equivalent representation of the multinomial prediction and predictor variables using MLN where the dependencies between these variables are transformed into first-order logic predicates. Then, RegRocket employs an efficient framework that learns the model parameters from the MLN representation in a distributed manner. Extensive experimental results based on two large real datasets show that RegRocket can build multinomial autologistic models, in minutes, for 1 million grid cells with 0.85 average F1-score. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Autologistic models; Factor graph; First-order logic; Markov logic networks; Multinomial spatial regression,Forecasting; Large dataset; Location; Markov processes; Probabilistic logics; Regression analysis; Statistical mechanics; Categorical variables; Factor graphs; First order logic; Markov logic networks; Predictor variables; Spatial regression; Statistical learning; Two-dimensional grids; business development; detection method; epidemic; graphical method; Markov chain; prediction; regression analysis; satellite imagery; species occurrence; Computer circuits
Stepping stone graph: A graph for finding movement corridors using sparse trajectories,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077800367&doi=10.1145%2f3324883&partnerID=40&md5=957dbc60f52a2e0eb33ac9bffe6fbda7,"There are many real world applications that require identifying public movements such as identifying movement corridors in cities and most popular paths. If one is not given user trajectories but rather sporadic location data, such as location-based social network data, finding movement related information becomes difficult. Rather than processing all points in a dataset given a query, a clever approach is to construct a graph, based on user locations, and query this graph to answer questions such as shortest paths, most popular paths, and movement corridors. Shortest path graph is one of the popular graphs. However, the shortest path graph can be inefficient and ineffective for analysing movement data, as it calculates the graph edges considering the shortest paths over all the points in a dataset. Therefore, edge sets resulting from shortest path graphs are usually very restrictive and not suitable for movement analysis because of its global view of the dataset. We propose the stepping stone graph, which calculates the graph considering point pairs rather than all points; the stepping stone graph focuses on possible local movements, making it both efficient and effective for location-based social network related data. We demonstrate its capabilities by applying it in the Location-Based Social Network domain and comparing with the shortest path graph. We also compare its properties to a range of other graphs and demonstrate how stepping stone graph relates to Gabriel graph, relative neighbourhood graph, and Delaunay triangulation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Graphs; Moving objects; Shortest path,Graphic methods; Location; Query processing; Delau-nay triangulations; Graphs; Location-based social networks; Movement analysis; Moving objects; Neighbourhood graphs; Shortest path; Shortest path graphs; coordinate; data processing; data set; graphical method; information management; movement; social network; trajectory; Graph theory
In-route task selection in spatial crowdsourcingl,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076785532&doi=10.1145%2f3368268&partnerID=40&md5=2ebf187f953873e888e1af1698d86eba,"Consider a city's road network and a worker who is traveling on a given path from a starting point s to a destination d (e.g., from school or work to home) in said network. Consider further that there is a set of tasks in the network available to be performed, where each such task takes a certain amount of time to be completed and yields a positive reward if completed, and, finally, that the worker is willing to deviate from his/her path as long as the travel time to the selected tasks plus the time taken for completing them does not exceed a given time budget. We call this problem the In-Route Task Selection (IRTS) problem and consider two variants thereof. In the first one, named IRTS-SP, we assume that the worker only specifies s and d and he/she wants to consider alternative paths that deviate (cost-wise) as little as possible from the cost of the shortest path connecting s and d. In the second variant, named IRTS-PP, we assume that the worker has a preferred path from s to d and wants to travel along that one path for as long as possible. The latter is practically relevant in cases where the worker has a path other than the shortest one that is more desirable for non-objective reasons, e.g., availability of public transit, bicycle-friendliness or perceived safety. Common to both variants though, we assume that the worker wants to maximize the rewards collected by completing tasks. Clearly, there are now two conflicting criteria for the worker to contemplate when considering which tasks to perform: minimizing path deviation and maximizing collected reward. In this context, we investigate both IRTS variants using the skyline paradigm in order to obtain the set of non-dominated solutions w.r.t. the tradeoffs between earned rewards and deviation from either the cost of the shortest path, in the case of IRTSSP, or the actual preferred path, in the case of IRTS-PP. Returning the skyline set of solutions to workers is of practical interest as it empowers them, e.g., it allows them to decide, at query time, which tasks suit them better. We propose exact and heuristic approaches in order to solve both variants of the IRTS problem. Our experiments, using real city-scale datasets, show that while the exact approaches serve as benchmarks, they do not scale due to the NP-hardness of the problems. The overall best heuristic approach, on the other hand, can solve relatively large instances of the IRTS problems within practical query processing time, e.g., at par with less effective greedy heuristics, while still producing very good approximate skyline sets, e.g., often yielding less than 10% relative error w.r.t. the exact solution. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",In-route queries; Road networks; Skyline; Spatial crowdsourcing,Budget control; Graph theory; Heuristic methods; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Sporting goods; Traffic control; Alternative path; Greedy heuristics; Heuristic approach; Nondominated solutions; Relative errors; Road network; Route queries; Skyline; experimental study; heuristics; road transport; routing; travel behavior; travel time; Travel time

These data constitute a rich representation of entities' whereabouts and behavior as they move on the map. Although several studies reported considerable predictability of such mobility patterns, several factors may impose significant changes on moving behavior. Being able to detect these changes can benefit several applications. In this article, we formalize and address the problem of detecting mobility drifts in mobility patterns. This problem is particularly challenging due to the noisy and incomplete nature of the data. We design non-parametric tests and present two algorithms to detect mobility drifts when the putative drift point is known in advance and there is no previous knowledge about the existence of potential changes, and we need to search for the most likely drift point rigorously. To evaluate our algorithms, we perform an extensive experimental study with real-world data coming from a variety of scenarios, such as geo-tagged social media data and GPS traces of connected vehicles. The results show the effectiveness of our algorithms, being able to identify existing drift points on spatial mobility patterns correctly. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Geo-tagged social media data; GPS traces; Mobility drift detection; Mobility patterns; Spatial behavior,Digital storage; Social networking (online); GPS traces; Location-aware informations; Mobility pattern; Moving behavior; Non-parametric test; Potential change; Social media datum; Spatial behaviors; algorithm; experimental study; GPS; social media; spatiotemporal analysis; Pattern recognition
Activity-Aware ridesharing group trip planning queries for flexible pois,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075630876&doi=10.1145%2f3341818&partnerID=40&md5=951333d84e24627b887f974e7bba054e,"In recent years, ridesharing has become a popular model that enables users to share their rides with others. In this article, we introduce a novel ridesharing service, an Activity-Aware Ridesharing Group Trip Planning (ARGTP) query, in road networks that exhibits three novel features: (i) ensures a complete trip for visiting more than two locations, (ii) allows visiting both fixed and flexible locations, and (iii) provides true ridesharing services instead of taxilike ridesourcing services by matching a group of riders' flexible trips with a driver's fixed trip. A trip visits a point-of-interest (POI) like a bank, restaurant, or supermarket for an activity in between source and destination locations. In a fixed trip, the POI is predetermined (e.g., a specific branch of a bank) and in a flexible trip, the POI is a flexible one (e.g., any branch of a bank). Considering the spatial proximity of the riders' trips with a driver's trip, an ARGTP query returns an optimal ridesharing group that minimizes the group cost. We develop the first solution to process ARGTP queries in real time and extend our solution for generalized ARGTP queries with multiple POIs. The efficiency of ARGTP query processing algorithms depends on the number of candidate riders and POIs to be explored. We introduce novel pruning techniques to refine the riders and POI search space. We perform extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms two baseline approaches with a large margin. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Flexibility; Group trip planning; Ridesharing; Spatial databases,Efficiency; Large dataset; Destination location; Flexibility; Pruning techniques; Query processing algorithms; Ride-sharing; Spatial database; Trip planning; Trip planning queries; cost analysis; database; marketing; public attitude; real time; spatial analysis; transportation mode; travel behavior; Location
Flood-risk analysis on terrains under the multiflow-direction model,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072544694&doi=10.1145%2f3340707&partnerID=40&md5=e9b7d35f58560a222e1d7ce1f6c91452,"An important problem in terrain analysis is modeling how water flows across a terrain and creates floods by filling up depressions. In this article, we study a number of flood-risk related problems: Given a terrain Σ, represented as a triangulated xy-monotone surface with n vertices, a rain distribution R, and a volume of rain ψ, determine which portions of Σ are flooded. We develop efficient algorithms for flood-risk analysis under the multiflow-directions (MFD) model, in which water at a point can flow along multiple downslope edges and which more accurately represent flooding events. We present three main results: First, we present an O (n log n)-time algorithm to answer a terrain-flood query: if it rains a volume ψ according to a rain distribution R, determine what regions of Σ will be flooded. Second, we present a O (n log n + nm)-time algorithm for preprocessing Σ containing m sinks into a data structure of size O (nm) for answering point-flood queries: Given a rain distribution R, a volume of rain ψ falling according to R, and point q ∈ Σ, determine whether q will be flooded. A point-flood query can be answered in O (|R |k + k2 ) time, where k is the number of maximal depressions in Σ containing the query point q and |R | is the number of vertices in R with positive rainfall. Finally, we present algorithms for answering a flood-time query: given a rain distribution R and a point q ∈ Σ, determine the volume of rain that must fall before q is flooded. Assuming that the product of two k × k matrices can be computed in O (kω ) time, we show that a flood-time query can be answered in O (nk + kω ) time. We also give an α -approximation algorithm, for α > 1, which runs in O (n log n logα ρ)-time, where ρ is a variable on the terrain that depends on the ratio between depression volumes. We implemented our algorithms for computing terrain and point-flood queries as well as approximate flood-time queries. We tested the efficacy and efficiency of these algorithms on three real terrains of different types (urban, suburban, and mountainous.) © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Data-driven Framework for Long-Range Aircraft Conflict Detection and Resolution,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072532354&doi=10.1145%2f3328832&partnerID=40&md5=a85d28515760fa926ead4b468d043a6d,"At the present time, there is no mechanism for Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to probe new flight plans filed by the Airlines Operation Centers (AOCs) against the existing approved flight plans to see if they are likely to cause conflicts or bring sector traffic densities beyond control. In the current Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, aircraft conflicts and sector traffic densities are resolved tactically, increasing workload and leading to potential safety risks and loss of capacity and efficiency. We propose a novel Data-driven Framework to address a long-range aircraft conflict detection and resolution (CDR) problem. Given a set of predicted trajectories, the framework declares a conflict when a protected zone of an aircraft on its trajectory is infringed upon by another aircraft. The framework resolves the conflict by prescribing an alternative solution that is optimized by perturbing at least one of the trajectories involved in the conflict. To achieve this, the framework learns from descriptive patterns of historical trajectories and pertinent weather observations and builds a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Using a variant of the Viterbi algorithm, the framework avoids the airspace volume in which the conflict is detected and generates a new optimal trajectory that is conflict free. The key concept upon which the framework is built is the assumption that the airspace is nothing more than a horizontally and vertically concatenated set of spatio-temporal data cubes where each cube is considered as an atomic unit. We evaluate our framework using real trajectory datasets with pertinent weather observations from two continents and demonstrate its effectiveness for strategic CDR. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Air traffic management; And Phrases: Aircraft conflict detection and resolution; Hidden Markov model; Prescriptive analytics; Time series,Air navigation; Air traffic control; Air transportation; Aircraft; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Hidden Markov models; Time series; Trajectories; Viterbi algorithm; Air navigation service providers; Air traffic control (ATC); Air Traffic Management; Aircraft conflict detection; Alternative solutions; Prescriptive analytics; Spatio-temporal data; Weather observations; air traffic; air traffic control; aircraft; conflict management; detection method; Markov chain; probe; risk assessment; time series; trajectory; Aircraft detection

LOOM proceeds in three stages: (1) construct a line graph, where edges correspond to network segments with the same set of lines following the same course; (2) apply a set of local transformation rules that compute an optimal partial ordering of the lines and speed up the next stage; (3) construct an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that yields a line ordering for each edge and minimizes the total number of line crossings and line separations; and (4) based on the line graph and the computed line ordering, draw the map. As our maps respect the geography of the transit network, they can be used as overlays in typical map services. Previous research either did not take the network geography into account or was only concerned with schematic metro map layouting. We evaluate LOOM on six real-world transit networks, with line-ordering search-space sizes up to 2 × 10267. Using our transformation rules and an improved ILP formulation, we compute optimal line orderings in a fraction of a second for all networks. This enables interactive use of our method in map editors. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We present an algorithm to compute the expected value of location data from a user, without access to the specific coordinates of the location data point. We use decision-theoretic techniques to provide a principled way for a potential buyer to make purchasing decisions about private user location data. We illustrate our approach in three scenarios: the delivery of targeted ads specific to a user’s home location, the estimation of traffic speed, and location prediction.

Our method uses a decay function that allows network topology and attribute information associated with that topology (geographic or otherwise) to guide generalizations of the activity patterns and model learning process. This allows the system to recognize when two routes within a network are similar, even when those routes share little explicit path information.We demonstrate this method's robust ability to distinguish between fundamentally different behaviors, even when data are both incomplete and subject to noise. The results show good performance when matching behaviors on different sized and attributed synthetic networks, as well as on a real-world road network; it examines situations in which observed entity behavior is noisy, as well as situations in which observed behaviors differ from learned models as a result of systemic noise in the underlying network.

Trip planning and scheduling for groups, an important class of location-based services (LBSs), have recently received attention from researchers. However, both group trip planning (GTP) and group trip scheduling (GTS) queries have restrictions: A GTP query assumes that all group members visit all required POIs together, whereas a GTS query requires that each POI is visited by a single group member. A GGTS query is more general and allows any number of group members to visit a POI together. We propose an efficient algorithm to evaluate the exact answers for GGTS queries in road networks. Since finding the answer for a GGTS query is an NP-hard problem, to reduce the processing overhead for a large group size or a large number of required POI types or a large POI dataset, we propose two heuristic solutions-trip-scheduling heuristic (TSH) and search region refinement heuristic (SRH)-for processing GGTS queries. Extensive experiments with real datasets show that our optimal algorithm is preferable for small parameter settings, and the heuristic solutions reduce the processing overhead significantly in return for sacrificing the accuracy slightly. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Generalized group trip scheduling; Group trip planning; Group trip scheduling; Points of interests; Road networks,Computational complexity; Cost reduction; Large dataset; Location based services; Roads and streets; Scheduling; Telecommunication services; Efficient scheduling; Heuristic solutions; Parameter setting; Points of interest; Processing overhead; Road network; Trip planning; Trip scheduling; algorithm; experimental study; research work; road; travel behavior; Query processing

Detecting the road closures and traffic rule changes is essential for dynamic route planning and navigation serving. In this article, we propose a driving-behavior modeling-based method for accurately and effectively detecting the road anomalies. In the first step, we detect the areas of anomalies by using the deviation between drivers' actual and expected behaviors. To discover the cause of anomalies, we explore the drivers' short-term destination and find the crucial link pairs in anomalous areas through a novel optimized link entanglement search algorithm, namely, the Select Link Entanglements (SELES) algorithm. Finally, we analyze the crowd's driving patterns to explain the road network anomalies further.

However, crowd mobility is a relatively new area of research and has significant technical challenges: Lack of large-scale fine-grained data, difficulties in large-scale trajectory processing, and issues with spatial resolution. In this article, we propose a novel approach for analyzing crowd mobility on a ""city block"" level. We first propose algorithms to detect homes, working places, and stay regions for individual user trajectories. Next, we propose a method for analyzing commute patterns and spatial correlation at a city block level. Using mobile cellular accessing trace data collected from users in Shanghai, we discover commute patterns, spatial correlation rules, as well as a hidden structure of the city based on crowd mobility analysis.

Existing formulations model mobility-on-demand systems in a queuing theoretical, network flow-based, or continuous, kinematic framework. In this work, we model a mobility-on-demand system as a stochastic differential equation that represents a generalization of previous approaches. Based on the model, we define system imbalance as the difference of the stochastic processes of service request arrival and vehicle arrival. We formally derive the first moment of the system imbalance for an imbalance control strategy that consists of a feedforward control approach (reference trajectory) and an additional feedback component. A distributed feedback control policy is defined that averages the imbalance across the system and therefore aims at a uniform quality of service distribution.

Crowd replication: Sensing-Assisted quantification of human behavior in public spaces,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070686512&doi=10.1145%2f3317666&partnerID=40&md5=763e48c5725849000f624916a2690bdd,"A central challenge for public space design is to evaluate whether a given space promotes different types of activities. In this article, as our first contribution, we develop crowd replication as a novel sensor-Assisted method for quantifying human behavior within public spaces. In crowd replication, a researcher is tasked with recording the behavior of people using a space while being instrumented with a mobile device that captures a sensor trace of the replicated movements and activities. Through mathematical modeling, behavioral indicators extracted from the replicated trajectories can be extrapolated to represent a larger target population. As our second contribution, we develop a novel highly accurate pedestrian sensing solution for reconstructing movement trajectories from sensor traces captured during the replication process. Our key insight is to tailor sensing to characteristics of the researcher performing replication, which allows reconstruction to operate robustly against variations in pace and other walking characteristics. We validate crowd replication through a case study carried out within a representative example of a metropolitan-scale public space. Our results show that crowd-replicated data closely mirrors human dynamics in public spaces and reduces overall data collection effort while producing high-quality indicators about behaviors and activities of people within the space. We also validate our pedestrian modeling approach through extensive benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach can reconstruct movement trajectories with high accuracy and robustness (median error below 1%). Finally, we demonstrate that our contributions enable capturing detailed indicators of liveliness, extent of social interaction, and other factors indicative of public space quality. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Crowd replication; Evaluation; Mobile sensing; Motion sensing; Pedestrian modeling; Public spaces; Urban computing,Trajectories; Crowd replication; Evaluation; Mobile sensing; Motion sensing; Pedestrian models; Public space; Urban computing; human behavior; modeling; movement; pedestrian; public space; quantitative analysis; urban area; walking; Behavioral research

However, many important real-Time applications rely on the continuous availability of stream values, e.g., to monitor traffic flow, resource usage, weather phenomena, and so on. Other non real-Time applications that support continuous or offline historical analytics also require high quality data to avoid producing misleading output such as false positives, erroneous conclusions, and decisions. In this article, we study the problem of smoothing streams produced by an overlay of sensors. We present nonparametric (data-driven, distribution free) statistical methods to provide an uninterrupted stream of highquality spatiotemporal data to real-Time applications, even when the raw stream suffers data quality issues, such as noise ormissing values. Our novel family of robustmethods computes smoothed values (SVs) that could be used as proxies for data of questionable quality. The methods make use of a partition of the monitored area into cells to compute SVs based on historical data and the deviation from normalcy in neighboring spatial cells in a way that outperforms standard regression or interpolation. Our methods use incremental computation for efficiency, and they differ in how the deviations are normalized, e.g., with respect to zeroth-order, firstorder, and second-order moments. We use three real data sets to run a suite of experiments and empirically demonstrate the superiority of the method that uses normalization with respect to variability. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Data quality; Residuals; Smoothing; Spatial sensors; Spatiotemporal streams,Data quality; Residuals; Smoothing; Spatial sensors; Spatiotemporal streams; data quality; data set; sensor; smoothing; spatiotemporal analysis

Such many-To-many shortest path computations are an essential and computationally expensive part of many emerging applications that involve map matching of imprecise trajectories. Existing solutions to this problem mostly conform to the obvious approach of performing a single-source shortest path computation for each source node. We present an algorithm that exploits the clustered nature of the source nodes. Specifically, we rely on the observation that paths originating from a cluster of nodes typically exit the source region's boundary through a small number of nodes. Evaluations on a real road network show that the proposed algorithm provides a speed-up of several times over the conventional approach when the source nodes are densely clustered in a region. We also demonstrate that the presented technique is capable of substantially accelerating map matching of sparse and noisy trajectories. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Many-To-many shortest paths; Map matching; Speed-up technique,Conventional approach; Emerging applications; Map matching; Shortest path; Shortest path computations; Single source shortest paths; Speed-up techniques; Transportation network; algorithm; detection method; map; transportation; Graph theory

Its goal is to assign every fine-grain location (i.e., POIs) that a user actually visited, which we call visited-POI, to the corresponding span of his or her (personal) GPS trajectories. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve this assignment task. First, we exhaustively extract stay-points as span candidates of visits using a variant of a conventional stay-point extraction method and then extract POIs that are located close to the extracted stay-points as visited-POI candidates. Then, we simultaneously predict which stay-points and POIs can be actual user visits by considering various aspects, which we formulate as integer linear programming. Experimental results conducted on a real user dataset show that our method achieves higher accuracy in the visited-POI assignment task than the various cascaded procedures of conventional methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",GPS trajectory; Integer linear programming; Point of interest; Spatial-Temporal mining,Data mining; Integer programming; Trajectories; Conventional methods; Gps trajectories; Human behavior analysis; Integer Linear Programming; Point extraction; Point of interest; Points of interest; Spatial temporals; algorithm; data mining; experimental study; extraction method; GPS; human behavior; linear programing; numerical method; satellite data; trajectory; Behavioral research
Spatial auto-regressive dependency interpretable learning based on spatial topological constraints,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070694457&doi=10.1145%2f3339823&partnerID=40&md5=f8109695ac22198e23243121d632c843,"Spatial regression models are widely used in numerous areas, including detecting and predicting traffic volume, air pollution, and housing prices. Unlike conventional regression models, which commonly assume independent and identical distributions among observations, existing spatial regression requires the prior knowledge of spatial dependency among the observations in different spatial locations. Such a spatial dependency is typically predefined by domain experts or heuristics. However, without sufficient consideration on the context of the specific prediction task, it is prohibitively difficult for one to pre-define the numerical values of the spatial dependency without bias. More importantly, in many situations, the existing techniques are insufficient to sense the complete connectivity and topological patterns among spatial locations (e.g., in underground water networks and human brain networks). Until now, these issues have been extremely difficult to address and little attention has been paid to the automatic optimization of spatial dependency in relation to a prediction task, due to three challenges: (1) necessity and complexity of modeling the spatial topological constraints; (2) incomplete prior spatial knowledge; and (3) difficulty in optimizing under spatial topological constraints that are usually discrete or nonconvex. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel convex framework that automatically jointly learns the prediction mapping and spatial dependency based on spatial topological constraints. There are two different scenarios to be addressed. First, when the prior knowledge on existence of conditional independence among spatial locations is known (e.g., via spatial contiguity), we propose the first model named Spatial-Autoregressive Dependency Learning I (SADL-I) to further quantify such spatial dependency. However, when the knowledge on the conditional independence is unknown or incomplete, our second model named Spatial-Autoregressive Dependency Learning II (SADL-II) is proposed to automatically learn the conditional independence pattern as well as quantify the numerical values of the spatial dependency based on spatial topological constraints. Topological constraints are usually discrete and nonconvex, which makes them extremely difficult to be optimized together with continuous optimization problems of spatial regression. To address this, we propose a convex and continuous equivalence of the original discrete topological constraints with a theoretical guarantee. The proposed models are then transferred to convex problems that can be iteratively optimized by our new efficient algorithms until convergence to a global optimal solution. Extensive experimentation using several real-world datasets demonstrates the outstanding performance of the proposed models.

Regrets in routing networks: Measuring the impact of routing apps in traffic,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069902178&doi=10.1145%2f3325916&partnerID=40&md5=cae1072cfff4f7282fb33d046990f110,"The impact of the recent increase in routing apps usage on road traffic remains uncertain to this day. The article introduces, for the first time, a criterion to evaluate a distance between an observed state of traffic and the user equilibrium of the traffic assignment: the average marginal regret. The average marginal regret provides a quantitative measure of the impact of routing apps on traffic using only link flows, link travel times, and travel demand. In non-atomic routing games (or static traffic assignment models), the average marginal regret is a measure of selfish drivers' behaviors. Unlike the price of anarchy, the average marginal regret in the routing game can be computed in polynomial time without any knowledge of user equilibria and socially optimal states of traffic. First, this article demonstrates on a small example that the average marginal regret is more appropriate to define proximity between an observed state of traffic and an user equilibrium state of traffic than comparing flows, travel times, or total cost. Then, experiments on two different models of app usage and three networks (including the whole L.A. network with more than 50,000 nodes) demonstrate that the average marginal regret decreases with an increase of app usage. Sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium state with respect to the app usage ratio proves that the average marginal regret monotonically decreases to 0 with an increase of app usage. Finally, using a toy example, the article concludes that app usage could become the new Braess paradox. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Navigonational GPS routing applications; Network flows; Regret; Routing games,Polynomial approximation; Sensitivity analysis; Traffic control; Travel time; Equilibrium state; Link travel time; Network flows; Quantitative measures; Regret; Routing games; Static traffic assignments; Traffic assignment; GPS; knowledge; measurement method; navigation; road traffic; routing; Network routing

Apache Spark is one such open source framework that is enjoying widespread adoption. Within this data space, it is important to note that most of the observational data (i.e., data collected by sensors, either moving or stationary) has a temporal component or timestamp. To perform advanced analytics and gain insights, the temporal component becomes equally important as the spatial and attribute components. In this article, we detail several variants of a spatial join operation that addresses both spatial, temporal, and attribute-based joins. Our spatial join technique differs from other approaches in that it combines spatial, temporal, and attribute predicates in the join operator. In addition, our spatio-temporal join algorithm and implementation differs from others in that it runs in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) application. The users of this functionality are assumed to be GIS analysts with little if any knowledge of the implementation details of spatio-temporal joins or distributed processing. They are comfortable using simple tools that do not provide the ability to tweak the configuration of the algorithm or processing environment. The spatio-temporal join algorithm behind the tool must always succeed, regardless of input data parameters (e.g., it can be highly irregularly distributed, contain large numbers of coincident points, it can be extremely large, etc.). These factors combine to place additional requirements on the algorithm that are uncommonly found in the traditional research environment.

As its benefits became more evident, and obstacles, e.g., lack of liability legislation, that may hinder its larger scale adoption are being overcome, ride-sharing will be a more common mode of transportation. In particular, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are showing their proficiency on the roads, which may also catalyze ride-sharing ubiquity. For example, while an AV owner is at work, he may find it appealing to offer his AV as a service or rent it to Uber so that the vehicle serves others' transportation requests. Furthermore, this disruptive technology is backed up by companies like Google (Waymo), Tesla, and Uber. Therefore, ride-sharing will soon become a source of traffic congestion itself. In this article, we present an efficient congestion-aware ride-sharing algorithm which, instead of finding optimal travel plans based on traffic load generated by other means of transportation, it computes optimal travel plans for thousands of ride-sharing requests within a time interval. Note that in this problem, an optimal travel plan for a group of requests may affect an already computed travel plan for another concurrent group of requests, therefore plans cannot be isolated from each other. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Ride-sharing; Spatial databases; Static traffic assignment; Steiner trees,Autonomous vehicles; Laws and legislation; Disruptive technology; Means of transportations; Private vehicles; Ride-sharing; Spatial database; Static traffic assignments; Steiner trees; Transportation mode; algorithm; congestion; database; road traffic; road transport; spatial data; traffic congestion; transportation mode; Traffic congestion

With the increase in volume and precision, point cloud data offers a useful source of information for natural-resource management, urban planning, self-driving cars, and more. At the same time, on the scale that point cloud data is produced, management challenges are introduced: it is important to achieve efficiency both in terms of querying performance and space requirements. Traditional file-based solutions to point cloud management offer space efficiency, however, they cannot scale to such massive data and provide the declarative power of a DBMS. In this article, we propose a time- and space-efficient solution to storing and managing point cloud data in main memory column-store DBMS. Our solution, Space-Filling Curve Dictionary-Based Compression (SFC-DBC), employs dictionary-based compression in the spatial data management domain and enhances it with indexing capabilities by using space-filling curves. SFC-DBC does so by constructing the space-filling curve over a compressed, artificially introduced dictionary space. Consequently, SFC-DBC significantly optimizes query execution and yet does not require additional storage resources, compared to traditional dictionary-based compression. With respect to space-filling-curve-based approaches, it minimizes storage footprint and increases resilience to skew. As a proof of concept, we develop and evaluate our approach as a research prototype in the context of SAP HANA. SFC-DBC outperforms other dictionary-based compression schemes by up to 61% in terms of space and up to 9.4× in terms of query performance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Data compression; Multidimensional data access methods; Point cloud; Spatial data management,Data acquisition; Data compression; Data handling; Database systems; Digital storage; Efficiency; Filling; Natural resources management; Dictionary compression; Dictionary-based compressions; Management challenges; Multidimensional data; Natural resource management; Point cloud; Processing technologies; Spatial data management; data acquisition; data management; data processing; data set; image processing; lidar; methodology; spatial data; Information management
Flood risk analysis on terrains,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068105490&doi=10.1145%2f3295459&partnerID=40&md5=021d17794cc375a93ed6c266ec880dd5,"An important problem in terrain analysis is modeling how water flows across a terrain and creates floods by filling up depressions. In this article, we study the flooding query problem: Preprocess a given terrain Σ, represented as a triangulated xy-monotone surface with n vertices, into a data structure so that for a query rain region R and a query point q on Σ, one can quickly determine how much rain has to fall in R so that q is flooded. Available terrain data is often subject to uncertainty, which must be incorporated into the terrain analysis. For instance, the digital elevation models of terrains have to be refined to incorporate underground pipes, tunnels, and waterways under bridges, but there is often uncertainty in their existence. By representing the uncertainty in the terrain data explicitly, we can develop methods for flood risk analysis that properly incorporate terrain uncertainty when reporting what areas are at risk of flooding. We present two results. First, we present an O(n log n)-time algorithm for preprocessing Σ with a linear-size data structure that can answer a flooding query in O(|R| + m log n) time, where |R| is the number of vertices in R, m is the number of so-called tributaries of q at which rain is falling, and n is the number of vertices of the terrain. Next, we extend this data structure to handle “uncertain” terrains using a standard Monte Carlo method. Given a probability distribution on terrain data, our data structure returns the probability of a query point being flooded if a specified amount of rain falls on a query region. We implement our data structure and test it on real terrains, showing that a small number of samples suffice to accurately estimate the flood risk. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Personalized travel time prediction using a small number of probe vehicles,2019,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066098641&doi=10.1145%2f3317663&partnerID=40&md5=4e24280d1420586fe6881e0c43d69029,"Predicting the travel time of a path is an important task in route planning and navigation applications. As more GPS probe data has been collected to monitor urban traffic, GPS trajectories of the probe vehicles have been frequently used to predict path travel time. However, most trajectory-based methods rely on deploying GPS devices and collect real-time data on a large taxi fleet, which can be expensive and unreliable in smaller cities. This work deals with the problem of predicting path travel time when only a small number of cars are available. We propose an algorithm that learns local congestion patterns of a compact set of frequently shared paths from historical data. Given a travel time prediction query, we identify the current congestion patterns around the query path from recent trajectories, then infer its travel time in the near future. Driver identities are also used in predicting personalized travel time. Experimental results using 10-25 taxis in urban areas of Shenzhen, China, show that personal prediction has on average 3.4mins of error on trips of duration 10-75mins. This result improves the baseline approach of using purely historical trajectories by 16.8% on average, over four regions with various degrees of path regularity. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art travel time prediction method that uses both historical trajectories and real-time trajectories. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",GPS trajectories; Mobile sensors; Travel time prediction,China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Fleet operations; Forecasting; Probes; Taxicabs; Time varying control systems; Traffic congestion; Trajectories; Urban planning; Driver identities; Gps trajectories; Mobile sensors; Path regularities; Real-time trajectories; State of the art; Trajectory-based; Travel time prediction; algorithm; GPS; prediction; probe; sensor; traffic congestion; transport vehicle; transportation planning; travel time; urban area; urban transport; Travel time
2D vector map fragile watermarking with region location,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054031366&doi=10.1145%2f3239163&partnerID=40&md5=b02619472590e19cde2c1dd69c0c484b,"Locating the original region of tampered features is a challenging task for existing 2D vector map fragile watermarking methods. This article presents a 2D vector map fragile watermarking framework that locates not only the current but also the original region of tampered feature groups. In particular, we propose dividing the features of the host vector map into groups, and embedding a watermark consisting of location-bits and check-bits into each group at the sender side. At the receiver side, by comparing the extracted and calculated check-bits, one can identify tampered groups and locate their current regions. Then the location-bits extracted from the mapping groups are used to indicate the original regions of the tampered groups. To demonstrate and analyze the applicability of this framework, we instantiate it by proposing a simulated annealing (SA)-based group division method, a group mapping method, a minimum encasing rectangle (MER) based location-bits generation method and a check-bits generation method, and use an existing reversible data hiding method for watermark embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can locate all the regions influenced by tampering, and the SA-based group division method can get a better region location ability. © 2018 ACM.",2D vector map; Authentication; Fragile watermarking; Region location; Tamper detection,Authentication; Mapping; Simulated annealing; Vectors; Watermarking; Fragile watermarking; Generation method; Group division method; Region location; Reversible data hiding; Tamper detection; Vector maps; Watermark embedding; Location
Hierarchical spatial aggregation for level-of-detail visualization of 3D thematic data,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054026963&doi=10.1145%2f3234506&partnerID=40&md5=38b3f51c33c5c5d81f861cb843ebf50b,"Thematic maps are a common tool to visualize semantic data with a spatial reference. Combining thematic data with a geometric representation of their natural reference frame aids the viewer's ability in gaining an overview, as well as perceiving patterns with respect to location; however, as the amount of data for visualization continues to increase, problems such as information overload and visual clutter impede perception, requiring data aggregation and level-of-detail visualization techniques. While existing aggregation techniques for thematic data operate in a 2D reference frame (i.e., map), we present two aggregation techniques for 3D spatial and spatiotemporal data mapped onto virtual city models that hierarchically aggregate thematic data in real time during rendering to support on-the-fly and on-demand level-of-detail generation. An object-based technique performs aggregation based on scene-specific objects and their hierarchy to facilitate per-object analysis, while the scene-based technique aggregates data solely based on spatial locations, thus supporting visual analysis of data with arbitrary reference geometry. Both techniques can apply different aggregation functions (mean, minimum, and maximum) for ordinal, interval, and ratio-scaled data and can be easily extended with additional functions. Our implementation utilizes the programmable graphics pipeline and requires suitably encoded data, i.e., textures or vertex attributes. We demonstrate the application of both techniques using real-world datasets, including solar potential analyses and the propagation of pressure waves in a virtual city model. © 2018 ACM.",Level-of-detail visualization; Real-time rendering; Spatial aggregation,Aggregates; Maps; Rendering (computer graphics); Semantics; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Aggregation functions; Aggregation techniques; Geometric representation; Information overloads; Level of detail; Real-time rendering; Spatial aggregation; Visualization technique; Data visualization

These ASes connect to each other in different forms to enable the ""global"" Internet communication. In this study, we investigate the geographical characteristics of the visible Internet as well as examine the relation between geography and intra-AS and inter-AS routing policies. We show that the ingress-to-egress subpaths have lower circuitousness compared to the end-to-end paths. Our findings not only demonstrate the efficient backbone infrastructures and routing schemes deployed by ASes but also show the consequences of economical incentives on the adoption of inter-AS paths. We present and examine the existence of a strong correlation between the geographical distance and round trip delay time as well as the lack of a correlation between the geographical distance and hop length in the Internet. We investigate the relation between the geographical distance and intra-AS routing policies by employing cross-AS (X-AS) Internet topology maps. Our results show that more than two thirds of the intra-AS subpaths are congruent with the shortest geographical distance whether or not geographical distance is employed as a custom parameter in routing decisions.

Disk-based indexing of recent trajectories,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054033678&doi=10.1145%2f3234941&partnerID=40&md5=bc1131fcca1b788a06151341cc0523d8,"The plethora of location-aware devices has led to countless location-based services in which huge amounts of spatiotemporal data get created every day. Several applications require efficient processing of queries on the locations of moving objects over time, i.e., the moving object trajectories. This calls for efficient trajectory-based indexing methods that capture both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data in a way that minimizes the number of disk I/Os required for both updating and querying. Most existing spatiotemporal index structures capture either the current locations of the moving objects or the entire history of the moving objects. Historical spatiotemporal indexing methods require multiple disk I/Os to process new updates and use a discrete trajectory representation that may result in incomplete query results. In this article, we introduce the trails-tree, a disk-based data structure for indexing recent trajectories. The trails-tree requires half the number of disk I/Os needed by other historical spatiotemporal indexing methods for the insertion and querying operations. We give a detailed description of the trails-tree, and we mathematically analyze its performance. Moreover, we present a novel query processing algorithm that ensures the completeness of the query result set.

CellNet: Inferring road networks from GPS trajectories,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054029489&doi=10.1145%2f3234692&partnerID=40&md5=d809903eb7bd234dad4abd3341778a26,"Road networks are essential nowadays, especially for people travelling to large, unfamiliar cities. Moreover, cities are constantly growing and road networks need periodic updates to provide reliable information. We propose an automatic method togenerate the road network using a GPS trajectory dataset. The method, called CellNet, works by first detecting the intersections (junctions) using a clustering-based technique and then creating the road segments in-between. We compare CellNet against conceptually different alternatives using Chicago and Joensuu datasets. The results show that CellNet provides better accuracy and is less sensitive to parameter setup. The size of the generated road network is only 25% of the networks produced by other methods. This implies that the network provided by CellNet has much less redundancy. © 2018 ACM.",Clustering; GPS routes; Grid; Road network; Similarity,Motor transportation; Traffic control; Automatic method; Chicago; Clustering; Gps trajectories; Grid; Road network; Road segments; Similarity; Roads and streets
Efficient computation of the optimal accessible location for a group of mobile agents,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053404376&doi=10.1145%2f3239124&partnerID=40&md5=0b83e3625ec530cdc9a88dd7b2aa4087,"Nowadays, people can access location-based services (LBSs) as a group via mobile devices to plan their daily activities with friends and relatives. In this article, we introduce an important class of group-oriented LBSs, group optimal accessible location (GOAL) queries that enable users to identify the location of a point of interest (POI) that has the minimum total distance to a given set of paths. GOAL queries have many applications, such as the selection of an optimal location for group meet-ups or for a mobile facility such as a food truck. In a GOAL query, each trip or path is represented as a set of line segments, and the distance of a POI from a path is computed as the minimum distance of the POI to any line segment of the path.We develop an efficient approach to evaluate GOAL queries. The novelty of our GOAL query processing algorithm in contrast to other spatial query processing algorithms is the reformulation of a GOAL query by considering only a subset of path segments from the given set of paths, which is also the key factor behind the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.We exploit geometric properties and develop pruning techniques to eliminate both POIs and path segments that cannot provide the optimal solution for a GOAL query.

Feature-based map matching for low-Sampling-Rate GPS trajectories,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051854878&doi=10.1145%2f3223049&partnerID=40&md5=2601e445b1bc262c8371fd04fe23407a,"With the increasing availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices, location-based services have become an integral part of everyday life. Among one of the initial steps of positioning data management, map matching aims to reduce the uncertainty in a trajectory by matching the GPS points to the road network on a digital map. Most existing work has focused on estimating the likelihood of a candidate route based on the GPS observations, while neglecting to model the probability of a route choice from the perspective of drivers. In this work, we propose a novel feature-based map matching algorithm that estimates the cost of a candidate route based on both GPS observations and human factors. To take human factors into consideration is highly important, especially when dealing with low sampling rate data where most of the movement details are lost. Additionally, we simultaneously analyze a subsequence of coherent GPS points by utilizing a new segmentbased probabilistic map matching strategy, which is less susceptible to the noisiness of the positioning data. We have evaluated both the offline and the online versions of our proposed approach on a public large-scale GPS dataset, which consists of 100 trajectories distributed all over the world. The experimental results show that our method is robust to sparse data with large sampling intervals (e.g., 60s i"" 300s) and challenging track features (e.g., u-turns and loops). Measurements including map matching accuracy and system efficiency have been thoroughly evaluated and discussed. Compared with two state-of-the-art map matching algorithms, our method substantially reduces the route mismatch error by 6.4% i"" 32.3% (either offline or online with the window size set to 360s), with a slight increase in terms of the processing time.

Weighted aggregate reverse rank queries,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051854284&doi=10.1145%2f3225216&partnerID=40&md5=597c22aeb524e117916f6142f8439d47,"In marketing, helping manufacturers to find the matching preferences of potential customers for their products is an essential work, especially in e-commerce analyzing with big data. The aggregate reverse rank query has been proposed to return top-k customers who have more potential to buy a given product bundling than other customers, where the potential is evaluated by the aggregate rank, which is defined as the sum of each product's rank. This query correctly reflects the request only when the customers consider the products in the product bundling equally. Unfortunately, rather than thinking products equally, in most cases, people buy a product bundling because they appreciate a special part of the bundling. Manufacturers, such as video games companies and cable television industries, are also willing to bundle some attractive products with less popular products for the purpose of maximum benefits or inventory liquidation. Inspired by the necessity of general aggregate reverse rank query for unequal thinking, we propose a weighted aggregate reverse rank query, which treats the elements in product bundling with different weights to target customers from all aspects of thought. To solve this query efficiently, we first try a straightforward extension. Then, we rebuild the bound-and-filter framework for the weighted aggregate reverse rank query. We prove, theoretically, that the new approach finds the optimal bounds, and we develop the highly efficient algorithm based on these bounds.

In this article, we investigate how data from several heterogeneous online sources can be used to discover insights and make predictions about the spatial distribution of crime in large urban environments. A series of important research questions is addressed, following a purely data-driven approach and methodology. First, we examine how useful different types of data are for the task of crime levels prediction, focusing especially on how prediction accuracy can be improved by combining data from multiple information sources. To that end, we not only investigate prediction accuracy across all individual areas studied, but also examine how these predictions affect the accuracy of identified crime hotspots. Then, we look into individual features, aiming to identify and quantify the most important factors. Finally, we drill down to different crime types, elaborating on how the prediction accuracy and the importance of individual features vary across them. Our analysis involves six different datasets, from which more than 3,000 features are extracted, filtered, and used to learn models for predicting crime rates across 14 different crime categories. Our results indicate that combining data from multiple information sources can significantly improve prediction accuracy. They also highlight which features affect prediction accuracy the most, as well as for which particular crime categories the predictions are more accurate. © 2018 ACM.",Crime prediction; Data analytics; Spatial crime distribution,Crime; Spatial distribution; Data analytics; Data-driven approach; Individual features; Information sources; Large urban environments; Prediction accuracy; Research questions; Spatial crime distribution; crime; data set; Internet; methodology; prediction; spatial distribution; urban ecosystem; Forecasting
Detecting deviations from intended routes using vehicular GPS tracks,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064550231&doi=10.1145%2f3204455&partnerID=40&md5=aeb3e721fe16d753e2cb45814ad1bbce,"This article proposes a method to find intersections at which cars tend to deviate from the optimal route based on global positioning system (GPS) tracking data under the assumption that such deviations indicate that car navigation systems (CNSs) and road signage are not readily available. If the intended route is known, deviations can be enumerated by comparing the intended route with the vehicle’s actual route as observed by a GPS; however, the intended route is unknown and can differ from the route suggested by a CNS. To identify intersections with high deviation rates without knowing intended routes, we exhaustively sampled subsequences from each vehicular GPS track, and detected deviations from the optimal route for the subsequences. Although the detected deviations are not always caused by driver confusion, accumulating such erroneous detection results would yield a meaningful difference in the number of accumulated deviations at each intersection. We applied the proposed method to 3,843 GPS tracks collected from visitor drivers in the city of Kyoto. Thresholding the estimated deviation rate yielded 39 intersections from 14,543 candidates. The results show a certain level of correlation between obtained deviations and rerouting locations from actual CNS data. We also found several intersections where faulty route suggestions are provided by CNSs. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

The medial axis of a multi-layered environment and its application as a navigation mesh,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064551312&doi=10.1145%2f3204456&partnerID=40&md5=7c8da80ba39372d43a8f600ed05784df,"Path planning for walking characters in complicated virtual environments is a fundamental task in simulations and games. A navigation mesh is a data structure that allows efficient path planning. The Explicit Corridor Map (ECM) is a navigation mesh based on the medial axis. It enables path planning for disk-shaped characters of any radius. In this article, we formally extend the medial axis (and therefore the ECM) to 3D environments in which characters are constrained to walkable surfaces. Typical examples of such environments are multi-storey buildings, train stations, and sports stadiums. We give improved definitions of a walkable environment (WE: a description of walkable surfaces in 3D) and a multi-layered environment (MLE: a subdivision of a WE into connected layers). We define the medial axis of such environments based on projected distances on the ground plane. For an MLE with n boundary vertices and k connections, we show that the medial axis has size O (n), and we present an improved algorithm that constructs the medial axis in O (n log n log k) time. The medial axis can be annotated with nearest-obstacle information to obtain the ECM navigation mesh. Our implementations show that the ECM can be computed efficiently for large 2D and multi-layered environments and that it can be used to compute paths within milliseconds. This enables simulations of large virtual crowds of heterogeneous characters in real-time. © 2018 ACM.",Crowd simulation; Medial axis; Multi-layered environment; Navigation mesh; Path planning; Voronoi diagram,Mesh generation; Navigation; Virtual reality; 3-D environments; Boundary vertices; Crowd Simulation; Efficient path planning; Medial axis; Multi-layered; Multistorey buildings; Voronoi diagrams; algorithm; data set; diagram; navigation; path analysis; real time; simulation; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; Motion planning
Enhanced indexing and querying of trajectories in road networks via string algorithms,2018,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064547696&doi=10.1145%2f3200200&partnerID=40&md5=6566b45136de49ce897743949c29a012,"In this article, we propose a novel indexing and querying method for trajectories constrained in a road network. We aim to provide efficient algorithms for various types of spatiotemporal queries that involve routing in road networks, such as (1) finding moving objects that have traveled along a given path during a given time interval, (2) extracting all paths traveled after a given spatiotemporal context, and (3) enumerating all paths between two locations traveled during a certain time interval. Unlike the existing methods in spatial database research, we employ indexing techniques and algorithms from string processing. This idea is based on the fact that we can represent spatial paths as strings, because trajectories in a network are represented as sequences of road segment IDs. The proposed SNT-index (suffix-array-based network-constrained trajectory index) introduces two novel concepts to trajectory indexing. The first is FM-index, which is a compact in-memory data structure for pattern matching. The second is an inverse suffix array, which allows the FM-index to be integrated with the temporal information stored in a forest of B+-trees. Thanks to these concepts, we can reduce the number of B+-tree accesses required by the query processing algorithms to a constant number, something that cannot be achieved with existing methods. Although an FM-index is essentially a static index, we also propose a practical method of appending new data to the index. Finally, experiments show that our method can process the target queries for more than 1 million trajectories in a few tens of milliseconds, which is significantly faster than what the baseline algorithms can achieve without string algorithms. © 2018 ACM.",Network-constrained trajectories; Spatiotemporal indexing; String algorithms,Forestry; Frequency modulation; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Inverse problems; Motor transportation; Pattern matching; Query processing; Roads and streets; Constrained trajectories; Indexing techniques; Query processing algorithms; Spatio-temporal indexing; Spatiotemporal queries; String algorithms; Temporal information; Trajectory indexing; algorithm; array; database; experimental study; index method; network analysis; research work; road; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory; Trajectories
Grid-based method for GPS route analysis for retrieval,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041562601&doi=10.1145%2f3125634&partnerID=40&md5=519bcfa7e30ede7914b54ffb10345700,"Grids are commonly used as histograms to process spatial data in order to detect frequent patterns, predict destinations, or to infer popular places. However, they have not been previously used for GPS trajectory similarity searches or retrieval in general. Instead, slower and more complicated algorithms based on individual point-pair comparison have been used. We demonstrate how a grid representation can be used to compute four different route measures: novelty, noteworthiness, similarity, and inclusion. The measures may be used in several applications such as identifying taxi fraud, automatically updating GPS navigation software, optimizing traffic, and identifying commuting patterns. We compare our proposed route similarity measure, C-SIM, to eight popular alternatives including Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) and Frechet distance. The proposed measure is simple to implement and we give a fast, linear time algorithm for the task. It works well under noise, changes in sampling rate, and point shifting. We demonstrate that by using the grid, a route similarity ranking can be computed in real-time on the Mopsi20141 route dataset, which consists of over 6,000 routes.

Efficient visibility determination in urban scenes considering terrain information,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045545037&doi=10.1145%2f3152536&partnerID=40&md5=de5c6b383a10d376d5dc5f1189b2469c,"In this article, we introduce a novel occlusion culling method working on the server side to provide real-time navigation on web-based systems. Nowadays, virtual navigation in urban environments is a rising trend in several contexts such as tourism, GPS navigation systems, and video games. A city environment is usually associated with a complex data model that is better stored, maintained, and updated on a server system. Mobile devices are regular clients in these cases, demanding this information in a fast, reliable, and engaging way. Even though these gadgets have been increasing their capabilities in computation and visualization, the bottleneck is still the transmission of information over the network. The advantage of urban environments is that, from a user viewpoint, only a small portion of the scene is visible. This feature makes crucial the use of occlusion culling techniques working on the server side in order to transmit to the client side only the small set of visible elements compared to the whole scene. The input data are the city geometry from the 2D cadastral information system, the building textures, and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) files with the urban terrain features. In a first stage, the process creates a 2.5D urban model with all these data in preprocessing time. Then the client provides the user location point, and the server sends back the exact portion of visible city. This approach is implemented using polar diagrams for visibility determination and LOD (Level of Detail) techniques for further geometry reduction. © 2017 ACM.",Digital elevation models; Hilly cities; Occlusion culling; Urban environments,Digital instruments; Forestry; Geomorphology; Navigation systems; Real time systems; Urban planning; Visibility; Digital elevation model; Hilly cities; LOD (level of detail); Occlusion culling; Preprocessing time; Real-time navigation; Urban environments; Visibility determination; culling; digital elevation model; GPS; hill; information; navigation; numerical model; real time; terrain; urban area; visualization; World Wide Web; Surveying

Assessing the significance of spatiotemporal co-occurrences plays an important role in the spatiotemporal frequent pattern mining applications of moving region objects. A spatiotemporal version of the popular Jaccard measure has been used for measuring the strength of spatiotemporal co-occurrences. We will demonstrate the shortcomings of the Jaccard (J) measure when it is used for assessing the significance of co-occurrences among spatiotemporal instances with highly different spatiotemporal evolution characteristics. We will present two extended novel measures (J+ and J∗) that address the problems linked to the J measure.

Toward mining stop-by behaviors in indoor space,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045546253&doi=10.1145%2f3106736&partnerID=40&md5=d8dc3671c882bd9cfa79c4d9c81407ef,"In this article, we explore a new mining paradigm, called Indoor Stop-by Patterns (ISP), to discover user stopby behavior in mall-like indoor environments. The discovery of ISPs enables new marketing collaborations, such as a joint coupon promotion, among stores in indoor spaces (e.g., shopping malls). Moreover, it can also help in eliminating the overcrowding situation. To pursue better practicability, we consider the cost-effective wireless sensor-based environment and conduct the analysis of indoor stop-by behaviors on real data. However, it is a highly challenging issue, in indoor environments, to retrieve frequent ISPs, especially when the issue of user privacy is highlighted nowadays. The mining of ISPs will face a critical challenge from spatial uncertainty. Previous work on mining indoor movement patterns usually relies on precise spatiooral information by a specific deployment of positioning devices, which cannot be directly applied. In this article, the proposed Probabilistic Top-k Indoor Stop-by Patterns Discovery (PTkISP) framework incorporates the probabilistic model to identify top-k ISPs over uncertain data collected from sensing logs. Moreover, we develop an uncertain model and devise an Index 1-itemset (IIS) algorithm to enhance the accuracy and efficiency. Our experimental studies show that the proposed PTkISP framework can efficiently discover high-quality ISPs and can provide insightful observations for marketing collaborations. © 2017 ACM.",Data cleansing; Indoor space; Region of interest; Symbolic model; Uncertain pattern mining; Wireless sensor,Behavioral research; Commerce; Communication channels (information theory); Cost effectiveness; Image segmentation; Marketing; Data cleansing; Indoor space; Pattern mining; Region of interest; Symbolic model; Wireless sensor; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; equipment; experimental study; indoor air; numerical model; sensor; Data mining
Spatial partition-based particle filtering for data assimilation inwildfire spread simulation,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045585276&doi=10.1145%2f3099471&partnerID=40&md5=90e49712d74e56e1b08b53d2187ba7b6,"This article develops a spatial partition-based particle filtering framework to support data assimilation for large-scale wildfire spread simulation effectively. The developed spatial partition-based particle filtering framework breaks the system state and observation data into smaller spatial regions and then carries out localized particle filtering based on these spatial regions. Particle Filters (PFs) hold great promise to support data assimilation for spatial temporal simulations, such as wildfire spread simulation, to achieve more accurate simulation or prediction results. However, PFs face major challenges to work effectively for complex spatial temporal simulations due to the high-dimensional state space of the simulation models, which typically cover large areas and have a large number of spatially dependent state variables. The developed framework exploits the spatial locality property of system state and observation data and employs the divide-and-conquer principle to reduce state dimension and data complexity. This framework is especially developed for a discrete event cellular space model (the wildfire simulation model), which significantly differs from prior works that use numerical models specified by partial differential equations (PDEs) with continuous variables. Within this framework, a two-level automated spatial partitioning method is presented to provide automated and balanced spatial partitions with fewer boundary sensors. The developed framework is applied to a wildfire spread simulation and achieved improved results compared to using standard PF-based data assimilation methods. © 2017 ACM.",Data assimilation; Particle filtering; Space partitioning; Spatial temporal simulation; Wildfire spread simulation,Discrete event simulation; Distributed computer systems; Fires; Network function virtualization; Data assimilation; Particle Filtering; Space partitioning; Spatial temporals; Wildfire spread simulation; complexity; data assimilation; numerical method; observational method; prediction; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; Monte Carlo methods
Classification of passes in football matches using spatiotemporal data,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045544550&doi=10.1145%2f3105576&partnerID=40&md5=26ad7071707cef109b9d2c1cfd25284e,"A knowledgeable observer of a game of football (soccer) can make a subjective evaluation of the quality of passes made between players during the game, such as rating them as Good, OK, or Bad. In this article, we consider the problem of producing an automated system to make the same evaluation of passes and present a model to solve this problem. Recently, many professional football leagues have installed object tracking systems in their stadiums that generate high-resolution and high-frequency spatiotemporal trajectories of the players and the ball. Beginning with the thesis that much of the information required to make the pass ratings is available in the trajectory signal, we further postulated that using complex data structures derived from computational geometry would enable domain football knowledge to be included in the model by computing metric variables in a principled and efficient manner. We designed a model that computes a vector of predictor variables for each pass made and uses machine learning techniques to determine a classification function that can accurately rate passes based only on the predictor variable vector. Experimental results show that the learned classification functions can rate passes with 90.2% accuracy. The agreement between the classifier ratings and the ratings made by a human observer is comparable to the agreement between the ratings made by human observers, and suggests that significantly higher accuracy is unlikely to be achieved. Furthermore, we show that the predictor variables computed using methods from computational geometry are among the most important to the learned classifiers. © 2017 ACM.",Classification; Computational geometry; Feature engineering; Spatial algorithms; Supervised learning,Automation; Classification (of information); Computational geometry; Function evaluation; Geometry; Learning systems; Object oriented programming; Quality control; Sports; Supervised learning; Tracking (position); Classification functions; Complex data structures; Feature engineerings; Machine learning techniques; Spatial algorithms; Spatio-temporal data; Spatio-temporal trajectories; Subjective evaluations; algorithm; automation; classification; computer simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; sport; supervised learning; vector autoregression; Knowledge based systems
Accurate and energy-efficient GPS-less outdoor localization,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043246392&doi=10.1145%2f3085575&partnerID=40&md5=66e7610efc99c65f2e0161b2f12798d3,"Location-based services have become an important part of our daily lives. However, such services require continuous user tracking while preserving the scarce cell-phone battery resource. In this article, we present Dejavu, a system that uses standard cell-phone sensors to provide accurate and energy-efficient outdoor localization. Dejavu is capable of localizing and navigating both pedestrian and in-vehicle users in real time. Our analysis shows that, whether walking or in-vehicle, when the user encounters a road landmark such as going inside a tunnel, ascending a staircase, or even moving over a bump, all these different landmarks affect the inertial sensors on the phone in a unique pattern. Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered virtual landmarks, to reset the dead-reckoning accumulated error and achieve accurate localization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other purposes. Moreover, Dejavu provides a localization confidence measure along with its predicted location. This improves the usability of the predicted location from end users' perspective. We present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing to automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation results from implementation on different Android devices using different testbeds showing that Dejavu can localize cell-phones in vehicles with a median error of 8.4m in city roads and 16.6m on highways and can localize cell-phones carried by pedestrians with a median error of 3.0m. Moreover, compared to the global position system (GPS) and other state-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by up to 347%, while achieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging in-city areas. In addition, Dejavu estimates the localization confidence measure accurately with a median error of 2.3m and 31cm for in-vehicle and pedestrian users, respectively. © 2017 ACM.",Crowd-sensing; Energy-efficient; Navigation; Outdoor localization; Pedestrian localization,Cellular telephone systems; Cellular telephones; Electric batteries; Errors; Global positioning system; Location; Location based services; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Navigation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Secondary batteries; Telecommunication equipment; Telecommunication services; Telephone sets; Transportation; Vehicles; Confidence Measure; Crowd-sensing; Energy efficient; Evaluation results; Global position systems; Outdoor localizations; Pedestrian localization; State-of-the-art system; accuracy assessment; design method; energy efficiency; GPS; mobile phone; navigation; pedestrian; perception; sensor; tracking; walking; Energy efficiency
A layered approach for more robust generation of road network maps from vehicle tracking data,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051086222&doi=10.1145%2f3061713&partnerID=40&md5=2d7fb3656a7e6c40b21d1abb534f8e4e,"Nowadays, large amounts of tracking data are generated via GPS-enabled devices and other advanced tracking technologies. These constitute a rich source for inferring the structure of transportation networks. In this work, we present a novel methodology for revealing a road network map from vehicle trajectories. Specifically, we propose an enhanced and robust map construction algorithm that is based on segmenting the original tracking data according to different types of movement and then constructing the topology of the road network hierarchically. The segmentation produces separate road network layers, which are then fused into a single network. This provides a more efficient way to addresses the challenges imposed by noisy and low sampling rate trajectories. It also allows for a mechanism to accommodate automatic map maintenance on updates. Thus, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods and introduces a map construction algorithm that is robust against heterogeneous and sparse data and capable to incorporate changes and improvements. An experimental evaluation extensively assesses the quality of the proposed methodology by constructing large parts of the road networks of four major cities, namely Athens, Berlin, Vienna, and Chicago, using as input GPS tracking data of utility vehicles and taxi fleets. Our results show significant improvements concerning the spatial accuracy and the quality of the constructed road network over the current state of the art. © 2017 ACM.",Map construction; Road networks; Trajectories,Athens [Attica]; Attica; Austria; Berlin; Chicago; Germany; Greece; Illinois; United States; Vienna; Global positioning system; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Taxicabs; Trajectories; Experimental evaluation; Layered approaches; Map constructions; Road network; Tracking technology; Transportation network; Vehicle tracking data; Vehicle trajectories; accuracy assessment; algorithm; experimental study; GPS; map generalization; mapping method; methodology; road; segmentation; tracking; trajectory; transportation system; Network layers
A general framework for MaxRS and MaxCRS monitoring in spatial data streams,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047349548&doi=10.1145%2f3080554&partnerID=40&md5=9fe2431084fa92425b7e646cafe54579,"This article addresses the MaxRS (Maximizing Range Sum) monitoring problem. Given a set of weighted spatial stream objects, this problem is to monitor a location of a user-specified sized rectangle where the sum of the weights of the objects covered by the rectangle is maximized. This problem supports modern applications (e.g., traffic analysis and event detection in urban sensing) but has not yet been addressed. Although some algorithms for static objects have been proposed, such algorithms are not scalable to stream environments. These motivate us to devise an algorithm for efficient MaxRS monitoring. We first propose G2 (Graph in Grid index) and a G2-based algorithm to incrementally update the result. We then propose aG2 (aggregate G2), by enhancing G2, and a branch-and-bound algorithm that employs aG2 and can deal with error-guaranteed approximation. We also address MaxCRS monitoring, which is the circle version of the aforementioned problem. Its importance is evident from the fact that distance is also popular as a range criterion. We then have an emerging challenge of developing a general and efficient solution for both continuous MaxRS and MaxCRS queries. Based on a common property of the two problems, we generalize aG2 so as to be employed in both continuous MaxRS and MaxCRS queries. The branch-and-bound algorithm is also extended to suit the generalized index. © 2017 ACM.",Continuous MaxRS; MaxCRS queries; Monitoring; Spatiotemporal object,Branch and bound method; Monitoring; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Continuous MaxRS; Generalized index; MaxCRS queries; Modern applications; Spatial data streams; Spatio-temporal objects; Stream environment; algorithm; monitoring; numerical method; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; Approximation algorithms
Estimating people flow from spatiotemporal population data via collective graphical mixture models,2017,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044527518&doi=10.1145%2f3080555&partnerID=40&md5=1773bca6ffafb958071993068721e00c,"Thanks to the prevalence of mobile phones and GPS devices, spatiotemporal population data can be obtained easily. In this article, we propose a mixture of collective graphical models for estimating people flow from spatiotemporal population data. The spatiotemporal population data we use as input is the number of people in each grid cell area over time, which is aggregated information about many individuals; to preserve privacy, they do not contain trajectories of each individual. Therefore, it is impossible to directly estimate people flow. To overcome this problem, the proposed model assumes that transition populations are hidden variables and estimates the hidden transition populations and transition probabilities simultaneously. The proposed model can handle changes of people flow over time by segmenting time-of-day points into multiple clusters, where different clusters have different flow patterns. We develop an efficient variational Bayesian inference procedure for the collective graphical mixture model. In our experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using four real-world spatiotemporal population datasets in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Beijing. © 2017 ACM.",Collective graphical models; Mixture models; Population data; Spatiotemporal data; Variational Bayes,Aichi; Beijing [China]; China; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Kinki; Nagoya; Osaka [Kinki]; Osaka [Osaka (PRF)]; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]; Bayesian networks; Data flow graphs; Graphic methods; Inference engines; Mixtures; GraphicaL model; Mixture model; Population data; Spatio-temporal data; Variational bayes; Bayesian analysis; estimation method; GPS; graphical method; mobile phone; numerical model; population migration; population structure; spatiotemporal analysis; Population statistics

Hence, in this article, we explore a geo-spatial learning-to-rank framework for identifying local experts. Three of the key features of the proposed approach are: (i) a learning-based framework for integrating multiple user-based, content-based, list-based, and crowd-based factors impacting local expertise that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of social media users; (ii) a location-sensitive random walk that propagates crowd knowledge of a candidate's expertise; and (iii) a comprehensive controlled study over AMT-labeled local experts on eight topics and in four cities.

Matching labels and markers in historical maps: An algorithm with interactive postprocessing,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046428015&doi=10.1145%2f2994598&partnerID=40&md5=e85777ce5c73d27be2cae2603ec69d54,"In this article, we present an algorithmic system for determining the proper correspondence between place markers and their labels in historical maps. We assume that the locations of place markers (usually pictographs) and labels (pieces of text) have already been determined - either algorithmically or by hand - and we want to match the labels to the markers. This time-consuming step in the digitization process of historical maps is nontrivial even for humans but provides valuable metadata (e.g., when subsequently georeferencing the map). To speed up this process, we model the problem in terms of combinatorial optimization, solve that problem efficiently, and show how user interaction can be used to improve the quality of the results. We also consider a version of the model where we are given label fragments and additionally have to decide which fragments go together. We show that this problem is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for a restricted version of this fragment assignment problem. We have implemented the algorithm for the main problem and tested it on a manually extracted ground truth for eight historical maps with a combined total of more than 12,800 markers and labels. On average, the algorithm correctly matches 96% of the labels and is robust against noisy input. It furthermore performs a sensitivity analysis and in this way computes a measure of confidence for each of the matches. We use this as the basis for an interactive system where the user's effort is directed to checking those parts of the map where the algorithm is unsure; any corrections the user makes are propagated by the algorithm. We discuss a prototype of this system and statistically confirm that it successfully locates those areas on the map where the algorithm needs help. © 2016 ACM.",Algorithms; Historical maps; Interaction; Metadata extraction; Sensitivity analysis,Algorithms; Combinatorial optimization; Metadata; Polynomial approximation; Sensitivity analysis; Assignment problems; Historical maps; Interaction; Interactive postprocessings; Interactive system; Meta-data extractions; Polynomial-time algorithms; User interaction; Problem solving

Existing approaches focus on forecasting temporal events (such as elections and sports) but as yet cannot forecast spatiotemporal events such as civil unrest and influenza outbreaks, which are much more challenging. To achieve spatiotemporal event forecasting, spatial features that evolve with time and their underlying correlations need to be considered and characterized. In this article, we propose novel batch and online approaches for spatiotemporal event forecasting in social media such as Twitter. Our models characterize the underlying development of future events by simultaneously modeling the structural contexts and their spatiotemporal burstiness based on different strategies. Both batch and online-based inference algorithms are developed to optimize the model parameters. Utilizing the trained model, the alignment likelihood of tweet sequences is calculated by dynamic programming.

An interesting research direction that has recently emerged handles semantics of movement instead of raw spatio-temporal data. Semantic annotations, such as “stop,” “move,” “at home,” “shopping,” “driving,” and so on, are either declared by the users (e.g., through social network apps) or automatically inferred by some annotation method and are typically presented as textual counterparts along with spatial and temporal information of raw trajectories. It is natural to argue that such “spatio-temporal-textual” sequences, called semantic trajectories, form a realistic representation model of the complex everyday life (hence, mobility) of individuals. Towards handling semantic trajectories of moving objects in Semantic Mobility Databases, the lack of real datasets leads to the need to design realistic simulators. In the context of the above discussion, the goal of this work is to realistically simulate the mobility life of a large-scale population of moving objects in an urban environment. Two simulator variations are presented: the core Hermoupolis simulator is parametric driven (i.e., user-defined parameters tune every movement aspect), whereas the expansion of the former, called Hermoupolisby-example, follows the generate-by-example paradigm and is self-tuned by looking inside a real small (sample) dataset.

This work introduces Links-of-Interest (LOI) between POIs as a means to increase the relevance and overall result quality of such queries. By analyzing user-contributed content in the form of travel blogs, we establish the overall popularity of an LOI, that is, how frequently the respective POI pair was visited and is mentioned in the same context. Our contribution is a query-processing method for so-called k-Relevant Nearest Neighbor (k-RNN) queries that considers spatial proximity in combination with LOI information to retrieve close-by and relevant (as judged by the crowd) POIs. Our method is based on intelligently combining indices for spatial data (a spatial grid) and for relevance data (a graph) during query processing. Using landmarks as a means to prune the search space in the Relevance Graph, we improve the proposed methods. Using in addition A∗-directed search, the query performance can be further improved.

Nevertheless, we argue that other marketing factors, such as social influence, could be considered in the process of business-location planning. In this article, we propose a framework for business-location planning that takes into account both factors of geographical proximity and social influence. An essential task in this framework is to compute the “influence spread” of RNNs for candidate locations. Here, the influence spread refers to the number of people influenced via the word-of-mouth effect. To alleviate the excessive computational overhead and long latency in the framework, we trade storage overhead for processing speed by precomputing and storing the social influence between pairs of customers. Based on Targeted Region (TR)-Oriented and RNN-Oriented processing strategies, we develop two suites of algorithms that incorporate various efficient pruning and segmentation techniques to enhance our framework. Experiments validate our ideas and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over various parameter settings. The experimental results show that (a) TR-oriented and RNN-oriented processing are feasible for supporting the task of location planning; (b) RNN-oriented processing is more efficient than TR-oriented processing; and (c) the optimization technique that we developed significantly improves the efficiency of RNN-oriented and TR-oriented processing. © 2016 ACM.",Reverse nearest neighbor; Social influence,Commerce; Efficiency; Location; Nearest neighbor search; Sales; Computational overheads; Geographical proximity; Optimization techniques; Processing strategies; Reverse nearest neighbors; Segmentation techniques; Social influence; Word-of-mouth effects; Economic and social effects
"Protecting against velocity-based, proximity-based, and external event attacks in location-centric social networks",2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049827021&doi=10.1145%2f2910580&partnerID=40&md5=830ebf7bdb52897ecd8ad0506c84a6bb,"Mobile devices with positioning capabilities allow users to participate in novel and exciting location-based applications. For instance, users may track the whereabouts of their acquaintances in location-aware social networking applications (e.g., Foursquare). Furthermore, users can request information about landmarks in their proximity. Such scenarios require users to report their coordinates to other parties, which may not be fully trusted. Reporting precise locations may result in serious privacy violations, such as disclosure of lifestyle details, sexual orientation, and so forth. A typical approach to preserve location privacy is to generate a cloaking region (CR) that encloses the user position. However, if locations are continuously reported, an attacker can correlate CRs from multiple timestamps to accurately pinpoint the user position within a CR. In this work, we protect against a broad range of attacks that breach location privacy using knowledge about (1) maximum user velocity, (2) external events that may occur outside the process of self-reporting locations (e.g., social network posts tagged by peers), and (3) information about mutual proximity between users. Assume user u who reports two consecutive cloaked regions A and B. We consider two distinct protection scenarios: in the first case, the attacker does not have information about the sensitive locations on the map, and the objective is to ensure that u can reach some point in B from any point in A; in the second case, the attacker knows the placement of sensitive locations, and the objective is to ensure that u can reach any point in B from any point in A. We propose spatial and temporal cloaking transformations to preserve user privacy, and we show experimentally that privacy can be achieved without significant quality-of-service deterioration. © 2016 ACM.",Location privacy; Location-aware social networks,Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Social networking (online); Location privacy; Location-aware; Location-based applications; Precise locations; Privacy violation; Self-reporting; Sexual orientations; Social networking applications; Location
Location estimation using crowdsourced spatial relations,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029911484&doi=10.1145%2f2894745&partnerID=40&md5=14e101eb51f1e6b2759607f95d12be52,"The “crowd” has become a very important geospatial data provider. Specifically, nonexpert users have been providing a wealth of quantitative geospatial data (e.g., geotagged tweets or photos, online). With spatial reasoning being a basic form of human cognition, textual narratives expressing user travel experiences (e.g., travel blogs) would provide an even bigger source of geospatial data. Narratives typically contain qualitative geospatial data in the form of objects and spatial relations (e.g., “St. John's church is to the North of the Acropolis museum.” The scope of this work is (i) to extract these spatial relations from textual narratives, (ii) to quantify (model) them, and (iii) to reason about object locations based only on the quantified spatial relations. We use information extraction methods to identify toponyms and spatial relations, and we formulate a quantitative approach based on distance and orientation features to represent the latter. Probability density functions (PDFs) for spatial relations are determined by means of a greedy expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm. These PDFs are then used to estimate unknown object locations. Experiments using a text corpus harvested from travel blog sites establish the considerable location estimation accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic and real-world scenarios. © 2016 ACM.",Crowdsourced geospatial data; Location estimation; Spatial relations,Location; Maximum principle; Geo-spatial data; Greedy expectation-maximization; Information extraction methods; Location estimation; Orientation features; Probability density functions (PDFs); Quantitative approach; Spatial relations; Probability density function
An efficient external memory algorithm for terrain viewshed computation,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020454605&doi=10.1145%2f2903206&partnerID=40&md5=f3de6ac18a35a44c652a66d456a280da,"This article presents TILEDVS, a fast external algorithm and implementation for computing viewsheds. TILEDVS is intended for terrains that are too large for internal memory, even more than 100,000×100,000 points. It subdivides the terrain into tiles that are stored compressed on disk and then paged into memory with a custom cache data structure and least recently used algorithm. If there is sufficient available memory to store a whole row of tiles, which is easy, then this specialized data management is faster than relying on the operating system's virtual memory management. Applications of viewshed computation include siting radio transmitters, surveillance, and visual environmental impact measurement. TILEDVS runs a rotating line of sight from the observer to points on the region boundary. For each boundary point, it computes the visibility of all terrain points close to the line of sight. The running time is linear in the number of points. No terrain tile is read more than twice. TILEDVS is very fast, for instance, processing a 104,000×104,000 terrain on a modest computer with only 512MB of RAM took only 11                             2 hours. On large datasets, TILEDVS was several times faster than competing algorithms, such as the ones included in GRASS. The source code of TILEDVS is freely available for nonprofit researchers to study, use, and extend. A preliminary version of this algorithm appeared in a four-page ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2012 conference paper, “More Efficient Terrain Viewshed Computation on Massive Datasets Using External Memory.” This more detailed version adds the fast lossless compression stage that reduces the time by 30% to 40%, and many more experiments and comparisons. © 2016 ACM.",External memory algorithms; Geographic information systems; Terrain visibility,Computational efficiency; Environmental impact; Geographic information systems; Information management; Landforms; Radio transmission; Random access storage; Visibility; Algorithm and implementation; Competing algorithms; Conference papers; External memory algorithms; Least recently used algorithms; Lossless compression; Region boundaries; Virtual memory management; Cache memory
TerraNNI: Natural neighbor interpolation on 2D and 3D grids using a GPU,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045638504&doi=10.1145%2f2786757&partnerID=40&md5=553d051430fe882dcf0df5713e0ab8ff,"With modern focus on remote sensing technology, such as LiDAR, the amount of spatial data, in the form of massive point clouds, has increased dramatically. Furthermore, repeated surveys of the same areas are becoming more common. This trend will only increase as topographic changes prompt surveys over already scanned areas, in which case we obtain large spatiotemporal datasets. An initial step in the analysis of such spatial data is to create a digital elevation model representing the terrain, possibly over time. In the case of spatial (spatiotemporal, respectively) datasets, these models often represent elevation on a 2D (3D, respectively) grid. This involves interpolating the elevation of LiDAR points on these grid points. In this article, we show how to efficiently perform natural neighbor interpolation over a 2D and 3D grid. Using a graphics processing unit (GPU), we describe different algorithms to attain speed and GPU-memory tradeoffs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms not only are significantly faster than earlier ones but also scale to much bigger datasets that previous algorithms were unable to handle. © 2016 ACM.",GIS; GPU; LIDAR; Massive data; Natural neighbor interpolation,Computer graphics equipment; Geographic information systems; Interpolation; Optical radar; Program processors; Remote sensing; Surveys; Three dimensional computer graphics; Digital elevation model; Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); Massive data; Natural neighbor interpolation; Remote sensing technology; Spatial data; Spatiotemporal datasets; Topographic changes; Graphics processing unit
Snap rounding with restore: An algorithm for producing robust geometric datasets,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027704296&doi=10.1145%2f2811256&partnerID=40&md5=eef279a32b7959ae1383ee611534ee69,"This article presents a new algorithm called Snap Rounding with Restore (SRR), which aims to make geometric datasets robust and to increase the quality of geometric approximation and the preservation of topological structure. It is based on the well-known Snap Rounding algorithm but improves it by eliminating from the snap rounded arrangement the configurations in which the distance between a vertex and a nonincident edge is smaller than half the width of a pixel of the rounding grid. Therefore, the goal of SRR is exactly the same as the goal of another algorithm, Iterated Snap Rounding (ISR), and of its evolution, Iterated Snap Rounding with Bounded Drift (ISRBD). However, SRR produces an output with a quality of approximation that is on average better than ISRBD, under the viewpoint both of the distance from the original segments and of the conservation of their topological structure. The article also reports some cases where ISRBD, notwithstanding the bounded drift, produces strong topological modifications while SRR does not. A statistical analysis on a large collection of input datasets confirms these differences. It follows that the proposed Snap Rounding with Restore algorithm is suitable for applications that require robustness, a guaranteed geometric approximation, and a good topological approximation. © 2016 ACM.",Geometric robustness; Rounding algorithms; Snap rounding,Geometry; Restoration; Topology; Geometric approximations; Rounding algorithm; Snap rounding; Topological modification; Topological structure; Approximation algorithms
Spatial consensus queries in a collaborative environment,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030670590&doi=10.1145%2f2829943&partnerID=40&md5=e8fc2f73c40ef6cc228ff4bd0ab209a3,"We introduce a new type of query for a location-based social network platform. Consider a scenario in which a group of users is trying to find a common meeting location, yet attempting to include all group members is introducing a significant traveling cost to most of them. In this article, we formulate a new query type called the consensus query, which can be used to help users explore these trade-off options to find a solution upon which everyone can agree. Specifically, we study the problem of evaluating consensus queries in the context of nearest neighbor queries, where the group is interested in finding a meeting place that minimizes the travel distance for at least a specified number of group members. To help the group in selecting a suitable solution, the major challenge is to find optimal subgroups of all allowable subgroup sizes, i.e., greater or equal to the minimum specified subgroup size, that minimize the travel distances.We develop incremental algorithms to evaluate in one pass the optimal query subgroups of different sizes along with their corresponding nearest data points. These subsets, which are evaluated by the location-based service provider, constitute the answer set that is returned to the group. The group then collaboratively selects the final answer from the candidate answer set. An extensive experimental study shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed techniques. © 2016 ACM.",Consensus queries; Group queries; Location-based services,Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Knowledge based systems; Location; Mobile devices; Nearest neighbor search; Query processing; Telecommunication services; Collaborative environments; Consensus queries; Different sizes; Group queries; Incremental algorithm; Location-based social networks; Nearest neighbor queries; Suitable solutions; Location based services
Privacy-aware dynamic ride sharing,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029215312&doi=10.1145%2f2845080&partnerID=40&md5=5efe903f46321c12cad5d5650d566882,"Dynamic ride sharing is a service that enables shared vehicle rides in real time and on short notice. It can be an effective solution to counter the problem of increasing traffic jams at peak hours in cities. The growing use and popularity of smart phones and GPS-enabled devices provides us with tools required to efficiently implement ride sharing and significantly enhance carpooling. However, privacy and safety concerns are the main obstacles faced when encouraging people to use such a service. In this work, we present ""Match Maker,"" a negotiation-based model that hides exact location information data for system participants while implementing privacy preserving ride sharing. We use the concept of imprecision (not being precise about location of the user out of set of n locations) and follow the idea of obfuscation, which equates a higher degree of imprecision with a higher degree of privacy. We identify two attack types that could circumvent privacy preserving ride sharing.We compare theMatch Makermodel with the standard central trusted server model collecting precise location data, which we term eBay model. We provide the first comprehensive approach that integrates privacy, safety and trust in a single model. We present a recursive ellipse-based algorithm to compute an optimal driver path as well as three negotiation strategies for drivers and passengers.We conduct extensive experiments on real road networks and compare the strategies for privacy and effectiveness of ride sharing in terms of traffic load and vehicle km reduction. We show that ride sharing saves between 9% and 21% (on average 12%) of vehicle km if drivers are only prepared to accept slight detours of their usual trips. In the city of Melbourne, with 11.6 million trips a weekday and an average trip length of 10.2 km, this would save 14.2 million km per weekday. © 2016 ACM.",Dynamic ride sharing; Optimization; Privacy; Spatiotemporal data; Trust,Location; Optimization; Smartphones; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Effective solution; Ellipse-based algorithms; Location information; Negotiation strategy; Privacy preserving; Ride-sharing; Spatio-temporal data; Trust; Data privacy
Area-preserving simplification and schematization of polygonal subdivisions,2016,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019818357&doi=10.1145%2f2818373&partnerID=40&md5=fc75fa9440334e47b8ae7720a19c26e8,"In this article, we study automated simplification and schematization of territorial outlines. We present a quadratic-time simplification algorithm based on an operation called edge-move. We prove that the number of edges of any nonconvex simple polygon can be reduced with this operation. Moreover, edge-moves preserve area and topology and do not introduce new orientations. The latter property in particular makes the algorithm highly suitable for schematization in which all resulting lines are required to be parallel to one of a given set of lines (orientations). To obtain such a result, we need only to preprocess the input to use only lines that are parallel to one of the given set. We present an algorithm to enforce such orientation restrictions, again without changing area or topology. Experiments show that our algorithms obtain results of high visual quality. © 2016 ACM.",Area preservation; Orientation restriction; Schematization; Simplification; Territorial outlines,Area preservation; Area-preserving; Schematization; Simple polygon; Simplification; Simplification algorithms; Territorial outlines; Visual qualities; Topology
Leveraging Simulation Data to Understand Bias in Predictive Models of Infectious Disease Spread,2024,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198030264&doi=10.1145%2f3660631&partnerID=40&md5=cb75d4a47764a1e9ee5dc836ae544df9,"The spread of infectious diseases is a highly complex spatiotemporal process, difficult to understand, predict, and effectively respond to. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved impressive results in other learning and prediction tasks; however, while many AI solutions are developed for disease prediction, only a few of them are adopted by decision-makers to support policy interventions. Among several issues preventing their uptake, AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on. This is especially problematic for infectious disease models that typically leverage large, open, and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making, resulting in inequitable policy interventions. Therefore, there is a need to gain an understanding of how the AI disease modeling pipeline can mitigate biased input data, in-processing models, and biased outputs. Specifically, our vision is to develop a large-scale micro-simulation of individuals from which human mobility, population, and disease ground-Truth data can be obtained. From this complete dataset-which may not reflect the real world-we can sample and inject different types of bias. By using the sampled data in which bias is known (as it is given as the simulation parameter), we can explore how existing solutions for fairness in AI can mitigate and correct these biases and investigate novel AI fairness solutions. Achieving this vision would result in improved trust in such models for informing fair and equitable policy interventions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",epidemic forecasting; fair and equitable AI; Spatial epidemiology; spatiotemporal prediction,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Diseases; Pipelines; Population statistics; Disease spread; Epidemic forecasting; Fair and equitable artificial intelligence; Infectious disease; Policy intervention; Predictive models; Simulation data; Spatial epidemiology; Spatio-temporal prediction; Spatiotemporal process; artificial intelligence; decision making; forecasting method; infectious disease; spatiotemporal analysis; Forecasting

However, there is an apparent lack of full-fledged systems that provide the infrastructure support for trajectory analysis techniques, which hinders the applicability of most of the designed algorithms. Inspired by the tremendous success of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) deep learning model in solving various Natural Language Processing tasks, our vision is to have a BERT-like system for trajectory analysis tasks. We envision that in a few years, we will have such system where no one needs to worry again about each specific trajectory analysis operation. Whether it is trajectory imputation, similarity, clustering, or whatever, it would be one system that researchers, developers, and practitioners can deploy to get high accuracy for their trajectory operations. Our vision stands on a solid ground that trajectories in a space are highly analogous to statements in a language. We outline the challenges and the road to our vision.

On the Opportunities and Challenges of Foundation Models for GeoAI (Vision Paper),2024,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193724004&doi=10.1145%2f3653070&partnerID=40&md5=ecc0cee8b7f3e8c5ce9cdec1e39787c3,"Large pre-Trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), are trained in a task-Agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks by fine-Tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning. Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have not yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial domains, including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality, such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, the task-Agnostic large learning models (LLMs) can outperform task-specific fully supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing FMs still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing an FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodal nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal FM that can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this article by discussing the unique risks and challenges to developing such a model for GeoAI.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Foundation models; geospatial artificial intelligence; multimodal learning,Character recognition; Foundations; Frequency modulation; Image classification; Remote sensing; Semantics; Zero-shot learning; Down-stream; Fine tuning; Foundation models; Geo-spatial; Geo-spatial data; Geospatial artificial intelligence; Large scale data; Multi-modal; Multi-modal learning; Performance; artificial intelligence; language; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; spatial data; Learning systems

Nowadays, while deep learning approaches are dominating the mobility prediction field where various model architectures/designs are continuously updating to push up the prediction accuracy, there naturally arises a question: whether these models are sufficiently good to reach the best possible prediction accuracy? To answer this question, predictability study is a method that quantifies the inherent regularities of the human mobility data and links the result to that limit. Mainstream predictability studies achieve this by analyzing the individual trajectories and merging all individual results to obtain an upper bound. However, the multiple individuals composing the city are not totally independent and the individual behavior is heavily influenced by its implicit or explicit surroundings. Therefore, the collective factor should be considered in the mobility predictability measurement, which has not been addressed before. This vision paper points out this concern and envisions a few potential research problems along such an individual-To-collective transition from both data and methodology aspects. We hope the discussion in this paper sheds some light on the human mobility predictability community. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",behavior predication; collective behavior; crowd behavior; Mobile behavior; predictability,Behavioral research; Deep learning; Forecasting; Telecommunication services; Behavior predication; Collective behaviour; Crowd behavior; Down-stream; Human mobility; Location-based services; Mobile behavior; Predictability; Prediction accuracy; Urban dynamics; collective action; machine learning; prediction; social mobility; Location based services

Recently, we have seen a plethora of research efforts that tackle these applications. However, research progress in this field is limited by a lack of large and representative datasets. The largest and most commonly used dataset of individual human trajectories captures fewer than 200 individuals, while datasets of individual human check-ins capture fewer than 100 check-ins per city per day. Thus, it is not clear if findings from the human mobility data science community would generalize to large populations. Since obtaining massive, representative, and individual-level human mobility data is hard to come by due to privacy considerations, the vision of this work is to embrace the use of data generated by large-scale socially realistic microsimulations. Informed by both real data and leveraging social and behavioral theories, massive spatially explicit microsimulations may allow us to simulate entire megacities at the person level. The simulated worlds, which do not capture any identifiable personal information, allow us to perform ""in silico""experiments using the simulated world as a sandbox in which we have perfect information and perfect control without jeopardizing the privacy of any actual individual. In silico experiments have become commonplace in other scientific domains such as chemistry and biology, permitting experiments that foster the understanding of concepts without any harm to individuals. This work describes challenges and opportunities for leveraging massive and realistic simulated alternate worlds for in silico human mobility data science. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",in silico; location-based social network data; mobility data science; Spatial simulation; trajectory data,Data privacy; Data Science; Large datasets; Population statistics; Human mobility; In-silico; Location-based social network data; Location-based social networks; Microsimulation; Mobility data science; Mobility datum; Network data; Spatial simulation; Trajectories datum; data set; experimental study; simulation; social mobility; social network; Trajectories

This imperative is exacerbated by the observation that improvements, by data analytics, in one segment of urban mobility typically have unintended and often adverse consequences in other segments. In this vision paper we argue for a data analytics agenda to advance climate action at the core of urban mobility research.

Topology-Aware operators have been defined to coarsen a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) without affecting the topology of its underlying terrain, i.e., without modifying critical features of the terrain, such as pits, saddles, peaks, and their connectivity. However, their scalability is limited for large-scale meshes. Our proposed algorithm uses a batched processing strategy to reduce both the memory and time requirements of the simplification process, and thanks to the spatial decomposition on the basis of Terrain trees, it can be easily parallelized. Also, since a Terrain tree after the simplification process becomes less compact and efficient, we propose an efficient post-processing step for updating hierarchical spatial decomposition. Our experiments on real-world TINs, derived from topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data, demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, topology-Aware simplification on Terrain trees uses 40% less memory and half the time compared to the most compact and efficient connectivity-based data structure for TINs. Furthermore, the parallel simplification algorithm on the Terrain trees exhibits a 12× speedup with an OpenMP implementation. The quality of the output mesh is not significantly affected by the distributed and parallel simplification strategy of Terrain trees, and we obtain similar quality levels compared to the global baseline method. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",edge contraction; shared memory processing; spatial indexes; Terrain simplification; topological methods,Application programming interfaces (API); Data structures; Landforms; Mesh generation; Trees (mathematics); Triangulation; Edge contractions; Mesh simplifications; Shared memory; Shared memory processing; Simplification algorithms; Spatial decompositions; Spatial indexes; Terrain simplification; Topological methods; Topology aware; algorithm; baseline survey; decomposition analysis; lidar; memory; terrain; topology; Scalability
Regionalization-Based Collaborative Filtering: Harnessing Geographical Information in Recommenders,2024,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198019640&doi=10.1145%2f3656641&partnerID=40&md5=afa9e535038c7786d8d045f3c74e96fc,"Regionalization, also known as spatially constrained clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify and define spatially contiguous regions. In this work, we introduce a methodology to regionalize recommendation systems (RSs) based on a collaborative filtering approach. Two main challenges arise when performing regionalization based on users' preferences in RSs: (1) unstructured data, as interactions are often scarce and observed on a smaller scale; and (2) the difficulty of evaluation of the quality of the clustering results. To address these challenges, our methodology relies on inductive matrix completion (IMC), a fundamental approach to recover unknown entries of a rating matrix while utilizing region information to extract a region-based feature matrix. With this feature matrix, our method becomes adaptive and seamlessly integrates with various regionalization algorithms to create regionalization candidates. This enables us to derive more accurate recommendations that consider regionalized effects and discover interesting patterns in localized user behavior. We experimentally evaluate our model on synthetic datasets to demonstrate its efficacy in settings where our underlying assumptions are correct. Furthermore, we present a real-world case study illustrating the interpretable information the model can derive in terms of regionalized recommendation relevance. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",inductive matrix completion; Recommender systems; regionalization algorithms,Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Collaborative filtering; Learning systems; Quality control; Constrained clustering; Feature matrices; Geographical information; Inductive matrix; Inductive matrix completion; Machine learning techniques; Matrix completion; Regionalisation; Regionalization algorithms; Unsupervised machine learning; algorithm; data set; GIS; machine learning; methodology; regionalization; Recommender systems

Existing techniques have not fully exploited such data to help practitioners perform a deep analysis of large online communities. Lack of scalability hinders analyzing communities of large sizes and requires tremendous system resources and unacceptable runtime. This article proposes a new analytical query that identifies the top-k posts that a given user community has interacted with during a specific time interval and within a spatial range. We propose a novel indexing framework that captures the interactions of users and communities to provide a low query latency. Moreover, we propose exact and approximate algorithms to process the query efficiently and utilize the index content to prune the search space.

STICAP: Spatio-temporal Interactive Attention for Citywide Crowd Activity Prediction,2024,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189477250&doi=10.1145%2f3603375&partnerID=40&md5=997d47d14db6b41370b15167c35746c4,"Accurate citywide crowd activity prediction (CAP) can enable proactive crowd mobility management and timely responses to urban events, which has become increasingly important for a myriad of smart city planning and management purposes. However, complex correlations across the crowd activities, spatial and temporal urban environment features and their interactive dependencies, and relevant external factors (e.g., weather conditions) make it highly challenging to predict crowd activities accurately in terms of different venue categories (for instance, venues related to dining, services, and residence) and varying degrees (e.g., daytime and nighttime). To address the above concerns, we propose STICAP, a citywide spatio-temporal interactive crowd activity prediction approach. In particular, STICAP takes in the location-based social network check-in data (e.g., from Foursquare/Gowalla) as the model inputs and forecasts the crowd activity within each time step for each venue category. Furthermore, we have integrated multiple levels of temporal discretization to interactively capture the relations with historical data. Then, three parallel Residual Spatial Attention Networks (RSAN) in the Spatial Attention Component exploit the hourly, daily, and weekly spatial features of crowd activities, which are further fused and processed by the Temporal Attention Component for interactive CAP. Along with other external factors such as weather conditions and holidays, STICAP adaptively and accurately forecasts the final crowd activities per venue category, enabling potential activity recommendation and other smart city applications. Extensive experimental studies based on three different real-world crowd activity datasets have demonstrated that our proposed STICAP outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms in CAP accuracy, with an average error reduction of 35.02%.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The creation and use of HD maps rely on advances in multiple disciplines, such as computer vision/object perception, geographic information systems, sensing, simultaneous localization and mapping, machine learning, etc. To date, several survey papers have been published describing the literature related to HD maps and their use in specialized contexts.

While recent advances exploit graph neural networks (GNN) to better learn spatial and temporal dependencies between sensors, they cannot model time-evolving spatio-temporal correlations (STC) between sensors and require pre-defined graphs, which are neither always available nor totally reliable, and target at only a specific type of sensor data at one time. Moreover, since the form of time-series fluctuation is varied across sensors, a model needs to learn fluctuation modulation. To tackle these issues, in this work, we propose a novel GNN-based model, Attention-adjusted Graph Spatio-Temporal Network (AGSTN). In AGSTN, multi-graph convolution with sequential learning is developed to learn time-evolving STC. Fluctuation modulation is realized by a proposed attention adjustment mechanism. Experiments on three sensor data, air quality, bike demand, and traffic flow, exhibit that AGSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Spatially-Aware Data-Driven Approach to Automatically Geocoding Non-Gazetteer Place Names,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189464974&doi=10.1145%2f3627987&partnerID=40&md5=c4e19fb351c3e74189e5f476290acd16,"Human and natural processes such as navigation and natural calamities are intrinsically linked to the geographic space and described using place names. Extraction and subsequent geocoding of place names from text are critical for understanding the onset, progression, and end of these processes. Geocoding place names extracted from text requires using an external knowledge base such as a gazetteer. However, a standard gazetteer is typically incomplete. Additionally, widely used place name geocoding - also known as toponym resolution - approaches generally focus on geocoding ambiguous but known gazetteer place names. Hence, there is a need for an approach to automatically geocode non-gazetteer place names. In this research, we demonstrate that patterns in place names are not spatially random. Places are often named based on people, geography, and history of the area and thus exhibit a degree of similarity. Similarly, places that co-occur in text are likely to be spatially proximate as they provide geographic reference to common events. We propose a novel data-driven spatially-aware algorithm, Bhugol, that leverages the spatial patterns and the spatial context of place names to automatically geocode the non-gazetteer place names. The efficacy of Bhugol is demonstrated using two diverse geographic areas - USA and India. The results show that Bhugol outperforms well-known state-of-the-art geocoders.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Robust Routing Using Electrical Flows,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179122693&doi=10.1145%2f3567421&partnerID=40&md5=623bb1ccc89c7c7acbc13c76781b4226,"Generating alternative routes in road networks is an application of significant interest for online navigation systems. A high quality set of diverse alternate routes offers two functionalities - (a) support multiple (unknown) preferences that the user may have; and (b) robust changes in network conditions. We formulate a new quantification of the latter in this paper, and propose a novel method to produce alternative routes based on concepts from electrical flows and their decompositions. Our method is fundamentally different from the main techniques that produce alternative routes in road networks, which are the penalty and the plateau methods, with the former providing high quality results but being too slow for practical use and the latter being fast but suffering in terms of quality. We evaluate our method against the penalty and plateau methods, showing that it is as fast as the plateau method while also recovering much of the headroom towards the quality of the penalty method. The metrics we use to evaluate performance include the stretch (the average cost of the routes), the diversity, and the robustness (the connectivity between the origin and destination) of the induced set of routes.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).",algorithms; alternates; electrical flows; road networks; Routing,Constrained optimization; Online systems; Quality control; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Alternate; Alternate routes; Alternative routes; Electrical flows; High quality; In networks; On-line navigation; Road network; Robust routing; Routings; algorithm; electrical method; navigation; road; robotics; routing; Navigation systems
Multimodal Deep Learning for Robust Road Attribute Detection,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179127474&doi=10.1145%2f3618108&partnerID=40&md5=49975449e0cfa96e6a07064d19f076a0,"Automatic inference of missing road attributes (e.g., road type and speed limit) for enriching digital maps has attracted significant research attention in recent years. A number of machine learning-based approaches have been proposed to detect road attributes from GPS traces, dash-cam videos, or satellite images. However, existing solutions mostly focus on a single modality without modeling the correlations among multiple data sources. To bridge this gap, we present a multimodal road attribute detection method, which improves the robustness by performing pixel-level fusion of crowdsourced GPS traces and satellite images. A GPS trace is usually given by a sequence of location, bearing, and speed. To align it with satellite imagery in the spatial domain, we render GPS traces into a sequence of multi-channel images that simultaneously capture the global distribution of the GPS points, the local distribution of vehicles' moving directions and speeds, and their temporal changes over time, at each pixel. Unlike previous GPS-based road feature extraction methods, our proposed GPS rendering does not require map matching in the data preprocessing step. Moreover, our multimodal solution addresses single-modal challenges such as occlusions in satellite images and data sparsity in GPS traces by learning the pixel-wise correspondences among different data sources. On top of this, we observe that geographic objects and their attributes in the map are not isolated but correlated with each other. Thus, if a road is partially labeled, then the existing information can be of great help on inferring the missing attributes. To fully use the existing information, we extend our model and discuss the possibilities for further performance improvement when partially labeled map data is available. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets in Singapore and Jakarta. Compared with previous work, our method is able to improve the detection accuracy on road attributes by a large margin.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).

To enable spatial data analytics, spatial data needs to be streamed into a data stream warehouse system that can provide real-time analytical results over the most recent and historical spatial data in the warehouse. Existing data stream warehouse systems are not tailored for spatial data. In this article, we introduce the STAR system. STAR is a distributed in-memory data stream warehouse system that provides low-latency and up-to-date analytical results over a fast-arriving spatial data stream. STAR supports both snapshot and continuous queries that are composed of aggregate functions and ad hoc query constraints over spatial, textual, and temporal data attributes. STAR implements a cache-based mechanism to facilitate the processing of snapshot queries that collectively utilizes the techniques of query-based caching (i.e., view materialization) and object-based caching. Moreover, to speed up processing continuous queries, STAR proposes a novel index structure that achieves high efficiency in both object checking and result updating. Extensive experiments over real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of STAR over existing systems.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).

This article focuses on multi-criteria distributed and competitive route planning for stationary resources in regions where neither real-time nor historical availability of the targeted resource is accessible. We propose an inference-than-planning approach, with an availability inference for stationary resources in areas with no sensor coverage and a distributed routing where no information is shared among agents. We leverage the inferred availability and network structure in the searching space to suggest a two-stage algorithm with three relaxing policies: adjacent cruising, on-orbital annealing, and orbital transitioning. We take two publicly accessible parking-slot datasets from San Francisco and Melbourne for evaluation. Overall results show that the proposed availability inference model can retain decent performance.

Important use cases for location data rely on statistical queries, e.g., identifying hotspots where users work and travel. Such queries can be answered efficiently by building histograms. However, precise histograms can expose sensitive details about individual users. Differential privacy (DP) is a mature and widely adopted protection model, but most approaches for DP-compliant histograms work in a data-independent fashion, leading to poor accuracy. The few proposed data-dependent techniques attempt to adjust histogram partitions based on dataset characteristics, but they do not perform well due to the addition of noise required to achieve DP. In addition, they use ad hoc criteria to decide the depth of the partitioning. We identify density homogeneity as a main factor driving the accuracy of DP-compliant histograms, and we build a data structure that splits the space such that data density is homogeneous within each resulting partition. We propose a self-tuning approach to decide the depth of the partitioning structure that optimizes the use of privacy budget. Furthermore, we provide an optimization that scales the proposed split approach to large datasets while maintaining accuracy. We show through extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing approaches.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",differential privacy; Location protection,Budget control; Graphic methods; Large dataset; Sensitive data; Urban transportation; Differential privacies; Geo-spatial; Homogeneous tree; Hotspots; Location data; Location protection; Mobile app; Selftuning; Statistical queries; Tuning structure; accuracy assessment; data set; histogram; host location; mobile communication; mobile phone; software; Location

Computing the time-varying distance between moving bodies and surrounding static and moving objects is crucial to many application domains including safety at sea, logistics robots, and autonomous vehicles. Not only is it a relevant analytical operation in itself, but also it forms the basis of other operations, such as finding the nearest approach distance between two moving objects. Most moving objects databases represent moving objects using a point representation, and the computed temporal distance is thus inaccurate when working with large moving objects. This article presents an efficient algorithm to compute the temporal distance between a moving body and other static or moving geometries. We extend the idea of the V-Clip and Lin-Canney closest features algorithms of computational geometry to track the temporal evolution of the closest pair of features between two objects during their movement. We also present a working implementation of this algorithm in an open-source moving objects database and show, using a real-world example on AIS data, that this distance operator for moving bodies is only about 1.5 times as slow as the one for moving points while providing significant improvements in correctness and accuracy of the results.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).

For example, trucks may be penalized for early or late arrivals at compact terminals, and early and late arrivals at general practitioners, dentists, and so on, are also discouraged, in part due to COVID. We propose foundations for routing with arrival-window constraints. In a setting where the travel time of a road segment is modeled by a probability distribution, we define two problems where the aim is to find a route from a source to a destination that optimizes or yields a high probability of arriving within a time window while departing as late as possible. In this setting, a core challenge is to enable comparison between paths that may potentially be part of a result path with the goal of determining whether a path is uninteresting and can be disregarded given the existence of another path. We show that existing solutions cannot be applied in this problem setting and instead propose novel comparison methods. Additionally, we introduce the notion of Stochastic Arrival-Window Contraction Hierarchies that enable accelerated query processing in the article's setting. Next, we present routing algorithms that exploit the above comparison methods in combination with so-called pivot paths and contraction hierarchies to enable efficient processing of the two types of queries. Finally, a detailed experimental study provides empirical insights that justify the need for the two types of routing and also offers insight into key characteristics of the problem solutions.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).

A recent regionalization problem, called MP-regions, groups spatial areas to produce a maximum number of regions by enforcing a user-defined constraint at the regional level. The MP-regions problem is NP-hard. Existing approximate algorithms for MP-regions do not scale for large datasets due to their high computational cost and inherently centralized approaches to process data. This article introduces a parallel scalable regionalization framework (PAGE) to support MP-regions on large datasets. The proposed framework works in two stages. The first stage finds an initial solution through randomized search, and the second stage improves this solution through efficient heuristic search. To build an initial solution efficiently, we extend traditional spatial partitioning techniques to enable parallelized region building without violating the spatial constraints. Furthermore, we optimize the region building efficiency and quality by tuning the randomized area selection to trade off runtime with region homogeneity.

Deep Spatial Prediction via Heterogeneous Multi-source Self-supervision,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172671063&doi=10.1145%2f3605358&partnerID=40&md5=39290a45a869dad00216e827cb2413bf,"Spatial prediction is to predict the values of the targeted variable, such as PM2.5 values and temperature, at arbitrary locations based on the collected geospatial data. It greatly affects the key research topics in geoscience in terms of obtaining heterogeneous spatial information (e.g., soil conditions, precipitation rates, wheat yields) for geographic modeling and decision-making at local, regional, and global scales. In situ data, collected by ground-level in situ sensors, and remote sensing data, collected by satellite or aircraft, are two important data sources for this task. In situ data are relatively accurate while sparse and unevenly distributed. Remote sensing data cover large spatial areas, but are coarse with low spatiotemporal resolution and prone to interference. How to synergize the complementary strength of these two data types is still a grand challenge. Moreover, it is difficult to model the unknown spatial predictive mapping while handling the tradeoff between spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity. Third, representing spatial relations without substantial information loss is also a critical issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Self-supervised Spatial Prediction (HSSP) framework that synergizes multi-source data by minimizing the inconsistency between in situ and remote sensing observations. We propose a new deep geometric spatial interpolation model as the prediction backbone that automatically interpolates the values of the targeted variable at unknown locations based on existing observations by taking into account both distance and orientation information. Our proposed interpolator is proven to both be the general form of popular interpolation methods and preserve spatial information. The spatial prediction is enhanced by a novel error-compensation framework to capture the prediction inconsistency due to spatial heterogeneity. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets and demonstrated our model's superiority in performance over state-of-The-Art models.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

At the same time, word clouds are a popular visualization tool to show the most important words in text data which has also been extended to visualize geospatial data (Buchin et al. PacificVis 2016). In this article, we study a hybrid visualization, which combines aspects of word clouds and point labeling. In the considered setting, the input data consist of a set of points grouped into categories and our aim is to place multiple disjoint and axis-Aligned rectangles, each representing a category, such that they cover points of (mostly) the same category under some natural quality constraints. In our visualization, we then place category names inside the computed rectangles to produce a labeling of the covered points which summarizes the predominant categories globally (in a word-cloud-like fashion) while locally avoiding excessive misrepresentation of points (i.e., retaining the precision of point labeling). We show that computing a minimum set of such rectangles is NP-hard. Hence, we turn our attention to developing a heuristic with (optional) exact components using SAT models to compute our visualizations. We evaluate our algorithms quantitatively, measuring running time and quality of the produced solutions, on several synthetic and real-world data sets. Our experiments show that the fully heuristic approach produces solutions of comparable quality to heuristics combined with exact SAT models, while running much faster.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesLabeling; categorical point data; word clouds,Data visualization; Geometry; Heuristic methods; Maps; Additional key word and phraseslabeling; Categorical point data; Classical problems; Feature labeling; Key words; Labelings; Point data; Point features; SAT model; Word clouds; detection method; GIS; heuristics; visualization; Visualization
Agent Based Modeling of the Spread of Social Unrest Using Infectious Disease Models,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172411930&doi=10.1145%2f3587463&partnerID=40&md5=72ff5b62c0974dc203ee4b3295d124bd,"Prior research suggests that the timing and location of social unrest may be influenced by similar unrest activities in another nearby region, potentially causing a spread of unrest activities across space and time. In this paper, we model the spread of social unrest across time and space using a novel approach, grounded in agent-based modeling (ABM). In it, regions (geographic polygons) are represented as agents that transition from one state to another based on changes in their environment. Our approach involves (1) creating a vector for each region/agent based on socio-demographic, infrastructural, economic, geographic, and environmental (SIEGE) factors, (2) formulating a neighborhood distance function to identify an agent's neighbors based on geospatial distance and SIEGE proximity, (3) designing transition probability equations based on two distinct compartmental models-i.e., the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models, and (4) building a ground truth for evaluating the simulations. We use ABM to determine the individualized probabilities of each region/agent to transition from one state to another. The models are tested using the districts of three states in India as agents at a monthly scale for 2016-2019. For ground truth of unrest events, we use the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) dataset. Our findings include that (1) the transition probability equations are viable, (2) the agent-based modeling of the spread of social unrest is feasible while treating regions as agents (Brier's score < 0.25 for two out of three regions), and (3) the SIS model performs comparatively better than the SIR model. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Variants have also been considered which take other factors into consideration, such as broader (implicit or explicit) semantic constraints as well as the limitations on the length of the trip. In this work, we present an efficient algorithmic solution to a novel query-PaDOC (Paths with Distance, Origin, and Category constraints)-which combines the generation of a path that (a) can be traversed within a user-specified budget (e.g., limit on distance), (b) starts at one of the user-specified origin locations (e.g., a hotel), and (c) contains PoIs from a user-specified list of PoI categories. We show that the problem of deciding whether such a path exists is an NP-hard problem.

This issue frequently brings more difficulty to relevant learning tasks, such as trajectory imputation and prediction. Nowadays, little existing work simultaneously deals with imputation and prediction on human trajectories. This work plans to explore whether the learning process of imputation and prediction could benefit from each other to achieve better outcomes. And the question will be answered by studying the coexistence patterns between missing points and observed ones in incomplete trajectories. More specifically, the proposed model develops an imputation component based on the self-attention mechanism to capture the coexistence patterns between observations and missing points among encoder-decoder layers. Meanwhile, a recurrent unit is integrated to extract the sequential embeddings from newly imputed sequences for predicting the following location. Furthermore, a new implementation called Imputation Cycle is introduced to enable gradual imputation with prediction enhancement at multiple levels, which helps to accelerate the speed of convergence. The experimental results on three different real-world mobility datasets show that the proposed approach has significant advantages over the competitive baselines across both imputation and prediction tasks in terms of accuracy and stability.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Given an n vertex trajectory P and an m vertex query trajectory Q, we seek to report a vertex-aligned sub-trajectory P′ of P that is closest to Q, i.e., P′ must start and end on contiguous vertices of P. Since in real data P typically contains a very large number of vertices, we focus on answering queries, without restrictions on P or Q, using only precomputed structures of (n) size.We use three baseline algorithms from straightforward extensions of known work; however, they have impractical performance on realistic inputs. Therefore, we propose a new Hierarchical Simplification Tree (HST) data structure and an adaptive clustering-based query algorithm that efficiently explores relevant parts of P. The core of our query methods is a novel greedy-backtracking algorithm that solves the Fréchet decision problem using (n+m) space and O(nm) time in the worst case.Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our heuristic effectively prunes the search space and greatly reduces computations compared to baseline approaches.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

UAVs are given a flight plan each, which they execute autonomously. A flight plan consists of a series of GPS coordinates and altitudes that indicate where the UAV stops and hovers momentarily to capture an image of stationary targets on ground. A PSR algorithm is proposed that, given any two images and corresponding GPS coordinates and altitude, estimates the overlap between the images, identifies targets in the overlapping area, and matches these targets according to the geometric patterns they form. The algorithm estimates the overlap considering the error in UAVs' locations due to wind, and it differentiates similar geometrical patterns by their GPS location. The algorithm is evaluated using the percentage of targets in the overlapping area that are matched correctly and the percentage of overlapping images matched correctly. The target-matching rate achieved using only the GPS locations of targets varied from 44% to 55% for target densities that varied from 6.4 down to 3.2 targets/m2.

Accurate prediction of future crime occurrences along with the reason behind a prediction would allow us to plan the crime prevention steps accordingly. The key challenge in developing the model is to capture the non-linear and dynamic spatial dependency and temporal patterns of a specific crime category, while keeping the underlying structure of the model interpretable. In this article, we develop AIST, an Attention-based Interpretable Spatio Temporal Network for crime prediction. AIST models the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations for a crime category based on past crime occurrences, external features (e.g., traffic flow and point of interest information) and recurring trends of crime.

Representing urban regions are essential for exploring, understanding, and predicting properties and features of cities. The enrichment of multi-modal urban big data has provided opportunities for researchers to enhance urban region embedding. However, existing works failed to develop an integrated pipeline that fully utilizes effective and informative data sources within geographic units. In this article, we regard a geo-tile as a geographic unit and propose a multi-modal and multi-stage representation learning framework, namely Geo-Tile2Vec, for urban analytics, especially for urban region properties identification. Specifically, in the early stage, geo-tile embeddings are firstly inferred through dynamic mobility events which are combinations of point-of-interest (POI) data and trajectory data by a Word2Vec-like model and metric learning. Then, in the latter stage, we use static street-level imagery to further enrich the embedding information by metric learning. Lastly, the framework learns distributed geo-tile embeddings for the given multi-modal data. We conduct experiments on real-world urban datasets. Four downstream tasks, i.e., main POI category classification task, main land use category classification task, restaurant average price regression task, and firm number regression task, are adopted for validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in representing geo-tiles. Our proposed framework can significantly improve the performances of all downstream tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate that geo-tiles with similar urban region properties are geometrically closer in the vector space.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesMulti-modal learning; representative learning; unsupervised learning; urban computing,Land use; Modal analysis; Unsupervised learning; Vector spaces; Additional key word and phrasesmulti-modal learning; Embeddings; Geographics; Key words; Metric learning; Multi-modal; Multi-stages; Representative learning; Urban computing; Urban regions; algorithm; data set; integrated approach; unsupervised classification; urban area; urban region; Embeddings
Dynamic Straggler Mitigation for Large-Scale Spatial Simulations,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162734349&doi=10.1145%2f3578933&partnerID=40&md5=a76dde43303aec88de4ac59a54bc2a27,"Spatial simulations have been widely used to study real-world environments, such as transportation systems. Applications like prediction and analysis of transportation require the simulation to handle millions of objects while running faster than real time. Running such large-scale simulation requires high computational power, which can be provided through parallel distributed computing. Implementations of parallel distributed spatial simulations usually follow a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model to ensure the correctness of simulation. The processing in BSP is divided into iterations of computation and communication, running on multiple workers, followed by a global barrier synchronisation to ensure that all communications are concluded. Unfortunately, the BSP model is plagued by the straggler problem, where a delay in any worker slows down the entire simulation. Stragglers may occur for many reasons, including imbalanced workload distribution or communication and synchronisation delays. The straggler problem can become more severe with increasing parallelism and continuous change of workload distribution among workers. This article proposes methods to dynamically mitigate stragglers and tackle communication delays. The proposed strategies can rebalance the workload distribution during simulation. These methods employ the spatial properties of the simulated environments to combine a flexible synchronisation model with decentralised dynamic load balancing and on-demand resource allocation. All proposed methods are implemented and evaluated using a microscopic traffic simulator as an example of large-scale spatial simulations. We run traffic simulations for Melbourne, Beijing and New York with different straggler scenarios.

Temporal models on evolving networks are crucial in applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example, a disease spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions between individuals occurring with different frequency, proximity, and venue population density. Similarly, propagation of information having a limited active period, such as rumors, depends on the temporal dynamics of social interactions. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the Temporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model with a spread function that efficiently utilizes a hypergraph-based sampling strategy and dynamic propagation probabilities. We prove this function to be submodular, with guarantees of approximation quality. This enables scalable analysis on highly granular temporal networks where other models struggle, such as when the spread across connections exhibits arbitrary temporally evolving patterns. We then introduce the notion of ""reverse spread""using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop novel solutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible nodes. Extensive analysis on real-world datasets shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by considering evolving network topology alongside granular contact/interaction information. Our approach has numerous applications, such as virus/rumor/influence tracking. Utilizing T-IC, we explore vital challenges of monitoring the impact of various intervention strategies over real spatio-temporal contact networks where we show our approach to be highly effective.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We first present a logarithmic-time online algorithm to find dwell regions in an incoming stream of object positions. Our method maintains the upper and lower bounds for the radius of the smallest circle enclosing the object positions, thereby greatly reducing the number of trajectory points needed to evaluate the query. It approximates the radius of the smallest circle enclosing a given subtrajectory within an arbitrarily small user-defined factor and is also able to efficiently answer decision queries asking whether or not a dwell region exists. For the offline version of the dwell region problem, we first extend our online approach to develop the ρ-Index, which indexes subtrajectories using query radius ranges. We then refine this approach to obtain the τ-Index, which indexes subtrajectories using both query radius ranges and dwell durations.

In this article, we focus on a specific type of SOP called spatial partitioning, which is a combinatorial problem due to the presence of discrete spatial units. Exact optimization methods do not scale with the size of the problem, especially within practicable time limits. This motivated us to develop population-based metaheuristics for solving such SOPs. However, the search operators employed by these population-based methods are mostly designed for real-parameter continuous optimization problems. For adapting these methods to SOPs, we apply domain knowledge in designing spatially aware search operators for efficiently searching through the discrete search space while preserving the spatial constraints. To this end, we put forward a simple yet effective algorithm called swarm-based spatial memetic algorithm (SPATIAL) and test it on the school (re)districting problem. Detailed experimental investigations are performed on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of SPATIAL. Besides, ablation studies are performed to understand the role of the individual components of SPATIAL. Additionally, we discuss how SPATIAL is helpful in the real-life planning process and its applicability to different scenarios and motivate future research directions. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Metaheuristic; Redistricting; Spatial optimization,Domain Knowledge; Decision variables; Memetic algorithms; Metaheuristic; Optimization problems; Partitioning problem; Redistricting; Search operators; Spatial optimization; Spatial partitioning; Spatial relationships; algorithm; knowledge; optimization; parameter estimation; planning process; Optimization

The relatively high frequency of microwaves increases their ability to transfer information at a high rate, but it also makes them susceptible to spatial obstructions and interference. Hence, when deploying wireless links, there are two conflicting considerations. First, the antennas height, selected from the available slots on each tower, should be as low as possible. Second, there should be a line of sight (LoS) between the antennas, and a buffer around the LoS defined by the first Fresnel zone should be clear of obstacles. To compute antenna heights, a planning system for wireless links has to maintain an elevation model, efficiently discover obstacles between towers, and execute Fresnel-zone clearance tests over a 3D model of the deployment area. In this article we present a system and algorithms for computing the height of antennas, by testing LoS and clearance of Fresnel zones. The system handles the following requirements: (1) the need to cover large areas, e.g., all of the USA, (2) big distance between towers, e.g., 100 kilometers, and (3) computing batches of thousands of pairs within a few minutes. We introduce three novel algorithms for efficient computation of antenna heights, we show how to effectively model and manage the large-scale geospatial data needed for the planning, and we present the results of tests over real-world settings. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Backhaul links; Elevation model; Fresnel zone; Geospatial database; Line of sight; Microwave; Network planning,United States; 3D modeling; Computational efficiency; Optical fibers; Slot antennas; Backhaul links; Elevation models; Fresnel zones; Geospatial database; Line of Sight; Lines-of-sight; Microwave backhauls; Network planning; Wireless backhaul; Wireless link; algorithm; antenna; database; elevation; planning system; telecommunication; testing method; Towers

To alleviate the heavy burden of them and produce consistent urban plans, we want to ask that can AI accelerate the urban planning process, so that human planners only adjust generated configurations for specific needs? The recent advance of deep generative models provides a possible answer, which inspires us to automate urban planning from an adversarial learning perspective. However, three major challenges arise: (1) how to define a quantitative land-use configuration? (2) how to automate configuration planning? (3) how to evaluate the quality of a generated configuration? In this article, we systematically address the three challenges. Specifically, (1) We define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor. (2) We formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of deep generative learning. The objective is to generate a configuration tensor given the surrounding contexts of a target region. In particular, we first construct spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data crawled from websites to learn graph representations. We then combine each target area and its surrounding context representations as a tuple, and categorize all tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Next, we develop an adversarial learning framework, in which a generator takes the surrounding context representations as input to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish between positive and negative samples. (3) We provide quantitative evaluation metrics and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Generative adversarial networks; Graph neural networks; Representation learning; Urban planning,Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Generative adversarial networks; Graph neural networks; Land use; Quality control; Tensors; Adversarial learning; Constraint-based; Context representation; Domain knowledge; Graph neural networks; Learn+; Negative samples; Personal experience; Planning process; Representation learning; artificial neural network; land use; land use change; urban area; urban planning; urban population; Urban planning
A Review of Bayesian Networks for Spatial Data,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146277028&doi=10.1145%2f3516523&partnerID=40&md5=51554fe243d56e17fe5f258f18a779f5,"Bayesian networks are a popular class of multivariate probabilistic models as they allow for the translation of prior beliefs about conditional dependencies between variables to be easily encoded into their model structure. Due to their widespread usage, they are often applied to spatial data for inferring properties of the systems under study and also generating predictions for how these systems may behave in the future. We review published research on methodologies for representing spatial data with Bayesian networks and also summarize the application areas for which Bayesian networks are employed in the modeling of spatial data. We find that a wide variety of perspectives are taken, including a GIS-centric focus on efficiently generating geospatial predictions, a statistical focus on rigorously constructing graphical models controlling for spatial correlation, as well as a range of problem-specific heuristics for mitigating the effects of spatial correlation and dependency arising in spatial data analysis. Special attention is also paid to potential future directions for the integration of Bayesian networks with spatial processes. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Bayesian networks; Spatial statistics,Database systems; Geographic information systems; Application area; Bayesia n networks; Geo-spatial; GraphicaL model; Probabilistic models; Property; Spatial correlations; Spatial data; Spatial dependencies; Spatial statistics; Bayesian analysis; GIS; heuristics; spatial analysis; spatial data; Bayesian networks
Application of Kalman Filter to Large-scale Geospatial Data: Modeling Population Dynamics,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149004819&doi=10.1145%2f3563692&partnerID=40&md5=871f8e610047f2a6042ecf0d1d00094a,"To utilize a huge amount of observation data based on real-world events, a data assimilation process is needed to estimate the state of the system behind the observed data. The Kalman filter is a very commonly used technique in data assimilation, but it has a problem in terms of practical use from the viewpoint of processing efficiency and estimating the deterioration in precision when applied to particularly large-scale datasets. In this article, we propose a method that simultaneously addresses these problems and demonstrate its usefulness. The proposed method improves the processing efficiency and suppresses the deterioration in estimation precision by introducing correction processes focusing on the non-negative nature and sparseness of data in wavelet space. We show that the proposed method can accurately estimate population dynamics on the basis of an evaluation done using population data generated from cellular networks. In addition, the possibility of wide area abnormality detection using the proposed method is shown from a situation analysis of when Category 5 typhoon Hagibis made landfall in Japan. The proposed method has been deployed in a commercial service to estimate real-Time population dynamics in Japan.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Laser Range Scanners for Enabling Zero-overhead WiFi-based Indoor Localization System,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149007804&doi=10.1145%2f3539659&partnerID=40&md5=968ec053275708facf26433deb599321,"Robust and accurate indoor localization has been the goal of several research efforts over the past decade. Toward achieving this goal, WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems have been proposed. However, fingerprinting involves significant effort-especially when done at high density-and needs to be repeated with any change in the deployment area. While a number of recent systems have been introduced to reduce the calibration effort, these still trade overhead with accuracy. This article presents LiPhi++, an accurate system for enabling fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems without the associated data collection overhead. This is achieved by leveraging the sensing capability of transportable laser range scanners to automatically label WiFi scans, which can subsequently be used to build (and maintain) a fingerprint database. As part of its design, LiPhi++ leverages this database to train a deep long short-Term memory network utilizing the signal strength history from the detected access points. LiPhi++ also has provisions for handling practical deployment issues, including the noisy wireless environment, heterogeneous devices, among others. Evaluation of LiPhi++ using Android phones in two realistic testbeds shows that it can match the performance of manual fingerprinting techniques under the same deployment conditions without the overhead associated with the traditional fingerprinting process. In addition, LiPhi++ improves upon the median localization accuracy obtained from crowdsourcing-based and fingerprinting-based systems by 284% and 418%, respectively, when tested with data collected a few months later. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Deep learning; Fingerprinting; Indoor localization; Laser range scanners; WiFi,Deep learning; Indoor positioning systems; Data collection; Deep learning; Fingerprint database; Fingerprinting; Indoor localization; Indoor localization systems; Laser range scanners; Research efforts; Wi-Fi fingerprinting; Wifi; calibration; database; laser method; machine learning; research method; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)
1D and 2D Flow Routing on a Terrain,2023,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149003435&doi=10.1145%2f3539660&partnerID=40&md5=d59fc9297820aa764f6066af1f1d7d03,"An important problem in terrain analysis is modeling how water flows across a terrain creating floods by forming channels and filling depressions. In this article, we study a number of flow-query-related problems: Given a terrain ς, represented as a triangulated xy-monotone surface with n vertices, and a rain distribution R that may vary over time, determine how much water is flowing over a given vertex or edge as a function of time. We develop internal-memory as well as I/O-efficient algorithms for flow queries. This article contains four main algorithmic results:(i) An internal-memory algorithm for answering terrain-flow queries: Preprocess ς into a linear-size data structure so given a rain distribution R, the flow-rate functions of all vertices and edges of ς can be reported quickly. (ii) I/O-efficient algorithms for answering terrain-flow queries. (iii) An internal-memory algorithm for answering vertex-flow queries: Preprocess ς into a linear-size data structure so given a rain distribution R, the flow-rate function of a vertex under the single-flow direction (SFD) model can be computed quickly.(iv) An efficient algorithm that, given a path in ς and flow rate along , computes the two-dimensional channel along which water flows.Additionally, we implement a version of the terrain-flow query and 2D channel algorithms and examine a number of queries on real terrains. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Tensor Network Quantum Virtual Machine for Simulating Quantum Circuits at Exascale,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151078859&doi=10.1145%2f3547334&partnerID=40&md5=92f7f14490058fb5125caf1ae46a226f,"The numerical simulation of quantum circuits is an indispensable tool for development, verification, and validation of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms intended for near-term quantum co-processors. The emergence of exascale high-performance computing (HPC) platforms presents new opportunities for pushing the boundaries of quantum circuit simulation. We present a modernized version of the Tensor Network Quantum Virtual Machine (TNQVM) that serves as the quantum circuit simulation backend in the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) framework. The new version is based on the scalable tensor network processing library ExaTN (Exascale Tensor Networks). It provides multiple configurable quantum circuit simulators that perform either an exact quantum circuit simulation via the full tensor network contraction or an approximate simulation via a suitably chosen tensor factorization scheme. Upon necessity, stochastic noise modeling from real quantum processors is incorporated into the simulations by modeling quantum channels with Kraus tensors. By combining the portable XACC quantum programming frontend and the scalable ExaTN numerical processing backend, we introduce an end-to-end virtual quantum development environment that can scale from laptops to future exascale platforms. We report initial benchmarks of our framework, which include a demonstration of the distributed execution, incorporation of quantum decoherence models, and simulation of the random quantum circuits used for the certification of quantum supremacy on Google's Sycamore superconducting architecture.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",high performance computing; Quantum computing; quantum simulation,Network security; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Tensors; Timing circuits; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Co-processors; Exascale; High performance computing; Indispensable tools; Performance computing; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Quantum-classical; Verification-and-validation; Circuit simulation
Automatic Qubit Characterization and Gate Optimization with QubiC,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168737915&doi=10.1145%2f3529397&partnerID=40&md5=9ebc13c0807e910ed3239d3430ce06f2,"As the size and complexity of a quantum computer increases, quantum bit (qubit) characterization and gate optimization become complex and time-consuming tasks. Current calibration techniques require complicated and verbose measurements to tune up qubits and gates, which cannot easily expand to the large-scale quantum systems. We develop a concise and automatic calibration protocol to characterize qubits and optimize gates using QubiC, which is an open source FPGA (field-programmable gate array)-based control and measurement system for superconducting quantum information processors. We propose multi-dimensional loss-based optimization of single-qubit gates and full XY-plane measurement method for the two-qubit CNOT gate calibration. We demonstrate the QubiC automatic calibration protocols are capable of delivering high-fidelity gates on the state-of-the-art transmon-type processor operating at the Advanced Quantum Testbed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

TimeStitch: Exploiting Slack to Mitigate Decoherence in Quantum Circuits,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140285145&doi=10.1145%2f3548778&partnerID=40&md5=91b137134cc57ce133dab6b87d0e431a,"Quantum systems have the potential to demonstrate significant computational advantage, but current quantum devices suffer from the rapid accumulation of error that prevents the storage of quantum information over extended periods. The unintentional coupling of qubits to their environment and each other adds significant noise to computation, and improved methods to combat decoherence are required to boost the performance of quantum algorithms on real machines. While many existing techniques for mitigating error rely on adding extra gates to the circuit [13, 20, 56], calibrating new gates [50], or extending a circuit's runtime [32], this article's primary contribution leverages the gates already present in a quantum program without extending circuit duration. We exploit circuit slack for single-qubit gates that occur in idle windows, scheduling the gates such that their timing can counteract some errors.Spin-echo corrections that mitigate decoherence on idling qubits act as inspiration for this work. Theoretical models, however, fail to capture all sources of noise in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum devices, making practical solutions necessary that better minimize the impact of unpredictable errors in quantum machines. This article presents TimeStitch: a novel framework that pinpoints the optimum execution schedules for single-qubit gates within quantum circuits. TimeStitch, implemented as a compilation pass, leverages the reversible nature of quantum computation to boost the success of circuits on real quantum machines. Unlike past approaches that apply reversibility properties to improve quantum circuit execution [35], TimeStitch amplifies fidelity without violating critical path frontiers in either the slack tuning procedures or the final rescheduled circuit. On average, compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, a practically constrained TimeStitch achieves a mean 38% relative improvement in success rates, with a maximum of 106%, while observing bounds on circuit depth. When unconstrained by depth criteria, TimeStitch produces a mean relative fidelity increase of 50% with a maximum of 256%. Finally, when TimeStitch intelligently leverages periodic dynamical decoupling within its scheduling framework, a mean 64% improvement is observed over the baseline, relatively outperforming stand-alone dynamical decoupling by 19%, with a maximum of 287%. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",quantum circuit optimization; Quantum computing; quantum information,Logic gates; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Circuit optimization; Decoherence; Dynamical decoupling; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit optimization; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Quantum Information; Quantum machines; Single-qubit gates; Errors

We model this problem as an integer linear program, using a network flow formulation with binary variables that includes the initial allocation of qubits and their routing. We consider several cost functions: an approximation of the fidelity of the circuit, its total depth, and a measure of cross-talk, all of which can be incorporated in the model. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and different hardware topologies indicate that the error rate and depth can be optimized simultaneously without significant loss. We test our algorithm on a large number of quantum volume circuits, optimizing for error rate and depth; our algorithm significantly reduces the number of CNOTs compared to Qiskit's default transpiler SABRE [19] and produces circuits that, when executed on hardware, exhibit higher fidelity. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",discrete optimization; integer programming; Quantum compiler; qubit routing,Cost functions; Program compilers; Quantum optics; Qubits; Binary variables; Discrete optimization; Error rate; Integer linear programs; Integer Program- ming; Network flow formulation; Quantum circuit; Quantum compiler; Qubit routing; Routings; Integer programming
OpenQASM 3: A Broader and Deeper Quantum Assembly Language,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176901602&doi=10.1145%2f3505636&partnerID=40&md5=4379aec19c96e1429b05e1a025281821,"Quantum assembly languages are machine-independent languages that traditionally describe quantum computation in the circuit model. Open quantum assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of quantum operations. We add support for arbitrary control flow as well as calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",circuit scheduling; dynamic circuits; quantum circuits; Quantum computing; quantum programming languages,Computer programming languages; Qubits; Assembly-language; Circuit modeling; Circuit scheduling; Dynamic Circuits; Imperative programming languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum programming languages; Quantum-classical; Time-scales; Timing circuits

In this article, we show that, given some constraints on the classical algorithms, this quantum algorithm can be implemented in time O(√GT). Our algorithm is based on non-binary span programs and their efficient implementation. We conclude that various graph-theoretic problems including bipartiteness, cycle detection, and topological sort can be solved in time O(n3/2log2n) and with O(n3/2) quantum queries.

I-QER: An Intelligent Approach Towards Quantum Error Reduction,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176888128&doi=10.1145%2f3539613&partnerID=40&md5=24932f2f20d2308f5a3f8a92d6238e76,"Quantum computing has become a promising computing approach because of its capability to solve certain problems, exponentially faster than classical computers. A n-qubit quantum system is capable of providing 2n computational space to a quantum algorithm. However, quantum computers are prone to errors. Quantum circuits that can reliably run on today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are not only limited by their qubit counts but also by their noisy gate operations. In this article, we have introduced i-QER, a scalable machine learning-based approach to evaluate errors in a quantum circuit and reduce these without using any additional quantum resources. The i-QER predicts possible errors in a given quantum circuit using supervised learning models. If the predicted error is above a pre-specified threshold, it cuts the large quantum circuit into two smaller sub-circuits using an error-influenced fragmentation strategy for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The proposed fragmentation process is iterated until the predicted error reaches below the threshold for each sub-circuit. The sub-circuits are then executed on a quantum device. Classical reconstruction of the outputs obtained from the sub-circuits can generate the output of the complete circuit. Thus, i-QER also provides classical control over a scalable hybrid computing approach, which is a combination of quantum and classical computers.

The quantum software community has adopted Python on a number of large-scale efforts due to these characteristics, as well as the remote nature of near-term quantum processors. The use of Python has enabled quick prototyping for quantum code that directly benefits pertinent research and development efforts in quantum scientific computing. However, this rapid prototyping ability comes at the cost of future performant integration for tightly coupled CPU-QPU architectures with fast-feedback. Here, we present a language extension to Python that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical computing via a robust C++ infrastructure for quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation. Our work builds off the QCOR C++ language extension and compiler infrastructure to enable a single-source, quantum hardware-agnostic approach to quantum-classical computing that retains the performance required for tightly coupled CPU-QPU compute models.

Approximating Decision Diagrams for Quantum Circuit Simulation,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167344826&doi=10.1145%2f3530776&partnerID=40&md5=e87fc4892c3e60502167c6a4d4151685,"Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than conventional computers ever could. Underneath is a fundamentally different computational primitive that introduces new challenges for the development of software tools that aid designers of corresponding quantum algorithms. The different computational primitives render classical simulation of quantum circuits particularly challenging. While the logic simulation of conventional circuits is comparatively simple with linear complexity with respect to the number of gates, quantum circuit simulation has to deal with the exponential memory requirements to represent quantum states on non-quantum hardware with respect to the number of qubits. Decision Diagrams (DDs) address this challenge through exploitation of redundancies in matrices and vectors to provide significantly more compact representations in many cases. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of quantum computations enables another angle to tackle the complexity: Quantum algorithms are resistant to some degree against small inaccuracies in the quantum state as these only lead to small changes in the outcome probabilities. We propose to exploit this resistance against (small) errors to gain even more compact decision diagrams. In this work, we investigate the potential of approximation in quantum circuit simulation in detail. To this end, we first present four dedicated schemes that exploit the error resistance and efficiently approximate quantum states represented by decision diagrams. Subsequently, we propose two simulation strategies that utilize those approximations schemes in order to improve the efficiency of DD-based quantum circuit simulation, while, at the same time, allowing the user to control the resulting degradation in accuracy. We empirically show that the proposed approximation schemes reduce the size of decision diagrams substantially and also analytically prove the effect of multiple approximations on the attained accuracy. Eventually, this enables speed-ups of the resulting approximate quantum circuit simulation of up to several orders of magnitudes-again, while controlling the fidelity of the result. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",approximating; decision diagrams; quantum circuit simulation; Quantum computing,Computational complexity; Computer aided software engineering; Computer circuits; Graphic methods; Quantum computers; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Approximating; Approximation scheme; Conventional computers; Decision diagram; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit simulation; Quantum Computing; Quantum state; Circuit simulation

In this respect, decision diagrams provide a promising foundation for tackling many design tasks such as simulation, synthesis, and verification of quantum circuits. However, users of the corresponding tools often do not have a proper background or an intuition about how these methods based on decision diagrams work and what their strengths and limits are.

We thus introduce a new simulation method that exploits this sparsity to reduce memory usage and simulation runtime. Moreover, our prototype implementation includes optimizations such as gate (re)scheduling, which amortizes data structure accesses and reduces memory usage. To benchmark our implementation, we run quantum algorithms for factoring, for computing integer and elliptic curve discrete logarithms, and for chemistry.

QIRO: A Static Single Assignment-based Quantum Program Representation for Optimization,2022,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127928638&doi=10.1145%2f3491247&partnerID=40&md5=8a595593abf719d05f83326cd1bff30c,"We propose an IR for quantum computing that directly exposes quantum and classical data dependencies for the purpose of optimization. The Quantum Intermediate Representation for Optimization(QIRO) consists of two dialects, one input dialect and one that is specifically tailored to enable quantum-classical co-optimization. While the first employs a perhaps more intuitive memory-semantics (quantum operations act on qubits via side-effects), the latter uses value-semantics (operations consume and produce states) to integrate quantum dataflow in the IR's Static Single Assignment (SSA) graph. Crucially, this allows for a host of optimizations that leverage dataflow analysis. We discuss how to map existing quantum programming languages to the input dialect and how to lower the resulting IR to the optimization dialect. We present a prototype implementation based on MLIR that includes several quantum-specific optimization passes. Our benchmarks show that significant improvements in resource requirements are possible even through static optimization. In contrast to circuit optimization at run time, this is achieved while incurring only a small constant overhead in compilation time, making this a compelling approach for quantum program optimization at application scale.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",dataflow optimization; intermediate representation; MLIR; Quantum compilation,Application programs; Program compilers; Quantum computers; Semantics; Data dependencies; Dataflow optimization; Intermediate representations; MLIR; Optimisations; Program representations; Quantum compilation; Quantum Computing; Quantum-classical; Static single assignments; Data flow analysis

Using the recently introduced Grover Mixer-QAOA algorithm for discrete optimization, we generate fair sampling circuits to solve six problems of varying difficulty, each with several optimal solutions, which we then run on twenty backends across the IBM Q system. For a given circuit evaluated on a specific set of qubits, we evaluate: how frequently the qubits return an optimal solution to the problem, the fairness with which the qubits sample from all optimal solutions, and the reported hardware error rate of the qubits. To quantify fairness, we define a novel metric based on Pearson's χ2 test. We find that fairness is relatively high for circuits with small and large error rates, but drops for circuits with medium error rates. This indicates that structured errors dominate in this regime, while unstructured errors, which are random and thus inherently fair, dominate in noisier qubits and longer circuits.

This is near optimal with respect to both κ and ϵ, and is achieved without relying on complicated amplitude amplification procedures that are difficult to implement. Our method is applicable to general non-Hermitian matrices, and the cost as well as the number of qubits can be reduced when restricted to Hermitian matrices, and further to Hermitian positive definite matrices.

Since the resulting optimization problem is in general nonconvex, the method can converge to suboptimal parameter values that do not yield the minimum eigenvalue. In this work, we address this shortcoming by adopting the concept of variational adiabatic quantum computing (VAQC) as a procedure to improve VQE. In VAQC, the ground state of a continuously parameterized Hamiltonian is approximated via a parameterized quantum circuit. We discuss some basic theory of VAQC to motivate the development of a hybrid quantum-classical homotopy continuation method. The proposed method has parallels with a predictor-corrector method for numerical integration of differential equations. While there are theoretical limitations to the procedure, we see in practice that VAQC can successfully find good initial circuit parameters to initialize VQE. We demonstrate this with two examples from quantum chemistry. Through these examples, we provide empirical evidence that VAQC, combined with other techniques (an adaptive termination criteria for the classical optimizer and a variance-based resampling method for the expectation evaluation), can provide more accurate solutions than ""plain""VQE, for the same amount of effort.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",adiabatic computing; Variational methods,Computation theory; Differential equations; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Ground state; Hamiltonians; Numerical methods; Parameterization; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Adiabatic computing; Eigensolvers; Minimum eigenvalue; Optimisations; Optimization problems; Parameterized; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum-classical; Variational methods; Quantum chemistry

Significant optimisations have been achieved manually (pen and paper) and not by software. This is the first in-depth study on the cost of compiling and optimising large-scale quantum circuits with state-of-the-art quantum software. We propose a hierarchy of cost metrics covering the quantum software stack and use energy as the long-term cost of operating hardware. We are going to quantify optimisation costs by estimating the energy consumed by a CPU doing the quantum circuit optimisation. We use QUANTIFY, a tool based on Google Cirq, to optimise bucket brigade QRAM and multiplication circuits having between 32 and 8,192 qubits. Although our classical optimisation methods have polynomial complexity, we observe that their energy cost grows extremely fast with the number of qubits. We profile the methods and software and provide evidence that there are high constant costs associated to the operations performed during optimisation. The costs are the result of dynamically typed programming languages and the generic data structures used in the background.

The repeat-until-success algorithm has to be run O(κ/(1-ϵ)) times to succeed, leveraging amplitude amplification, and needs to be sampled O(1/ϵ2) times. Thus, the algorithm achieves an exponential improvement with respect to N over classical methods. In particular, we present efficient oracles for state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and a set of observables together with the corresponding error and complexity analyses. As the main result of this work, we show how to use Richardson extrapolation to enhance Hamiltonian simulation, resulting in an implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) within the algorithm with ϵ circuits that can be run in parallel each with circuit complexity ϵ instead of 1/ϵ. Furthermore, we analyze necessary conditions for the overall algorithm to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical methods.

Since every additional quantum gate takes time and introduces noise into the system, it is important to find the smallest possible quantum circuit that implements a given computation, especially for near-term quantum devices that can execute only a limited number of quantum gates before noise renders the computation useless. An important building block for many quantum circuit optimization techniques is pattern matching: given a large and small quantum circuit, we would like to find all maximal matches of the small circuit, called a pattern, in the large circuit, considering pairwise commutation of quantum gates. In this work, we present the first classical algorithm for pattern matching that provably finds all maximal matches and is efficient enough to be practical for circuit sizes typical for near-term devices.

This article investigates how to capitalize on quantum resources to accelerate the modeling of knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose the first quantum machine learning algorithm for inference on tensorized data, i.e., on knowledge graphs. Since most tensor problems are NP-hard [18], it is challenging to devise quantum algorithms to support the inference task. We simplify the modeling task by making the plausible assumption that the tensor representation of a knowledge graph can be approximated by its low-rank tensor singular value decomposition, which is verified by our experiments.

It is conjectured that the unitarity of quantum circuits provides possible regularization to avoid overfitting. However, it is not clear how the regularization interplays with the expressibility under the limitation of current Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum devices. In this article, we perform simulations and theoretical analysis of the quantum circuit learning problem with hardware-efficient ansatz. Thorough numerical simulations show that the expressibility and generalization error scaling of the ansatz saturate when the circuit depth increases, implying the automatic regularization to avoid the overfitting issue in the quantum circuit learning scenario. This observation is supported by the theory on PAC learnability, which proves that VC dimension is upper bounded due to the locality and unitarity of the hardware-efficient ansatz. Our study provides supporting evidence for automatic regularization by unitarity to suppress overfitting and guidelines for possible performance improvement under hardware constraints.  © 2021 ACM.",Expressibility; overfitting; quantum circuit; regularization,Electric network analysis; Learning systems; Expressibility; Function approximators; Higher dimensional function; Machine-learning; Overfitting; Quantum circuit; Quantum machines; Quantum processors; Regularisation; Unitarity; Timing circuits

Despite there being several strong results about identifying a linear function and distinguishing one from a sufficiently non-linear function, we found a surprising lack of work on computing the non-linearity of a function. The non-linearity is related to the Walsh coefficient with the largest absolute value; however, the naive attempt of picking the maximum after constructing a Walsh spectrum requires (2n) queries to an n-bit function. We improve the scenario by designing highly efficient quantum and randomised algorithms to approximate the non-linearity allowing additive error, denoted λ, with query complexities that depend polynomially on λ. We prove lower bounds to show that these are not very far from the optimal ones. The number of queries made by our randomised algorithm is linear in n, already an exponential improvement, and the number of queries made by our quantum algorithm is surprisingly independent of n. Our randomised algorithm uses a Goldreich-Levin style of navigating all Walsh coefficients and our quantum algorithm uses a clever combination of Deutsch-Jozsa, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation to improve upon the existing quantum versions of the Goldreich-Levin technique.  © 2021 ACM.",Boolean function; non-linearity; quantum algorithm; query complexity,Computational complexity; Quantum theory; Absolute values; Additive errors; Linear functions; Non-linearity; Nonlinear functions; Quantum algorithms; Query complexity; Randomized Algorithms; Walsh Coefficients; Walsh spectrum; Boolean functions

We address this question by studying the diagonal thermal properties of the canonical one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing processor. We find that the quantum processor fails to produce the correct expectation values predicted by Quantum Monte Carlo. Comparing to master equation simulations, we find that this discrepancy is best explained by how the measurements at finite transverse fields are enacted on the device. Specifically, measurements at finite transverse field require the system to be quenched from the target Hamiltonian to a Hamiltonian with negligible transverse field, and this quench is too slow.

In this work, we propose an experimental study of the costs (in terms of gate number and execution time on a idealised hardware created from realistic gate data) associated with one of the ""direct""quantum algorithm: the wave equation solver devised in [32]. We show that our implementation of the quantum wave equation solver agrees with the theoretical big-O complexity of the algorithm. We also explain in great detail the implementation steps and discuss some possibilities of improvements.

Motivated by this ever more realistic threat for existing classical cryptographic protocols, researchers have developed several schemes to resist ""quantum attacks.""In particular, for electronic voting (e-voting), several schemes relying on properties of quantum mechanics have been proposed. However, each of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated corruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security claims that are never formalized and are at best justified only against specific attacks. To address this, we propose the first formal security definitions for quantum e-voting protocols. With these at hand, we systematize and evaluate the security of previously proposed quantum e-voting protocols; we examine the claims of these works concerning privacy, correctness, and verifiability, and if they are correctly attributed to the proposed protocols. In all non-trivial cases, we identify specific quantum attacks that violate these properties. We argue that the cause of these failures lies in the absence of formal security models and references to the existing cryptographic literature. © 2021 ACM.",attacks; quantum cryptography; Quantum electronic voting,Electronic voting; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Voting machines; Attack; Cryptographic protocols; Electronic voting; Electronic voting protocols; Formal security; Property; Quanta computers; Quantum electronic voting; Security definitions; Verifiability; Quantum cryptography

However, the limited number of qubits makes it infeasible to tackle massive real-world datasets directly in the near future, leading to new challenges in utilizing these quantum processors for practical purposes. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that leverage both quantum and classical types of devices are considered as one of the main strategies to apply quantum computing to large-scale problems. In this article, we advocate the use of multilevel frameworks for combinatorial optimization as a promising general paradigm for designing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To demonstrate this approach, we apply this method to two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the Graph Partitioning Problem, and the Community Detection Problem. We develop hybrid multilevel solvers with quantum local search on D-Wave's quantum annealer and IBM's gate-model based quantum processor. We carry out experiments on graphs that are orders of magnitude larger than the current quantum hardware size, and we observe results comparable to state-of-the-art solvers in terms of quality of the solution.

Rev. Lett. 68, 2981 (1992)] is used to show non-locality without inequalities, and it has been tested several times using optical circuits. We, for the first time, experimentally test Hardy's paradox of non-locality in superconducting qubits. For practical verification of Hardy's paradox, we argue that the error-modeling used in optical circuits is not useful for superconducting qubits. So, we propose a new error-modeling for Hardy's paradox and a new method to estimate the lower bound on Hardy's probability (i.e., the probability of a specific event in Hardy's test) for superconducting qubits. Our results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled state of two qubits violates Hardy's equations; whereas, any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit Hardy's non-locality. Further, we point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of quantum protocols based on Hardy's paradox and propose possible remedies. We also propose two performance measures for any two qubits of any quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. © 2020 ACM.",error-modeling; Hardy's paradox; IBM quantum computer; non-locality; quantum correlations; superconducting qubits,Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Error modeling; Experimental verification; Hardy's paradox; IBM quantum computer; Nonlocalities; Optical circuits; Quanta computers; Quantum correlations; Superconducting qubits; Two-qubit; Errors

We present quantum algorithms for training and evaluating feedforward neural networks based on the canonical classical feedforward and backpropagation algorithms. Our algorithms rely on an efficient quantum subroutine for approximating inner products between vectors in a robust way, and on implicitly storing intermediate values in quantum random access memory for fast retrieval at later stages. The running times of our algorithms can be quadratically faster in the size of the network than their standard classical counterparts since they depend linearly on the number of neurons in the network, and not on the number of connections between neurons. Furthermore, networks trained by our quantum algorithm may have an intrinsic resilience to overfitting, as the algorithm naturally mimics the effects of classical techniques used to regularize networks. Our algorithms can also be used as the basis for new quantum-inspired classical algorithms with the same dependence on the network dimensions as their quantum counterparts but with quadratic overhead in other parameters that makes them relatively impractical. © 2020 ACM.",qRAM; Quantum algorithms,Multilayer neural networks; Quantum theory; Random access storage; Feed forward; Inner product; Machine-learning; Network-based; Neural-networks; Performance; QRAM; Quantum algorithms; Quantum machines; Random access memory; Machine learning

In this work, we instead consider three-level qutrits. Past work with qutrits has demonstrated only constant factor improvements, owing to the log2(3) binary-to-ternary compression factor. We present a novel technique, intermediate qutrits, to achieve sublinear depth decompositions of the Generalized Toffoli and other arithmetic circuits using no additional ancilla- A significant improvement over linear depth for the best qubit-only equivalents. For example, our Generalized Toffoli construction features a 70× improvement in two-qudit gate count over a qubit-only decomposition. This results in circuit cost reductions for important algorithms like quantum neurons, Grover search, and even Shor's algorithm. Using a previously developed simulator with near-term noise models, we demonstrate for these models over 90% mean reliability (fidelity) for the Toffoli construction, versus under 30% for the qubit-only baseline. For our other constructions, such as the Incrementer, the A + B adder and the +K adder, we demonstrate the power of intermediate qutrits in producing asymptotic depth improvements with no additional ancilla. Together, these results suggest qutrits offer a promising path toward scaling quantum computation. © 2020 ACM.",Quantum computing; quantum information; qutrits,Computer circuits; Cost reduction; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Ancilla; Compression factor; Constant factors; Novel techniques; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum Information; Qutrits; Sublinear; Three-level; Adders

The algorithm outputs a pair of matrices (S,Y) that have objective value within ϵ of the optimal and satisfy the constraints approximately to error xi. The parameter mu is at most 2n while kappa is an upper bound on the condition number of the intermediate solution matrices arising in the classical IPM. For the case where κ ≪ n5/6, our method provides a significant polynomial speedup over the best-known classical semi-definite program solvers that have a worst-case running time of Õ(n6).

Here, we prove several results on efficiently learning Pauli channels and more generally the Pauli projection of a quantum channel. We first derive a procedure for learning a Pauli channel on n qubits with high probability to a relative precision μ using O(μ-2n2n) measurements, which is efficient in the Hilbert space dimension. The estimate is robust to state preparation and measurement errors, which, together with the relative precision, makes it especially appropriate for applications involving characterization of high-accuracy quantum gates. Next, we show that the error rates for an arbitrary set of s Pauli errors can be estimated to a relative precision ϵμ using O(ϵμ-4log s log s/ϵμ) measurements. Finally, we show that when the Pauli channel is given by a Markov field with at most k-local correlations, we can learn an entire n-qubit Pauli channel to relative precision ϵμ with only Ok(ϵμ-2n2logn) measurements, which is efficient in the number of qubits.

Whereas quantum advantages have been established for state learning, quantum process learning is less understood. We establish an exponential quantum advantage for learning an unknown n-qubit quantum process . We show that a quantum memory allows to efficiently solve the following tasks: (a) learning the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) of an arbitrary , (b) predicting expectation values of Pauli-sparse observables measured on the output of an arbitrary upon input of a Pauli-sparse state, and (c) predicting expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of an unknown with sparse PTM upon input of an arbitrary state. With quantum memory, these tasks can be solved using linearly-in-n many copies of the Choi state of . In contrast, any learner without quantum memory requires exponentially-in-n many queries, even when using adaptively designed experiments. In proving this separation, we extend existing shadow tomography bounds from states to channels. Moreover, we combine PTM learning with polynomial interpolation to learn arbitrary Hamiltonians from short-time dynamics.

This work systematically compares a broad range of techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when deciding which models and methods to use in their applications. We compare fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits: (1) A continuous architecture, which produces continuous-valued data samples, and (2) a discrete architecture, which samples on a discrete grid. We also compare the performance of different data transformations: the min-max and the probability integral transforms. We use two popular training methods: (1) quantum circuit Born machines (QCBM), and (2) quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their performance and tradeoffs as the number of model parameters increases, with a baseline comparison of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets. Our two key findings are that: (1) For all data sets, our quantum models require similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme case, the quantum models require two orders of magnitude less parameters.

The change in state due to the firing of a detector is given by a unitary operator, which is the same for all sensors in the network. Such a network of detectors can be used to localize an event, using a protocol to determine the firing sensor, presumably the one closest to the event. The determination of the firing sensor can be posed as a Quantum State Discrimination problem, which incurs a probability of error depending on the initial state and the measurement operators used. In this article, we address the problem of determining the optimal initial global state of a network of detectors that incur a minimum probability of error in determining the firing sensor. For this problem, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial state that allows for perfect discrimination, i.e., zero probability of error. Using insights from this result, we derive a conjectured optimal solution for the initial state, provide a pathway to prove the conjecture, and validate the conjecture empirically using multiple search heuristics that seem to perform near-optimally. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",heuristic search; initial state optimization; Quantum sensor network; quantum state discrimination,Errors; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Quantum theory; Heuristic search; Initial state; Initial state optimization; Probabilities of error; Quantum sensor network; Quantum sensors; Quantum state discrimination; Sensors network; State optimization; States change; Sensor networks

Asymptotically, in the limit as r tends to infinity, the probability of successfully recovering r in a single run tends to one.

Quantum measurement, a critical component of quantum computing, involves determining the probabilities linked with quantum states post-multiple circuit computations based on quantum readout values provided by hardware. While there are promising classification-based solutions, they can either misclassify or necessitate excessive measurements, thereby proving to be costly. This article puts forth an efficient method to discern the quantum state by analyzing the probability distributions of data post-measurement. Specifically, we employ cumulative distribution functions to juxtapose the measured distribution of a sample against the distributions of basis states. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through experimental results on a superconducting transmon qubit architecture, which shows a substantial decrease (88%) in single qubit readout error compared to state-of-the-art measurement techniques. Moreover, we report additional error reduction (12%) compared to state-of-the-art measurement techniques when our technique is applied to enhance existing multi-qubit classification techniques.

In such setup the T gate is typically much more expensive to implement in a fault-Tolerant way than Clifford gates. To improve the feasibility of fault-Tolerant quantum computing it is then crucial to minimize the number of T gates. Many algorithms, yielding effective results, have been designed to address this problem. It has been demonstrated that performing a pre-processing step consisting of reducing the number of Hadamard gates in the circuit can help to exploit the full potential of these algorithms and thereby lead to a substantial T-count reduction. Moreover, minimizing the number of Hadamard gates also restrains the number of additional qubits and operations resulting from the gadgetization of Hadamard gates, a procedure used by some compilers to further reduce the number of T gates. In this work we tackle the Hadamard gate reduction problem, and propose an algorithm for synthesizing a sequence of π/4 Pauli rotations with a minimal number of Hadamard gates. Based on this result, we present an algorithm which optimally minimizes the number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last T gate of the circuit.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Recent advances have shown that topological codes can be efficiently decoded by deploying machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular with neural networks. In this work, we first propose an ML-based decoder for heavy hexagonal code and establish its efficiency in terms of the values of threshold and pseudo-Threshold for various noise models. We show that the proposed ML-based decoding method achieves ∼ 5 × higher values of threshold than that for MWPM. Next, exploiting the property of subsystem codes, we define gauge equivalence for heavy hexagonal code, by which two distinct errors can belong to the same error class. A linear search-based method is proposed for determining the equivalent error classes. This provides a quadratic reduction in the number of error classes to be considered for both bit flip and phase flip errors and thus a further improvement of ∼ 14% in the threshold over the basic ML decoder. Last, a novel technique based on rank to determine the equivalent error classes is presented, which is empirically faster than the one based on linear search.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

SpinQ: Compilation Strategies for Scalable Spin-Qubit Architectures,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189101939&doi=10.1145%2f3624484&partnerID=40&md5=8050554c593dea3ed346d2e824ad8a09,"Despite Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices being severely constrained, hardware-and algorithm-Aware quantum circuit mapping techniques have been developed to enable successful algorithm executions. Not so much attention has been paid to mapping and compilation implementations for spin-qubit quantum processors due to the scarce availability of experimental devices and their small sizes. However, based on their high scalability potential and their rapid progress it is timely to start exploring solutions on such devices. In this work, we discuss the unique mapping challenges of a scalable crossbar architecture with shared control and introduce SpinQ, the first native compilation framework for scalable spin-qubit architectures. At the core of SpinQ is the Integrated Strategy that addresses the unique operational constraints of the crossbar while considering compilation scalability and obtaining a O(n) computational complexity. To evaluate the performance of SpinQ on this novel architecture, we compiled a broad set of well-defined quantum circuits and performed an in-depth analysis based on multiple metrics such as gate overhead, depth overhead, and estimated success probability, which in turn allowed us to create unique mapping and architectural insights. Finally, we propose novel mapping techniques that could increase algorithm success rates on this architecture and potentially inspire further research on quantum circuit mapping for other scalable spin-qubit architectures.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Milestones on the Quantum Utility Highway: Quantum Annealing Case Study,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189072141&doi=10.1145%2f3625307&partnerID=40&md5=ebaccd144fe070499db0bd9f56b5d0df,"We introduce quantum utility, a new approach to evaluating quantum performance that aims to capture the user experience by considering the overhead costs associated with a quantum computation. A demonstration of quantum utility by the quantum processing unit (QPU) shows that the QPU can outperform classical solvers at some tasks of interest to practitioners, when considering the costs of computational overheads. A milestone is a test of quantum utility that is restricted to a specific subset of overhead costs and input types.We illustrate this approach with a benchmark study of a D-Wave annealing-based QPU versus seven classical solvers for a variety of problems in heuristic optimization. We consider overhead costs that arise in standalone use of the D-Wave QPU (as opposed to a hybrid computation). We define three early milestones on the path to broad-scale quantum utility. Milestone 0 is the purely quantum computation with no overhead costs and is demonstrated implicitly by positive results on other milestones. We evaluate the performance of a D-Wave Advantage QPU with respect to milestones 1 and 2: For milestone 1, the QPU outperformed all classical solvers in 99% of our tests. For milestone 2, the QPU outperformed all classical solvers in 19% of our tests, and the scenarios in which the QPU found success correspond to cases where classical solvers most frequently failed.This approach of isolating subsets of overheads for separate analysis reveals distinct mechanisms in quantum versus classical performance, which explain the observed differences in patterns of success and failure. We present evidence-based arguments that these distinctions bode well for annealing quantum processors to support demonstrations of quantum utility on ever-expanding classes of inputs and with more challenging milestones in the very near future.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesQuantum annealing; D-Wave; experimental algorithmics; heterogeneous computational benchmarking; quantum benchmarking; quantum performance analysis; quantum utility,Benchmarking; Quantum computers; Additional key word and phrasesquantum annealing; Algorithmics; D-wave; Experimental algorithmic; Heterogeneous computational benchmarking; Key words; Performances analysis; Quantum benchmarking; Quantum performance analyse; Quantum utility; Annealing

A central feature is a microarchitecture executing quantum operations in parallel on arbitrary predefined qubit groups. Another key feature is a reconfigurable quantum instruction set that supports easy qubit re-grouping and instructions extensions.As a demonstration, we implement the widely-studied surface code quantum computing workflow, which is instructive for being demanding on both the controllers and the integrated classical computation. Our design, for the first time, reduces instruction issuing and transmission costs to constants, which do not scale with the number of qubits, without adding any overheads in decoding or dispatching.Our system uses a dedicated general-purpose CPU for both qubit control and classical computation, including syndrome decoding.

Many quantum compilation approaches can mitigate the effects of imperfect hardware by optimizing quantum circuits for objectives such as critical path length. Few approaches consider quantum circuits in terms of the set of vendor-calibrated operations (i.e., native gates) available on target hardware. This manuscript expands the analytical and numerical approaches for optimizing quantum circuits at this abstraction level. We present a procedure for combining the strengths of analytical native gate-level optimization with numerical optimization. Although we focus on optimizing Toffoli gates on the IBMQ native gate set, the methods presented are generalizable to any gate and superconducting qubit architecture. Our optimized Toffoli gate implementation demonstrates an 18% reduction in infidelity compared with the canonical implementation as benchmarked on IBM Jakarta with quantum process tomography. Assuming the inclusion of multi-qubit cross-resonance (MCR) gates in the IBMQ native gate set, we produce Toffoli implementations with only six multi-qubit gates, a 25% reduction from the canonical eight multi-qubit implementations for linearly connected qubits.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).

Indeed, to provide sound alternatives to lattice-based cryptosystems, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advanced all round 3 code-based cryptosystems to round 4 of its Post-Quantum standardization initiative. We present a complete implementation of a quantum circuit based on the Information Set Decoding (ISD) strategy, the best known one against code-based cryptosystems, providing quantitative measures for the security margin achieved with respect to the quantum-accelerated key recovery on AES, targeting both the current state-of-the-art approach and the NIST estimates. Our work improves the state-of-the-art, reducing the circuit depth by 219to 230for all the parameters of the NIST selected cryptosystems, mainly due to an improved quantum Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit with respect to previous proposals. We show how our Prange's-based quantum ISD circuit reduces the security margin with respect to its classical counterpart.

One step in compiling a quantum circuit to some device is quantum circuit mapping, where the circuit is transformed such that it complies with the architecture's limited qubit connectivity. Because the search space in quantum circuit mapping grows exponentially in the number of qubits, it is desirable to consider as few of the device's physical qubits as possible in the process. Previous work conjectured that it suffices to consider only subarchitectures of a quantum computer composed of as many qubits as used in the circuit. In this work, we refute this conjecture and establish criteria for judging whether considering larger parts of the architecture might yield better solutions to the mapping problem. We show that determining subarchitectures that are of minimal size, i.e., from which no physical qubit can be removed without losing the optimal mapping solution for some quantum circuit, is a very hard problem. Based on a relaxation of the criteria for optimality, we introduce a relaxed consideration that still maintains optimality for practically relevant quantum circuits. Eventually, this results in two methods for computing near-optimal sets of subarchitectures - providing the basis for efficient quantum circuit mapping solutions. We demonstrate the benefits of this novel method for state-of-the-art quantum computers by IBM, Google, and Rigetti.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Our first result is that an arbitrary protocol for achieving this task (where there are no assumptions on the sender's encoding operations or the dimension of the shared entangled state) is locally equivalent to the canonical Bennett-Wiesner protocol. In other words, the superdense coding task is rigid. In particular, we show that the sender and receiver only use additional entanglement (beyond the EPR pair) as a source of classical randomness.We also investigate several questions about higher-dimensional superdense coding, where the goal is to communicate one of d2possible messages by sending a d-dimensional quantum state, for general dimensions d. Unlike the d=2 case (i.e., sending a single qubit), there can be inequivalent superdense coding protocols for higher d. We present concrete constructions of inequivalent protocols, based on constructions of inequivalent orthogonal unitary bases for all d > 2. Finally, we analyze the performance of superdense coding protocols where the encoding operators are independently sampled from the Haar measure on the unitary group. Our analysis involves bounding the distinguishability of random maximally entangled states, which may be of independent interest. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",distinguishability; generalized Holevo-Curlander bounds; Marčenko-Pastur Law; orthogonal unitary basis; random maximally entangled states; rigidity; shared entanglement; Superdense coding,Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Rigidity; Signal encoding; Distinguishability; Encodings; EPR pairs; Generalized holevo-curlander bound; Marčenko-pastur law; Maximally entangled state; Orthogonal unitary base; Random maximally entangled state; Shared entanglement; Superdense coding; Encoding (symbols)

Quantum algorithms have been designed for efficiently realizing bilinear interpolation. However, these quantum algorithms have limitations in circuit width and garbage outputs, which block the quantum algorithms applied to noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In addition, the existing quantum bilinear interpolation algorithms cannot keep the consistency between the geometric centers of the original and target images. To save the above questions, we propose quantum bilinear interpolation algorithms based on geometric centers using fault-tolerant implementations of quantum arithmetic operators. Proposed algorithms include the scaling-up and scaling-down for signals (grayscale images) and signals with three channels (color images). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bilinear interpolation algorithms obtain the same results as their classical counterparts with an exponential speedup. Performance analysis reveals that the proposed bilinear interpolation algorithms keep the consistency of geometric centers and significantly reduce circuit width and garbage outputs compared to the existing works.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We present a quantum algorithm that estimates the volume of an n-dimensional convex body within multiplicative error ϵ using Õ(n3 + n2.5/ϵ) queries to a membership oracle and Õ(n5+n4.5/ϵ) additional arithmetic operations. For comparison, the best known classical algorithm uses Õ(n3.5+n3/ϵ2) queries and Õ(n5.5+n5/ϵ2) additional arithmetic operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum speedup for volume estimation. Our algorithm is based on a refined framework for speeding up simulated annealing algorithms that might be of independent interest. This framework applies in the setting of ""Chebyshev cooling,""where the solution is expressed as a telescoping product of ratios, each having bounded variance. We develop several novel techniques when implementing our framework, including a theory of continuous-space quantum walks with rigorous bounds on discretization error. To complement our quantum algorithms, we also prove that volume estimation requires ω (√n+1/ϵ) quantum membership queries, which rules out the possibility of exponential quantum speedup in n and shows optimality of our algorithm in 1/ϵ up to poly-logarithmic factors.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Previous work partially addresses this issue for QAOA on unweighted MaxCut problems by leveraging similarities in the objective landscape among different problem instances. However, we show that the more general weighted MaxCut problem has significantly modified objective landscapes, with a proliferation of poor local optima. Our main contribution is a simple rescaling scheme that overcomes these deleterious effects of weights. We show that for a given QAOA depth, a single ""typical""vector of QAOA parameters can be successfully transferred to weighted MaxCut instances. This transfer leads to a median decrease in the approximation ratio of only 2.0 percentage points relative to a considerably more expensive direct optimization on a dataset of 34,701 instances with up to 20 nodes and multiple weight distributions. This decrease can be reduced to 1.2 percentage points at the cost of only 10 additional QAOA circuit evaluations with parameters sampled from a pretrained metadistribution, or the transferred parameters can be used as a starting point for a single local optimization run to obtain approximation ratios equivalent to those achieved by exhaustive optimization in 96.35% of our cases.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",parameter optimization; QAOA; weighted MaxCut,Approximate optimization; Approximation ratios; Max-cut; MAX-CUT problem; Optimization algorithms; Parameter optimization; Parameter transfers; Percentage points; Quantum approximate optimization algorithm; Weighted maxcut; Parameter estimation

Programmers of such computers must therefore balance trade-offs among a large number of (potentially heterogeneous) factors specific to the targeted application and quantum hardware. To assist them, we propose Meta Quantum Circuits with Constraints (MQCC), a meta-programming framework for quantum programs. Programmers express their application as a succinct collection of normal quantum circuits stitched together by a set of (manually or automatically) added meta-level choice variables, whose values are constrained according to a programmable set of quantitative optimization criteria. MQCC's compiler generates the appropriate constraints and solves them via an SMT solver, producing an optimized, runnable program. We showcase a few MQCC's applications for its generality including an automatic generation of efficient error syndrome extraction schemes for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with heterogeneous qubits and an approach to writing approximate quantum Fourier transformation and quantum phase estimation that smoothly trades off accuracy and resource use. We also illustrate that MQCC can easily encode prior one-off NISQ application designs - multi-programming (MP), crosstalk mitigation (CM) - as well as a combination of their optimization goals (i.e., a combined MP-CM).  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Meta-programming; Quantum Computing,Computer hardware; Economic and social effects; Error correction; Fourier transforms; Program compilers; Qubits; Timing circuits; Application design; Crosstalk mitigation; Hardware resources; Meta Programming; Multi-programming; Quanta computers; Quantum applications; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Trade off; Constrained optimization

We apply machine learning methods to analyze the correlations of the penalty factors and the minimum spectral gap for six selected constrained optimization problems and show that regression using a neural network allows to predict the best penalty factors in our settings for various problem instances.

To analyze these kernels in terms of NISQ device execution, in addition to circuit width and depth, we propose four circuit metrics including gate density, retention lifespan, measurement density, and entanglement variance, to extract more insights about the execution efficiency, the susceptibility to NISQ error, and the potential gain from machine-specific optimizations. Applications in QASMBench can be launched and verified on several NISQ platforms, including IBM-Q, Rigetti, IonQ and Quantinuum. For evaluation, we measure the execution fidelity of a subset of QASMBench applications on 12 IBM-Q machines through density matrix state tomography, comprising 25K circuit evaluations. We also compare the fidelity of executions among the IBM-Q machines, the IonQ QPU and the Rigetti Aspen M-1 system.

A Quantum Algorithm for the Sub-graph Isomorphism Problem,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176889098&doi=10.1145%2f3569095&partnerID=40&md5=a6f5d5cbe57c3d2cfb902455d6ae5ec5,"We propose a novel variational method for solving the sub-graph isomorphism problem on a gate-based quantum computer. The method relies (1) on a new representation of the adjacency matrices of the underlying graphs, which requires a number of qubits that scales logarithmically with the number of vertices of the graphs; and (2) on a new ansatz that can efficiently probe the permutation space. Simulations are then presented to showcase the approach on graphs up to 16 vertices, whereas, given the logarithmic scaling, the approach could be applied to realistic sub-graph isomorphism problem instances in the medium term.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Bridging Classical and Quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176905410&doi=10.1145%2f3549554&partnerID=40&md5=1f6894cfa5388c0f3b8775143030dc9d,"We study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the context of the Max-Cut problem. Noisy quantum devices are only able to accurately execute QAOA at low circuit depths, while classically-challenging problem instances may call for a relatively high circuit-depth. This is due to the need to build correlations between reachable pairs of vertices in potentially large graphs [16]. To enhance the solving power of low-depth QAOA, we introduce a classical pre-processing step that initializes QAOA with a biased superposition of possible cuts in the graph, referred to as a warm-start. In particular, we initialize QAOA with a solution to a low-rank semidefinite programming relaxation of the Max-Cut problem. Our experimental results show that this variant of QAOA, called QAOA-warm, is able to outperform standard QAOA on lower circuit depths in solution quality and training time. While this improvement is partly due to the classical warm-start, we find strong evidence of further improvement using QAOA circuit at small depth. We provide experimental evidence of improved performance as well as theoretical properties of the proposed framework.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",approximation algorithms; graph theory; Max-Cut; QAOA; warm-starts,Computation theory; Electric network analysis; Graph theory; Approximate optimization; Large graphs; MAX CUT; Max-cut; MAX-CUT problem; Optimization algorithms; Problem instances; Quantum approximate optimization algorithm; Quantum device; Warm start; Approximation algorithms
Optimized Compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146507571&doi=10.1145%2f3579367&partnerID=40&md5=02a6738e8cbd881f7f0f08d8b5e2538b,"Practical distributed quantum computing requires the development of efficient compilers, able to make quantum circuits compatible with some given hardware constraints. This problem is known to be tough, even for local computing. Here, we address it on distributed architectures. As generally assumed in this scenario, telegates represent the fundamental remote (inter-processor) operations. Each telegate consists of several tasks: (i) entanglement generation and distribution, (ii) local operations, and (iii) classical communications. Entanglement generations and distribution is an expensive resource, as it is time-consuming. To mitigate its impact, we model an optimization problem that combines running-time minimization with the usage of distributed entangled states. Specifically, we formulated the distributed compilation problem as a dynamic network flow. To enhance the solution space, we extend the formulation, by introducing a predicate that manipulates the circuit given in input and parallelizes telegate tasks.To evaluate our framework, we split the problem into three sub-problems, and solve it by means of an approximation routine. Experiments demonstrate that the run-time is resistant to the problem size scaling. Moreover, we apply the proposed algorithm to compile circuits under different topologies, showing that topologies with a higher ratio between edges and nodes give rise to shallower circuits.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Integer Linear Programming; Quantum circuit compilation,Integer programming; Program compilers; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Timing circuits; Distributed architecture; Distributed quantum computing; Entanglement distribution; Entanglement generation; Hardware constraints; Integer Linear Programming; Interprocessors; Optimized compiler; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit compilation; Topology
A Bayesian Approach for Characterizing and Mitigating Gate and Measurement Errors,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164822418&doi=10.1145%2f3563397&partnerID=40&md5=372cac5e4b1d93aefeefd975d1bf5edb,"Various noise models have been developed in quantum computing study to describe the propagation and effect of the noise that is caused by imperfect implementation of hardware. Identifying parameters such as gate and readout error rates is critical to these models. We use a Bayesian inference approach to identify posterior distributions of these parameters such that they can be characterized more elaborately. By characterizing the device errors in this way, we can further improve the accuracy of quantum error mitigation. Experiments conducted on IBM's quantum computing devices suggest that our approach provides better error mitigation performance than existing techniques used by the vendor. Also, our approach outperforms the standard Bayesian inference method in some scenarios.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bayesian statistics; Error mitigation; gate error; measurement error,Bayesian networks; Error statistics; Inference engines; Quantum computers; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian inference; Bayesian statistics; Device errors; Error mitigation; Error rate; Gate errors; Noise models; Posterior distributions; Quantum Computing; Measurement errors
Machine Learning Optimization of Quantum Circuit Layouts,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176902486&doi=10.1145%2f3565271&partnerID=40&md5=051088fc5e177a93d292e7836c5b1a74,"The quantum circuit layout (QCL) problem involves mapping out a quantum circuit such that the constraints of the device are satisfied. We introduce a quantum circuit mapping heuristic, QXX, and its machine learning version, QXX-MLP. The latter automatically infers the optimal QXX parameter values such that the laid out circuit has a reduced depth. In order to speed up circuit compilation, before laying the circuits out, we use a Gaussian function to estimate the depth of the compiled circuits. This Gaussian also informs the compiler about the circuit region that influences most the resulting circuit's depth. We present empiric evidence for the feasibility of learning the layout method using approximation. QXX and QXX-MLP open the path to feasible large-scale QCL methods.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

LEAP: Scaling Numerical Optimization Based Synthesis Using an Incremental Approach,2023,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163022405&doi=10.1145%2f3548693&partnerID=40&md5=969516ee586f1f1df87d29b262f1564a,"While showing great promise, circuit synthesis techniques that combine numerical optimization with search over circuit structures face scalability challenges due to a large number of parameters, exponential search spaces, and complex objective functions. The LEAP algorithm improves scaling across these dimensions using iterative circuit synthesis, incremental reoptimization, dimensionality reduction, and improved numerical optimization. LEAP draws on the design of the optimal synthesis algorithm QSearch by extending it with an incremental approach to determine constant prefix solutions for a circuit. By narrowing the search space, LEAP improves scalability from four to six qubit circuits. LEAP was evaluated with known quantum circuits such as QFT and physical simulation circuits like the VQE, TFIM, and QITE. LEAP can compile four qubit unitaries up to 59× faster than QSearch and five and six qubit unitaries with up to 1.2× fewer CNOTs compared to the QFAST package. LEAP can reduce the CNOT count by up to 36×, or 7× on average, compared to the CQC Tket compiler. Despite its heuristics, LEAP has generated optimal circuits for many test cases with a priori known solutions. The techniques introduced by LEAP are applicable to other numerical optimization based synthesis approaches.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Gate-based quantum computing; Quantum circuit synthesis,Iterative methods; Optimization; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Circuit synthesis; Gate-based quantum computing; Incremental approach; Numerical optimizations; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit synthesis; Quantum Computing; Scalings; Search spaces; Synthesis techniques; Scalability

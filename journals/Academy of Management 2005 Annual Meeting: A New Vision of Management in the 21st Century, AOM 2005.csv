An integrative model linking employee positive moods and task performance,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859095017&partnerID=40&md5=c25a22cd434527dd2e53d8dc3c7e77b3,"Past empirical evidence has demonstrated that employees' positive moods enhance their task performance. This study extends previous research by proposing an integrative model that examines mediating processes underlying employee positive moods and task performance. Data were collected at two points in time from 306 employees and their immediate supervisors in five insurance companies in Taiwan. Results showed that employee positive moods influenced task performance indirectly through both motivational and interpersonal processes. Specifically, employee positive moods affected self-efficacy and task persistence, which in turn led to higher task performance. In addition, positive moods influenced interpersonal helping behaviors (i.e., helping coworkers and coworker helping), which in turn led to higher task performance.",Mediating processes; Positive moods; Task performance,Insurance; Empirical evidence; Insurance companies; Mediating processes; Positive moods; Self efficacy; Task performance; Task persistence; Two-point; Human resource management
The moderating effect of procedural fairness in standardizing professional work: Hospital drug formulary and its cost effectiveness,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859091968&partnerID=40&md5=e7af8ee64b921e95593a1f3b05508e7d,"This paper explores the role of procedural fairness in determining responses to bureaucratic standardization. I examine this question in the context of drug formularies in hospitals. Drug formularies are a list of drugs available to physicians in a healthcare organization, and represent a standardization of the drug choices available to physicians. While some advocate the use of formularies as a cost-effective means of managing drug benefits, critics see them as an infringement on physicians' clinical autonomy, and as potentially harmful to patients, ultimately contributing to higher costs of providing care. Drawing on organizational justice theory, I look at the role of procedural fairness in shaping the effectiveness of bureaucratic standardization, and argue that the payoff from drug formularies depends on whether the process of setting and implementing formulary policies is fair. To examine this, Inpatient Discharge Data for 2002 from Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas, combined with an original survey of 243 hospital pharmacy directors, were analyzed using the hierarchical linear modeling technique. I found that the cost effectiveness of drug standardization depends on the procedural fairness of the standardization process, controlling for patient, hospital, and hospital market factors. Theoretically, this paper contributes to a partial reconciliation of conflicting predictions from the standardization literature by considering procedural fairness. Given the ubiquity of standardized rules in organizations, the findings also have practical implications for how to manage bureaucratic standardization without alienating organizational members.",Procedural fairness; Profession; Standardization,Cost effectiveness; Health care; Hospitals; Cost-effective means; Drug benefits; Florida; Healthcare organizations; Hierarchical linear modeling; Hospital market; Illinois; Moderating effect; New York; Procedural fairness; Profession; Standardization process; Standardization
Performance effects of relationalism with dominant and non-dominant suppliers: A case study,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859091024&partnerID=40&md5=bd64e1240e073e25a72021ab9a013cea,"Theorists hypothesize that close, cooperative, long-term relationships with suppliers enhance firm performance; however, existing studies have produced conflicting results. This study makes three important contributions. First, it demonstrates that when firm performance is defined more broadly than transaction costs to include operational and financial aspects, resource dependence theory is a better guiding theory than transaction cost theory, which has been a prominent theory guiding several firm- supplier relationship studies. Second, we show that the case study research is superior to survey-based research in dealing with the complexities of firm-supplier relationship phenomenon, particularly in measuring firm-supplier relationalism. Finally, through case analysis of 8 leading U.S. computer hardware firms, we show that relationalism between firms and dominant suppliers is positively associated with firm profitability but negatively associated with product innovation, and that relationalism between firms and non-dominant suppliers is positively associated with operational cost efficiency. In sum, the findings suggest that dominant-supplier-relationalism and non-dominant supplier-relationalism are separate phenomena that impact firm performance in different ways.",Case study; Firm performance; Firm-supplier relationships,Cost benefit analysis; Profitability; Research; Case analysis; Case study research; Financial aspects; Firm Performance; Firm-supplier relationships; Operational costs; Performance effect; Product innovation; Supplier relationships; Survey-based research; Transaction cost; Transaction-cost theory; Industry

In this information society, IT is being increasingly recognized as a key factor that will change the way countries as well as individual firms compete. An example of a country rising fast into the information age is Singapore. In less than forty years, Singapore has transformed herself into a fully developed nation with an advanced eGovernment agenda. A well structured IS leadership has been at the heart of this success and has enabled Singapore to adopt a drive towards continuous innovation. In this study, we explore the influence of leadership in first appreciating the potential value of IT in Singapore's legal system, and then realizing this potential value. In particular, we are interested in the concept of distributed leadership. Compared to a traditional model of leadership where power is usually concentrated in a single individual, distributed leadership is one where more than one individual or organization takes the lead, by virtue of their knowledge, skill or ability. Based on empirical data collected on the implementation of the electronic litigation system in Singapore, we find that such distributed leadership occurs in layers, at the different levels, in impacting the business value of IT.",Electronic litigation system; IS leadership; IT business value,Information science; Laws and legislation; Value engineering; Business value; Continuous innovation; e-Government; Empirical data; Information age; Information society; IS leadership; IT business values; Key factors; Legal system; Litigation systems; Potential values; Singapore; Information technology

This study addressed three measurement challenges that human resource researchers have suggested: data collected for business unit level companies; data collected separately for managerial and non-managerial employee groups; and, testing interrelationships between three organizational performance measures. This study addressed the aforementioned methodological issues. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of human resource management on organizational performance.

Interfirm distances as channels for external resources: The choice between alliances and mergers & acquisitions,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859070229&partnerID=40&md5=f2a84e56ec0695a95f23c355d7d738c4,"This study develops an external resource perspective to examine firms' resource acquisition through the lens of organizational distances. The dyadic approach reveals the different mechanisms for resource combination between firms through either alliances or M&A. Specifically, this research explores the roles of strategic distance, technical distance and structural distance in firms' strategic choices of different governance modes. The study argues that firms are more likely to use alliances to access external resources under a large strategic distance, while there is a U-shaped relationship between technical distance and firms' governance choice. A large structural distance also motivates firms to choose alliances over acquisitions. We find support for the majority of our arguments by examining alliances and acquisitions in the U.S. computer industry over a nine-year span.",Alliances; Interfirm distances; Mergers & acquisitions,Alliances; Computer industry; Different mechanisms; External resources; Interfirm distances; Resource acquisition; Strategic choice; Through the lens; U-shaped; Mergers and acquisitions

Traditionally, most cross-cultural research has taken either a comparative approach, applying common metrics and methods across multiple cultures and analyzing the results for differences or similarities, or a differentiating approach, identifying unique characteristics of an individual culture in order to explain behaviors within that environment. Both of these approaches have advanced our understanding of cross-cultural environments, but neither provides the framework for understanding the simultaneous interactions of intra- and intercultural factors in a cross-cultural setting. Drawing specifically on other fields which research within and across cultural boundaries, specifically cross-cultural psychology and anthropology, and merging them with the management literature, I propose that second person research, as advanced by Torbert's Action Inquiry (2004) framework, provides the tools to overcome this limitation and move both international management research and practice beyond where most extant research has brought us.",Action reseach; Cross-cultural; Methodology,Action reseach; Comparative approach; Cross-cultural; Cross-cultural research; Cultural environment; International management; Management research; Methodology

The literature to date has emphasized how actors that are powerful and legitimate (e.g., a national government) may coerce the adoption of reforms by dependent actors (e.g., state governments and other organizations whose activities are governed by the federal government). We observe that that an actor's power alone may be sufficient to promote reform, regardless of the actor's legitimacy. However, such reforms are more susceptible to subsequent change than are those that emerge from processes not subject to the influence of external actors whose sway derives from their power alone. We develop and test our arguments in the context of the worldwide electricity provision industry by analyzing countries' adoption of reforms in response to conditional lending practices by multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF. We find that reforms adopted in response to coercive pressures exerted by these organizations encounter much greater resistance, and that the incidence of financial and economic crises, the absence of checks and balances in established political institutions, and the inexperience of investor coalitions dramatically increase the predicted level of resistance.",Coercive isomorphism; Deinstitutionalization; Institutional change,Investments; Set theory; Coercive isomorphism; Deinstitutionalization; Federal governments; Infrastructure investment; Institutional change; Multilateral organizations; National governments; Political institutions; Economics

In Study 1 (n = 2,208), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted with two subsamples from one organization to investigate the dimensionality of the new measure. In Study 2 (n = 660), we cross-validated the factor structure and provided initial evidence of discriminant validity using a second organizational sample. We also empirically assessed the betweenunit variance of individual's organizational energy scores to test our assumption that unit-level membership is a significant source of between-unit variability. In Study 3 (n = 2,658), we conducted both individual-level and unit-level analyses on data collected from a third organizational sample. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the cross-cultural, cross-language equivalence using the individual-level data to demonstrate measurement equivalence across five national cultures. Next, following appropriate justification, we aggregated the data to the unit-level of analysis and investigated the incremental predictive power of the new organizational energy measure on group goal commitment and unit-level job satisfaction, over and above motivation and group process variables, using hierarchical regression analyses. Results indicated the new measure of organizational energy accounted for unique variance in both outcomes. Based on the evidence from the three studies, we concluded initial support for the construct validity of organizational energy was found.

The impact of acquisitions on the innovation performance of inventors at semiconductor companies,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859040770&partnerID=40&md5=b99721a5f882a1dbf642c080236dd533,"In R&D-intensive industries, corporate acquisitions are becoming increasingly important as a mechanism for acquiring new knowledge. In this paper, we examine the impact of corporate acquisitions on the innovation performance of inventors at the acquired firms. We also explore several factors that shape the post-acquisition performance of these inventors. Our study utilizes a novel dataset comprising 353 inventors from semiconductor firms acquired between 1991 and 1998. A control group was constructed by pairing each inventor from the acquired firm with a carefully chosen inventor from the acquiring firm. Our results show a significant decline in the post-acquisition productivity of inventors, as compared to the control group. However, a higher post-acquisition performance is obtained when there is a high degree of business overlap, a low level of integration between the acquiring and acquired firm, and when the acquired company is not a startup. Our findings suggest that managers should be cautious when using acquisitions as a means of knowledge acquisition: there is a real risk that the acquired technical team will become unproductive, and the results are sensitive to the way the integration and business scope is managed.",Acquisition; Patents; Semiconductors,Knowledge acquisition; Semiconductor materials; Acquisition; Control groups; Data sets; Innovation performance; Low level; Patents; Semiconductor companies; Mergers and acquisitions
Cognition and competitive dynamics: The influence of subjective beliefs on a firm's likelihood of competitive response,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088337845&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778489&partnerID=40&md5=9f7d44b41915eba8c5aea9bc8f03a78c,"Much of competitive dynamics research has focused on modeling firm behavior by examining the influence of various decision making cues that are presumed to systematically give rise to predictable and highly similar cognitive interpretations amongst strategists at all firms. Such an approach is valuable because it outlines a central behavioral tendency of competitive response, or the way that most firms respond given a wide set of measurable situational constructs. We suggest, however, that such an approach also renders a necessarily simplified and incomplete explanation of competitive response because it cannot explain the unique, idiosyncratic and often inertial competitive behaviors of individual firms. We leverage research that suggests that subjective beliefs, because they vary widely across decision makers, are a likely source of variation in competitive behavior across firms, which is not being adequately modeled by current competitive dynamics research. To address this gap, we develop and test a straightforward but theoretically grounded model of the competitive response behavior of individual firms that simultaneously considers the effect of subjective beliefs, the implied cognitive biases associated with social and institutional cues, and the interactions between subjective beliefs and cues. We test hypotheses using a matched set of cognition and competitive interaction data for ten large firms over a seven year period. The results imply that strategists' subjective beliefs are not only strong determinants of competitive behavior, but that they are relatively inflexible in the face of either validating or invalidating information that may arise with the presence of strong social and institutional cues.",Cognition; Competitive dynamics; Information processing,Data processing; Decision making; Dynamics; Cognition; Cognitive bias; Competitive behavior; Competitive dynamics; Competitive interactions; Decision makers; Response behavior; Competition

We undertake to chronicle key concepts driving this recent activity by beginning with prehistoric conceptual foundations of entrepreneurship and tracing them into the present day. Our analysis employs a logical mechanism of conjecture and refutation to illustrate the emergence, rise, re-emergence, and/or decline of key theories and concepts within the context of (a) prehistoric, (b) classical, (c) neoclassical, (d) Austrian market process, and (e) multidisciplinary conceptual movements. The contributions of our paper include a clearer perspective on the conceptual roots of the entrepreneurship field as a scholarly area and the relevance of influential conceptual notions and their impact on entrepreneurial thought (e.g., arbitraging market, equilibrium models). Contributions also include a contextualizing of contemporary entrepreneurship theory, such as recent work focusing on the role of opportunities in the entrepreneurial discovery process.

This paper examines how a development project's relation to the developing firm and its technological knowledge base influences the rate at which products succeed or fail. More specifically, I introduce two dimensions along which ""distance"" between a firm and project can be created: the locus of initial development and the technological relevance to a firm's knowledge base. Integrating previously conflicting views on the success rates of alliances, I propose that projects originating from outside the firm will have a higher rate of successful development, but the effect is enhanced when the collaborative project is technologically relevant to a firm's knowledge base allowing the firm to screen out potential ""lemons"". Furthermore, I test the idea that projects will have a slower rate of success when projects are either highly and lowly relevant to a firm's existing technology base. Finally, I examine the rate of development for failed projects and propose that factors that promote faster development will paradoxically slow the rate of failure for these projects. Using project data of 2,114 drug development projects from 1980 to 2003, I find that the hazard of succeeding is higher when drugs are developed in an alliance between firms and especially so when these in-licensed projects are closer to its technological knowledge base. However, alliances are also shown to extend the development period for failed drugs, implying that strategies of buying promising drug candidates can result in higher costs.",Alliances; Drug development; Innovation,Competition; Alliances; Collaborative projects; Competitive advantage; Development project; Drug development; Initial development; Project development; Technological knowledge; Knowledge based systems

A third hypothesis claims that optimal cognitive distance is a function of absorptive capacity, which depends on cumulative past R&D.

Set in the Indian context, it compares the influence of diversification, group affiliation and their interaction on firm performance before (1988) and after (1999) the country introduced dramatic market reforms (1991). Results show that in the pre-reform period while group affiliated diversifiers captured performance benefits, performance of unaffiliated diversifiers was negatively impacted. This suggests that the group structure exerted an important moderating effect on the diversification performance relationship.

How national systems influence executive discretion: A study of CEO effects in three countries,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088338959&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778500&partnerID=40&md5=f8cf1e4cdc976999bdc306573429fb23,"Received wisdom in the field of strategic management, coupled with a healthy dose of anecdote and folklore, suggests that CEOs in the United States are romanticized to a far greater degree than CEOs from other major nations. Certainly, they are paid much more. In an attempt to provide some explanation for these phenomena, we extend the theoretical construct of managerial discretion to the macroenvironmental, or national system, level and investigate whether there are quantifiable cross-cultural differences in the degree to which CEOs matter to company performance. We argue that variance in three inter-related macro-environmental factors - national values, firm ownership structure, and board governance practices - will lead to differences in the level of CEO discretion across countries. We apply a variance-partitioning analysis to a 15-year matched sample of 103 U.S. firms, 103 German firms, and 103 Japanese firms. Results provide strong evidence that the magnitude of CEO influence on firm performance is greater in U.S. firms than in German and Japanese firms, and moderate evidence that U.S. CEOs influence performance more quickly than do German and Japanese CEOs. We discuss the implications of these results for theory and research, as well as for the world of practical affairs.",CEOs; Cross-cultural; Managerial discretion,CEOs; Company performance; Cross-cultural; Cross-cultural differences; Environmental factors; Managerial discretion; Ownership structure; Strategic management; Managers

Organizational identity change: An alliance between organizational identity and identification,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859070218&partnerID=40&md5=8ea2e5fd249f1a33f976e6ab1254218c,"Organizational identity change, partly due to its paradoxical nature, has been rather underexposed. A review of the research on identity change reveals several well-established assumptions. First, identity scholars generally refer to one of three change triggers: a construed external image discrepancy, change in social referent and temporal identity discrepancy. The assumption is that members, when faced with one of these discrepancies, will be triggered to engage in identity change. However, it remains unclear what criteria members use to evaluate the significance of a discrepancy. Also, these triggers are treated as similar and no distinctions are made on how they elicit change. Second, scholars treat identification as the main vehicle that facilitates identity change. A high degree of identification inhibits change, because members are attached to the old identity, and a low degree of identification enables change owing to a lack of attachment. We challenge this assumption and argue that this one-dimensional approach of identification disregards its significant role in guiding a collective effort. The general framework of work motivation theory sheds some light on these issues, it provides insight into those processes that arouse and direct sustainable collective identity change. Social identity theory offers insight into the three self-definitional criteria that arouse members to engage in identity change. And by combining self-categorization theory and an expanded identification model, we argue how identification directs members toward collective change. This alliance between identity and identification is indispensable in order to achieve collective identity change.",Identification; Organizational identity change; Work motivation theory,Identification (control systems); Collective identity; Identification model; Low degree; One-dimensional approach; Organizational identity change; Social identity theories; Work motivation theory; Motivation

Firmlevel studies, without taking into account the identities of partners, and dyad-level studies, without identifying an affiliated network, can be complemented by the approach taken in our study which treats ties (and links) in a network context. Data are drawn from two data sets, one on alliances and the other on patent citations. Results from a sample of 497 alliances over a 11 year period in the global chemical and pharmaceutical sector suggest that technological similarity (measured by cross patent citations), structural equivalence (measured by the degree of sharing common third-party technology sources), and prior alliance ties statistically explain the propensity of a pair of firms in the network to form an alliance. The results also support our hypothesis that alliance ties and technology links are intertwined at a network level and, thereby, affect the likelihood of forming an alliance with a particular partner.",Alliance; Global; Networks,Chemical analysis; Networks (circuits); Patents and inventions; Technology transfer; Alliance; Alliance formation; Data sets; Dyadic relationship; Global; Industry networks; Network level; Patent citation; Pharmaceutical sector; Structural equivalence; Unit of analysis; Industry

However, the management literature has two alternate views of control, (1) balancing, and (2) more controls. The balancing view suggests that management's focus is establishing and maintaining a healthy balance between formal (behavior and outcome) and informal (clan and self) controls. The more controls view suggests that an increase in overall control improves project performance. We first argue that the balancing and more controls views suggest additional insights to IS project control. We then employ indifference curve theory to integrate and unify these three views. The situational view is modeled as changes in the bundle of controls determined by differences in their relative costs. The balancing view is modeled as income and substitution effects to a portfolio of controls. Finally, the more controls view is represented as a shift to a higher ""project control indifference curve."" Additional insights from our model applicable to each view are also presented. Specifically, for the situational view, we demonstrate that the indifference curve concepts of substitutability and complementarity explain the presence of all control modes in portfolios of control. The core concepts of cost and preference and the ancillary concepts of necessities, and luxuries explain differences in the relative proportion of formal and informal controls in the balancing view.

By examining the theoretical nexus of schema theory and the Neoclassical Economics' perspective regarding market disequilibrium, this paper describes the formation of market insights as the first discovery stage in the opportunity recognition process. In addition, market insights are distinguished from entrepreneurial opportunities and are shown to be the result of a entrepreneurial cognitive processing while entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is shown to be the result of a unique entrepreneurial decision process.

We propose a conceptual framework which differentiates resources based on their degree of complexity, tacitness and specificity, and a continuum of corporate environmental strategies from pollution control to sustainable development. Our framework explains how a firm's feasible corporate environmental strategy choices are at least partly determined by their resource endowment. We argue that available slack resources, while not usually considered within resource-based approaches to corporate environmental strategy, can be useful for implementing reactive corporate environmental strategies such as pollution control and prevention. Strategic resource and capability bundles can assist in incremental strategies such as pollution prevention and product stewardship. Dynamic capabilities are required for the most proactive corporate environmental strategy, sustainable development. Our framework also illustrates the importance of resource endowments in feeding inertia and inhibiting proactive corporate environmental strategies. In particular, firms can use available slack as a buffer to avoid the implementation of both product stewardship and sustainable development strategies, and can find that lock-in to strategic resource and capability bundles can inhibit sustainable development.

This produces what is known as multi-channel public service delivery as public services are delivered through both offline and online channels, often resulting in an increase in the operating cost without necessarily generating equitable benefits. Further aggravating the situation, scenarios of conflicts and mutual cannibalization are known to occur in multi-channel approaches of delivering a same service. Notwithstanding, a growing understanding is being established in the marketing and information systems disciplines that synergistic outcome can be realized through the appropriate intertwining of offline and online channels in multi-channel approaches. Thus, this study attempts to expound on this 'new vision of management' in public service delivery by investigating on the research question of 'how offline and online channels can be synergistically intertwined in multi-channel public service delivery' through a case study on the Feedback Unit in Singapore. Leveraging on the illustrative lens of the intertwining concept, four findings and eight corresponding processes are found to support the establishment of synergistic outcome in the intertwining of offline and online channels for multi-channel public service delivery. These are devised into a conceptual framework. The result of this study affirms that 'complementarity and compliment rather than confrontation and abuse' among the channels is more appropriate in multi-channel public services delivery.",Case study; Intertwining; Multi-channel public service delivery,Conceptual frameworks; Information systems disciplines; Intertwining; Legislative requirements; Privacy and security; Public organizations; Public service deliveries; Research questions; Online systems

We argue that strategic management scholars share a common albeit implicit understanding of what their field is all about- a consensus that is reflected in the language they use. In this paper, we adopt a linguistic perspective to extract the distinctive lexicon of the field, and through that lexicon we impute the consensual definition of the field of strategic management.

The study rests on the premise that organizational learning is neither sporadic process nor an accidental outcome. As a matter of fact, organizations can effectively learn only by means of systematic collection, storing, analysis, and utilization of knowledge. Hence, the notion of organizational learning in this research is represented by a composite index measuring the extent to which organizations methodically apply a series of learning mechanisms such as those stated above. For the purpose of this study, 75 departments were sampled from two different organizations. One organization renders financial services, and the other organization provides military products. Data were collected by means of questionnaires administered to over 360 supervisors and their subordinates in those departments. Four hypotheses concerning the relationships between the nature of the departments environment, culture, leadership and the application of learning mechanisms were statistically tested. The research findings indicate that the application of learning mechanisms by a given department is correlated with its environment, its culture, and its leadership. However, those variables differ in their connection to the learning mechanisms. Taken together, the learning-supportive organizational culture is the key-factor and the best predictor of learning organizations. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on organizational learning by linking together internal with external sets of variables. Following this method, the study reveals how interactions between organizational and environmental variables affect learning processes.",Culture; Leadership; Learning,Cell culture; Learning systems; Surveys; Environmental variables; Leadership; Learning; Learning mechanism; Learning organizations; Military products; Organizational cultures; Organizational learning; Knowledge management

Through the mechanism of status transfer, a focal actor that establishes relationships with higher status others will enhance his status and, subsequently, enjoy those benefits associated with higher status. However, if lower status actors gain in status and derive subsequent benefits by affiliating with higher status actors, what is in such affiliations for the higher status actors? Why do we observe affiliations between high and low status actors at all if high status actors face reduction of their status? The answer lies in the fact that while low status actors gain through the implicit status transfer, high status actors derive greater benefits in terms of the overt material exchange such relationships entail. In other words, low status actors gain in status and derive associated benefits in their future transactions whereas high status actors gain by being able to secure greater attendance and effort regarding the overt, material, exchange in the current relationship. Using longitudinal data from racing team and engine supplier relationships in Formula One Racing, we find support for the idea that actors higher in status are able to derive greater material benefits in relationships with those lower in status.",Embeddedness; Status,Embeddedness; Engine supplier; Formula One; Longitudinal data; Status

Using theories of legitimacy, signaling, and prestige we investigate the circumstances surrounding outside director appointments and seek to clarify why we observe certain individuals joining boards as outside directors. We examine the phenomenon of outside directorships through an executive's home firm career, prestigious affiliations, and the firms which employ them as outsiders. In general, we find significant differences between those executives who join their first board vs. those who go on to become outside directors on more than one firm.

We propose a model to provide insights into the role of a job-seeker's social network in providing comparison information for assessing his or her job search performance. This comparative information is linked to perceptions and feelings that are critical for one's job search success. Our model integrates social network theory with current research on social comparison processes. We highlight the importance of the quality of information from one's social network for job seekers when other comparative information is not readily available.

We find that the relationship between these determinants and underpricing has been very different for technology IPOs from their non-technology counterparts, and the insiders (venture capitalists and entrepreneurs) of technology IPOs use different strategies from their non-technology counterparts (i.e., pay more for analyst coverage, retains more insider shares, more insider selling at lock-up expirations, etc) that determine the higher degree of underpricing of their firms.",Analyst coverage; Insider Ownership; IPO Underpricing,Industry; Agency theory; Analyst coverage; Behavioral theory; Higher-degree; Information asymmetry; Insider Ownership; IPO Underpricing; Prospect theory; Venture capitalists; Technology
The effects of utilitarian & ontological individualism-collectivism on multitask performance in teams,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859073623&partnerID=40&md5=33108a789ff86641d4f300d632f5079e,"Individuals working in teams often face an equivocal situation in which attention and effort must be divided between personal endeavors and collective pursuits. We propose that individual differences in two types of individualism-collectivism-utilitarian and ontological-influence how team members resolve this equivocality. Results of a study of the members of 52 teams with either high or low interdependence, a variable indicative of differences in situational strength also likely to influence how individual/collective equivocality is resolved, show that heterogeneous intra-individual combinations of the two types of individualism-collectivism, either utilitarian collectivism coupled with ontological individualism or utilitarian individualism coupled with ontological collectivism, lead to greater speed of team member performance in conditions of low structural interdependence. Findings also indicate that homogeneous intra-individual combinations of the two types of individualism-collectivism, either utilitarian individualism and ontological individualism or utilitarian collectivism and ontological collectivism, lead to greater accuracy of team member performance. These results suggest that speed and accuracy of team member performance stem from different underlying processes and require different profiles of individual-level resources. They also verify the empirical independence of the utilitarian and ontological dimensions of individualism-collectivism, and indicate that their effects on behavior in teams and organizations merit further investigation.

But they have shown remarkably little interest in systematic investigation of the factors that allow an academic field to emerge at all. In this paper, we model the ascendance of a new academic field as a successful social movement, consisting of three major elements: differentiation, mobilization, and legitimacy-building. For a new field to emerge, the aspiring community must differentiate itself from other existing fields, making claims about how a class of important problems cannot be solved by these status quo entities. Second, there must be a mobilization of resources; the elements of collective action - political opportunity structure, a bounded set of shared interests, and social infrastructure - must be in place or put in place. Third, the aspiring community must build legitimacy in the eyes of the academic establishment, both by intellectual persuasion as well as by adherence to the norms, styles, and standards of adjacent established fields. We illustrate each element of our model by applying it to the published histories of four academic fields: agricultural chemistry, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and radio astronomy. And we apply the model comprehensively to explain the rise of a specific field within the administrative sciences: strategic management.",Development of academic fields; Social movements; Strategic management,Artificial intelligence; Molecular biology; Radio astronomy; Strategic planning; Academic establishments; Academic fields; Collective action; Major elements; Social infrastructure; Social movements; Sociology of science; Status quo; Strategic management; Systematic investigations; Education

While agreeing that AI is a powerful technique, we argue that traditional action research and its problem solving orientation have been unduly criticized. The real issue is not whether a given situation is framed as a problem or an opportunity but whether whatever framework is used bestirs the actors involved to think, collaborate and learn at their best. Sometimes the invitation to problem solve can evoke dreams of heroism and thereby heighten imagination and daring, while at others it can bring depressing memories of failure and blame. Drawing on attachment theory from the field of child development and short term therapy, we argue that what determines the response is the nature of the actor's attachment to the organization at the time the invitation to problem solve occurs. Paralleling attachment theory on an interpersonal level, we hypothesize four categories of organizational attachment: secure, dismissive, resistant and passive. Participants respond positively to either kind of OD initiative when they experience their attachment to the organization as secure. Past negative experiences with action research may evoke less secure attachments, but past successes can evoke a secure response. AI hedges its bets by inviting actors to explore memories of secure attachments before dreaming new possibilities and creating designs that may cause the participants to address problems in implementation.",Action research; Appreciative inquiry; Attachment theory,Action research; Appreciative inquiry; Attachment theory; Child development; Negative experiences; Short term

Current research, however, does not effectively integrate or fully explore the relationship between these two frameworks. Given the extant lack of a systematic approach for addressing such questions of conceptual integration involving two distinct but related models, we develop a four-level framework of increasing integration intensity. Using this novel integrative approach, and building on information processing, behavioral, and motivational theoretical perspectives, we generate and test hypotheses examining how the TO and FU approaches relate to 1) each other and 2) organization intentions and responses to strategic issues. Analyzing data from how firms reacted to the economic uncertainty of early 2003, the results of our study indicate that our integrative model containing the variables of Favorability, Urgency, and Influence (which we dub FUI) is a better predictor of both intentions and actual responses than is either the UF or OT approaches alone.",Organizational response; Strategic issue diagnosis; Theory integration,Uncertainty analysis; Economic uncertainty; Integration intensity; Integrative modeling; Organizational response; Strategic issues; Integration

This paper evaluates a survivor-based approach to inter-industry relatedness by comparing survivor based measures of relatedness with equivalent measures relying on SIC-distances.

We propose to treat the normative foundation on the one hand (value) and stakeholders and issues on the other hand (strategy) as two dimensions of CSR that are conceptually independent of each other. We suggest that the CSR engagement of a corporation can be either on value or off value, and that it can be either on strategy or off strategy. Cross-classifying two levels of each of these leads us to consider four CSR prototypes which we label - Robber Baron, Robin Hood, Book Keeper, and Statesman. Those prototypes are shown to exhibit specific characteristics on a set of features. Our framework for categorization of CSR, analysis of featural qualities of each type, and suggested pathways for migration, opens up both construct validity aspects and comparative studies into CSR. Rather than simply developing inventories of CSR activities, and seeking correlations with financial performance measures, it is possible to turn attention to a broad range of independent (i.e., CSR preconditions) as well as dependent (i.e., CSR consequences) variables, and attempt meaningful comparisons to achieve relevant benchmarks. Furthermore, it serves to bridge the gap between CSR scholarship and practice which seem to have evolved in parallel universes.",CSR practice; CSR theory; Managerial framework,Benchmarking; Comparative studies; Construct validity; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); CSR practice; CSR theory; Financial performance; Managerial framework; Middle-range theory; Economic and social effects

First, building upon the instrumental stakeholder argument and agency perspective, we develop the argument that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between corporate charitable giving and corporate financial performance. Second, we predict that the inverse U-shaped relationship changes over time: firms that engage in moderate amounts of giving in a later period would have a higher level of financial performance than those in an earlier period.

Success on technical projects is enhanced through a unique project design-one that weaves social networks and social capital into the projects' formal structures. The results also demonstrate that centrality in two social advice networks-technical and organizational- constructed to reflect the information exchange and communication flow in an R&D environment is critical in shaping the projects' outcomes. In addition to providing one of the few empirical accounts of the effects of social networks and centrality on the performance of R&D projects, the study challenges the prevailing views with regard to the relationship between formal and informal structures.

It argues that while contemporary scholars improve on James in many respects, they nonetheless have inherited several limitations of his work, including a preoccupation with defining spirituality, demonstrating its tangible benefits, and exploring the spiritual orientations of corporate leaders. In particular, scholars of workplace spirituality have inherited from James the dubious notion that spirituality is fundamentally a property of individuals. The unfortunate consequences this has had for our knowledge of workplace spirituality as a cultural/organizational phenomenon are illustrated through a review of research on spirituality in nursing. It is suggested that a major reason why so little is known about the conditions under which nurses and other frontline workers can develop shared understandings of the sacred is that most researchers subscribe to what is labeled here a subjective model of workplace spirituality. An alternative, relational model is proposed and some of the new questions it raises about spirituality in the workplace are presented. The article concludes by suggesting how these relational questions might be addressed using appropriate, relation-oriented methods developed recently by cultural sociologists.",Meaning; Spirituality; Work,Corporate leaders; Front-line workers; Meaning; Relational Model; Shared understanding; Spirituality; Work; Nursing

"Time to change, time for change: How was time used to change a global company?",2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859025960&partnerID=40&md5=e906fd415eaaa5e8a76f577c2fcecf2a,"Time is often claimed as the core of culture, and culture is an essential aspect of organizational change. Therefore, time can affect, and be affected by, organisational change. The role of time is rarely investigated in organisational development and change. This paper describes and analyzes a case where time was used as a catalyst for organisational change. In early 1990s, an alarm rang among the employees of one of the largest conglomerates (chaebol) in Korea, Samsung, that it was ®time to change to compete and survive in the global market. The companys chairman ingeniously spotted ®time as a tool for change. The company introduced a new temporal scheme by which its employees had to start at seven in the morning and leave office at four in the afternoon. This paper investigates how the new temporal scheme affected various aspects of organizational culture, which in turn caused organizational change. The new temporal system contributed to facilitating organizational change in three ways: (i) by creating a sense of crisis for change, (ii) by searching for new ways of working, and (iii) by making the employees more aware of the value of time as a resource. Although the new temporal scheme failed to survive internal and external challenges, it left many positive heritages to the organizations and employees involved, to some of which the success of the company in following years can be attributed.",Organizational change; Organizational culture; Time,International trade; Global market; Organisational change; Organisational development; Organizational change; Organizational cultures; Samsung; Temporal scheme; Temporal systems; Time; Value of time; Management
Psychological contract breach: Assessing underlying assumptions,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088339205&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18780819&partnerID=40&md5=6dea9890cf2684f6d2f269d9b38a68e3,"Existing research demonstrating negative relationships between psychological contract breach and employee attitudes and behaviors suggests that organizations fulfill the promises they make to employees. This may be interpreted to mean that organizations promise little to newcomers from the beginning of their employment relationship. The present study questions the validity of such advice on the basis of the measurement techniques used to assess breach (i.e., difference scores and direct measures) in past research. In a three-wave longitudinal study of employees on a co-operative education work term, we assessed the underlying assumption of past research that perceptions of psychological contract breach and their effects on outcomes are due to a discrepancy between promised and delivered inducements. Our findings suggest that breach perceptions are not composed of a mere discrepancy between promised and delivered inducements, and that the relations among these component variables and satisfaction, feelings of violation, and employment intentions are more complex than is suggested by most past research.",Employee attitudes; Psychological contract breach; Psychological contracts,Personnel; Cooperative education; Direct measures; Employee attitudes; Employment relationship; Longitudinal study; Measurement techniques; Psychological contracts; Work terms; Behavioral research

Despite this attention, empirical results in this tradition are exceedingly fragile. This paper proposes three reasons for the empirical inconsistencies in the literature-that small and large firms differ in the extent to which they may offer efficient incentive contracts, that small and large firms differ in their stock of technological experiences, and that small and large firms differ in their ability to efficiently utilize internal and market contracts. The paper suggests that the instability in existing work is at least partially due to the failure of prior work to fully capture the joint and interactive effects associated with these three differences. Results from a ten-year study of 523 semiconductor firms indicate that the benefits of technological experience developed internally and of technological experience accessed via co-development partners diminish as a firm increases in size. In contrast, the benefits of experiences accessed via production-sourcing contracts are strengthened as a firm increases in size. These results are broadly consistent with the notion that differences in the relative incentives and abilities of entrepreneurial and established firms affect their innovative activity.",Experiential learning; Innovation; Resource based,Competitive position; Entrepreneurial firms; Experiential learning; Incentive contracts; Incentive structure; Innovative activities; Resource-based; Technological innovation
Hospitals on the road to competitive advantage?

Research concerning DRGs mostly concentrates on the system, functions, and outcomes of DRGs, especially reduction in length of stay, decrease in costs and the improvement of the patient treatment process. Based on a dynamic capability approach our study investigates the implementation process itself. Data from direct observation, documents, and interviews with the occupational professionals involved identified several influencing variables concerning successes or failures in the adoption of DRGs. In successful clinics a higher level of acceptance is observed as these clinics accept change, gain internal resources to compensate the lack of external support, and organize processes of implementation by shifting their capabilities to required changes. Unsuccessful clinics resist change due to the defense of medical and traditional values of patient treatment, and the inability to compensate lack of resources. They organize their implementation processes due to the traditional division of labor without enhancing their capabilities. The contribution to organizational theory lies in the adaptation of a dynamic capability approach to the field of health care management by augmenting the categories of this approach and by presenting empirical findings on processes of implementation regarding an administrative innovation in hospitals. The implications of our work for management practice concerns the ability of managers and chief physicians to consider resources and capabilities that address the change process itself and resources and capabilities supporting a new asset position within their field.",Diagnosis related groups; Dynamic capability approach; Implementation process,Competition; Patient treatment; Administrative innovation; Care management; Change process; Competitive advantage; Diagnosis related groups; Division of labor; Dynamic capabilities; Dynamic capability approach; Empirical findings; Implementation process; Internal resources; Length of stay; Management practices; Organizational theory; Traditional values; Hospitals

In particular, I examine the short and long run effects of both greenfield and acquisition entry on entrepreneurial entry, as well as on the exit and growth of indigenous incumbents in regions. I use a comprehensive dataset of all firms in the Canadian biotech industry between 1978 and 2002 to study the dynamic effects within all regions that have experienced an external entry.

This article makes the first step. In addition, it is not known why some organizations can maintain a good alignment between strategy and structure, while others cannot. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to identify antecedents that can help to explain the alignment.

A double case study examines how and why business actors in two national fields translate the foreign institutions of diversity management and socially responsible investment into unreceptive fields. Their motivation was apparently to solve a problem and modernize the field, which led them to pursue partial deinstitutionalization of the dominant institutional logic. The mechanisms consisted in recombining elements from two disparate frames, a local and a foreign one, to develop a new frame that qualified as innovative, modern, legitimate, and continuous with existing practice. The choice of frames was fairly deliberate, and the combination of frames was based on pragmatic decisions, yet the translation process was governed in large part by institutions, timing, and optimal field conditions. The study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms of translation, which have implications for frame alignment and institutional change.",Deinstitutionalization; Frame alignment; Translation,Deinstitutionalization; Diversity managements; Field conditions; Frame alignments; Institutional change; Inter-organizational; Socially responsible investments; Translation process; Translation (languages)

The difficulty faced by managers is compounded by the lack of studies examining organizational communication within a context of organizational change (Eisenberg, Andrews, Murphy, & Laine-Timmerman, 1999; Lewis & Seibold, 1996). Not surprisingly then, is there a paucity of organizational change theory to guide further research and practitioners. This paper addresses the lack of organizational change communication research and contributes to theoretical development of communication during organizational change. A model of change communication during continuous change is presented from the analysis of two longitudinal empirical studies. Central constructs of the model are the monologic change communication, the dialogic change communication and the background talk of change. Further Van de Ven and Poole's (1995) Process Theories of Change are extended to consider the sequencing of the three constructs. The findings suggest that the sequencing of the dominant change communication approaches is informed by an alignment of individual communication competences and organizational change communication expectations.",Case study; Change communication; Theory development,Communication research; Empirical studies; Organizational change; Organizational communication; Process theory; Theoretical development; Theory development; Information theory

However, earlier literature, research from outside the management discipline, and research published outside of the mainstream management literature suggest that humor has important implications for organizations. In this paper we explore the role that humor plays in leadership, in building cohesiveness, and in generating creativity. In addition, because culture represents an increasingly important role in shaping modern organizations, we argue that the omission of culture from research on humor and organizations represents a serious challenge for those who want to explore humor and organizations and contribute to the literature in a meaningful way. To address this issue, we draw on theoretical constructs from the literature on societal and organizational culture to explore empirically testable hypotheses about the relationship between culture, humor, and organizational outcomes. In particular, we develop propositions regarding how culture influences whether or not communications are interpreted to be humorous, and how culture shapes norms for the appropriate use of humor. In addition, we formulate propositions that cast culture as a moderator between humor and organizationally relevant effects of humor. We hope that this paper will stimulate other researchers' interest in empirical research on the topic.",Culture; Humor; Review,Cell culture; Research; Reviews; Empirical research; Humor; In-buildings; Organizational context; Organizational cultures; Organizational outcomes; Societies and institutions

We examine a longitudinal dataset of the network structure of past and present employment ties among all partners in Nashville law firms from 1933 to 1978. Our basic proposition is that a law firm that has a central position in the professional network among partners (i.e., having partners whose prior law firm affiliations create ""bridges"" or linkages between otherwise disconnected firms) will be better positioned to discover, access, and exploit lucrative opportunities than more peripheral law firms. We thus make the general prediction that a law firm's network centrality (based on the unique or ""non-redundant"" bridges of its partners) will increase its growth rate. We also examine the temporal context within which the bridges of a law firm's partners develop and distinguish between a firm's ""current"" network centrality (based on the bridges created in the last year), its ""past"" network centrality (based on bridges that were created at any point prior to the last year), and its ""imprinted"" network centrality (based on bridges that were created during the formative stage in the career of a focal law firm's partners). We theorize and find support for the predictions that network centrality increases law firm's growth rates and that the temporal and ecological context within which professional networks develop have a persisting effect on firm performance.",Dynamics of social networks; Imprinting; Organizational ecology,Ecology; Firm Performance; Imprinting; Network centralities; Network structures; Non-redundant; Organizational ecology; Past and present; Temporal dynamics; Professional aspects

This study seeks to inform this question by studying performance implications of diversification within the software industry. Software firms can exploit production-side synergies by developing products for related operating system platforms. They can also exploit consumption-side synergies by serving the multiple needs of the same customers with a suite of related products. In the software industry, there are strong complementarities between the production-side and consumptions-side synergies. Thus, firm performance depends not only on the two types of synergies but also on their interaction. Due to the complementarities, absence or weakness along one type of synergy could diminish the value of the other type of synergy, and negatively influence the overall firm performance. The study finds empirical support for these hypotheses in a sample of about 1200 software firms over a period of 13 years (1990-2002).

We also identify a key role for brokers as self-appointed conflict handlers in teams. Contrary to previous research, our results suggest brokers may play a facilitative, rather than a self-interested role in organizations.

To increase group performance, which could in turn determine individual outcomes, one's peers should be better than oneself. But to increase the probability of getting ahead, one's peers should be worse than oneself. Individuals will have to tradeoff these conflicting motives when making judgments that will affect peers desires (and choices) to remain in the organization. Results from a television game where this dilemma is stark and involves large stakes, indicate that individuals make judgments that could potentially eliminate others who are substantially better or substantially worse performers than themselves. This tendency is moderated by the size of the reward pool and the strength of the player: individuals are more likely to vote out high (rather than low) performers as the size of the reward pool increases and low performers are more likely to vote to eliminate strong performers than strong performers are.",Competition; Incentives; Mixed-motives,Group performance; Hierarchical organizations; Incentives; Mixed-motives; Weakest links; Competition

Interviews with the airline's managers and employees indicate that Continental's improved employee relations stem from an employment system fundamentally different from that at traditional airlines, marked by an ""involvement-based"" (rather than ""command-based"") authority system and by management commitment to a philosophy of treating each employee as a valued team member. Thus, focusing primarily on the airline's formal programs, such as its performance-based bonuses or even the bundle of practices consistent with a high-commitment work system, likely misses the essence of Continental's approach. The study also describes key actions and conditions that likely facilitated Continental's adoption of this new employment system, despite its history of adversarial employee relations. In particular, the breakdown of Continental's traditional unionized employment system during the strife and bankruptcies of the 1980s may have made the subsequent adoption of the involvement-based system easier-a conjecture which does not necessarily bode well for the short-term future of airlines currently attempting to restructure.",Airlines; Employment systems; Turnaround,Employment; Human resource management; Continental Airlines; Employee relations; Formal programs; Key actions; Labor management; Performance based; Team members; Turnaround; Air transportation

Further, we expect the positive influence of expatriate staffing levels on subsidiary performance to be weaker, the more developed the institutional environment. Results based on an analysis of expatriate employment levels in more than 13,015 foreign subsidiaries of 2,952 Japanese firms in 48 countries substantially support our arguments.

We examine this question through an analysis of all shareholder proposals introduced from 1969 to 2003 on the topic of international human rights and labor standards, a topic we call Global Corporate Responsibility (GCR). Our analysis demonstrates that religious organizations, activist groups, and universities played an important early role in identifying and raising issues of corporate responsibility and validating the topic for shareholder concern in the early 1970s. We also identify an important role for public pension funds in championing this agenda over time, beginning in the 1980s. When public pension funds supported shareholder proposals on the GCR theme, campaigns attain a level of persistence and success that is more likely to attract the attention of managers. Issues that fail to involve public pension funds exhibit more variable life spans and success rates. Many types of institutional investors played an important role as innovators and supporters in bringing new issues to the foreground of public GCR debate. The support of large pension funds, however, largely determined the success of an issue in consistently garnering the attention of managers.",Corporate social responsibility; Investor activism; Strategic agenda,Investments; Managers; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Human rights; Investor activism; Labor standards; Life span; Pension funds; Strategic agenda; Shareholders

It defines the process by which information is transformed into an ontologically stable category of price. Reconstructing this sensemaking is a crucial task, since the settlement of prices for futures markets has significant organizational and economic consequences. And the recent emergence of electronic trading as an alternative to traditional ways of trading makes this issue more vivid. Futures exchanges have historically relied on a trading technology known as ""open outcry,"" where traders gather in a central physical location to buy and sell futures contracts on a range of physical and financial commodities. The organizational practices of open outcry produces prices deeply embedded in the interactions among these traders. Since the early 1990s, the technology of futures trading has been challenged by the introduction of electronic trading platforms. Automated trading systems shift the point of exchange from a centralized physical location to a decentralized network of terminals, located in investment banks and smaller boutique trading firms. With the elimination of the exchange trading floor and transformation of trading technology, the schemas and organizational settings that supported the creation of prices in open outcry have required renegotiation. This paper uses participant observation and interview data gathered on the trading floors of open outcry and electronic exchanges to investigate how sensemaking leads to the production of futures market prices.",Futures markets; Organizational sensemaking; Prices,Costs; Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Floors; Investments; Automated trading systems; Decentralized networks; Economic consequences; Organizational practices; Organizational setting; Participant observations; Prices; Sensemaking; Financial markets
How do firms gain and retain their dominant position?,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859018500&partnerID=40&md5=d85a7cecbeb7576beed35ca2322bba05,"In this paper we analyze the product launch decisions by dominant and fringe firms. In particular, we explore three questions in the product entry process: which firms enter, when they enter, and what happens after they enter. To do this, we use a database of all product launches in the desktop laser printer industry from 1984 to 1997. We show that dominant firms are quite selective in the submarkets they pursue. In particular, they often stay out of the technologically advanced markets, and choose to enter markets well behind the technological frontier set by fringe firms. When dominant firms do enter submarkets, they are usually early entrants, launching products before many fringe firms. Additionally, we analyze what happens to markets after entry by dominant firms. Many antitrust scholars and policymakers fear that dominant firm entry into technology markets forces out fringe competitors, leading to high market power for the dominant entrant. We find that both entry and exit rates increase after a dominant firms enters a submarket, but that there is a net increase on average in the number of competing models and substantial growth in demand. In addition, while dominant firms introduce models priced at a premium relative to the average in a product class, the average price within that class tends to decline more as a result of competition from dominant firms than from fringe firms.",Industry evolution; Management of technology,Commerce; Industry; Competing models; Desktop lasers; Industry evolution; Management of technology; Market Power; Policy makers; Product class; Product launch; Submarkets; Competition

These employees have different preferences related to performance rewards. Our research employs the following three constructs: the institutional framework and its formal and informal implications for incentive compensation, diminishing marginal utility of individuals related to performance rewards, and the incentive system as a motivational device in the organizational work environment. We have conducted an empirical study using an enriched form of Hofstede's cross-cultural questionnaire to examine employees of one MNC in China, Germany, Japan and the USA. Our results show that employees from these countries have different preferences on incentives and that incentive plans designed for one country might not even have motivating consequences in the others. We also find that the logic of diminishing marginal utility applies to certain rewards.",Cross-national comparison; Incentive compensation; Performance rewards,Cross-national; Diminishing marginal utilities; Empirical studies; Incentive compensation; Incentive systems; Institutional framework; Performance rewards; Work environments; Motivation

We posit that when individuals work extensively in a virtual mode, the quality of their relationships with supervisors becomes even more instrumental in determining their organizational commitment, job satisfaction and performance. Based on a survey of professional-level virtual workers in a Fortune 100 company, our results revealed that for those who worked more extensively in a virtual mode, the quality of their supervisory relationship had a far greater impact on their level of organizational commitment and job satisfaction, but not their performance.",,Organizational Commitment; Professional levels; Virtual works; Job satisfaction

Whereas past work has primarily evaluated subordinate responses to these managerial activities, this paper introduces and develops a theory regarding the determinants of these actions. We specifically focus on how the presence of various forms of superior-subordinate conflicts (concerning goals, tasks, and interpersonal issues) stimulate managerial concerns around subordinate task performance and managerial authority. We argue that managers attempt to address these concerns using particular combinations of task control, trust-building, and fairness-building activities. The paper concludes with a discussion about how the theory we pose here refines and extends organizational research in several domains.",Conflict; Control; Trust,Control engineering; Building activities; Conflict; Interpersonal issues; Managerial actions; Managerial activity; Organizational research; Task performance; Trust; Managers

Much of the emerging scholarly literature has been concerned with investigating how change in broader, field-level institutions such as cultural logics and belief systems can influence change in organizational practices. Less understood are interorganizational norms and how they begin to break down. In this research, I examine the breakdown of such norms as a type of institutional change process. More specifically, I investigate the 'no-lateral-hiring' norm in the corporate law field and its subsequent breakdown. I document the emergence and the subsequent breakdown of the no-lateral-hiring norm. I then examine various forces that may have contributed to its decline. I focus in particular on the endogenous dynamics of its breakdown. I generally argue that purposive action on the part of actors may have played a role in promoting the breakdown of the no-lateral-hiring norm. I use panel data on large Chicago law firms and all the lawyers in these firms for the period 1974-1990 to test hypotheses about the breakdown of this norm. The results suggest that higher status firms were more likely to engage in lateral hiring, but the most elite firms were less likely to engage in the practice. They further suggest that firms that had previously engaged in lateral hiring were more likely to subsequently engage in the practice. Finally, firms that had lost personnel to other law firms were more likely to abandon the no-lateral-hiring norm.",Institutional change,Belief systems; Break down; Endogenous dynamics; Field level; Institutional change; Inter-organizational; Organizational practices; Panel data; Employment
Agents or stewards: How government manages its contracting relationships with nonprofit social service providers,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859029748&partnerID=40&md5=136332237eed6fc1a8c0775742787cbc,"This study examines the context and variation in which government manages its contracting relationships with nonprofit organizations using agency and stewardship theory. Interviews were conducted with public and nonprofit managers involved in social services contract relationships at the state and county level in New York State. The use of trust, reputation, information, and monitoring as well as other factors influence the manner in which contract relationships are managed. The findings suggest that nonprofits engaged in contracts with government are managed largely as stewards, but there is much less variance in the management practices applied than either theory would suggest. This results in part from the nature of the service, the lack of market competitiveness, and administrative capacity constraints. The intergovernmental environment in which social services are implemented and delivered poses complex challenges for public managers responsible for managing contract relationships. The findings from this study document those challenges and the corresponding management practices used with nonprofit contractors.",Agency theory; Public management; Stewardship theory,Competition; Managers; Agency theory; Capacity constraints; County level; Management practices; New York State; Non profit organizations; Public management; Social service; Stewardship theory; Management

Such ties create both opportunities and constraints for innovation by units of a business group and, in aggregate, for the group as a whole C̈ opportunities that arise from access to information, people, money, and other resources, but also constraints that arise from entrenched relationships among different actors and a short term focus on immediate activities. We test our predictions by investigating how the overall density and individual centrality of ties affects group and affiliate innovativeness within 267 business groups in Taiwan between 1981 and 2000. The most innovative groups tend to be those with loosely-connected operating and director relationships, along with tight investment ties that allow them to share financial resources among affiliates. In turn, the most innovative affiliates tend to be central businesses in the loosely-connected groups. The results are robust to both parametric and non-parametric estimation. We extend the implications to the more general setting of multi-business firms.",Groups; Innovation; Network-ties,Innovation; Business groups; Financial resources; Groups; Innovativeness; Network tie; Network-ties; Non-parametric estimations; Short term; Industry

A review of the empirical literature reveals a variety of interpretations about some aspects of the phenomenon such as its underlying causal mechanisms and its level of analysis. To stimulate further progress in empirical research on dominant designs, we advocate a standardization of terminology by conceptualizing products as complex artifacts that evolve in the form of a nested hierarchy of technology cycles. Such a nested complex system perspective provides both unambiguous definitions of dominant designs (stable core components that can be stable interfaces) and inclusion of multiple levels of analysis (system, subsystems, components). We introduce the concept of an operational principle and offer a systematic definition of core and peripheral subsystems based on the concept of pleiotropy. We also discuss how the proposed terminological standardization can stimulate cumulative research on dominant designs.",Architecture of complex systems; Dominant designs; Product life cycle,Large scale systems; Standardization; Terminology; Dominant design; Empirical literature; Empirical research; Industrial dynamics; Nested hierarchy; Operational principles; Product life cycles; Technology cycle; Life cycle

Using data from the shipbuilding and shipping industries on the Clyde River from 1711 to 1990, I examine how horizontal intra-industry ties, vertical ties between industries, and other social institutions interacted to shape economic action in the local economy. I find that whereas horizontal ties benefited firms in both the shipbuilding and shipping industries, the vertical ties that connect actors across these industries helped builders but harmed owners. Additional analyses uncover two distinct sets of norms that influenced the distribution of value in these networks. Value appropriation in horizontal networks was governed by moral considerations, where strong firms supported their weaker counterparts. By contrast, vertical connections approximated power and dependence relations, as strong firms leveraged value from their weaker exchange partners.",Industrial districts; Interorganizational linkages; Networks,Networks (circuits); Shipbuilding; Ships; Shipyards; Approximated power; Dependence relation; Industrial districts; Inter-organizational linkages; Inter-organizational network; Local economy; Shipping industry; Social structure; Industrial economics

It contributes to the literature by linking the two streams of knowledge, proposing and testing the mediating role of LMX between psychological contract breach and employee performance. We also examined the moderating role of LMX between breach and employee performance. Since high LMX relationships involve mutual trust, respect, and obligations (Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975), this may further impose higher expectations on the leader. Thus, an experience of breach may be construed as a form of betrayal. As a consequence, employees with high quality LMX relationships are more likely to retaliate by performing less extra-role behaviors and by neglecting their inrole responsibilities. We present two competing perspectives in explaining the moderating role of LMX between breach and employee performance. Data were collected from 177 employees and their direct supervisors from a large manufacturing organization in the Philippines. In general, we found that psychological contract breach and LMX were significantly related to civic virtue behavior, altruism and inrole performance. Results also showed that LMX fully mediated the relationship between psychological contract breach and altruism and in-role performance but partially mediated the psychological contract breach - civic virtue behavior relationship. Finally, LMX moderated the relationship between breach and altruism.

In this study, I sought to fill this gap by developing the concept of emotional fit and investigating its psychological and behavioral outcomes. I defined emotional fit as the congruence between the activation levels of an employee's affective trait and the emotional climate of his/her workplace. I hypothesized that emotional fit will be positively related to an employee's: a) connection with others, b) connection with work, and c) performance, through the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion. To test these hypotheses, I conducted a cross-level field study in which the emotional climate component of emotional fit was analyzed at the contextual level and then was compared with the affective trait component, measured at the individual level. I collected data from 257 employees within 40 work units across 11 organizations and their supervisors. The results showed that emotional fit was positively related to connection with others and connection with work, but not performance. In terms of connection with others, emotional fit was positively related to affective commitment and negatively related to surface acting. As for connection with work, emotional fit was positively related to intention to stay in the organization and negatively related to psychological withdrawal. As predicted, emotional exhaustion mediated these relationships. Implications of these findings on the emotions and organizational climate literatures are discussed.",Emotional exhaustion; Emotions; Organizational climate,Personnel; Affective commitments; Behavioral outcomes; Contextual factors; Emotional exhaustion; Emotions; Individual levels; Mediating effect; Organizational climate; Behavioral research

However, research on the effects of this interaction on the resulting quality of a firms' scientific output is scarce. This is an important gap in the literature since the specific mechanisms by which public-private collaboration might improve firm, industrial or even regional-wide performance are not well known. Improvements to research quality through public-private collaboration is one obvious channel by which firms and industry may benefit from co-mingling with academic expertise. This paper attempts to fill this gap by comparing the effect of private-public collaboration on research quality using unique data from the U.K. biotechnology sector from 1988-2001. Specifically, this paper tests whether collaboration with academic researchers improves the the quality of scientific research that U.K. biotech firms produce. The paper concludes that collaborative research does indeed improve research quality, although the status of of the academic researchers and the nature of the biotech firm in question are significant factors in determining how strong a positive effect public-private collaboration has on research quality. For firms this implies that they should seek alliances with high status academics with established research reputations. From a science and technology policy perspective, the paper recommends strengthening support for public science and encouraging collaboration across the public-private divide to ensure that industry can fully reap the benefits of academic science.",Biotechnology; Collaboration; Research,Research; Academic science; Biotechnology sectors; Collaboration; Collaborative research; Public-private interactions; Science and technology policy; Scientific output; Scientific researches; Biotechnology

One employed a ""fountain"" approach which sought to assert itself as the central hub in the region's knowledge networks thus filling the vacuum left by the decline of the old industry actors who had previously dominated the local economy. The other faced similar circumstances, but employed a ""forum"" approach which aimed at building relationships among organizations in the region. Evidence from the network analysis suggests the two approaches have shaped the evolution of knowledge networks in the two regions.

Where do alliances come from?

Previous organizational research has focused on prior alliance activity as a driver of alliance formation. Yet, in the context of young firms which have limited track records, such explanations do not suffice. This paper proposes an alternative mechanism of alliance formation that focuses on the individuals that form the upper echelon of a firm. We theorize that the career affiliations of top managers facilitate the formation of alliances by acting as a signal of legitimacy, status, and substance. Utilizing a typology of upper echelon experience that distinguishes between upstream, horizontal, and downstream employment-based affiliations, we propose that the prominence of upper echelon affiliations signal a firm's quality and legitimacy, which in turn promotes alliance formation. We further unpeel this general proposition to examine the specific ways in which these signals transpire, suggesting that status dynamics and homophily tendencies determine the formation of prominent and specific types of alliances. We test our ideas with an event-history dataset of 3,200 career histories of top managers who took biotechnology firms public between 1979 and 1996, and find that firms possessing more upper echelon affiliations with prominent downstream and horizontal organizations have a higher rate of forming alliances. Further, we find that the better the match between the type of employment affiliation and the type of alliance partner, the greater the rate of alliance formation. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for organizational research on young entrepreneurial firms.",Alliances; Entrepreneurship; Upper echelons,Statistical tests; Access to resources; Alliances; Biotechnology firms; Entrepreneurial firms; Entrepreneurship; Horizontal organizations; Organizational research; Upper echelons; Managers

As the field of operations strategy matures, we need to refine the theories and abandon weak models through cumulative research. This study is an attempt to help advance the theory building initiative of contemporary researchers in the field. After presenting a detailed review of the literature from both camps, a comprehensive set of hypotheses is introduced to a) test the prevalence of the cumulative model, b) help uncover the underlying sequence used in pursuing competitive priorities, and c) test the performance impact for companies at different stages of the cumulative model. The data used in this study comes from two high-ranking individuals from each of the 98 participating manufacturing units in the U.S. Multiple methods are deployed to discern data patterns, including a novel application of the hierarchical regression (mediating effects) model, to unearth the implied sequence of improvements from a cross-sectional data set. Strong support was found in favor of the cumulative model in the U.S., a region that has either not been studied previously (cf., Ferdows and De Meyer 1990) or not found to be so supportive of the cumulative model (cf., Noble 1995, Flynn and Flynn 2004).

What factors determine their fates? Scholars have suggested such culprits as rigidities in organizational capabilities, inability to manage changes in value networks, and failures of incentives. While none of the approaches explicitly excludes the potential role of managerial interpretations (or frames), neither do they address empirically or theoretically the role these frames play in shaping strategic choices and actions. This paper builds on an emerging stream of research that has begun to establish a systematic relationship between managerial cognition and strategic outcomes in periods of radical change to explore the contexts in which cognitive frames might matter and also to unpack the relationship between frames and capabilities. Analysis of 20 years of data on the response by 72 communications technology firms to the fiber-optic revolution shows that top managers' cognitive frames can help explain organizational outcomes. Controlling for multiple possible alternative explanations, I find that cognitive frames have a separate and significant effect on outcomes as measured by optical patenting patterns but that this relationship varies depending on timing of entry, the firm's main customer group and place in the value chain and is attenuated by whether or not the firm has prior organizational capabilities in the optical arena.",Discontinuities; Managerial cognition; Technology strategy,Fiber optics; Cognitive frames; Communications technology; Discontinuities; Managerial cognitions; Organizational capabilities; Organizational outcomes; Strategic choice; Technology strategies; Managers

Understanding how they overcome these barriers is important both for individuals actively constructing their work lives and for scholars of boundaryless careers. This paper proposes that individuals attempting to conduct radical career changes seek to learn the criteria recruiters use and the associated behavioral norms prior to recruiting. I offer a two-stage learning process in which job seekers first acquire information about what the hiring criteria are, then learn how to present themselves accordingly. During this process, three types of developmental make learning possible. The paper proposes social structural factors that facilitate access to and drive the effectiveness of those relationships. The main contribution of the paper is to the literature on networks and career development. It takes further existing theory of developmental networks by refining the mechanisms that drive existing and new developmental relationships.",Career change; Networks; Socialization,Networks (circuits); Career change; Career development; Job seekers; Learning process; Socialization; Structural factor; Work life; Employment

This paper tests the extent of this proposed linkage. We develop hypotheses based on Boyd's (1990, 1995) operationalization of the three dimensions of environmental uncertainty identified by Dess & Beard (1984): munificence, dynamism, and complexity. Extending prior stakeholder research (Berman, Wicks, Kotha and Jones, 1999), we employ what we call ""stakeholder performance"" as the dependent variable measuring the extent to which environmental uncertainty affects how firms manage stakeholder relationships. These initial models return mixed results that, in turn, suggest a need for further refinement. Additional explanation is obtained using the concept of managerial discretion (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987). We find that measures of managerial discretion moderate the relationship between stakeholder and resource dependence theories and conclude that the suggested overlap between stakeholder and resource dependence theories is overstated. These findings serve to carve out independent theoretical space for stakeholder theory as distinct from prior theories. Other differences between resource dependence and stakeholder theory are elaborated and implications for future research are discussed.",Managerial discretion; Resource dependence theory; Stakeholder theory,Dependent variables; Environmental uncertainty; Implications for futures; Managerial discretion; Paper tests; Resource dependences; Stakeholder theory; Three dimensions; Managers
The relationship of affect and cognition based trust with sharing and use of tacit knowledge,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088183699&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18779269&partnerID=40&md5=fb31b2daa4a80da354c4440e6b576719,This study explored the relationship between affect-based and cognition-based trust and the willingness of professionals to share and use tacit knowledge. Affect-based and cognition based trust both influence willingness to share and use tacit knowledge. The effects of each type of trust differ between positive referents (well-liked co-workers) and negative referents (not-well-liked co-workers). The results suggest that managers can facilitate sharing and use of tacit knowledge by undertaking programs that develop both cognition and affect-based trust among co-workers.,Interpersonal trust; Knowledge management; Tacit knowledge,Knowledge management; Affect-based; Cognition-based; Interpersonal trust; Tacit knowledge; Willingness to share; Human resource management

There is little evidence on the incentives for faculty members to get involved in patenting processes, of the obstacles, and of their perceptions of actions to be taken to successfully support the commercialization of academic knowledge through patents. In this paper we present such an assessment based on Italian faculty members. Our analysis is based on a sample of 208 faculty members who appeared to be inventors of Italian academic patents. Our findings show that Italian professors get involved in patenting activities to enhance their prestige and reputation and to look for new stimuli for their research; personal earnings do not represent an important incentive. Respondents appreciate universitylevel support mechanisms and the availability of an outside fertile local context (firms, scientific parks, incubators, venture capitalists, etc.). Implications are discussed with regard to the diffusion patenting policies within universities and the implementation of effective mechanisms supporting academic patenting processes.",Incentives; Patents; Universities,Effective mechanisms; Incentives; Market inefficiencies; Organizational change; Patenting activities; Patents; Universities; Venture capitalists; Patents and inventions

We use the results of a qualitative, participant-observer method to demonstrate specific instances of the ways in which organization-client interactions are simulated in a standardized patient training program.

Correlation and path analysis results indicated support for a model in which race and racial identity predicted stereotype threat, and the effect of stereotype threat on performance was mediated by anxiety and selfefficacy, although there were some key differences between the two testing situations.

A multinational and multifaceted research project is investigating a topic that intersects these three trends: international differences in information ethics. Scenarios based on information-related issues identified by Mason (1986) have been developed in order to examine ethical decision making. These scenarios are being used to survey managers on ethical dilemmas related to information privacy, access, property, and accuracy. Specific factors in each dilemma have been designed to reflect different stages in the moral development model developed by Kohlberg (1976). The information ethics of managers from different countries are now being studied. This paper focuses on the responses of managers from the two 21st century superpowers - the United States and the People's Republic of China - which have very different prevailing cultures. Although American and Chinese managers reached similar conclusions or outcomes on all but one of the ethical dilemmas, the factors shaping their decision making processes differed significantly.

The study found that the majority of studies (22 of 31, or 71 percent) reported detail on the item development process for the new scales used; the primary method for item development was deductive, based on existing theory. In the area of scale development, 55 percent of the studies reported using factor analysis for evaluation of constructs; of those that did, less than half of those reported information regarding factor retention criteria such as Eigen values. With regard to the internal consistency, the coefficient alpha was reported in only 52 percent of the studies. However, in those cases where scale development practices were described, the information was generally quite detailed and reflected statistical rigor. Few studies reported information related to scale evaluation.

To assess the generalizability and boundary conditions of our theory, we test it in two samples of senior managers: one from the United States (an individualistic culture) and the second from China (a collectivistic culture). As most previous research is distinctly American (Adler, 2002; Welsh, Luthans, and Sommer, 1993) and it is mostly individualistic rather than collectivistic (House & Aditya, 1997), examining the moderating affect of culture on the effectiveness leadership behaviors will help to fill this gap in both the leadership in international management literatures. In part 1 of the study, we find that charismatic leadership is positively related to social network extensiveness and that culture moderates this relationship.

The broad question that this research is addressing is whether conceptualizations of issues relating to learning that face practitioners can be useful in helping them to reflect on, and so address, the achievement of collaborative advantage in their practical collaborative settings. The particular focus of this article is on attitudes to inter-partner learning (that is, to exchange of knowledge between collaborating partners). The theoretical conceptualizations derived are based upon action research within partnership development programmes in both private and public sector settings. Basic attitudes to learning - ""selfish"", ""shared"" and ""sidelined"" - are identified and through an analysis of the data collected during the programmes, these are unpacked to reveal stances that are subtle and varied manifestations of these. The findings suggest that the distinction between selfish and shared learning in collaborations is fuzzy and that many stances have an element of both basic attitudes. For practitioners, they suggest that learning attitudes may have an effect on collaboration outcomes whether learning is a focal concern or not. The findings also contribute to debates on the possibilities for ""knowledge transfer"" in such settings and the nature and usefulness of the knowledge that obtains.",Attitude; Collaboration; Learning,Attitude; Collaboration; Collaborative advantage; Collaborative settings; Knowledge transfer; Learning; Learning attitudes; Partnership development; Knowledge management

Individual differences in core evaluations, chronic regulatory focus, and cognitive style and ability help explain how biases come about and why some people are more likely to exhibit some biases. Finally, we introduce a process model that links between the three bias categories and helps integrate findings from the expansive literature on biases.

The concept of hegemony in GPNs suggests the contingent stability and contestation within these networks, and highlights the importance of power relations rather than efficiency. GPNs are viewed as political arenas engaging a wide array of actors, and encompassing a more multi-dimensional and multi-level approach to power relations. The expansion of GPNs, along with the simplification and routinization of inter-organizational interfaces, can be interpreted as a form of international Taylorism.",Critical; Globalization; International production,Conceptual frameworks; Critical; Critical perspectives; Global commodity chains; Global production networks; Globalization; Inter-organizational; International management; Offshore oil well production

Russian banks receive many directional ties created by executives of industrial corporations on boards of banks. A similar network position is interpreted as an indicator of power of banks in the United States, but this interpretation is not applicable to Russia, where directional interlocks between large corporations reflect the relations of influence. I argue that Russian banks do not derive special information or control benefits from their network position and that this position reflects a subordinate role of banks in today's Russian economy. I explain this subordinate role by the fact that Russian banks are dependent on large industrial corporations (first of all, exporters of raw materials) as major sources of financial capital. An empirical test of hypotheses about the association between banks' reliance on different sources of financial capital and their network positions provides support for this context-specific application of the resource dependence argument.",Interorganizational influence; National corporate networks; Russian banks,Corporate networks; Developed economies; Empirical findings; Financial capital; Inter-organizational; Resource dependences; Russian banks; Russian economy

The model proposes that individuals high in political skill form social networks that provide access to information for opportunity identification and resources for opportunity exploitation through weak and strong ties, which create social capital. The role of social capital in obtaining entrepreneurial performance is contextual. The interaction of social capital and the operating environment determines entrepreneurs' social capital value. Implications and future research directions are presented.",Political skill; Social capital; Social networks,Causal relationships; Empirical investigation; Future research directions; Operating environment; Opportunity identifications; Political skills; Social capitals; Theoretical development; Social networking (online)
Relational intelligence for leading responsibly in a connected world,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087246218&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18783524&partnerID=40&md5=6e5518b1e110725b4ad560e3d7a195e3,"In this paper we argue that organizations and their leaders face profound challenges in a global and connected world. To navigate successfully in the 21st century, leaders have to deal with an ethics challenge, a diversity challenge, a business in society challenge and a stakeholder challenge. These challenges also shape their leadership roles and responsibilities, which have a relational dimension. The need to interact with different stakeholders from various cultural backgrounds both inside and outside the organization, with different interests and values, requires leaders to connect and to act interpersonally and ethically competent. We therefore suggest that leaders need relational intelligence to cope emotionally and ethically mature with the leadership challenges at hand. We define relational intelligence as a combination of emotional and ethical intelligence, that involves the ability to be aware of and understand own and others' emotions, values, interests and demands, to discriminate among them, to critically reflect on them and to use this information to guide one's action and behaviour with respect to people. Based on this definition we suggest and introduce a preliminary model of relational intelligence. Drawing on case examples we show how relational intelligence (informed by emotional and ethical abilities) can guide leadership behaviour in interactions helping leaders deal with complex ethical and cultural dilemmas and make balanced and responsible decisions. We postulate that relational intelligence can support global leaders to meet the leadership challenges by guiding them to interact adequately across borders and to build sustainable and trustful relationships to various stakeholders.",Business ethics; Relational intelligence; Responsible leadership,Business ethics; Cultural backgrounds; Preliminary model; Relational intelligence; Responsible leaderships; Philosophical aspects
Mentors' motivations at work as predictors of protégés' experiences in a formal mentoring program,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087222026&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778723&partnerID=40&md5=1ae5c63350c781e1737549876d7fcd7a,"We propose that individuals' motivations at work have implications for the extent of mentoring they provide to assigned protégés in a formal organizational program. We hypothesized that mentors' communion striving would be negatively related to protégés' developmental experiences in the relationship, and that this negative relationship would be moderated by mentors' job level. In addition, we posited that mentors' achievement and status strivings would be positively related to protégés' developmental experiences. The developmental experiences assessed by protégés were three mentoring functions and total interaction time. The posited relationships were generally supported by data from 61 formal mentor-protégé dyads. We discuss implications for theory and future research on mentoring effectiveness, as well as considerations for formal mentoring programs.",Dyads; Mentoring; Motivation,Dyads; Interaction time; Mentoring; Mentoring programs; Motivation

There is also a large lab and field-based literature on the topic of performance evaluation bias. In all these studies, however, there is the presumption that today's organizations are meritocratic and consequently that a significant positive relationship between performance, wage, and wage growth is institutionally valued and strongly supported. If performance evaluation works the way advocates of meritocracy claim, then including performance ratings in any empirical models should explain away the effect of any ascriptive characteristics on wage growth. In this article, I examine whether there is evidence of the meritocratic claim in a special setting with unique data where supervisors evaluate employees using dyadic performance evaluations and where the performance evaluations constitute the primary source of salary increases over time. Although there is no evidence that gender, race, or nationality accounts for any differences in starting annual salaries within a given occupation in a given work unit, I still find that certain organizational decisions over the tenure of employees end up in important wage inequality outcomes: Observationally equivalent women and men, for example, obtain different salary increases over time, even after they are given the same performance evaluation. These findings are robust after controlling for the process of turnover.",Discrimination; Performance evaluations; Wage and wage growth,Discrimination; Empirical model; Performance evaluations; Performance ratings; Primary sources; Wage inequalities; Wages

The purpose of this paper is to identify a more salient conceptual understanding of how timing childbirth influences perceived career success for working women. I also explore the situational factors that moderate the relationship between age at first birth and perceived career success including job class, family-friendly work policies and career transitions. I begin by reviewing the current literature and identify the inherent gaps. I then develop a model with testable propositions that can be used as a starting point for future research on timing childbirth and careers.

Three studies involving 643 engineers supported this hypothesis in two ways. First, participants rated OCBs as costly to an employee in the short-run, and beneficial to an organization in the long-run. Second, self-reported (Study 2) and supervisor-rated (Study 3) likelihood of engaging in OCBs was higher among those high in empathy (Davis, 1983) and those who adopted a long-term horizon within an organization. Most important, empathy showed a stronger relationship with OCBs when participants adopted a short-term horizon, and individuals high in concern with future consequences were less likely to engage in OCBs under a short-term horizon.

How do firms' actions influence corporate reputation?

Researchers have argued that audiences bestow such reputation when they perceive that firms have delivered on their commitments, are trustworthy and credible, exhibit high performance, and have acted in normatively or culturally valued ways, among other things. One important question asks how specific corporate actions dynamically affect such reputation. While reputation scholars stress that actions are central in how audiences develop the above perceptions and thus why they bestow reputation, relatively few studies have directly examined this relationship and understandings of this relationship are limited. Thus, we examine how large American corporations' rankings in the annual Fortune Magazine Most Admired Companies survey were affected by their use of the controversial practice of downsizing across the period from 1985 to 1994. We develop and test theoretically-grounded hypotheses about this empirical relationship, drawing on reputational and institutional research. Findings show that engaging in downsizing strongly affected firms' rankings in the Fortune survey. They also provide strong support for most of our hypotheses, revealing a number of important complexities and contingencies in the relationship between firm actions and changes in corporate reputations. We discuss our study's implications for research on reputation as well as for institutional theory.",Downsizing; Legitimacy; Reputation,Corporate reputations; Downsizing; Empirical relationships; Fortune Magazines; Institutional theory; Legitimacy; Reputation; Surveys

Our findings indicate that in some environments regulatory processes have a greater role to play, thereby establishing the importance of institutional and stakeholder theories of corporate governance, in such contexts. While we did not find a main effect for the competitive environment on the absolute corporate governance standards of firms, the competitive environment interacted with the regulatory environment to have a significant effect, demonstrating thereby the importance of agency and resource dependence theories.

Three forms of the 92-item Schein Descriptive Index were used to measure gender role stereotypes and characteristics of entrepreneurs in general. Data were collected from respondents at the pre-entrepreneurial stage in three countries, US, Turkey and India. The results revealed that, in general, entrepreneurs are perceived to have predominantly male characteristics. Further, although both men and women perceive entrepreneurs to have characteristics similar to those of males, only women also perceived entrepreneurs and females as having some similar characteristics. We also found that respondents who perceived themselves as more similar to males had higher entrepreneurial intentions than those who see themselves as less similar to males while no such difference was found for people who saw themselves as more or less similar to females. The results were consistent across the three national cultures in our sample.

Far less attention has been paid to efforts ""from below"" to effect second-order structural change. Under what conditions can relatively low power employees induce broader structural change in their organizations? One area of research that has examined the efforts of low power change agents to induce structural change is that of social movements. Research on social movements has identified three key components of social movements: mobilizing structures, political opportunities, and framing processes. However, most studies of social movements have focused on external change agents. Relatively little work has examined the efforts of internal change agents Therefore, to extend current theory on both organizational change and social movements, the present research examines the efforts of the Voice of the Faithful, a Catholic group formed in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal, to create a more democratic Church structure. Examination of the emergence of the Voice of the Faithful provides support for a model of second-order change from below. The model suggests conditions and ways in which similar change efforts may gain power within centralized, hierarchical organizations.",Second order; Social movements; Structural change,Current theories; Hierarchical organizations; Internal changes; Organizational change; Participative decision makings; Second orders; Social movements; Structural change; Decision making

It is based on a survey of 796 students from 26 countries, students that all have experience from foreign universities or business schools. The students were asked to describe and compare specific features related to teaching they had encountered at foreign business schools and the institution in their home country, and to state their preferences in relations to those features. The study analyses student responses by country of origin and argues that business school teaching reflects cultural values related to authority and participation. We show that there are significant correlations between student empowerment at business schools and a variety of sociopolitical and socio-cultural indicators. This suggests that postmodern welfare societies with strong civic cultures tend to breed egalitarian and participation- oriented business schools. Finally, the concept of globalization is touched upon: while faculty at the business schools seem to be unaffected by globalization, students with international experience have relatively similar values across nations and prefer the postmodern, egalitarian approach to teaching. In countries with more autocratic business schools, this difference may lead to tension between international students and professors.",International; Teaching; Value,Teaching; Business schools; Cultural value; International; International experiences; International students; National cultures; Student response; Value; Students

The results indicate significant differences in the overall willingness to uphold termination, with labor arbitrators being the most likely to rule in favor of the employee, followed by jurors, employment arbitrators judging statutory and for-cause claims, and employment arbitrators judging statutory-only claims.

We explain the near miss bias as a discounting of given probability information so that people fail to see the independence of events. Experiment 2 lends support to this proposition, as it shows that when probability information is made salient, and when decision makers attend to this probability information as the basis for their decision, the near miss bias goes away. Experiment 2 also shows that when people have near miss information they search significantly less for information, even when that information is costless.

Proponents of corporate governance reform (and agency theory) argue that executives have too much control over the firms that they manage and are in a position to abuse it, while the executives themselves (and many organization theorists) claim that managers can never be in complete control over their entire web of interdependencies. In this paper, I examine managerial control by studying how managers altered their patterns of communication with the investing public during the height of the Enron accounting scandal. I draw from research on the strategic use of attributions and develop competing hypotheses based on the mechanisms of agency theory, resource dependence theory, and social distance. I test these hypotheses by analyzing press releases of quarterly earnings statements from 2001 and 2002 for a sample of firms from the S&P 500 and find results more consistent with resource dependence theory as greater institutional ownership leads managers to take more credit for success but that less managerial ownership and fewer outside directors have no effect. Further analysis shows that having Arthur Andersen as one's auditor was the strongest predictor of attribution change. I conclude with a discussion on the importance of the ""court of public opinion"" as well as the importance of conducting mechanism-based research.",Agency theory; Managerial control; Resource dependence theory,Earnings; Public relations; Social aspects; Agency theory; Conducting mechanism; Corporate governance; Corporate scandals; Institutional ownerships; Organization theory; Patterns of communication; Resource dependences; Managers

With the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 climate change has attracted increasing business interest. It has also created much uncertainty for companies, particularly about the role of trading in realizing emission reductions. This paper investigates what drives multinational corporations to show interest in emissions trading and carbon offset projects to deal with climate change. On the basis of an analysis of data of 136 companies derived from a questionnaire, it also examines the role that country of origin, industry affiliation, and companies' environmental strategy play in this regard. Findings show that industry pressure and product and process innovations are the main determinants for MNCs to participate in the emission market. It appears that climate policy particularly induces energy-related industries to reduce emissions, which puts them ahead of other industries with regard to their interest in emissions trading. Firms that are more likely to engage in emissions trading also invest relatively more in emission-reducing technologies aimed at the production process or at products. This suggests that emissions trading does not crowd out innovation to reduce GHG emissions. An important implication for practitioners is that emissions trading should not be managed in isolation, because other initiatives to reduce emissions affect a company's position in the emissions market.",Climate change; Corporate strategy; Multinationals,Commerce; Digital storage; Emission control; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; International law; Investments; Corporate strategies; Environmental issues; Environmental strategy; Management challenges; Multi-national corporations; Multinationals; Process Innovation; Production process; Climate change

We develop a transition model that suggests the transition process consists of early, intermediate, and late stages. We assess the effectiveness of major corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) in and across these stages. Our general proposition is that as transition economies move through early, intermediate, and late stages, effective CGMs tend to be those that first rely on state administrative control power, followed by those that rely on social networks and private orders, and then those that rely on market forces and formal institutions. Our study makes contributions to, and holds implications for transition economies and the impacts of institutions and institutional changes on corporate governance.",Governance; Institutions; Transition Economies,Societies and institutions; Administrative controls; Corporate governance; Governance; Institutional change; Market forces; Transition economy; Transition model; Transition process; Industrial management

Drawing on institutional theory we explore whether, beyond firm-specific advantages, experiential learning, and information links emphasized in the existing literature, greater relative similarity in home and host institutional environments is associated with better MNE relative performance abroad. In regressions we run factoring in a variety of controls, home-host institutional similarity is significant and even stronger than firm capability and information links in explaining MNE relative local sales performance. Among proxies constituting institutional similarity, cognitive elements appear most important followed by regulative and then normative elements. Notably, cultural closeness is not a driver. We conjecture that institutional similarity aids MNE strategy implementation and is reflected in relative performance, and, that as host markets become more contested by MNEs from different home countries, international business is set to become more institutional business.",Competition; Institutional similarities; Multinationals,Competition; Developing countries; Experiential learning; Institutional business; Institutional influences; Institutional similarities; International business; Multinationals; Relative performance; Strategy implementations; Commerce

The inference of such studies implies that firms with more prior FDI experience will outperform firms with less prior experience. However, I find contrary evidence which suggests firms with dissimilar types of experience are more likely to fail. This study contributes insight to the overarching hypothesis that prior experience leads to subsequent performance improvement by further specifying the conditions which uphold this theoretical view. I conjecture that firm's heterogeneity of prior experience acquired in idiosyncratic institutional environments mediates firm success given the level of relatedness of the prior experience to the local market conditions. The evidence demonstrates that firms with similar prior institutional experiences are more likely to experience market success than firms with dissimilar institutional experiences. Second, I examine the financial performance of each firm to determine the mechanisms of prior experience that lead to subsequent performance and find that firms with similar prior experiences are more successful due to three differentiating mechanisms: 1) their ability to select better projects exante entry, 2) their ability to accurately predict cash flows and 3) their ability to mitigate the risk through market volatilities. Moreover, firms lacking these competencies due to a lack of market specific knowledge acquired from unrelated experiences have a higher likelihood of failure. Utilizing a hazard rate model, I examine the effects of prior institutional experience similarity on failure rates of foreign firms who have entered the Brazilian telecommunications industry from 1997-2004.",Experience; Foreign direct investment; Institutional environments,Commerce; Failure (mechanical); Failure analysis; Telecommunication industry; Experience; Financial performance; Foreign direct investments; Foreign investment; Institutional environments; Likelihood of failures; Specific knowledge; Telecommunications industry; Investments
Curing the firm's indigestion: Organizational restructuring and the dynamics of acquisition performance,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087584684&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778460&partnerID=40&md5=e2d7ad558fb9b5785605284745a5ada3,"In the present paper, we argue that the more intensive the firm's acquisition activity, the more frequently the firm should undertake large-scale organizational restructuring. Drawing on the insight that the integration of acquisitions is inevitably imperfect in the short term, thus giving rise to lingering integration problems that tie up management time and attention in highly acquisitive firms, we first hypothesize that acquisitions are an important driver of restructuring. Subsequently, we juxtapose two counteracting forces: one that pushes toward more frequent restructuring - the positive content effect of restructuring - and one that induces less frequent restructuring - the negative process effect. Unlike most extant research, which studies the performance effects of isolated acquisitions, we argue, building on a small yet growing research stream, that the position of an acquisition within the sequence of acquisitions undertaken since the firm's last restructuring greatly influences its performance contribution. Furthermore, we examine the role of time in this relationship and how the dynamics of this relationship evolve as the firm becomes more experienced with acquisition and restructuring. Using panel data on large, highly acquisitive corporations covering over thirty years, we find support for our predictions.",Acquisitions; Organizational restructuring; Performance,Acquisition performance; Integration problems; Organizational restructuring; Panel data; Performance; Performance effect; Process effects; Short term; Mergers and acquisitions

Drawing on theories of failure-induced change, threat rigidity, and issue framing, we derive competing hypotheses regarding the likelihood that a firm will respond to the emergence of a new technology. We then test these predictions by examining firms in the U.S. computer industry, which faced a punctuated environmental change when IBM introduced its open architecture Personal Computer in 1981. Consistent with notions of failure-induced change, we find that firms performing below aspiration levels are more likely to respond by adopting a new technology in their product lines. This is contrary to the predicted effects of threat-rigidity, which suggests that firms performing below aspirations are less responsive to environmental change. In comparison, firms performing further above their aspirations were more likely to adopt new technology, suggesting that environmental change is often framed as an opportunity when an organization's prior performance exceeds its expectations. We conclude by discussing the significance and implications of these findings.",Aspirations; Change; Threat rigidity,Computer architecture; Personal computers; Rigidity; Aspirations; Change; Computer industry; Empirical test; Environmental change; Firm Performance; Open architecture; Technological change; Environmental technology

One method for facilitating the connection between coursework and the workplace is to use real-world managers as mentors to Management students.

Mentors, who are middle to high ranking business managers, are recruited from Alumni and friends of the University. As part of the mentor program, students communicate with their virtual mentors via e-mail throughout the academic term to learn more about the applications of management concepts in the work place. An assessment of the programindicates that the program has been viewed very favorably by both students and mentors, resulting in positive perceptions of learning for students and stronger ties between the mentors and the University. While originally initiated three years ago as a pilot project for a Managerial Skills class, the virtual mentor approach has evolved into a broader program that has been implemented across several business courses. As the virtual mentor program has grown, administrative challenges have occurred. A model for developing a virtual mentoring program is proposed, and benefits and challenges of the program are discussed.",Experiential learning; Management education; Mentoring,Application programs; Curricula; Managers; Students; Business managers; Experiential learning; Management course; Management education; Managerial skills; Mentor programs; Mentoring; Mentoring programs; Education computing

To assess the difference in nurse staffing using measures that adjust for patient turnover and severity versus those that do not. Data Sources. Numbers of registered nurses (RNs), adjusted patient days of care (APDC), length of stay, and patient severity information from acute-care general hospitals in Pennsylvania 1994-2001, obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the American Hospital Association, and the Atlas MediQual system. Study Design. After examining the trends in patient turnover and severity and their relationship to RN staffing, we apply two patient turnover indices with and without patient acuity adjustments to RN staffing measures, and test the difference between the original and adjusted measures using paired sample t-tests. Data Extraction Methods. Data sets were match-merged by hospital ID, and patient turnover and severity indices were created, using 1994 as the base year. RN staffing measures were developed using unadjusted APDC and APDC adjusted for patient turnover and both patient turnover and severity. Principal Findings. Patient turnover increased significantly from 1994 to 2001. The difference between RN staffing measures adjusted for patient turnover and severity and those not adjusted was increasingly significant from 1999 on. Unadjusted RN staffing showed a 1 percent decline over the eight year period compared to decreases of from 10 to 26 percent after adjustments. Conclusions. These results indicate that the assessment of unadjusted RN staffing by RN to patient ratios alone significantly underestimates nursing needs and overstates RN staffing levels. Patient turnover, as well as acuity, should be taken into account in staffing assessment and decision-making.",Length of stay; Patient throughput; RN staffing,Decision making; Hospitals; Nursing; Data extraction; Department of healths; General hospitals; Length of stay; Paired-sample t-test; Severity index; Staffing level; Study design; Personnel selection

This relationship is moderated by the entrepreneur's social identity with the relevant ethnic community. Venture strategy is hypothesized to influence performance based on how well aligned the strategy is to the aspirations and capital possessed by the minority entrepreneur.

Dense local clustering provides bandwidth in the network by fostering communication and cooperation while nonredundant connections contract the distance between firms and give the network greater reach by tapping a wider range of knowledge resources. However, since firms are constrained in forming alliances, there appears to be a trade-off between creating bandwidth versus reach. We argue that small world connectivity helps resolve this tradeoff by enabling bandwidth and reach to be achieved simultaneously. We propose that firms embedded in alliance networks that exhibit the characteristic small world properties of high clustering and short average path lengths (i.e., high reach) will experience greater knowledge creation than firms in networks that are not small worlds. We find support for this proposition in a longitudinal study of the patent performance of 1106 firms in 11 industry-level alliance networks.",Innovation; Small world networks; Strategic alliances,Bandwidth; Economic and social effects; Small-world networks; Alliance networks; Average path length; Inter-firm collaboration; Knowledge creations; Knowledge resource; Local clustering; Longitudinal study; Strategic alliance; Patents and inventions

Previous literature on the impact of experiential learning on acquisition performance has led to mixed results. We suggest that these inconsistencies stem from two sources: inappropriate specification of performance, and neglect to account for acquisition management processes and value creation mechanisms. Most previous studies measure acquisition performance at an aggregate level, using stock market returns. In this study, we utilize patent data from technology sourcing acquisitions to measure performance tied to the focal acquisition. Using patent data, we also distinguish between two value creation mechanisms with differing levels of complexity. Our results indicate that experiential learning enables performance of the less complex value creation activities, while hindering performance of the more complex value creation activities. We find that performance measures that are closely related to focal acquisition performance provide different conclusions for the effect of experience than do studies conducted at more aggregate levels of performance.",Acquisitions; Dynamic capabilities; Experience,Aggregates; Mergers and acquisitions; Acquisition management; Acquisition performance; Conceptual frameworks; Dynamic capabilities; Experience; Experiential learning; Performance measure; Value creation mechanisms; Patents and inventions

We extend the literature on corporate elites by suggesting that interpersonal influence behavior, in the form of ingratiatory behavior directed at individuals who control access to board positions, provides an alternative pathway to the boardroom for managers who lack elite credentials. Specifically, our theory leads to the expectation that (i) top managers who engage in ingratiatory behavior toward their CEO, where ingratiation is comprised of flattery, opinion conformity, and rendering personal favors, will be more likely to receive board appointments at other firms where their CEO serves as director, and (ii) interpersonal influence behavior will substitute to some degree for the advantages of an elite background or demographic majority status, such that ingratiation toward the CEO will be particularly beneficial in garnering board appointments for managers who lack such credentials. An analysis of survey data on interpersonal influence behavior from a large sample of managers and CEOs at Forbes 500 companies supports our theoretical claims. Our findings can help explain why norms of director deference to CEOs may have persisted despite increased diversity in the corporate elite. They also reveal a subtle form of social discrimination, in that managers who are demographic minorities or who lack privileged backgrounds must engage in a higher level of ingratiatory behavior in order to have the same chance of obtaining a board appointment.",Board of directors; Corporate governance; Top managers,Access control; Population statistics; Board of directors; Board position; Control access; Corporate governance; Interpersonal influences; Survey data; Top managers; Managers

The specific focus of this study is on salespeople in B2B contexts. Direct and interactive effects of two inter-related mechanisms- trust and control- on salespersons' boundary linking function- building relationships with customers- are examined. In so doing, we attend to the dynamics of boundary spanners' role relationships with internal managers and external customers and examine how these dynamics ultimately 'trickle down' to influence sales outcomes in terms of sales performance, relationship quality and customer loyalty. To test this model, we use dyadic survey data from 210 salespeople in an industrial distribution company and their customers. Our results indicate that (1) trust and control mechanisms have significant direct and interactive effects in shaping salespersons' cognitions and behaviors,(2) while customer trust and process controls independently have positive simple effects, their interactive effect has a significant negative influence, implying that process controls may be substituted by customer trust, and (3) trust gaps resulting from differences between salespeople's self report and customers' perceptions of their trustworthy behaviors have a significant influence on customer loyalty.",Boundary spanner; Control; Trust,Control engineering; Human resource management; Managers; Sales; Boundary spanners; External customers; Industrial distribution; Interactive effect; Organizational boundaries; Relationship qualities; Trust; Trust and controls; Process control

Unfortunately, the true impact of the Golem effect-Pygmalion in reverse-has gone unproven and the potential negative effects are not wholly understood. Furthermore, the literature largely fails to address the extent to which Pygmalion-related effects may differ based on task complexity. This study examines the effect of an instructor's verbalized expectations-both negative and positive-on the performance of 351 business-school undergraduate students. Analyses using pre-and post-treatment data collected during field experiments indicated, most notably, that negative expectations of subordinates' performance on cognitively based tasks tend to degrade that performance. The effects on non-cognitively based tasks were, however, positive. Positive expectations had the opposite effect.

In recent years scholars have often referred to these social structures as ""policy networks."" While policy networks have been studied since the 1970s, only recently have the difficulties of managing these entities come under greater scrutiny. Studies of ""network management"" are designed to better understand the unique challenges of operating in a context where bureaucracy no longer provides the primary tool for ""social steering."" Yet most network management studies have failed to account for the ""other"" network that has emerged concurrently: the Internet. The Internet has changed the organizational, technological, social, and political context in which network management occurs and has expanded the toolkit managers utilize when seeking to shape (or ""govern"") social processes. This paper examines theoretically and empirically how network management may change in the Age of Internet. The first five sections of the paper develop a resource dependence framework to conceptualize policy networks and network management, examines the role of the Internet, explores how the four ""critical functions"" that Agranoff & McGuire identify in their review of network management are affected by the Internet, and introduces a series of hypotheses regarding the Internet's effect on these functions. The last three sections introduce the case data used to test these hypotheses, presents findings and conclusions, and suggests areas for future research.",Network management; Networks; Policy networks,Networks (circuits); Critical functions; Policy networks; Political context; Political process; Private organizations; Public agencies; Resource dependences; Social structure; Network management

Conceptually, these barriers concern what have been labeled as the interrelated topics of the costs of doing business abroad and the liability of foreignness. Efforts by political interest groups, consultants, analysts and academics to better understand country differences related to such costs produced a variety of measures that all purport to capture some element of this ""country risk."" Unfortunately, international business research while increasingly focused on country risk, still gives little attention to understanding the construct or its measures. Risk measures are labeled differently, implying they capture different aspects of country risk. Yet, prior findings of high correlation between measures undermine this presumption and suggest that aggregation of component risk information removes distinctions. Thus, the question is raised of whether differently labeled risk constructs and their measures provide clear, distinct sources of information about the external environment that capture unique aspects of country risk. Ultimately, this analysis finds strength in an underlying construct of country risk, while challenging efforts to distinguish between specific types of risk. Though the existence of a range of country risk measures implies an ability to distinguish between aspects of country risk, it is only an illusion.",Country risk; Factor analysis; Liability of foreignness,Factor analysis; Country differences; Country risks; External environments; International business; Liability of foreignness; Political interest; Risk information; Sources of informations; Risk assessment

Next we explain how a code-book can be created to ensure consistent application of coding criteria. The quantification of variables facilitates performance of statistical tests of variance, and also the identification of relationship between variables. Such an approach done over multiple organizations and over longitudinal periods facilitates theory development and falsification of key hypotheses. Finally, the paper offers a brief example of how one such adolescent theory -attention-based view of the firm - might be developed using archival records in the domain of healthcare in Canada.",Content analysis; Qualitative text; Theory development,Attention-based views; Codebooks; Content analysis; Multiple organizations; Qualitative text; Theory development

This paper investigates the phenomenon of spin-out formation and performance from the theoretical lens of social capital theory, executive migration, and dynamic capabilities. Applying these lenses, a theoretical model is presented positing 'immigrating executives' capabilities' as the antecedent for the 'accumulation of social capital' and 'financial capital', which lead to spin-out formation in the first stage. Next, this theoretical model suggests that the 'accumulated social capital' and 'accumulated financial capital' will show a positive effect on firm performance in the post-IPO stage. I expect to find support for the central thesis that the accumulated social capital and financial capital in the pre-IPO stage will have a positive effect on firm performance in the post-IPO stage. The interaction effects between (tacit) accumulated social capital and (explicit or tangible) financial capital is another point of interest as per these theories. Thus, this paper proposes testable building blocks for contributing to research in the areas of new venture creation and performance, application of knowledge based view, and application of social capital theory.",Dynamic capabilities view; New venture creation; Social capital theory,Enterprise resource management; Knowledge based systems; Dynamic capabilities; Financial capital; Interaction effect; Knowledge-based views; New venture creation; Point of interest; Social capitals; Theoretical modeling; Finance

We simulate the actions and consequences of hiring and firing personnel in two firms in this industry to seek to find out what produces virtual coopetition. By examining poaching strategies in this industry we argue that virtual coopetition results when the initiating party is unsure about the long-term value of a predatory move for itself, and therefore refuses to carry out such move. Hence, we show that the consequences of poaching strategy, when considered with the risk of being a target, are quite disastrous. The principal reason is that the long term consequences are such that it is difficult to recover from the damage inflicted. The ecological (and to some extent evolutionary) consequences of poaching explain why this phenomenon is rarely seen in the management consulting industry: it is simply mutual value destruction. In conclusion we show that the avoidance of mutual value destruction is a virtual form of coopetition.",Coopetition; Management consultin industry; Value,Co-opetition; Management consulting; Term value; Value; Game theory

To date, very little attention has been paid to how employees', as the targets of HRM, may actually perceive and react to what are essentially people-centred management practices. In this study work unit members' shared perceptions of their organisation's HRM system, or HRM climate, and the effects of these perceptions on members' aggregated outcomes was investigated. Results from a sample of 66 work units showed that a more favourable HRM climate was associated with higher levels of perceived organisational support, in-role performance and citizenship behaviour, and lower levels of intentions to quit and workplace deviance. Moreover, the effects of climate level were moderated by climate strength, such that the influence of work units' climate on the criterion variables was most favourable under strong climate conditions. Additional analyses revealed that trust in management and leader informing behaviour were significant predictors of climate level, whilst leader informing behaviour was a significant predictor of climate strength.

Prospective case study design for deductive theory testing,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087998892&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18783418&partnerID=40&md5=57ba9204c9c0c0a5f25f574fad937904,"The paper advances a prospective case study research design in social sciences as an alternative to traditional post-hoc case study research in deductive theory testing. It is argued that some limitations of post-hoc qualitative methods in deductive theory testing can be alleviated by using a prospective case study design, where the researcher formulates a set of theory-based hypotheses in respect to the evolution of an on-going social process and then tests these hypotheses at a pre-determined follow-up time in the future by comparing these hypotheses with the observed process outcomes using ""pattern matching"" or similar technique. Some of the challenges of conducting prospective research in social sciences are discussed. An illustration of the application of this method in deductive testing of two competing theories is provided.",Deductive theory testing; Electronic health record; Prospective case study method,Pattern matching; Case study methods; Case study research; Electronic health record; Follow up; Qualitative method; Social process; Study design; Theory testing; Behavioral research
Silence speaks volumes: The effectiveness of reticence in comparison to apology and denial for repairing integrity- and competence-based trust violations,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087224505&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778530&partnerID=40&md5=1b6f5cf232845236c7545af21d6b72fc,"Prior research on trust repair has focused primarily on the effects of apology and denial. We recognize another form of verbal response: reticence. Although reticence is sometimes used for strategic reasons (e.g., to unjustifiably evade culpability), reticence is also used in many situations because it is more appropriate than apology and denial. By considering information diagnosticity and belief formation mechanisms through which verbal responses are evaluated, we hypothesized that the effectiveness of reticence vis-à-vis apology and denial depends on the nature of the original trust violation. The hypotheses were tested in a laboratory study of a simulated employment interview. Results indicate that, as a response to an integrity-based violation, reticence produces trust levels that are similar to those of apology but inferior to denial. As a response to a competence-based violation, reticence produces trust levels that are similar to those of denial but inferior to apology. Our results have important implications for those who might use reticence to respond to a perceived trust violation, and also for those who must judge another's reticence.",Interpersonal trust; Social perception; Trust repair,Formation mechanism; Information diagnosticity; Interpersonal trust; Laboratory studies; Perceived trusts; Social perception; Trust repairs; Verbal response; Repair
The role of values and emotions in newcomers' socialization into organizational corruption,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088185664&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18783528&partnerID=40&md5=a862f2864f2f27429226195de86feb00,"We offer a theoretical framework predicting the susceptibility of newcomers' to corrupt choices and their subsequent involvement in ongoing organizational corruption. Previous research on corruption has identified contributing organizational factors such as institutionalization, rationalization, and socialization as well as personal factors such as locus of control and level of moral development. We take a personsituation interaction approach in which we examine the roles of newcomers' values and emotions in their acceptance or refusal in joining ongoing corruption when organizational socialization lures them into accepting unethical choices. Our framework also suggests that regulation of emotions might be one of the important factors guiding newcomers to make morally valued choices even when the situations force them otherwise.",Corruption; Emotions; Values,Corruption; Emotions; Locus of control; Moral development; Organizational factors; Theoretical framework; Values; Crime

The present study proposes to answer the question of whether citizenship behavior may be harmful to individual career outcomes. This question is investigated among academic faculty in terms of research productivity (i.e., publications), promotions and career advancement speed. A measure of citizenship behavior in academe was developed for this study.

A multi-dimensional framework was used to classify coping strategies and predict responses to incidents of sexual harassment. Research questions were explored using a twophase approach: a qualitative study based on interviews with 19 sexual harassment victims and a quantitative analysis based on a survey questionnaire administered to 657 women. The quantitative study reaffirmed the qualitative study which suggested that Mexican American women's choice of coping strategies would be less confrontational and less assertive than those used by Anglo women. Cultural variables such as collectivism, power distance and machismo significantly influenced choice of coping strategy. Seeking Social Support was the most utilized strategy by both groups of women yet none of the cultural or structural variables included in the analysis were related to this coping strategy. One particularly striking finding was that organizational responsiveness increased the likelihood that Anglo women, but not Mexican American women, would utilize a Direct Behavior (Confront) coping strategy. This finding has important implications for organizations since substantial resources are devoted to developing systems that will solicit complaints of harassment. If Mexican American women are unaffected by these types of efforts and won't seek organizational assistance even when the organizational climate is extremely conducive to doing so then we, as organizational representatives, have to develop different mechanisms targeting Latina victims.",Coping strategy; Mexican American women; Sexual harassment,Coping strategies; Cultural variables; Different mechanisms; Mexican American women; Organizational climate; Quantitative study; Research questions; Sexual harassment; Surveys

In recent years, however, large organizations have increasingly introduced more formalistic procedures for how management consultants are to be purchased, curtailing the discretion of the individual manager. Based on the study of six multinational organizations and their procedures for purchasing management consultants, this paper identifies 3 purchasing strategies for management consultants: 1) An ad-hoc strategy representing a decentralized purchasing of consultants, in which each manager has full freedom to choose his favorite consultant 2) an organized decentralization strategy in which preferred suppliers are identified as the basis for managers' choice and 3) an expert strategy representing a highly centralized purchasing of management consultants with organizational experts responsible for the identification and contracting of management consultants. The three different strategies and their implementation as well as their potential consequences are discussed in the paper.",Client; Management consulting; Purchasing,Managers; Purchasing; Centralized purchasing; Client; Large organizations; Management consultants; Management consulting; Multinational organizations; Purchasing managements; Strategies for managements; Sales

This paper analyzes the role of such intermediaries i.e. staffing agencies in high-skill contractors' careers. As opposed to commonly held conceptions of mediated employment as atomistic, arms -length transactions, I present a picture of this type of work as a relatively organized and socially structured system. I argue that staffing firms may end up reproducing some of the artifacts that we generally associate with organizational career systems, even in a context that is in principle very different from an internal labor market. I draw on learning theories of the employment relationship in order to explain the emergence of bureaucratic structures in this context, and complement these with an emphasis on the relational and social aspects in which mediated work takes place. I analyse client records and individual job histories from a sample of 329 creative IT contractors - web designers, programmers, etc - placed in 2,092 projects by a staffing agency over a 4-year period. I complement these data with insights from 43 semi-structured interviews. Using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, I demonstrate the value of long-term employment for both the staffing agency and its contractors, and explore a number of mechanisms through which tenure premiums arise. I discuss the implications of this study for our theories of careers within and across organizations.",Intermediaries; Internal labor markets; Learning processes,Commerce; Contractors; Personnel selection; Social aspects; Employment relationship; Intermediaries; Labor markets; Learning process; Learning Theory; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Semi structured interviews; Structured systems; Employment

In this article we first propose a typology of multilevel theories of homology which considers different stages of theory development and different levels of similarity in relationships across levels. Building on cross-validation principles, we then delineate and demonstrate a comprehensive and flexible statistical procedure for testing different multilevel theories of homology. Finally, we discuss implications for theory, research and practice, as well as potential caveats of the new statistical tests.",Homology; Multilevel analysis; Validation,Conceptual frameworks; Cross validation; Homology; Levels of analysis; Multi-level analysis; Theoretical framework; Theory development; Validation; Statistical methods

Accordingly, a firm-level decision to divest of resource capacity is a strategically significant organizational change event-and one that entails risk-but empirical research has not considered why firms undertake such risky change to the resource portfolio. We draw on the Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTF) to examine this question. The analysis presented here employs insights from the BTF and tests theoretical propositions of the RBV in examining the effect of prior firm performance and strategic factor market characteristics on the firm's divestment of productive asset capacity during periods of strategic reconfiguration. In particular, we find that prior firm performance and the ability to appropriate rents are related to the amount and type of resource divestment the firm undertakes. Empirical research on resource divestment has been sparse, largely owing to the difficulty in tracking and measuring resources across firms and over time. This paper overcomes this research design challenge by using a population-level dataset of professional baseball franchises to study the divestment of strategic player resources. Findings from this study show the value of studying determinants to resource decisions and argue for reintroduction of the BTF into the RBV.",Behavioral theory; Rent appropriation; Resource based view,Behavioral theory; Behavioral theory of the firms; Competitive advantage; Organizational change; Rent appropriations; Resource portfolio; Resource-based view; Resource-based view of the firm; Competition

However, management must provide the proper support to help employees overcome the interpretive barriers encountered when crossing departmental boundaries. This study couples the theory of thought worlds with the theory of hermeneutic inquiry to determine whether knowledge management technology can help. More specifically, this study proposes that the use of technology features that support crossdepartmental understanding is positively related to the perceived value of cross-departmental knowledge on innovation, a key indicator of future innovation. The study employed a two-wave survey of 874 scientists and engineers. Findings indicated support for the hypothesis, even after controlling for other supportive mechanisms, including: people-to-people interaction, perceived openness of communication, perceived task complexity, and perceived ease of use of technology. More specifically, the findings suggest that cross-departmental knowledge is more highly valued for innovation when technology features help individuals find diverse opinions, see how knowledge about a situation has evolved over time, link general overviews of knowledge about a situation to additional related details, and actively add to the knowledge as it evolves.",Innovation; Knowledge management; Knowledge managment technologies,Competition; Knowledge management; Competitive advantage; Future innovations; Knowledge management technology; Managment; Perceived ease of use; Perceived value; Scientists and engineers; Task complexity; Human resource management

Prior research suggests that a critic's ability to establish himself as an expert of the market is based on the appeal to a rationalized and defensible system of standards for evaluating products. In this paper, I argue that this creates a fundamental bias in the allocation of critical attention. Because of their need to establish and justify their status as non-partisan experts, critics will demonstrate a tendency to favor arenas in which they have developed clear and structured schemas for evaluation. As a result, producers within such categories will receive disproportionately greater critical attention. I test and find support for this hypothesis within the context of the U.S. feature film industry. The implications of this bias in terms of producer legitimacy are discussed.",Legitimacy; Market mediation; Schemas,Motion pictures; Feature films; Film industry; Legitimacy; Schemas; Commerce

We suggest that insider board participation is determined not only by the conflict among elites, but also by their ability to establish tacit agreement. The idea of settlement is important because it provides a window to understanding the processes of restrained partisanship and stability at the top of U.S. corporations. We contribute to the theoretical body of work on coalitions, boards and settlements by considering the role of three distinct coalitions - CEOs, insiders and outsiders - and the effects of critical events, formal roles and informal power across on the creation and maintenance of board structural arrangements. We study an unexplored structural form and build on the nascent body of empirical work on settlements by offering a quantitative analysis boards characterized by a single inside director - the CEO. We find that CEO succession, formal authority derived from insider board roles and informal power of both outsiders and insiders impact the settlements and the adoption of a CEO-only insider structure.",Boards; Power; Settlements,Boards; Critical events; Power; Settlements; Structural arrangement; Structural form; Tacit agreement; Testing hypothesis

However, one important type of change-technological innovation-has appeared to be immune, at least implicitly, from such risks, and little attention has been given to the possibility that frequent innovation can be as hazardous as other kinds of organizational change. This paper argues that there may be tradeoffs to high rates of technological change. The costs are of two kinds: overestimating the advantages and receptiveness of the innovation, and the organizational disruptions associated with frequent innovation. Using data on the population of worldwide floppy disk drive manufacturers, we analyze (1) the effect of the frequency of innovation on organizational mortality; (2) the extent to which the relationship between innovation and survival may interact with important organizational characteristics such as size, age and entry status; and (3) whether innovators that are large, old, or de alio generate strong competition. We find that the average firm is likely to fail the more frequently it innovates, but also that large and, to a lesser extent, de alio innovators are less likely to fail. We also find that large innovators generate more powerful competition. Advice to managers to engage in continuous innovation can therefore be misguided because unless firms are large, they may incur costs that are so great that the firm actually ""fails"" by innovating frequently.",Innovation; Organizational ecology; Technology,Floppy disk storage; Continuous innovation; Disk drive manufacturers; High technology; Organizational change; Organizational characteristics; Organizational ecology; Technological change; Technological innovation; Population statistics

As measures of human capital, researchers have used education, gender, age (as a proxy for work experience), and previous experience or family history of self-employment (as a proxy for knowledge about managing small businesses). These variables largely measure entrepreneurial ability and are typically used in the absence of more detailed information that is unavailable. Recent work on the utility-maximizing theory of self-employment has shown that the probability of self-employment also depends on entrepreneurial attitudes, such as those toward incomes, autonomy, risk, work effort, and perquisites. Since attitudes impact the way people apply their abilities we believe that the human capital concept applicable to entrepreneurs should be expanded to include both abilities and attitudes. We define 'entrepreneurial capital' to include specific abilities and attitudes, and extend the utility-maximizing model of self-employment to include neglected human capital aspects of the decision to become self-employed. These include the growth of entrepreneurial capital during the selfemployment process, leveraging the human capital of employees, and retaining valuable employees by sharing income, autonomy, risk and perquisites with them such that their utility (job satisfaction) is maximized.",Entrepreneurship; Human capital; Self-employment,Job satisfaction; Entrepreneurial attitude; Entrepreneurship; Human capitals; Probability of success; Self employment; Small business; Social capitals; Work experience; Employment

Results of another experiment suggest that email senders who use all capital letters are perceived as less likeable and are less likely to receive compliance for a simple request. However, the receiver's personality characteristics moderated these relationships, suggesting that emotional perception in email varies between individuals. The studies expand our understanding of how and when emotions are conveyed and perceived in email messages, and suggest that managers should be aware that emails can be perceived to carry emotional content. Furthermore, they suggest that the use of nonverbal cues in email communication that convey emotional content affect both how an email sender is perceived and the recipient's behavior in response to the email.",Email; Emotion; Nonverbal,Electronic mail; Email communication; Email messages; Emotion; Focus group studies; Focus groups; Nonverbal; Nonverbal cues; Personality characteristic; Behavioral research

While previous literature on time in organizational studies mainly focused on intra organizational temporal coordination and interorganizational temporal competition, we argue that inter organizational temporal coordination is also a crucial issue especially when organizations are highly interdependent within a field. To study this under investigated dimension, we develop the concept of temporal institution defined as a socially constructed and stable form of temporal coordination that is shared by actors. We argue that the existence of a temporal institution allows members of a field to synchronize their actions, improve foreseeing and legitimate their behaviors or the actors. We illustrate the importance of temporal institutions in fields through a case study of the micro computers field where such a temporal institution known as Moore's Law has been a guideline for the different organizations during decades. This case study enables also to provide an empirical illustration of the three fundamental functions we identified theoretically. The implications of this concept and the avenues of research that it opens are discussed.",Organizational field; Temporal institution; Time,In-field; Inter-organizational; Moore's Law; Organizational field; Organizational studies; Stable form; Temporal coordination; Time

Is it because growth allows them to become profitable, or is it rather that their profitability allows them to grow based on retained earnings? While arguments in support of both scenarios can be derived from established theories the extant empirical literature has not been able to settle the issue despite its arguably central interest to entrepreneurship theorists and practitioners. Using a large, longitudinal data set this research tests the hypothesis that SMEs that show high profitability but low growth, and those showing high growth but low profitability, are equally likely to achieve high growth and high profitability in the subsequent period. Our results turn out a rather dramatic rejection of that hypothesis. In several year-by-year analyses firms originating in the high profitability/low growth category are about three times as likely to reach simultaneous high growth and profitability, as are firms originating in the high growth/low profitability group. The latter group is instead markedly over represented among firms that regress to low growth and low profitability. Over a four-year interval the difference is smaller but still very substantial. Over all, the results presented in the paper are strong reason for entrepreneurs and policy makers as well as entrepreneurship researchers and educators not to embrace a universal and uncritical growth ideology.

To test this framework, we build a unique dataset of over 650 secondary stakeholder actions within the United States all concerning environmental issues over the period 1971 to 2003.",Environmental management; Self-regulation; Stakeholders,Environmental management; Statistical tests; Environmental issues; Self regulation; Stakeholder groups; Stakeholders; Environmental regulations

We go beyond prior research on firm experience and country risk that have generally focused on a single element of risk or a single dimension of experience. Using Miller's (1992) environmental risk concept, we analyze the interactions between different types of firm-level experience and a full set of country-level risks on foreign direct investment value creation. Our findings suggest that foreign experience mitigates the stock market's perception of foreign investment risk in a variety of settings, although conditions under which these effects are present is subtle and nuanced.",Country risk; Firm experience; Foreign direct investment,Risk perception; Country risks; Environmental risks; Firm experience; Foreign direct investments; Foreign investment; Multi-national corporations; Single element; Investments
An empirical investigation of the B2B e-service chain,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085780497&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18782096&partnerID=40&md5=d4ddaf25f0bc818abc43fd629494a188,"This research is focused on B2B e-services, which we define as a company's portfolio of service offerings available to its business customers through the Internet channel. This channel acts to virtually connect B2B trading partners with each other. We coin the term B2B e-service capability, which we operationally define as a multidimensional construct that captures a generic set of abilities required for a company to deliver B2B services effectively. This research develops and tests a model for describing the antecedents of e-service capability, and in turn, its influence on performance. The conceptual idea behind our model is that the more service-oriented the firm, the better it will be able to translate this orientation to its B2B channel. The model is empirically tested using data gathered through a web-based survey from 181 companies that have deployed B2B e-services. Our results show that e-service capability is a second-order factor that is reflected by the company's capabilities of e-service recovery, ease of navigation, service portfolio comprehensiveness, e-customization, and information richness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to define e-service capability in the context of B2B. Service-orientation is antecedent of e-service capability, and is reflected by a set of variables that captures the company's operating environment, including deliberate managerial attention and strategies for service climate (comprised of leadership, service culture and value orientation), market focus (market acuity, relationship management and new service development), processes (ICT implementation and service processes), HR policy (human capital and reward systems) and metrics and standards (measurement systems and standard services).",B2B; E-services; Empirical,E- services; E-service recoveries; Empirical; Empirical investigation; Information richness; New service development; Operating environment; Relationship management; Commerce

Most new firms die young due to a lack of resources, legitimacy, and coordination. Although growth is rare among young firms, it is a desirable objective for most newly-founded organizations since large size has political and pragmatic advantages. Two main problems constrain the survival (and by extension, the chances to grow) of young firms: their lack of resources and the potential loss of coordination that occurs when their founders leave. In this paper, I explore how young firms overcome the first constraint and grow. I address the problem of new ventures' scarce resources by adopting a socioeconomic approach. I propose that new firms with few financial resources and few avenues to obtain them grow by acquiring intangible social resources such as legitimacy, status, and reputation. These social resources are acquired by mimicking the structures and activities of established firms, and by affiliating with high-status customers respectively. Analysis of panel data on the structures, activities, customers, and suppliers of a cohort of advertising agencies founded in New York and Chicago between 1977 and 1985 supported most of the hypotheses in this paper, indicating that social resources do indeed improve new ventures' chances of growth. Additionally, I conducted ancillary analyses that demonstrate that new venture survival and growth do not have identical antecedents, and that determinants of growth are different from the determinants of survival. Implications for entrepreneurs and founder-managers are discussed in the end.",Intangible resources; Legitimacy and status; New venture growth,Advertising agency; Entrepreneurial success; Established firms; Financial resources; Intangible resources; Legitimacy and status; New ventures; Survival and growth

First, the research reformulated the theory using Kozloswski and Klein's emergence model. Second, the research used Burt's structural hole theory, Granovettor's strength of weak ties theory, Krackhardt's strength of strong ties theory, Lin's social resources theory, and Coleman's network closure theory to examine how individual and collective social capital influences the development of transactive memories. The model was tested via multilevel structural equation modeling techniques. Results showed that individual social capital had a significant impact on the development of individual expertise directories. Collective social capital and task interdependence did not impact the development of transactive memory systems at the group level, but task interdependence had significant direct impact on collective access to information. It was also found that both network density and task interdependence moderated the relationship between the development of individual expertise directories and individual access to information. It means that in (a) dense networks, or (b) high task interdependence groups, the relationship between the development of individual expertise directories and individual access to information was weaker than in (a) sparse networks or (b) low task dependence groups.

In the quantitative study, 844 respondents, or nearly one in five health care chief executives in the U.S., participated in a 72-item survey including a short version of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ). In the qualitative study, 160 informants were interviewed as experts or key informants associated with organizational case studies. Survey results highlight the importance of transformational leadership characteristics in contributing to executives' perceptions of leadership impact. In addition, respondents' reported plans to leave their current organizations in the near future underscored the need for health care institutions to appropriately plan for executive succession, as well as development of new leaders. Qualitative findings added insight to findings about leadership styles. In addition, informants predicted future needs for health care leadership competencies in the areas of ethics and values, cultural competency, and fluency with information technologies and systems. While findings about whether and how health care leadership is different from other industries were inconsistent, results reflect both the importance of leadership and of focusing on the development of new leaders-especially persons of color and women-to ensure that the health care chief executive population of the future is able to meet the challenges inherent in the industry.",Leadership; Learning; Organizational development,Health care; Cultural competency; Information technologies and systems; Leadership; Leadership development; Learning; Organizational development; Quantitative study; Transformational leadership; Surveys

We argue that social capital provides access to external knowledge, which the firm-specific absorptive capacity acquires and combines with existing knowledge to create new knowledge.

We study these perspectives in the context of alliance formation, distinguishing exploration alliances from exploitation alliances along three dimensions: (a) based on the function that the alliance serves, (b) the structural network location of the partner, and (c) the partner's attributes. Our study of 20,779 alliances in the software industry reveals that firm age and partnering experience induce exploration.

Based on initial interviews and the help-seeking and disabilities literatures, workgroup supportiveness is thought to be a dominant factor. The literature also suggests that the strength of this relationship will vary depending on attributes of the requester's disability and the presence of others with disabilities. Help-seeking theory and the disabilities literature, however, are at odds regarding the precise nature of this influence. On one hand, the disabilities literature suggests that the influence of workgroup supportiveness will be weaker when a requester is more severely disabled, or when disability onset is earlier, because these factors impact the extent to which a requester draws influence from others with disabilities and when this influence is stronger, then impact of workgroup supportiveness is dampened. In contrast, help-seeking theory suggests the opposite or that workgroup supportiveness will play a greater role when a requester is more severely disabled or when the requester became disabled at an earlier age because these conditions are associated with less power and status and thus greater reluctance to ask for assistance. Survey data from 555 people who have hearing impairments is used to test these hypotheses. Findings are consistent with help-seeking theory that asserts the importance of fear of losing power and status in determining the extent to which people withhold requests for assistance.",Accommodation; Disabilities; Help-seeking,Accommodation; Disabilities; Dominant factor; Hearing impairments; Help seeking; People with disabilities; Survey data; Workgroups; Audition

We analyse reorganization processes in terms of four types of problems that emerge during the transition: coordination games, bargaining games, prisoner's dilemma games, and pure competition games. We argue that the four types of problems or games differ with regard to their severity and the difficulty or ease with which they can be resolved. Coordination problems are the least severe, because they are not triggered by diverging interests and can be solved by provision of information to the exchange partners. Pure competition games are the most severe, because they represent a zero-sum situation with opposing interests. We hypothesize that successful management of transition processes implies that the relative frequency of the more severe problems will decrease over time. We apply cognitive mapping techniques to analyse interview material gathered from 18 directors and staff members of a Dutch bank. The transcribed and coded interviews were used as a basis to identify the problems and game structures that occurred during a three year transition period in which the bank underwent a process of centralization. A total of 174 problems were identified. Correlational analysis shows that the probability for the occurrence of severe games declines over time. The data also show that as the reorganization is proceeding, manager's tend to use 'positive' causal more frequently than in the beginning of the reorganization process. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for the study of organizational change processes.",Cognitive mapping; Organizational change; Social dilemmas,Cognitive systems; Game theory; Cognitive mapping; Cognitive mapping techniques; Correlational analysis; Organizational change; Organizational restructuring; Prisoner's dilemma game; Social dilemmas; Successful management; Mapping

This relationship remained significant even after controlling for other known correlates of deviance (relevant personality traits and job satisfaction).",Counterproductive behaviors; Deviance; Self-monitoring,Counterproductive behaviors; Counterproductive work behaviors; Deviance; Personality traits; Self-monitoring; Job satisfaction

The 'academic pipeline' argument posits that the under-representation of minority faculty results from low supply of minority doctoral students. The racial discrimination argument, on the other hand, argues that the historical underpinnings of racism persist and stymie minority doctoral students even if supply of minorities was high. We advance a third view - institutional argument - as a third cause of minority faculty under-representation. Using Oliver's (1991) institutional framework, this study finds that contextual, constituent, control, and content factors affect minority faculty representation in academia.",Faculty diversity; Institutional determinants; Minority faculty representation,Faculty diversity; Institutional determinants; Institutional framework; Minority faculty representation; Racial discriminations

Our results suggest that: (a) the influence of delivered inducements is generally much larger than that of expected inducements, (b) the role of expected inducements varies by the nature of the inducement and the criterion being predicted, and (c) met expectations have more positive relations with organizational outcomes at higher absolute levels of fulfillment.

Qualitative data collected from 193 employees of a large multinational corporation, who ranged widely in both level and function, suggested that risky voice opportunities involve substantive matters of improvement or injustice, heightened awareness of authority figures, and moderate to intense emotion. Emphasizing the negative personal and professional consequences that might result from the reactions of those with authority to their ideas, people in this study predominantly chose not to speak up with substantive comments that they believed could help the organization or themselves. Their self-protective silence led, ironically, to personal costs in the form of frustration and emotional pain.

This paper explores ways in which nurses and physicians sought to ""repair"" an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system and improve its fit with their everyday practice. The paper is based on a case study of the introduction of an EMR in an academic hospital in Israel. The research was guided by Orlikowski's work on the social construction of technology. We show that repair work by clinical practitioners flowed from pragmatic efforts to incorporate HIT into their practices, rather than from arbitrary resistance to HIT. By negotiating changes in the EMR, the practitioners succeeded in overcoming gaps between the designers' assumptions and realities of clinical work. In this way the EMR became localized. This study supports Orlikowski's argument that the features of a technology are not built in but emerge though negotiations among its stakeholders. Moreover, the study supports previous research findings showing that localization is inherent to implementation of new technologies. Moreover, we argue that localization of HIT implementation may actually contribute to its capacity to improve clinical work. Recognition of gaps between assumptions built into HIT software and the realities of clinical practice may help managers and designers learn to work more effectively with practitioners to develop HIT systems that are flexible and well aligned with the needs and concerns of users.",Health information technology; Hospitals; Innovation,Hospitals; Medical computing; Repair; Academic hospitals; Clinical practices; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical record system; Health information technologies; Health information technologies (HIT); Social construction of technology; Unintended consequences; Health
Electronic Government as a guided evolution in Singapore: Vision for the world in the 21st century,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399407&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18783344&partnerID=40&md5=771bf4aa9740eff5bbebb0697795d6d7,"Most of the e-Government initiatives around the world have often been sporadic and unsystematic. ""Technological thrust"" rather than a ""citizen orientation"" has been the driving force for most of these initiatives. Singapore is one of the few nations where the e-Government was recognized as a strategy for growth very early. Continuous planning and monitoring of the nation's e-Government initiative has yielded rich dividends and today, Singapore is one of the most advanced countries in the world in terms of e-Government. Tracing the e-Government evolution in Singapore, through its three phases, reveals the inadequacy of the 'sequential evolutionary models' in explaining the e-Government evolutionary process. The e-Government initiatives in Singapore were taken as an opportunity to reengineer the government processes, procedures and systems so as to provide enhanced value to the citizens. Singapore's effective resource management strategy is the key to its e-Government success. Unlike many other nations, Singapore did not focus only on exploiting its scarce 'tangible' resources but went about in an organized way to develop complementary 'tangible and intangible' resources. This strategy, guided by the vision of developing Singapore into a world class Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) exploiter, helped Singapore develop a successful e-Government. This case study provides insights to the other nations for planning their e-Government efforts through the lessons learned from the Singapore experience. An extensible and flexible infrastructure, leadership vision and support, stress on handling change management and bridging the digital divide, an effort towards developing trust in e-Government and having a sound legal framework have enabled Singapore to have one of the most advanced e-Government systems in the world. To overcome the problem of allocating limited ICT and financial resources, the study proposes a value-grid for prioritizing the e-Government activities for a greater impact. The Singapore e-Government case study helps researchers and practitioners better understand the evolution of a successful e-Government system. Such an understanding serves as a vision for the countries around the world to formulate better strategies and policies for facilitating their evolution towards to an integrated e-Government in the 21st century.",E-Government; Internet; Singapore,Internet; Telecommunication services; Continuous planning; E-government systems; Electronic government; Evolutionary process; Government activities; Government initiatives; Resource management; Singapore; e-government

We suggest that they consider primarily two dimensions of resistance - the form and the content - and that, on that basis of these dimensions, place resistors and their message into some sort of narrative or story that serves as a basis for action. Using these dimensions and levels, we propose four types of workplace resistance: Resistance through Spectacle (Unambiguous Form-Literal Content), Chaos (Ambiguous Form-Literal Content), Sly civility (Ambiguous Form - Nuanced Content), and Tempered radicalism (Unambiguous Form and Nuanced Content) (See Figure 1). For each of these types, we discuss potential gains and risks of the approach, likely initial emotional reactions and responses by organizational elites, and possible long term responses. We also characterize each in terms of a change metaphor and illustrate it using an example or case scenario.",Aesthetics; Power; Resistance,Electric resistance; Aesthetics; Emotional reactions; Power; Two-dimension; Resistors

The key question is whether governance skills, including relational supply management capabilities and the use of formal contracts, can substitute for technical skills when firms out-source goods and services. The answer to this question has gained importance as firms increasingly turn to out-sourcing relationships in order to reduce costs, increase quality, and improve their innovativeness. We find that governance expertise leads to superior buyer-supplier cooperation, while a buyer's own technical expertise strongly influences supplier quality and pricing.",Capabilities; Governance; Outsourcing,Outsourcing; Capabilities; Formal contracts; Governance; Innovativeness; Supplier performance; Supply management; Technical expertise; Technical skills; Sales

As conceptualized in this model, teaching presence has three components: (1) Course design and organization; (2) Facilitating discourse; and (3) Direct instruction. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to test this teaching presence framework in the context of management education. Using items to measure these characteristics developed by Shea and colleagues (2003), we gathered data from a sample of 191 MBA students and tested the posited model through a structural equation model. The results revealed that after dropping some of the measurement items we were able to produce a stable model with good fit between the data and the model. This is one of the first studies to establish construct validity for the components of teaching presence, suggesting that it is a valid framework for studying online management education. It also points to the potential of the larger Community of Inquiry model for further research and application in online management education.

We focus on how firms increase their exploration after obtaining greater capabilities and experience via sequential international expansion. Using Japanese manufacturing firms' investment into the US, we find that more experience and experience in locations thick with indigenous R&D activity leads firms to pursue greater exploration by adding their own R&D activity. Interestingly, the influence of location is differential; while firms that are more technically advanced are unaffected, less technically advanced firms tend to add their own R&D activity after gaining experience in locations with high indigenous R&D activity. The results suggest that technically lagging firms may leverage host country technical activity to strategically catch up with their more technically advanced competitors.",Exploration; Foreign R&D; International expansion,Natural resources exploration; Exploitation and explorations; Host countries; International expansion; Japanese manufacturing; Technical activities; Location

They played different roles in the emergent electrical industry and faced growth challenges in very distinct ways. The paper elaborates on Chandler's notion of organizational self-perpetuation, and advances the notion of organizational self-destruction. Inductive theoretical work on historical data advances two polar ideal types: the self-perpetuating and the self-destructing archetypes. Six dimensions of organizational responses to growth-related challenges characterize those archetypes: enterprising (the firm's willingness to take risks, as well as its willingness to search for ways of avoiding risk and still expand); related diversification promoting (kinds of motives inspiring the firm's expansion); change handling (strategic responses of firms that are likely to promote or preclude the development of dynamic capabilities); diversity management (the building of bonding relations to neutralize disruptive effects of increasing diversity); complexity management (capabilities to solve increasingly complex managerial problems); managerial resources provisioning (ensuring availability of needed managerial talent to support expansion). The proposed theory postulates that self-perpetuation and self-destruction are two extreme states of organizational existence. As a result, firms tend to operate in an intermediary state. The more the organization's responses point in the direction of the self-perpetuation (self-destruction) pole, the higher the chances the firm will experience organizational success (failure). Historical analysis of the period suggests that General Electric stood in the vicinity of the self-perpetuation pole, while Westinghouse of the self-destruction one.",Corporate growth; Dynamic capabilities; Long-term organizational success,Enterprise resource management; Expansion; Failure (mechanical); Managers; Poles; Comparative analysis; Complexity management; Corporate growth; Diversity managements; Dynamic capabilities; Historical analysis; Long-term organizational success; Managerial resources; Industrial management

Yet, limited research has developed or validated the behaviors necessary for effective entrepreneurship. We previously developed behavioral observation scales (BOS) that identified 47 key behaviors for entrepreneurship. These behaviors were grouped into 9 dimensions (e.g., opportunity identification, financial management skills, employee management). In this study, we validated the BOS through a national survey of 177 entrepreneurs. This survey captured two objective (i.e., employee growth and sales growth) and seven subjective (i.e., sales growth, net profit, quality, cash flow, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and personal income) performance measures. Our analysis consisted of three steps. First, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the proposed structure of the BOS. Second, we treated each of the nine BOS dimensions as scales and examined their reliability. Third, we correlated the performance measures with: (a) the nine factors resulting from the factor analysis, (b) the nine BOS dimensions, and (c) the total score on the BOS. Overall the results revealed that some refinement of the BOS was needed; a revised BOS is presented. The results further revealed that many of the nine dimensions, as well as the total score on the BOS, correlated significantly with most of the nine performance measures.

We address that need by investigating Leader- Member Exchange (LMX) and mentoring as sources of social support that decrease burnout through influences on organizational socialization and role stress. Using structural equation modeling we tested a network of relationships that showed LMX and mentoring have significant direct and indirect effects on reports of burnout. Data from 428 hospital employees indicated LMX and mentoring were positively associated with organizational socialization. Socialization then was negatively related to role stress which had a strong, positive influence on burnout. LMX displayed a direct negative relationship with role stress, while mentoring had a direct negative relationship with burnout. This study advances burnout theory by further clarifying the role of social support in reducing burnout. Additionally, the results provide a foundation for healthcare professionals, and organizations in general, to design workplace interventions intended to prevent or reduce burnout.",Burnout; Socialization; Structural equation modeling,Burnout; Health care professionals; Indirect effects; Leader-member exchanges; Social support; Socialization; Structural equation modeling; Job satisfaction

We augmented and improved upon past stress-performance meta-analyses in the following ways: (1) in addition to role ambiguity and role conflict, we included other types of chronic stress, such as role overload, job insecurity, work-family conflict, environmental uncertainty and situational constraints. (2) We explored two specific dimensions of performance, such as quality and quantity of performance as well as other objective and subjective measures performance. (3) We identified all relevant unpublished dissertations and broadened significantly the number of samples. (4) We tested new moderating effects. As hypothesized, all stresses had consistently negative relationships with all measures and dimensions of performance. The type of stress measurement used was a significant moderator. However, the published vs. unpublished studies moderator was not consistent across the various stresses. In our moderator analyses, two significant interactions were found. We found that as the percentage of women in the studies and the respondents' age increased interactively, and as the tenure and age of the respondents in the studies increased interactively, there was a reduction in the negative relationship between role ambiguity and performance. The results are discussed in terms of theoretical contributions and implications for future stress-performance research.",Meta-analysis; Performance; Stress,Moderators; Stresses; Environmental uncertainty; Implications for futures; Meta analysis; Objective and subjective measures; Performance; Situational constraints; Stress performance; Work-family conflict; Uncertainty analysis
Privacy trade-off factors in e-commerce - A study of Italy and the United States,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955075677&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18781234&partnerID=40&md5=beba1a6ac9082398e3b96a1d247c96b4,"This study examines cross-cultural differences in privacy trade-off factors as related to e-commerce use for Italy and the United States. By employing the model of trade-off factors, we argue that for both cultures the user's decision to make a purchase is influenced by trust, perceived vulnerability, and privacy concerns which are known to be among the most salient factors driving e-commerce. The empirical model was tested using LISREL structural equation modeling. We incorporated two of the most influential cultural theories - Hofstede's cultural dimensions of individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, and Fukuyama's theory of trust and social capital. The importance of trust in the collectivist Italian society and privacy in the individualist U.S. society has been discussed using the etic and emic approaches of cultural research. The paper's major contribution is in integrating the cultural theories into the theoretical model and showing the moderating effects of culture. The results render support for the study's hypotheses and show that the Italian culture exhibits lower propensity to trust, lower institutional trust, and lower privacy concerns, and higher perceived vulnerability than the U.S. counterpart which, from its part, exhibits stronger relationships between the e-commerce use and the trade-off factors.",Culture; E-commerce; Privacy,Cell culture; Data privacy; Electronic commerce; Cross-cultural differences; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Institutional trust; Moderating effect; Privacy concerns; Structural equation modeling; Theoretical modeling; Uncertainty avoidance; Economic and social effects
Broadening the scope: Exploring three knowledge distinctions,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64149115711&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18779934&partnerID=40&md5=db494a5f432b84869276517264b3116c,"In this paper, we draw three knowledge distinctions. The first distinction, borrowed from Polanyi (1966, 1969), separates tacit from explicit knowledge, and is based on the codifiability of knowledge. The second distinction, between theoretical and practical knowledge, categorizes knowledge based on its product. The product in theoretical knowledge is an understanding of its object, whereas in practical knowledge it is the manipulation or creation of its object. We argue that practical knowledge enables individuals to creatively fill the gaps between their theoretical knowledge of the world and the world in actuality. Emotions coupled with cognition play a key role in this gap-filling process. The third distinction separates physical knowledge (knowledge of objects) from social knowledge (knowledge of humans). Physical knowledge is universal; social knowledge is essentially communal and normative. We provide examples of the eight kinds of knowledge resulting from the intersections of the three distinctions and show how they have variously, but not systematically, been considered in prior literature. We argue that the use of the three knowledge distinctions would benefit the field of organization studies in the realm of empirical studies of modern occupations, macro considerations of knowledge creation and acquisition, and the extension of organizational theory.",Action; Emotion; Knowledge,Action; Emotion; Explicit knowledge; Gap-filling process; Knowledge; Knowledge creations; Organization studies; Organizational theory; Knowledge based systems
Strategic process effects on the entrepreneurial orientation-sales growth rate relationship,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085781257&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778648&partnerID=40&md5=b3038821dac240c4e97ccb1d2b4602f3,"This research examined the effects of three strategic process variables - strategic decision-making participativeness, strategy formation mode, and strategic learning from failure - on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO)-firm sales growth rate relationship. Results based on a sample of 110 manufacturing firms indicate a positive effect of EO on sales growth rate. Moreover, the relationship between EO and sales growth rate is more positive among firms that employ autocratic decision making and exhibit an emergent strategy formation process. Perceptions of proficiency at learning from strategic mistakes differentially affect the growth rates of firms at different ends of the EO continuum, but in manners inconsistent with the hypothesized relationship.",Entrepreneurial orientation; Learning from strategic mistakes; Strategic processes,Decision making; Autocratic decision makings; Emergent strategies; Entrepreneurial orientation; Learning from failures; Learning from strategic mistakes; Manufacturing firms; Strategic decision making; Strategic process; Sales
Feminist analysis of micro research on gender in organizations: Suggestions for advancing the field,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399914&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778662&partnerID=40&md5=4f34e2120c80a7d56032b3bf6e665da6,"Based on a survey of empirical research on gender in organizations published over a 20-year period, this paper argues that cumulatively, studies of sex difference tend to neglect organizational features. Drawing on concepts from feminist theory, we outline how greater attention to the links among gender, identity, and power in organizations would enrich the field. We conclude with examples of research that has retained a focus on the individual while incorporating analysis of the impact of organizational factors.",Diversity; Gender,Diversity; Empirical research; Gender; Organizational factors; Sex difference
Effects of transformational leadership training on employee safety performance: A quasi-experiment study,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84914703146&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18780756&partnerID=40&md5=2eec94738ea064f73cccabb5ed18fc42,"We conducted a pre-test/post-test quasi-experiment with swimming pool supervisors (n = 18) and their swim instructors (n = 39) to test whether a safety-specific transformational leadership training intervention for supervisors affected instructors' safety behaviors. Results from the experimental group (10 supervisors, 26 instructors) indicated that, when compared to the control group (8 supervisors, 13 instructors), the intervention significantly improved instructors' perceptions of their supervisors' transformational leadership behaviors, maintained instructors' safety compliance, and improved instructors' safety participation at a 6-week follow-up. A change in instructors' perceptions of their supervisors' transformational leadership behaviors served as the mechanism by which changes in the safety behaviors occurred. Observational ratings of pre-test and post-test instructors' safety behavior provided further evidence of experimental effects.",Leadership; Safety; Training,Accident prevention; Compliance control; Supervisory personnel; Employee safety; Experimental groups; Leadership; Quasi-experiments; Safety behavior; Safety compliances; Safety participations; Transformational leadership; Personnel training
The imprinting effect of initial resources and market strategy on the early growth path of start-ups,2005,"Academy of Management 2005 Annual Meeting: A New Vision of Management in the 21st Century, AOM 2005",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047987920&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2005.18778595&partnerID=40&md5=37daaaea4053c02ba7c86f58160bb313,"Research-based start-ups (RBSUs) differ in their early growth. Some firms grow very rapidly, while others grow slowly or do not grow at all. In this paper we bring insights in the causes of the diversity in the early growth of RBSUs. To identify some of the key factors that affect growth, we study the initial resource base and the firm's market strategy. We control for age, size and industry differences. Growth is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, we study three growth measures, namely growth in employees, revenues and total assets. Our multivariate analyses show that raising large amounts of VC is a key driver for early employment and revenue growth. Whilst most RBSUs are founded by pure technical founding teams, we find that R&D experience has no effect on growth. Founding teams with commercial experience, on the other hand, grow significantly more in employees, revenues and total assets. Next, RBSUs, which are internationally oriented from the start, grow significantly faster in terms of revenues and total assets but not in employees. Finally, multivariate analysis indicates that firms that are closer to a market ready product at founding do not grow significantly more in terms of revenues and employees, but firms that are earlier in the product development cycle grow more in total assets during the early growth path. We use in-depth qualitative information to explain and interpret the results and discuss the sustainability of different early growth trajectories. Our findings have important implications for entrepreneurs, investors and policy makers.",Growth; Resources; Start-up,Commerce; Fault tolerant computer systems; Growth (materials); Investments; Natural language processing systems; Personnel; Reactor startup; Imprinting effects; Initial resources; Market strategies; Multi variate analysis; Product development cycle; Qualitative information; Resources; Revenue growth; Multivariant analysis

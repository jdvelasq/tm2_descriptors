"""WHAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY?"": FROM THEORETICAL MYSTIFICATION TO EVERYDAY UNDERSTANDING","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192685867&doi=10.5465%2famr.2020.0335&partnerID=40&md5=fa01bb0c469b791a09b055fe6d41f1e9","Expressions about opportunities are used unproblematically in everyday contexts. Yet, the question ""What is an opportunity?"" has posed a difficult riddle in the academic study of entrepreneurship. Drawing on the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein,we explain that such perplexities are common when words are removed from ordinary language and intellectuals try to grasp what they name. Approaching the opportunity riddle differently, we ask, ""How do entrepreneurs use the word 'opportunity?'"" and elucidate an actualization theory of entrepreneurship attuned to the everyday understandings that underlie the meaningful use of the word. Bringing implicit understandings to the foreground contributes to (a) dissolving the mystification over the nature of ""opportunity""; (b) clarifying the conceptual foundations of entrepreneurship theory; and (c) reorienting the field toward more conceptually precise ways of thinking about Knightian uncertainty, entrepreneurial success, and the entrepreneurial process. This paper also contributes to the methodology of management studies by demonstrating how attention to the logic of ordinary language can alert us to theoretical dead-ends and enable the development of theory that bridges academic and everyday understandings. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Responding to recent efforts to address the micro and meso in institutional analysis, we introduce two interrelated constructs—a person’s embodied world of concern and a community’s shared world of concern—which shape how people experience, evaluate, and participate in institutional arrangements. The world of concern, which is the product of people’s sedimented experiences of thriving and suffering, becomes the basis for their commitments and antagonisms toward certain social arrangements. The world of concern, as a lens, sheds light on the complex ways the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are coimplicated in constructing commitments and attachments that animate action in institutional arenas by providing a new metaphor, one that links the realism of participant concerns to the microdynamics that underpin institutions. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these ideas for future research. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

As federalism has served as a prevailing U.S. theory for arranging governmental political power for the advancement of the public interest, we derive from federalist principles descriptive, normative, and instrumental theoretical foundations for arranging corporate power and directing corporate social action in the pursuit of similar goals. What we call “federated corporate social responsibility” (FCSR) revives an older institutional approach to corporate responsibility, paying particular attention to the division of moral labor in society and how different corporate responsibility prescriptions stand to affect the social ecosystem of power. Federalist institutional strategies deploying separations of power and constitutions are used to develop a concept of corporate “constitutional devices,” which have promise to constrain the corporation as it fulfills its social responsibilities, even outside the ambit of a strong state and in light of barriers to constant, effective stakeholder accountability. We conclude by outlining FCSR managerial strategies, which sometimes endorse corporate social inaction in the interest of a desirable distribution of authority across society. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Grounded in a process ontology, we conceptualize institutions as ever-becoming yet enduring social processes that are meaningful and carry prescriptions for actors’ legitimate participation. Building on this conceptualization, we develop a theoretical model of the role of temporality in institutional stabilization that explores how three dimensions of institutions (meaning, prescriptions, and participation) are each stabilized by a facet of temporality (temporal patterns, expectancies, and mechanisms), as well as factors affecting each of these links. Our arguments contribute to writing on institutions in relation to temporality, agency, and process. © 2023 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Directed by their relationship with the firm's leadership, we theorize that stakeholders' appraisals of top female leaders map onto a categorical and complex continuum. At the ""categorical"" end of this continuum, stakeholders neither have access nor are attentive to capability cues fromthe leader, increasing their reliance on stereotypes and gender biases in their leader evaluations. At the ""complex"" end of the continuum, stakeholders have access and are attentive to capability cues from the leader, decreasing their reliance on stereotypes and increasing their ability to accurately evaluate the leader. Between these ends, stakeholders evaluate female leaders by applying stereotypes and striving for accuracy to varying degrees. Each region on this continuum is linked to an array of behavioral responses, directed by stakeholders toward a target leader, that differ in valence and intensity. Our framework has significant implications for understanding a variety of social biases beyond gender, and enables the development of tailored strategies that can be used to facilitate accurate leader evaluations by all stakeholders. © 2024 Academy of Management.

We argue that, in order to create and capture value by acquiring established businesses and selling them to corporate buyers, PE firms must possess at least one of three potential advantages: (a) they must be able to identify businesses that are currently undervalued (valuation advantage), (b) they must be able to enhance the intrinsic value of the business (governance advantage), or (c) they must be able to match the business to a more synergistic corporate owner than is immediately available (timing advantage). We discuss why, and under what conditions, PE firms may thus have an advantage in buying, owning, and selling businesses, and derive a set of propositions predicting which targets PE firms are most likely to pursue. Our study thus offers a comprehensive yet contingent theory of non-venture PE, developing an integrated value-based framework to explain this important and growing phenomenon.

We develop a theoretical framework consisting of three components to analyze firms' CPA concealment strategies. First,we provide a detailed conceptual background on CPA concealment, including what CPA concealment is and how it can occur. Second, we develop an in-depth analysis of the key benefits and costs of concealing CPA for firms. Finally, we integrate this analysis with positive political theory to place our firm-level calculus in the context of policymaking by identifying the public policymakers whom firms are most likely to influence via CPA concealment. Based on this framework, we generate additional empirically testable propositions on how CPA concealment changes with factors at the country, institution, issue, and firm levels. This study is the first to generate systematic theory on firms' CPA concealment strategies.

We argue that this omission occurs because TCE's opportunism assumption does not consider organizational member motivations under different hierarchical forms. Thus, TCE does not fully examine opportunistic behavior under hierarchy, resulting in an incomplete governance analysis. To fill this gap, we build a discriminating alignment theory of hierarchical choice that incorporates explicit motivations under each hierarchical form. We make three contributions to TCE with this theory. First, using the counterproductive work behavior and goal-framing literatures, we predict specific motivations (effort, visceral, financial or status opportunism, or collaboration) across hierarchical forms. Second, we predict when ""efficient""hierarchical forms (mapped from Williamson's internal governance analysis) do not effectively mitigate opportunistic behavior, creating hierarchical failure. In these cases, we augment the hierarchical forms with supplemental governance mechanisms necessary to efficiently govern the exchange. Finally, we investigate how different motivations across hierarchical forms lead to excess misalignment costs to enhance our understanding of hierarchical failures. Examining how both transaction hazards and specific motivations drive particular behaviors allows for a more nuanced understanding of specific ""costs and competencies""of hierarchy and, in turn, hierarchical failure in TCE. © 2023 Academy of Management Review.","",""

If complementarities are net positive, then dampening agents’ incentives can dramatically reduce the value created in the ecosystem, even to zero—that is, the prospect of a firm’s value capture may even prevent the firm itself from operating. Conversely, if complementarities are net negative, dampening agents’ incentives can increase value creation by discouraging agents from imposing these negative complementarities on each other. The disincentivizing effects of a firm’s value capture can be mitigated by enforceable contracts, cooperative governance, and self-organization by agents, but what is optimal for the agents or the firm may not be optimal for value creation in the ecosystem. © 2022 Academy of Management.

We propose that nonprofits can be modeled as profit-maximizers serving a two-sided market, also known as a multisided platform (MSP). We present a formal model to demonstrate how MSPs, so influential in the technology sector, can also explain nonprofit behavior. In our model of donative nonprofits, donors comprise one side of the market and recipients of services comprise the other side.

Agency problems and other contracting problems resulting from shirking, hold-up, market power, and externalities are best understood in this context. We develop design principles for the allocation of property rights to mitigate each of these contracting problems by reducing stakeholders' vulnerabilities to opportunistic behaviors.

However, scholars have yet to examine the economic incentives governing these choices. In particular, the literature offers little insight into how consumers' willingness to pay a CSR price premium affects the choice between symbolic versus substantive CSR. To address this question, this paper proposes a formal model wherein substantive CSR reduces the negative socioenvironmental externalities associated with firms' products, while consumers vary in their ability to monitor these externalities, and in their preferences for CSR. The paper establishes conditions under which the CSR price premium functions as an enabler of substantive CSR. It also examines howmonitoring intensity, product differentiation, and competitors' CSR engagement choices moderate this enabling effect. For example, when competitors engage in symbolic CSR, higher monitoring increases the enabling effect of the CSR price premiumif substantive CSR sufficiently reduces negative externalities, but decreases it otherwise. Product differentiation and competitors' decisions to engage in substantive CSR have similarly nuanced roles.

Leaders across industries, from telecom to sports, employ these narratives to inspire members of their organizations. However, little is understood about howunderdog narratives influence the actions and attitudes of members of organizations. To address this gap, we explain how a leader's communication of an underdog narrative may instill confidence in members of the organization that together they can overcome their shared disadvantage and achieve a clear set of organizational aspirations. In doing so, we introduce a conceptual model that draws on the sensemaking and social identity literatures to explain how a leader's underdog narrative fosters the adoption of a collective underdog identity bymembers of an organization. Further,we explain that the specific attributes of the leader's underdog narrative influence how this unique type of collective identity leads to varied outcomes for members of an organization.

From a resource-based perspective, we first identify four resources-social dominance, ethnocentric orientation, social capital, and absorptive capacity-that represent Hobfoll's four kinds of resources (i.e., object, personal, condition, and energy) and differentiate them in terms of their goal (i.e., maintaining the original culture or seeking intercultural interactions) and orientation (i.e., individual or social). We postulate that domestic employees' loss and gain of these resources set boundary conditions for acculturation stress in response to the influence of globalization. Then, drawing on Berry's taxonomies, we configure different combinations of the loss and gain of these resources to form individual and collective ideal types of resources that set boundary conditions for the influence of acculturation stress on adaptation approaches (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) at the individual level and the influence of globalization on adaptation cultures (i.e., multiculturalism, melting pot, segregation, and exclusion) at the organizational level. Finally, we propose that adaptation cultures exert influences on domestic employees' normative freedom of choice of adaptation approaches.  © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Yet, empirically observing both the situated nature of actions and their ultimate consequences remains challenging. In this paper, we describe microhistory as a complementary approach to grounded and longitudinal studies that reconciles situated action in time with its broader consequences over time. Microhistorical research involves the reflexive use of dual temporal frames: a microtemporal frame suited to an empirically grounded study of individuals in time and a macrotemporal frame accounting for processes of continuity and change in social structures over time. We describe the epistemology, method, and form inherent in theorizing with microhistory and consider its potential for management researchers. Microhistory’s approach, we recognize, is well-suited to several phenomena that remain elusive to contemporaneous and longitudinal studies, such as exceptional normal actions, unintended consequences, nonlinear and emergent processes, contingent processes, and unobserved or inconceivable processes. Finally, we consider how microhistory’s reflexive temporality offers management scholars opportunities to situate ourselves and our own theorizing in time and to account for evolving consequences over time. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Drawing on a core social motives framework, we propose two primary types of work-related imagined interactions: those aimed at helping employees feel more connected with others (i.e., imagined interactions concerning socio-emotional goals) and those aimed at helping employees gain confidence to influence others (i.e., imagined interactions concerning socio-instrumental goals). We explicate the conditions that motivate employees to engage in each type of imagined interaction and examine the content of these imaginings, explaining with whom they imagine interacting, what the imagined interaction is like, and when the imagined interaction occurs.

Drawing on the meaning maintenance model and concepts surrounding psychological ownership and identity, we build a model that focuses on ""legatees""-the beneficiaries of the legacy-in the lower echelons. The departure of a manager, informal leader, or star serves as a disruption to legatees' mental representations of their working world. That disruption causes them to attend to issues of ownership (either psychological ownership or disownership of the legacy) and identity (either identification or rivalry with the legator) in order to fulfill salient needs. Fulfilling continuity and belonging needs results in two behaviors that enhance the durability of the legator's contributions:maintaining and evangelizing. Fulfilling distinctiveness and efficacy needs results in two behaviors that reduce the durability of the legator's contributions: neglecting and erasing.

We propose that this dismal assessment, as well as subsequent prescriptions to address it, flow from a narrow epistemological approach to informality based on absence, where the lack of (Western) market-supporting legal and regulatory institutions explain missing economic growth at the firm level. In contrast, we build a theoretical approach grounded in presence, proposing that a more comprehensive incorporation of existing institutions may reveal less visible, individual level types of entrepreneurial growth occurring in informal economies. To do so, we conceptualize informal economies as institutional interfaces built of “bits and pieces” from market and nonmarket institutions. We propose that the configuration of these interfaces influences the cultural toolkits of inhabitant entrepreneurs, which in turn shapes how they grow in an informal economy. Specifically, we link three dimensions of institutional complexity at the institutional interface (jurisdictional influence, fragmentation, and incompatibility) to three types of growth (direct, dispersed, and disguised) that vary in terms of visibility. Our theory animates understanding of diverse informal economies and the entrepreneurial activity that exists within them. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Yet, studies have failed to consistently demonstrate this importance. These equivocal findings have been attributed to the lack of clarity of the strategic consensus construct. We contend that current notions of strategic consensus have broadened the construct to the point that it has become indistinguishable from organizational strategic climate, which is a distinct, but related, construct. Moreover, we depart from past studies that have essentially treated commitment as an element of strategic consensus. Instead, we suggest that commitment is but one of several possible psychological bonds generated by strategic consensus. We therefore reconceptualize strategic consensus, disentangling it from commitment and strategic climate, and theorize how these three distinct constructs are interrelated. Specifically, we suggest that a strategic consensus influences strategic climate through both symbolic and substantive means, and that the latter occurs through a relationship mediated by the psychological bond that the strategic decision-makers hold toward the strategic decision. In so doing, our theorization paves the way for future research to explore how this constellation of constructs works together to affect more distal organizational outcomes such as strategic implementation, and ultimately, firm performance. © 2022 Academy of Management.

In this manuscript, we reflect on the factors that led to this progress in crowdsourcing research, and how the theoretical insights from our paper––e.g., markets in the hierarchies-markets dichotomy are made up of markets with ex ante contracts and crowdsourcing (markets with no ex ante contracts)––may have influenced that progress. Also, because profits have become the ultimate goal of a large number of the seekers of solutions through crowdsourcing, we present an outline of a framework for exploring the impact of crowdsourcing on a seeker’s profitability.

This limitation persists partly because the structure and content of the social interactions are unaccounted for,making it impossible to fully understand and predict when HCR will be generated through the HCR emergence process. To address this deficiency, we draw from social capital literature to develop HCR emergence theory.

Yet, for a number of businesses, including erotic webcam, reality television, slum tourism, and mixed martial arts, voyeurism is an important part of value creation. The success of such businesses that violate dominant moral codes raises questions about value creation that existing theory in management cannot adequately answer. To help advance our understanding, we theorize how businesses commercializing voyeurism create value for audiences. Conceptualizing voyeurism as a social practice, we identify two dimensions of voyeurism—authenticity and transgression—that help create value by generating desirable emotional responses that facilitate a distinctive experience for audiences. However, we further argue that these same dimensions can also hinder value creation by generating undesirable emotional responses that may lead audiences to disengage from the practice. Accordingly, we contend that businesses’ ability to deliver value to audiences hinges on effective emotional optimization—efforts to reduce undesirable emotional responses by dampening the authenticity or transgression in the voyeuristic practice, while reinforcing the associated desirable emotional responses. We contribute to the literature by advancing a novel theory of the commercialization of voyeuristic practice. In doing so, we also enrich our understanding of both authenticity and transgression.

We argue that as uncertainty increases, the choice of commercialization mode will increasingly be driven by differences in subjective judgments of the idea's value, with firms having an advantage in assessing the true value of their employee's ideas relative to market because of their firm-specific nature. Building on this insight, we develop a formal model of commercialization choice that maps idea characteristics to commercialization outcomes-spinouts, internal commercialization, market mobility, or abandonment- while also predicting how these relationships will be moderated by the cost of startups, the value of the idea, and the institutional context, as well as how value will be created and appropriated within each mode. In particular, the model distinguishes between four different types of employee spinouts, including the previously neglected case where the employer sees value in an idea and wants to commercialize it, but the employee still prefers to start their own firm.We thus offer a more nuanced viewof employee entrepreneurship, based on differences in subjective judgment under uncertainty, the firm-specific nature ofemployee knowledge, and appropriability regimes. © 2024 Academy of Management.

This paper draws on the psychology of reasoning to take a step toward answering this question. We begin by theorizing small world representations and how the scenario spaces they contain are constructed and may be updated over time. We then introduce two well-known heuristic methods of inquiry, disconfirmation and counterfactual reasoning; translate them into practical procedures for updating scenario spaces; and compare the relative performance of these procedures in strategic situations of Knightian uncertainty. Our principal findings are that the procedure based on counterfactual reasoning is superior to that based on disconfirmation with respect to (a) counteracting the confirmation bias, (b) promoting the exploration of the set of imaginable scenarios, and (c) facilitating action to mitigate or exploit the consequences of what would otherwise have been Black Swans.

We focus on the design of a “program of experimentation,” which we define as a sequentially interdependent set of experiments and pivot decisions an entrepreneur undertakes to develop a viable business idea. This conceptualization highlights two dimensions of program design: the number of experiments to run and the pivot threshold for evaluating experimental outcomes. Our computational model suggests that while experimenting and pivoting can improve new venture performance, it can also be taken too far. Programs of experimentation that generate frequent and early pivots may impede learning and underperform more conservative programs that generate fewer pivots. We also show that an effectively designed program of experimentation can partially remedy an entrepreneur's behavioral biases.

Although previous SH research is rich, there remain unanswered questions about how SH is defined, how it develops, and how it can be mitigated. Further, recent research on social sexual behavior (SSB), which establishes potential workplace benefits of SSB, has posed the challenge of distinguishing between positive SSB and SH. In this paper, using an interactional framing approach, we present a theory examining the interactional process that determines the meaning of work SSB as either play or SH. Our proposed model is dynamic and helical, suggesting that social participants cycle through nonlinear phases of engrossment and sensemaking as they set, sustain, limit-test, and break frames around work SSB. This model is influenced by organizational culture (e.g., masculinity contest culture, organizational tolerance for SH) and individual motivations related to goal interconnections and interdependence. This model can be applied to explain how potentially serious SSB conduct comes to be interpreted as playful, how this interpretation is sustained and expanded, and how the meaning of the conduct may come to be reinterpreted as SH.

We offer an important explanation for whether star performers may flourish or flounder when they join a new team. Integrating insights from attribution theory and social comparison research, we present a process model explaining how incumbents make sense of star newcomer status. We propose that incumbents determine whether the star newcomer attained their star status through internal factors (e.g., ability, grit) or external factors (e.g., luck, affiliation), which gives rise to one of four distinct emotions: optimism, inspiration, shame, or envy. Incumbents who feel optimism or inspiration attempt to enhance their status through learning or helping behaviors that subsequently facilitate star newcomer performance, whereas incumbents who feel shame or envy seek to protect their status through withdrawal or destructive behaviors that hinder star newcomer performance. We further propose that the effect of incumbent behaviors on star newcomer performance is particularly likely when there is a high need for task-related interactions and complementary skills among team members. Our theoretical framework helps to advance the star newcomer literature by examining the largely overlooked influence of incumbents and highlighting the cognitive process that precedes their behavior toward star newcomers. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Creon, Antigone's ruler, preconizes the traditionally masculine leadership conduct, with hubristic tyrannical tendencies, that deliver tragic consequences. Antigone schools Creon and the audience, firstly, by identifying the behaviors and circumstances that favor bad and untimely leadership decisions. Then Antigone presents the wisdom of phronesis as the way forward for good and timely leadership decisions. Phronesis is a pragmatic, measured rationality that comprises prudence, and a sensibility to the context, openness to dialogue, and to the other. Phronesis also calls for an open and flexible relation to error, to changing one'smind. The focus is notmerely on the leader but on the relations, their differences, and opportunities, and what everyone involved in the specific circumstances of the decision can offer when listening and learning from one another. Phronesis becomes part of amodus operandi that prefigures collaborative leadership. Collaborative leadership is predicated on the collective and individual flourishing central to the dawn of democratic rule and the dilemmas Antigone examines. This essay shows how today we still need Antigone in deepening our democracy and making better leadership decisions.  © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Yet, existing work in this area has focused primarily on characteristics of voice that appear valued by recipients, falling short in specifying the dimensions that contribute to voice's performanceenhancing potential or the conditions that facilitate its development in organizations. Envisioning ""voice quality"" as a cross-level and context-specific phenomenon, we advance a contextualized theory that first draws on an organizationalambidexterity perspective to detail how voice quality is multiplicatively composed of three dimensions- desirability, feasibility, and, in exploration-focused contexts, degree of change. Further recognizing that the development of voice quality depends on context-specific knowledge, experiences, and cognitions, we accentuate how time-in conjunction with other individual and contextual factors-produces ebbs and flows in voice quality in the specific case of newcomer socialization. Altogether, our framework aims to build consensus around a contextualized understanding of the dimensions of voice quality, highlight its dynamic nature, and advance a temporally precise theory around its unique nomological network in organizations. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Surprisingly, however, there is relatively little agreement about the precise meaning of either dimension, the relationship between them, or the process through which they are produced. In this paper, we explore how novelty and usefulness have been used explicitly and implicitly in the creativity literature to reveal three ways to understand the definitional constructs. We propose that these three understandings give rise to distinct but interrelated forms of creativity: creativity as maximization, creativity as balance, and creativity as integration. Each form provides a different way of answering the question: What is creativity? We further theorize that the forms are shaped by the distal relations between novelty and usefulness, context, and process. Fundamentally, our theory suggests that developing a creative outcome for a distant alternative reality is a different form of creativity than developing an idea grounded in the present, so that as creators move through space and time, they also move through different forms of creativity. Our meta-theory furthers our understanding of creativity by revealing the centrality of usefulness in defining creativity, opening up the dynamics of the creative process, and highlighting interdependencies between ideas and context.

New ventures are commonly founded by teams of entrepreneurs, who must employ a decision-making structure that implicitly or explicitly defines how individual beliefs are aggregated into team decisions. We consider this issue through the lens of organizational economics, which focuses on decision-making governance. Using a computational model, we consider three archetypal decision-making structures: partnership voting, a boss with employees, and a buyout option (partnership convertible to boss structure). We highlight the conditions under which partnership voting is an effective means of governing market entry and exit decisions when teams’ decision-making is informed by efforts to learn about the merits of uncertain opportunities. The promise of partnership voting is realized when entrepreneurs are either unbiased or optimistic about their likelihood of success. Partnership voting is problematic when entrepreneurs differ in their biases or respond too rapidly to new information, in which case a buyout option is better. From a policy perspective, we show that confidence biases may be managed by selectively matching the decision-making structure to entrepreneurs’ biases, and that doing so may substantially improve the performance of new ventures.

Drawing from cinematic examples, we consider how pathos appeals influence team adaptation. Specifically, we examine three cinematic stories in which pathos appeals were used to leverage emotion by adapting teams. These stories enhance our understanding of team adaptation in the face of difficult and often unforeseen challenges, laying the foundation for new theory and an expanded understanding of how emotion and persuasion affect team change.

Shifting the focus from exploring drivers of dominant coalition configurations in isolation (e.g., equity holdings), we expand on a relational perspective to explore how relational ties (soft power) among family shareholders interplay with equity holdings (hard power) in generating individual effective power to influence decision-making in the family firm. Drawing from and expanding on a cooperative game theory approach, this paper breaks new theoretical ground by providing insights into why and how the formation of relational ties (and lack thereof) among family shareholders affects the distribution of effective power in decision-making processes, over and beyond the share in equity holdings. Our work trains a microfoundation lens on the study of dominant coalitions by disentangling and assessing individual effective power in coalitions of shareholders in family firms. We further propose a new perspective and a formal modeling approach to explain and measure why and how relational ties among members shape their effective power to influence decision-making, thereby shedding light on why and how members participate in different coalitional configurations.

We build on the work of Elinor Ostrom on solving collective action problems to develop theory about how to govern joint value creation whenmanaging for stakeholders. Specifically, we useOstrom's design principles to contrast the hub-and-spoke formof governance central tomuch of the stakeholder literature with two alternative governance forms (lead role governance and shared governance) that we derive from Ostrom's work, and we discuss the comparative effectiveness of these three governance forms as depending on the nature of the joint value creation activities.

We call the second account the belief-based model. This model focuses on the characteristics of the choice alternatives faced by firms and the challenges inherent in evaluating them. Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the predictions of the belief-based model may explain instances where search increases, rather than decreases, as performance improves. This behavioral pattern, both above and below the aspiration, is prevalent in empirical research but not well accounted for using the aspiration-based model alone.

However, in recent years a new business model has emerged that contradicts this fundamental precept: With pay-what-you-want (PWYW) pricing, a seller allows a buyer to name any nonnegative price, even zero, for the seller’s product or service, and yet, enough buyers make voluntary positive payments, and of sufficient magnitude, that the seller may earn a substantial profit. Motivated by this development, we posit a theory of how value creation and value capture—though generally treated as distinct processes in strategy theory—are in fact strongly connected through the sociopsychological framing of a transaction: If a transaction is framed as a social exchange between the buyer and seller, the seller may capture more value with PWYW than if the seller posts a price or haggles with the buyer over terms in a market-based exchange.

While prior strategy research has often assumed that learning curves are deterministic and known ex ante to firms, substantial evidence suggests that learning curves are inherently uncertain. If there is uncertainty in the learning curve, then the taken-for-granted wisdom regarding the strategic implications of learning curves may over- or under-emphasize the value of early entry. We consider two forms of uncertainty-prospective (future costs) and contemporaneous (current costs).We demonstrate computationally that while prospective uncertainty in the learning curve enhances the benefits of early entry, contemporaneous uncertainty reduces these benefits. Further, we examine the implications of these findings for competition and learning curve spillovers between leader and laggard firms. Recognizing learning curve uncertainty highlights a novel formof spillovers that do not affect expected cost but rather affect uncertainty about cost. Our core insight is that when learning curve uncertainty is large relative to the expected learning rate, it is uncertainty, rather than expectations about this rate, that determines the extent of early-mover advantage.  © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Our key proposal is to distinguish between ends and means, or functions (e.g., goals or mandates) and structures (e.g., roles). This conceptualization makes it possible for two roles to be simultaneously interdependent in work processes yet conflicted in goals.

Building upon the sociological literature, we classify forms of social control based on their cooperativeness and formality; additionally, we shed light on the outcomes of social control by illustrating the conditions under which they are likely to be more, or less, accommodative of deviant behavior, aswell asmore, or less, permanent. In so doing,we contribute to scholarly understanding of the role of social control in organizational fields, as well as of the advantageousness of deviant behavior as a strategic option for organizations. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Such advances have been fueled by a rising collective experience of paradox—as change, scarcity and plurality intensify awareness of conflicting, interdependent and persistent forces—and by a global community of paradox scholars—notably creative, dedicated and mutually supportive. We are honored by the 2021 Decade Award. Our 2011 publication helped shape rigorous research while informing vexing challenges. In this manuscript, we reflect on factors contributing to this scholarly expansion, offering insights into how advances of paradox theory could generalize to the rise of fields more broadly. We then explore the accumulation of paradox scholarship, noting the convergence of key ideas and definitions, while recognizing the divergence of ontologies, methodologies, theories, and phenomena. Building upon expanding insights into how to navigate paradox, we categorize varied approaches into four sets of tools—assumptions (cognition), boundaries (structures), comfort (emotions), and dynamics (change)—presented within an integrative framework that we label the Paradox System. By doing so, we highlight the breadth of underlying research, depict interwoven and paradoxical relationships across categories, and surface a core insight that navigating paradox is paradoxical. Finally, we offer suggestions and provocations for future research. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Yet, we lack theories on the drivers of diversity learning and transfer that consider both unique workforce composition characteristics and contextual changes. Diversity training researchers have focused primarily on static aspects of training design and content while largely ignoring the role of the learner. Because these oversights have fueled persistent questions about the effectiveness of diversity training, we offer a learner-centric, process-based model of diversity training that acknowledges the broader context in which it is situated and its influence on trainee motivation, learning, and transfer. We consider the interplay among the design factors, learning context, and learner characteristics in the pre-training, training, and post-training environments, and explore the self-regulatorymechanisms through which trainees can guide their learning. We close by discussing how our process model of diversity training changes our understanding of past research and redirects future research, and we apply the model to several prototypical diversity learner personas to demonstrate how it can be used in practice to personalize diversity training and address barriers to its effectiveness. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Consequently, suppliers may avoid exerting effort and so customersmay be unwilling to pay a premium. This article develops an analyticalmodel to address market frictions. We identify circumstances where the classic reputation mechanism is insufficient and then propose a newstrategywhereby the platform accepts only a subset of suppliers.Wedemonstrate that this supplier-restriction strategy can support a welfare-enhancing equilibrium and accelerate evolution even if all the suppliers are homogeneous and the customers can costlessly transact with suppliers outside the platform. At equilibrium, suppliers on the platform enjoy a higher market share than those outside and are motivated to exert effort; customers prefer to pay suppliers on the platform a premium and seek outside suppliers only if the former are unavailable. We evaluate platform profitability and social welfare, compare different payment structures, and extend the model to accommodate issues regarding verifiability, imperfect signals, and matching costs.

We advance the existing conceptualization of synergy in three ways. First, we develop a theoretically motivated, parsimonious typology of five distinct sources of synergy based on two underlying dimensions: the level of analysis at which valuable activities occur and the orientation by which those activities are governed. The typology uncovers three novel synergy sources (relational, network, and nonmarket) arising from acquisition-induced changes in firms’ external cooperative environments and classifies two other well-known synergies (internal and market power). Second, we introduce the concept of synergy life cycles to explore how the timing of initial realization and the duration of gains vary across the five synergies based on differences in the post-merger integration required and in the control the acquirer has over the assets and activities combined by the merger. Third, we consider how the synergy types interact, yielding co-synergies when they complement each other and dis-synergies when they substitute for one another. This enables us to expand the traditional conceptualization of the total value created by mergers and acquisitions as the sum of each of the synergy types, their co-synergies, and their dis-synergies. © 2022 Academy of Management.

A unique challenge for entrepreneurs, however, is how entrepreneurs can construct a narrative that unites stakeholders with different perceptions of the degree of risk or uncertainty posed by the future. We address this question with a diegetic narrative model of stakeholder enrollment. Our primary argument is that, to reduce variation in how potential stakeholders view the future, a story must embed a vision of the future in a coherent and collectively held narrative of the past. We introduce rhetorical history as the primary construct throughwhich this occurs.We demonstrate howsuccessful visions employ historical tropes at the intradiegetic level to appeal to individual perceptions of risk or uncertainty and how those historical tropes are combined into meta-narratives or myths drawn from the collective memory of a community to create broad, extradiegetic appeal to broader categories of potential stakeholders with heterogeneous temporal orientations. Finally, we describe three categories of historical reasoning-teleology, presentism, and retro-futurism-that act as bridging mechanisms between past, present, and future that provides stakeholderswith an enhance sense of agency in the future. © 2023 Academy of Management Review.","",""

The argument employs two philosophical concepts: intentionality and speech acts. The first is used to conceptualize the corporate mind, which is a set of long-lived beliefs about the world as it is and intentions about theworld as it will be that drives organizational activity. Corporate minds allow for complex and valuable forms of social cooperation and, hence, the article argues that the purpose of any organization is to sustain a corporate mind. Five core attributes enable organizations to fulfill this purpose: authorization, property rights, the ability to contract, the capacity to deliberate, and conversability. Conversability allows organizations to perform speech acts; that is, to make statements about the corporate mind that are referred to in this article as meta-contractual avowals. The article provides a value-neutral account of corporate governance as the set of devices that ensures the consistency of an organization's corporate mind, metacontractual avowals, and authorized actions.

In order to advance our understanding of (and adaptation to) future discontinuities and crises, we argue that we require a reconceptualization of how disruption occurs. To do so, we draw on event systems theory; in contrast to previous work viewing disruption as the outcome of a singular event, we focus on how disruption can occur from an event chain—that is, a set of events that are temporally and causally connected. We abductively shape our conceptual arguments by drawing on narratives of past pandemics, reviewing two historical and two fictional texts that (re)create the experiences of those living through the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the bubonic plague. Rather than focusing on events themselves, we identify how certain characteristics among events in a chain lead to four microlevel experiences: stagnation, disorientation, polarization, and repudiation. We then proceed to examine how these microlevel reactions culminate into macrolevel transformations of economic, political, and cultural norms. Our event-system perspective on disruption and crises thereby generates insight, not only into understanding the (post-)pandemic world, but also into responses to future discontinuities. © 2023 Academy of Management.

In this paper, we call attention to the anchoring and evolving forces that people experience as a paradox for their career identity and theorize “career identifying” as an ongoing process of career identity maintenance and change. As individuals contend with career identity tensions, they make adjustments to maintain a balance of anchoring and evolving forces on their career identity or to make shifts that accumulate into career identity change. The career identifying process accounts for both career identity maintenance and change in a single theoretical model that explains how career identity can change over time while being stable enough to make coherent career choices. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Juxtaposing The Chair against germane discourses on the model minority, I consider some of the salient, though not fully understood, challenges to inclusion at work. I develop theoretical insights on how the model minority encounters specific forms of institutional racism that encumber their inclusion in organizations. Namely, I contend that the construction of an organizational member of color as the model minority positions them in (a) double consciousness and (b) the leadership conundrum. Double consciousness refers to the phenomenon wherein the model minority is subjected to latent or overt institutional racism while simultaneously being pressured to remain within the restrictive parameters of the model minority stereotype. The leadership conundrum refers to how the model minority is cast with expectations to behave in ways not expected of White colleagues occupying the same role, which ultimately sets up the model minority leader for failure.

The large extent of nonroutine activities in such organizations hampers the effectiveness of traditional management instruments, such as monitoring effort and performance levels and exercising fiat—resulting in increasingly important self-organized collaboration. To explain how such collaboration is possible, we suggest a refinement of the psychological assumptions underpinning influential theories of the firm—specifically, concerning how people reason. We juxtapose “Nash reasoning” (the mode of reasoning underpinning organizational economic theories of the firm) with “virtual bargaining” (a more collaborative mode of reasoning drawing on recent research in cognitive science). Virtual bargaining enables individuals to establish, maintain, and abide by tacit “social contracts” of their team and organization—the (often-tacit) norms, rules, roles, and responsibilities governing how employees should behave (irrespective of their personal objectives). Thus, virtual bargaining helps individuals mitigate challenges of team production, such as shirking and hold-up, in a self-organizing and self-enforcing way. We analyze the conditions under which virtual bargaining leads individuals to coordinate on enhanced effort levels in organizationally relevant settings. We outline avenues for empirically testing virtual bargaining in organizations and discuss conceptual implications. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Regardless of one's position, institutional theory requires a scaffolding that acknowledges the novelty and diversity of actor analyses and facilitates the commensurability, application, and reach in scholarly uses of the term.

Our lens pushes beyond the prolific use of the term by providing a foundation for identifying and positioning actorbased studies. It also delineates reference sets of actor-based scholarship, even absent of the term altogether, so as to identify where conceptual specifications converge, expand, complement, or compete. Our lens also provides a means of relating actor-based analyses to one another in ways that distinguish the quality of the actor specification from its novelty or empirical validity.

Our contribution extends this stream of research by identifying how design choices about the way knowledge is manifested (e.g., into routines, blueprints, prototypes, or products) can inhibit a counterparty’s ability to imitate knowledge relating to a focal innovation. We derive six theoretically distinct types of knowledge manifestation that can be used for these ends, consider their impacts on the awareness, motivation, and capability of a counterparty seeking to imitate the focal knowledge, and organize them into a novel two-dimensional conceptual framework for comparison. By doing so, we add design mechanisms to the strategic toolbox of isolating mechanisms available for capturing value from innovation.

However, past research has given less attention to the social media era's revolutionary effects on these dynamics. In the present paper, we theorize that the social media era's greater velocity, emotionality, and communality increase the likelihood that social disapproval will spread faster and more empathetically among a more heterogeneous set of constituents. We develop a framework that explicates how a firm's response strategies can prevent, contain, and attenuate ""social disapproval,"" which we define as constituents' general enmity toward a firm. Our framework predicts that a firm's greater initial transparency is more likely to prevent social disapproval, while a reticent response to others' initial disclosures is more effective at containing it. Once social disapproval has spread, however, we posit that a firm can more effectively attenuate it by responding more deliberatively and accommodatively. Further, we theorize how traditional media era contingencies of event severity, actor prominence, andmessage inauthenticity take on additional meaning and have unexpected effects on the social disapproval management process in the social media era. © 2021 Academy of Management.

With the current literature treating the conceptions of new ventures as exogenous, there has been a limited focus on the transition of venturing efforts from nebulous, open-ended, and accidental toward becoming scalable, focused, and deliberate. We develop a dynamic model for organizing support systems for the early phases of new venture creation, where scattered ideas evolve into venture concepts as tokens, frames, and premises for further action. By viewing venturing efforts and opportunities as emergent and drawing on the literature on complexity and organizational space, we propose openness, self-selection, visibility, and connectivity as the defining characteristics for organizing support systems. In contrast to the literature’s predominant focus on a predictive, linear approach, we expand the theoretical scope of support systems to include organizing that is more attuned to the uncertain and nonlinear nature of new venture creation that they support. Our work has broader implications for organizing uncertain early-phase development processes. A video abstract of this paper can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDUZgGapMnM.

Instead of considering this taken-for-grantedness as a natural, selfsustaining feature of institutions, I argue here that it is a fundamental, precarious, and ongoing accomplishment. Drawing on ethnomethodology, I theoretically elaborate the intricate interactional choreography through which taken-for-grantedness is achieved-as institutional typifications are skillfully drawn into, and enacted in, social interactions-and highlight how this choreography can itself generate oddities, or breaks in the typified expectations between interactants. These oddities, if not resolved by interactants' corrective sensemaking, generate substantive breaches in taken-for-grantedness, potentially with significant downstream consequences for institutional maintenance and change. I then expand upon this baseline interactional model by suggesting that local choreographies vary in their characteristics, in ways that affect the incidence of oddities and breaches across settings. I theorize four such characteristics: Choreographical fluidity, ordinary accountability, directorial sensegiving, and material scene-setting. I then close by discussing implications for institutional theory and future research. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Macro-institutional theories are good at explaining why organizations adopt practices whose efficacy is dubious by appealing to the power of their legitimizing and symbolic properties. Yet these theories are less able to explain how adoption happens and why practices of accounting and auditing persist and amplify, despite being objects of critique. This article addresses this puzzle by supplementing macro-institutional explanations of the audit society with a micro-foundational analysis grounded in a process model. The model theorizes the humble notion of the audit trail as a process that not only produces auditable accounts but is also a logic that is formative of organizational actors’ dispositions to reproduce those accounts. The analysis contributes to debates about organizational micro-processes and micro-foundations by proposing that this logic of the audit trail is strongly performative of the conditions of its own reproduction and expansion. In explaining the persistence and amplification of the audit society, the model also shows how accounting and auditing are not inherently value-subverting and may be value-enhancing. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

This work further suggests that people who have been mistreated can grow and experience positive outcomes from traumatic experiences. We integrate theory on traumatic events, the self-concept, appraisal, and coping to develop a process model about the effects of abusive supervision after it has ended. According to our model, the more employees experience abusive supervision as extraordinary, uncontrollable, and overwhelming, the more likely they are to experience changes to the content of their self-concept, which leads to posttraumatic stress (PTS), a state characterized by alternating states of intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal. We propose that having a complex selfconcept protects abused employees from experiencing PTS by diluting and segregating the impact of past abusive supervision. We also identify differences in cognitive processing regarding employees' experience and appraisal of memories associated with past abuse, and argue that these differences determine whether abused employees recover from PTS, endure prolonged PTS, or experience posttraumatic growth (PTG). Finally, we explain how prolonged PTS and PTG resulting from past abusive supervision affect employees' personal and professional lives in the future, thereby revealing a unique set of consequences for the abusive supervision literature. © Academy of Management Review 2020.","",""

The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders.

I simultaneously examine three stylized forms: Public bureaucracy, involving both public sponsorship and public management; public-private partnerships, with a mix of public sponsorship and private management; and social enterprise, with both private management and sponsorship from impactoriented investors. Although the extant literature has underscored a supply-side hazard emerging when actors try to appropriate rents by economizing on noncontractible social dimensions, I also examine the implications of a demand-side tradeoff emerging when providers are tempted to focus on more profitable customer segments and exclude more vulnerable populations. In my framework, distinct organizational forms change the managerial incentives to provide inclusive, high-quality social services based on three main factors: The relative attractiveness of beneficiary segments, their cost structure, and the extent of fixed costs to implement and operate services. I thus offer a testable theory of organizational alignment, identifying the comparative merits of each form based on how they incentivize public and private actors to create and appropriate social value. © 2020 Academy of Management Review.","",""

This is perplexing given that entrepreneurial action is oriented toward novel creations that unfold under conditions of uncertainty, where temporal concerns may be especially impactful. This paper addresses this lacuna by introducing a framework that articulates the key dimensions of time that entrepreneurs consider. We advance that entrepreneurs organize and shape their visions of entrepreneurial endeavors by constructing time-calibrated internal narratives. These narratives address the dimensions of initialization (i.e., timing of action), pace (i.e., time from action to outcome), and chronology (i.e., sequencing of action). Our theoretical model identifies how variations in these dimensions affect the likelihood of entrepreneurial action. We further specify that narrative vigilance and externalization moderate these effects, with hyper levels of each reversing the relationships. Together, our conceptualizations reveal how entrepreneurial time calibrations are themselves an essential lever for action. We discuss the implications of these insights for a range of perspectives on the ways entrepreneurs engage their craft, with special attention to dynamic process-centered frameworks. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

In this paper, we seek to reconceptualize the necessity entrepreneurship construct by drawing on a motivational theory of necessity to predict how variation in founders’ basic needs influences the entrepreneurial process, conditional on the level of their human capital endowments, the environmental context in which they are embedded, and the presence of supportive institutional levers.

Most current career theories focus on how career decisions are enacted and, in the end, realized. However, empirical evidence shows that people often do not realize their career desires. For instance, many people who have turnover intentions stay in their organization, and people with entrepreneurial desires often turn out to be wantrepreneurs (i.e., people who talk about starting a business without doing anything to realize it). Although structural barriers sometimes inhibit people from realizing a desired change, there are also indications that people often do not even mobilize into action, or give up prematurely, when trying to realize their career desires. This explanation, however, has rarely been acknowledged, let alone studied. To address this gap, we develop a theory of career inaction. We define career inaction as the failure to act sufficiently over some period of time on a desired change in one's career. Building on the psychology of doing nothing, we explain why and when career inaction may occur and how it can impact people, even in the longer run.

Whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. Overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of AI in organizations.

Integrating prior research on generativity and CEO succession, we identify two key orthogonal dimensions of CEO generativity: (a) the CEO's degree of commitment to developing the next generation of company leadership and (b) the CEO's degree of need to control the succession process and outcome. A given CEO's place on these two dimensions constitutes their overall ""generativity mindset,"" which we conceptualize as a relatively stable motivational orientation that stems from the CEO's disposition and accumulated life experiences. From these dimensions, we identify four archetypes: The generative, hypergenerative, hypo-generative, and anti-generative CEO.

Yet, CEOs are increasingly ignoring this dictum and taking public stances on socially contentious issues. We address this relatively unexplored but important phenomenon by developing a theory of CEO sociopolitical activism. Our stakeholder alignment model posits that CEO activism stems foremost from a CEO’s personal values but is facilitated (or suppressed) by the CEO’s expectation of support from stakeholders, particularly employees and customers. We also highlight the importance of CEO power, celebrity, and narcissism in influencing whether, and how vividly, the CEO’s values manifest in activism. Then, following an episode of CEO activism, stakeholders psychologically respond to the leader’s action. Those who were ex ante predisposed toward the CEO’s public stance will feel pride in their affiliation with the company, and will consequently experience heightened identification with the firm and with the CEO’s stance. Stakeholders who were ex ante averse to the CEO’s stance will experience diminished identification with the firm, and their oppositional stance will be further cemented.

Drawing fromcategorization theory, we argue that the movement from data to theory is an active process in which researchers choose between multiple moves that help themto make sense of their data. In addition, we develop a framework of the main moves that people use when they categorize data and demonstrate that evidence of these moves can also be found in past qualitative scholarship. Our framework emphasizes that, if we are not sufficiently reflexive and explicit about the active analytical processes that generate theoretical insights, we cannot be transparent and, thus, rigorous about how we analyze data.

More specifically, we present a multi-stage theory of ethical accounting (TEA) that describes how this differential access to information, specifically about the self versus others, can create an interrelated series of cognitive distortions in how people account for the same unethical behavior. TEA posits that such distortions can allow people to believe they are being fair and consistent when appraising the morality of the self and others while actually being inconsistent in how they do so, and describes how this can ultimately make it harder to address not only hypocrisy but also unethical behavior more broadly in organizations. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Overcoming this difficulty will require responses suited to the conditions ofmanagement research. To that end, we reviewthe philosophical literature on the epistemology of testimony,which describes the conditions under which common empirical claims provide a basis for knowledge, and we evaluate ways these conditions can be verified.We conclude that inmany areas ofmanagement research, popular proposals such as preregistration and replication are unlikely to be effective.We suggest revised modes of testimony that could help researchers and readers to avoid some barriers to learning from testimony.

Therefore, in this paper, we develop a process theory of the socially situated emergence of moral leadership and its development into a broader movement affecting moral systems within and across formal organizations. We theorize the pathways through which moral leadership emerges; the triggers that bring about moral awareness and the moral courage to offer an alternative moral stance toward an issue, and leaders' ability to deftly connect followers and their moral convictions into a broader movement, such that a moral system changes from within. With our process theory, we bridge between micro and macro levels of analysis, and highlight the crucial ability of leaders to be both principled and pragmatically savvy, and thus capable of bridging between their own moral convictions and those of others in order to develop a common and mutually binding ground toward change. © Academy of Management Review 2020.","",""

However, commitments are still largely studied in isolation or in one-off combinations, and current commitment theory does not account for the dynamic interrelationships among multiple commitments. To address this deficiency, we propose commitment system theory (CST). We draw upon general systems theory to depict commitment systems as malleable and interconnected structures. We present the defining elements by which commitment systems can be described and studied, develop theory regarding when commitment systems will diverge or converge over time, and discuss how taking a systems perspective resolves discrepant findings in the literature. Specifically, CST advances the commitment literature by offering an alternative perspective to explain how commitments behave as parts of larger systems. Specifically, CST accounts for (a) why and when commitments have synergistic, neutral, or conflicting interrelationships; and (b) the temporal dynamics of those interrelationships as commitments develop, change, and dissipate. CST thus offers a new vocabulary and conceptual toolkit for understanding the evolving structure of commitments to multiple targets.

Nearly two decades later, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see the effects of changing political power on the American Dream—and, in turn, on the perceived purpose of business organizations and individuals’ experience of the meaning of work. To study these phenomena through a diversity of perspectives, we examine four post-9/ 11 stories in which business is a central force: Art Spiegelman’s 2004 graphic comix storyboard, In the Shadow of No Towers; Mohsin Hamid’s 2007 novel, The Reluctant Fundamentalist; Irene Sankoff and David Hein’s 2015 musical, Come from Away; and Laila Lalami’s 2019 novel, The Other Americans. These stories encourage us to reflect on the causes and consequences of 9/11 and to consider how systems of political power, economic organizations, and work have changed and should change. They also challenge management scholars to think about what this means for our own scholarship, teaching, and practice—in particular, who capitalism is for, what business is for, and why we work.

Yet, little research has examined individual cognition, affect, and behavior in response to the ""pull"" of entrainment to an organization's temporal structure. In this paper, we develop theory highlighting how individuals use temporal schemata-cognitive frameworks about time-to interpret and respond to temporal cues provided by an organization's temporal structure (i.e., ""push back""). We propose that individuals can automatically or deliberately entrain, actively or passively resist, or create additional temporal structure. By identifying how individuals compare temporal cues against their temporal schemata within a situation, we develop a temporal cognitive-affective processing model to explain how individuals navigate the tension between their individualized view of time and social pressures for coordination. This model emphasizes the underdeveloped individual-level aspects of entrainment and contributes to future research by demonstrating that, contrary to prior research findings, (a) entrainment varies in degree and type, (b) entrainment (or lack thereof) is both cognitive and affective, and (c) entrainment may not be sustained. © 2021 Academy of Management.

Despite the extensive study of work design, the scope and effects of employees' contact with nature have rarely been considered as a meaningful element of the work context. This is an important oversight, given the significance of the biophilia hypothesis, which proposes that humans have an innate desire to connect with nature, and research showing that individuals benefit from contact with nature. Moreover, prior research has largely focused on the positive effects of nature on individuals, and it is unclear whether these effects will remain positive in organizational settings, or whether biophilia at work can sometimes have negative implications. In this paper, we draw on the biophilic design literature to identify contextual characteristics of work design that influence the extent to which employees have contact with nature while on the job. In addition, we describe how contact with nature affects employees' cognitive, emotional, prosocial, and physical reserves of energy.

Research on interfirm networks has conceptualized network change as being driven almost exclusively by modifications in ties (additions and deletions). Yet firms frequently engage in actions that modify the ownership and existence of nodes: acquisitions “collapse” nodes, divestitures “split” nodes, industry entries “create” nodes, and industry exits “remove” nodes. The literatures on corporate strategy and organizational networks have mostly overlooked the implications of node-modifying actions for network change. We explore those implications in three ways. First, we systematically analyze and compare the network-changing properties of the six node- and tie-changing actions. Second, we link the strategic objectives that boundedly rational firms pursue through each corporate action to changes in their ego network positions (openness, closure, and status). Third, we consider how these local network changes set off ripple effects that create externalities for the networks of the focal firm’s immediate partners and that modify the structure of the global network. The result is a much more expansive understanding of the mechanisms driving structural change in interfirm networks. © Academy of Management Review","",""

While these ""good ethics pays"" or ""win-win"" approaches have garnered significant attention in both academic and practitioner-oriented arenas, empirical vetting of such strategies has lagged far behind their widespread diffusion. Even more problematic, careful examination of the scholarly work in this area reveals fundamentally different presuppositions about what it means to claim ""good ethics pays"" and how this claim relates to managerial activity. This article maps out the various good ethics pays arguments across the managerial discipline to uncover three competing, divergent, and at times incommensurable frameworks. This mapping is followed by examining how disciplinary commitments to parsimonious explanations and stable behavioral patterns utilize good ethics pays frameworks to effectively minimize the moral agency ofmanagerial actors. This article concludes by laying out a new research approach that foregrounds the varied contingency of how ethics and economics intersect. The approach moves beyond ungrounded confidence in a grand theory of win-win convergences to instead investigate the provisional and contextual social mechanisms that reward or sanction ethical action. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We introduce the Masculinity Effects in Negotiations model to explain men’s negotiation behaviors and outcomes. According to the model, men perceive negotiating as an activity through which they can signal their masculinity and pursue social status, but they also recognize that their masculinity might be questioned and that they might lose social status. As a result, men can become enthusiastic but also anxious about negotiations and these emotions lead them to display a number of agentic negotiation behaviors to protect and underscore their masculinity and their social status. Depending on their own and their counterpart’s behavior, men then either succeed or fail to obtain favorable economic negotiation outcomes, which influence their subsequent emotions (e.g., pride or shame).

We analyze the deployment of patented technology employing either competition or collaboration modes, or both together (i.e., coopetition), as well as switching among them across demand states or over time, or delaying these choices until more information is available. We thus view a patent as a bundle of real options that enables a firm to manage not only the classic tension between commitment and flexibility but also the tension between competition and cooperation. We develop theory and propositions to predict which of these patent deployment modes will be chosen by an innovator facing an established firm as a function of the strength of the technology, market or bargaining power, and other market conditions, particularly the level and volatility of market demand.

While consensus is growing on the definition of organizational paradox as persistent contradictions between interdependent elements, its ontology continues to be contested. The inherent and constitutive views of organizational paradox adopt competing ontological positions on organizational paradox as existing irrespective of, or only through, organizational members' discursive construction. In this paper, we develop a novel ontological approach that conceptualizes paradox as both inherent and socially constructed, thereby highlighting the paradoxical nature of the ontology of paradox. To develop our approach, we mobilize the ontological underpinnings of quantum mechanics and reconceptualize the ontology of paradox with regard to its latency, salience, and persistence. As per our quantum approach, paradox is coconstituted by latency-the inherent but indeterminate potential of paradox; salience-the concrete enactment of paradox in a sociomaterial context; and persistence-the repeated enactment of paradox in similar sociomaterial contexts. Thereby, we explain how inherent material factors and socially constructed meaning coconstitute paradox. Our quantum approach to the ontology of paradox transcends the standoff between the inherent and constitutive views and provides a theoretical account for the dual nature of paradox as being both inherent and socially constructed. © 2021 Academy of Management.

The first question is as follows: “Given that individuals have no rational, profit-maximizing reason to begin the process of forming an opportunity under conditions of Knightian uncertainty, why do they do so?” The present paper suggests that entrepreneurial curiosity sparks the creation of opportunities. The second question is this: “In later stages of the opportunity formation, how do individuals create the many possible ways to exploit this opportunity?” Here, this papers posits that creating entrepreneurial opportunities under Knightian uncertainty includes the cognitive generative processes of entrepreneurs.

We argue that strategists adopt two distinct strategic postures when crafting strategies in uncertain markets—shaping and adapting—and theorize their constituent elements: intentions, epistemologies, and enactment strategies.

Micro management scholarship has focused on employee job performance behavior and rarely considered the extent to which value created by employees is actually appropriable by the employing firm. Simultaneously,macro management scholarship has focused on firm value creation and capture without explicit attention to the nature and types of individual job performance or collective performance processes within firms. Thus, we conceptually integrate strategic management theory on value creation and capture with psychological theory on employee job performance and collective performance, to propose a theory that explains howand when firms will capture value from employee job performance. Heterogeneity in value created and captured by employee job performance is affected by two broad factors: Individual (e.g., the type of job performance) and market (e.g., labor market constraints). These insights lead to theoretical and practical advances for both micro and macro fields, suggesting that the relationship between employee job performance and firm value capture is more conditional and context-specific than previously recognized. © 2021 Academy of Management.

These works identify common criticisms of capitalist systems related to an excessive corporate emphasis on economic value (i.e., shareholder primacy), their neglect of societal externalities, and their tendency toward increasing market concentration. They also eschew simplistic arguments based on the notion that companies can ""do well by doing good,"" which fail to recognize important trade-offs in decisions involving multiple stakeholder interests. The books, however, diverge in their solutions, ranging from suggestions to tackle these trade-offs with the incorporation of stakeholder interests to more profound changes in the structure of economic exchange. Building on the insights of these books and identifying some missing issues, I then suggest four avenues for future research: (a) the analysis of pro-social shareholder preferences, (b) a thorough analysis of comparative organizational forms, (c) the detailed assessment of the costs of organization, and (d) the reconceptualization of the notion of value creation toward a higher emphasis on social justice. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We believe that this is because they engage in a form of nonresponse that we designate as strategic forbearance, a phenomenon that has been mostly neglected by scholars of competitive dynamics. We view such forbearance as a critical component of competitive strategy—an attempt to situate responses to attacks within a more complex and nuanced strategic, organizational, and environmental context. Forbearance, we argue, represents managers’ mindful attempts to transcend reflexive responses by expanding the range of considerations beyond (a) an attacker to other stakeholders and rivals, (b) the immediate attack to its historical setting and long-term relational implications, and (c) unitary tactics to those concerning global strategic coherence and adaptation. We formally define and tentatively operationalize strategic forbearance before deriving propositions concerning its five general transcending drivers. Ultimately, we believe that the study of forbearance can bring scholars of competitive dynamics closer to the heart of reflective competitive strategy.

Despite existing research on team effectiveness, we know very little about what enables teams to “bounce back” from adversity-induced setbacks. This is problematic because such negative experiences can lead to team failure. In response to this, we draw from conservation of resources theory to develop a comprehensive theoretical model of work team resilience that clarifies the meaning of the work team resilience construct and illustrates both how it emerges in an interdependent fashion via critical team-level resources and how it unfolds over time through team processes. In doing so we highlight the compelling phenomenon in which energetic, interdependent team member activity leads to goal attainment during challenging circumstances. We further theorize that work team resilience strengthens over time through mastery experiences, functioning as a self-reinforcing gain spiral. We contribute to the management literature by highlighting the key antecedents and processes that distinguish resilient work teams from brittle ones, including those teams that are merely adaptable and those that excel in stable environments but falter under adversity. We inform practitioners about how to build and sustain resilient work teams. © Academy of Management Review 2020","",""

As transient work crosses both organizational and professional boundaries, individuals may seek stability in their self-definitions by identifying with core, repeated elements of the temporary relationships that they form again and again in their work lives-a notion we capture in proposing the concept of ""professional network identification"" (PNI). Developing the concept of PNI, we describe how it establishes coherence in self-conception in an environment of weakening traditional identifications. Relative to traditional forms of work identification, PNI leads individuals to engage with and disengage from relationships more swiftly, to prefer transient over more stable work relationships, and to be less constrained by the norms, values, and interests of a specific organization, profession, or relationship at work. This benefits individuals and organizations by facilitating productive outcomes in transient knowledge work, including proactive behavior and creativity. Because it reflects a fundamental untethering of individuals and organizations, PNI may also motivate individual behaviors that may be difficult for employers to anticipate or understand, particularly where it concerns the management of knowledge resources. © 2021 Academy of Management.

However, tensions exist in the literature surrounding the idiosyncratic, tacit, and, hence, inimitable nature of dynamic capabilities.

In this article we argue that a firm’s dynamic capabilities rest on a tacitly shared substrate of sensitivities and predispositions that precede cognitive representation. These sensitivities and predispositions are typically transmitted and shared unconsciously through social practices rather than through formal instruction. They provide the microfoundational substrate of capabilities that enable a firm to effectively respond by orienting its members toward external environmental challenges in a manner unique to the firm’s history. Such sensitivities and predispositions provide an organizational modus operandi for members to reconfigure capabilities and resources and to capitalize on new opportunities. © 2020 Academy of Management.

However, we presently have little understanding about the organizational factors and psychological mechanisms that explain why employees become vigilantes.

However, the self-incentivizing nature of property rights engenders three control hazards-those related to reliability, egocentrism, and succession- that threaten stakeholder welfare. In order to mitigate these hazards, owner-managersmust establish credible governance. We discuss four governancemechanisms often found in owner-managed firms: Commitment to social control, delegation of authority to managers, submission to the hierarchy of a board, and partial transfer of ownership. Although these mechanisms help mitigate control hazards, they also constrain the valuegenerating benefits of owner-management. Owner-managers thus face control dilemmas when determining howto best govern their firms. Our theory sheds new light on the relationship between property rights and value creation, and lays a foundation for exploring the benefits and liabilities of owner-management. © 2021 Academy of Management.

However, current thinking on complementary assets operates with an unstated boundary condition—that relevant assets and asset configurations are relatively well known to the innovating firm. This assumption is applicable under conditions of “risk,” wherein decision-makers can know outcomes and probabilities. It is less clear, though, how current insights apply under conditions of “Knightian uncertainty,” in which neither outcomes nor probabilities are knowable. The purpose of this paper is to advance a complementary assets theory that accounts for conditions of Knightian uncertainty, thus aligning theory with the contemporary realities surrounding innovating firms. This article highlights an important intertemporal trade-off that existing literature ignores—without accounting for Knightian uncertainty, firms may unknowingly direct complementary assets in ways that favor current value appropriation at the expense of future value creation. We discuss theoretical implications for research on the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities and opportunities for future research on complementary asset configurations across geographic boundaries and across organizations in innovation ecosystems.

Conversely, research on learning and social control has considered opacity-understood as a lack of transparency-to be conducive to substantive CSR adoption. These opposing viewpoints highlight a fundamental tension: Is transparency good or bad for substantive adoption? This paper resolves this tension by asking an alternative question: When is transparency good or bad, and why? We advance a dynamic perspective that conceives transparency and opacity as transitory phenomena, and we specify the boundary conditions for which either enduring or transitory forms of transparency and opacity further the substantive adoption of CSR. Our analyses reveal that, for circumstances under which the motivation of ceremonial adoption is hypocritical (rather than opportunistic) and where both substantive adoption and practice abandonment are difficult, the former can be maximized by first allowing organizations to adopt a CSR practice ceremonially under opacity (""bait""), and then prompting ceremonial adopters to become substantive adopters through a shift to transparency (""switch"").

Here, we take on this issue, distinguishing mitigable ignorance of pertinent but knowable information (i.e., “epistemic uncertainty”) from immitigable indeterminacy (i.e., “aleatory uncertainty”). We review the current state of the debate on the existence of free will, because the acceptance or rejection of conscious agents as a true first cause has fundamental implications. A critical examination of the arguments for and against the free will hypothesis land us on the side of voluntarism, which implies immitigable indeterminacy (but not complete unpredictability) wherever conscious actors are involved.

But how might the structure of interdependencies shape the innovativeness of firms in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we develop a search-based theory that considers a multiplicity of upstream and downstream firms simultaneously innovating in an ecosystem, contributing to and searching for novel combinations of components. We conceptualize two types of structural interdependencies between firms in an ecosystem based on the structure of technological interactions between components and the structure of input-output flows between stages of production. Using a simulation model, we show that downstream firms can benefit from mixing and matching components produced upstream, whereas upstream firms can benefit from optimizing their search more narrowly around their focal components. Importantly, these benefits that accrue to upstream and downstream firms are significantly impacted by the structure of technological and flow interdependencies in the ecosystem. © Academy of Management Review 2020.","",""

Viewing business school research in the context of these quadrants, it becomes clear that all four quadrants are so closely linked that research in each informs and inspires research in the others. It is therefore critical that business schools promote research in all four quadrants. Likewise, researchers in business schools should appreciate the importance of research in every quadrant and the scope of cross-pollination between them, or they will fail to realize their full potential. In order to get the most out of every quadrant, business schools must recruit professors who pursue research in a range of disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, and economics, and those who focus on the practical use of knowledge.

We present MOSAIC—a model of stereotyping through associated and intersectional categories—to explain how stereotypes from various demographic categories influence the expectations for, and visibility of, employees. MOSAIC makes sense of outcomes previously seen as anomalies and theoretically reconciles patterns of advantage and disadvantage that individuals experience (e.g., why Black women face less backlash for assertiveness but are less likely to be promoted and earn considerably less than White women). Extending intersectionality research to management scholarship, we introduce the concept of an associated demographic category, which we define as a category that bears an implicit cognitive link to another demographic category. MOSAIC proposes that perceivers integrate the stereotypes from individuals’ foundational, intersectional, and associated categories and that this integration generates amplified or diluted stereotypes. This integrated stereotype content then yields proscriptive, prescriptive, and visibility templates and expectations that explain how bias emerges. As such, MOSAIC advances microlevel explanations for how and why particular configurations of demographic categories yield predictable patterns of stereotypes, expectations, and evaluations.

However, managers spend much of their time avoiding such extreme events rather than responding to them, and we know very little about how reputation influences managers’ everyday decisions. We address this issue by offering a theoretical framework to explain how reputation shapes managers’ perceptions of their discretion as they attempt to navigate stakeholder expectations. In doing so we clarify and elaborate two forms of reputation—those rooted in a firm’s behaviors and those rooted in a firm’s outcomes—as well as two forms of discretion—managers’ perceived latitude of actions and their perceived latitude of objectives—thereby synthesizing and extending recent work in both the reputation literature and discretion literature. The intersection of social evaluations and managerial decisions remains an exciting and fruitful avenue of research, and we aim to illustrate how the insights from the meticulous efforts of scholars in both fields would benefit from further cross-pollination. © Academy of Management Review","",""

The dimension of compatibility considers workers’ subjective experiences of the fit between their personhood and modes of control, where alignment can inspire fulfillment and misalignment can prompt suffering. The dimension of coherence considers workers’ perception of the consistency between modes, which can be fragmented or unified to reinforce organizationally prescribed goals and processes. The framework yields four ideal types of interaction between modes of control: complementing, coexisting, competing, and clashing.

With a focus on highly publicized instances of violence enacted against Black Americans by law enforcement as the mega-threat under study, we propose that the coupling of intrapsychic and group-level processes that occur as a result of a mega-threat leads minorities to experience identity fusion that involves the blurring of organizational and social identities through both affective and cognitive pathways. We further propose that identity fusion compels minorities to engage in task and relational positively deviant behaviors: progroup voice and relational bridging.

We propose that majority and minority employees differ in terms of network utilization, which is the extent to which individuals utilize their existing network ties. We theorize why and how network utilization processes-career and work utilization of network ties-can explain employees' (i.e., actors) influence on their leadership advancement. We also explicate the process through which actors' direct and indirect network connections (i.e., alters) contribute to such outcomes through both career-supporting utilization and work-supporting utilization with actors.

Drawing on theories of close relationships, social exchange, and boundary management, we present a theoretical framework highlighting how four defining features of friendship (informality, voluntariness, communal norms, and socioemotional goals) are in tension with four fundamental elements of organizational life (formal roles, involuntary constraints, exchange norms, and instrumental goals). We also highlight how mutual self-disclosure and perceived similarity develop and deepen friendships but also lead to downsides for individuals, groups, and organizations. We articulate how specific features of a focal friendship clique (e.g., closeness, maturity, and status of members) may amplify or buffer negative aspects and how social media affect friendship formation and tensions.

So far, management scholars have highlighted mostly positive effects of CEOs' empathy in the emotionally charged context of crises. We combine the emerging critical perspective on empathy with research on upper echelons and crisis management to provide a more balanced portrayal of the influence of CEO empathy on crisis management. Specifically, we argue that, on the one hand, highly empathic CEOs will recognize warning signs more quickly, have access to more crisis-related information, gain greater stakeholder appreciation via displays of compassion, and be more committed to healing the organization's relational system. On the other hand, they also may be more predisposed to false alarms, more biased in processing crisis-related information, overinclined toward apologetic sensegiving, and less committed to repairing the organization's operational system. Ultimately, we propose that CEOs' empathy influences their effectiveness in the various tasks of crisis management in an inverted U-shaped pattern. Our theory offers an upper echelons view of organizational crises, particularly by illuminating the roles of empathy and emotions in executives' crisis management.

Based on appraisal theories of emotion, we propose a process model of schadenfreude emergence and development: initial schadenfreude occurs when observers appraise mistreatment incidents as relevant and conducive to their goals; this initial feeling evolves into either righteous or ambivalent schadenfreude, depending on observers’ secondary appraisals of victim deservingness.

Blame shifting enables an organization to limit its financial responsibility and contain potential reputational damage after failure.

Beliefs about the world come, in large part, from the world itself.

For each prime we also provide four examples of objective contextual features-one each at the family, organizational, community, and societal level of analysis-that make the relevant prime salient and shape the associated work-life ideology. Finally, we propose that work-life ideologies are consequential because they affect individuals' work-life preferences and how they make sense of demands and resources, which, in turn, affect work-life conflict and enrichment.

Largely absent in prior perspectives is a consideration of the relational dynamics and underlying behaviors by which individuals learn vicariously through interacting with others, rendering these perspectives less useful for understanding learning in the increasingly interconnected work of modern organizations. Integrating theories of experiential learning and symbolic interactionism, I offer a theoretical model of coactive vicarious learning, a relational process of coconstructed, interpersonal learning that occurs through discursive interactions between individuals at work. I explore how these interactions involve the mutual processing of another's experience; are influenced by characteristics of the individual, relational, and structural context in organizations; and lead to growth not only in individuals' knowledge but also in their individual and relational capacity for learning and applying knowledge.

Even as mindfulness becomes increasingly prevalent, we lack clarity on three key questions: What is mindfulness? How does mindfulness training operate? And why might mindfulness matter for organizations? In this article I introduce a new conceptualization of mindfulness, which I call metacognitive practice. Metacognitive practice is so named because it blends insights from metacognition and practice theory to answer these three key questions. First, when seen as metacognitive practice, mindfulness is not a single mode of information processing to be applied in all situations. Instead, it is a metacognitive process by which people adjust their mode of information processing to their current situation. Second, this metacognitive process is made possible by three specific beliefs that supersede lay beliefs about human information processing. A core function of mindfulness training, thus, is to provide a context that cultivates these beliefs. Third, when these beliefs are put into practice, people gain greater agency in how they respond to situations. This matters for organizations, because as people interrelate their individual actions into a collective response, metacognitive practice can get embedded in amplifying processes that transform the organization—or in fragmentation processes that threaten it. © Academy of Management Review","",""

It is timely, then, that human resource management scholars and practitioners are adopting an increasingly relational view of human resources. Whereas this burgeoning stream of research predominantly positions relationships as pathways for the transmission of resources, we shift attention by spotlighting that the interplay between human resource practices and informal relationships perforates deeper than resource flows; it also influences how individuals view and define themselves in the context of their dyadic and collective relationships. Moreover, because human resource practices routinely involve human capital movement into, within, and out of the organization, these practices have implications for the network architecture of organizations. We integrate the social network perspective with the theory of relational identity to present a relational theory of human resource management that informs how modifications to internal social structures stimulated by human resource practices can influence individual outcomes by transforming individuals' self-concepts as relationships are gained, altered, and lost. © 2018 Academy of Management Review.","",""

I argue that current explanations in the neoinstitutional literature suffer from two problems. The first is a rational-cognitive bias coupled with an overemphasis on the role of actors. The second is the unexplained source of autonomy and externality in the definition of institutions. I propose to solve these problems by introducing an aisthetic perspective on institutional endurance. This perspective should not replace but, rather, supplement existing models and theories. The aisthetic perspective conceptualizes institutions as social processes with aisthetic qualities, such as harmony and rhythm. These aisthetic qualities can be felt and perceived, resulting in a positive or negative experience of the institution that, in turn, promotes its reproduction (or not). © Academy of Management Review","",""

We develop theory to explain how executives process information by integrating construal-level theory with upper echelons theory. Construal-level theory describes how the same event can be interpreted in different ways, thus influencing the type of information people pay attention to, how they process that information, and their resulting decisions and actions. Our theoretical framework explores the dynamic nature of construal levels by developing two new constructs: construal shifts and construal flexibility. In doing so we draw on self-regulation research to detail how executives can develop the capacity to modify how they process information to best meet changing situational demands. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to the acquisition context and demonstrate the vital role played by construal shifts and flexibility for executives attempting to manage complex strategic actions. The end result is a framework that executives can use to effectively navigate the challenging acquisition process. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

This article makes three contributions to the management literature. First, it explores how jealousy develops within the workplace through examining specific relational characteristics of the actortarget exchange, rival characteristics, and the moderating effects of the organizational environment that can influence the emergence of jealousy. It therefore opens new venues for research by explaining how jealousy emerges based on individual, contextual, and core psychological mechanisms. Second, it expands research on regulatory focus theory by exploring the role of regulatory focus in the interpersonal domain. Third, based on the alignment of jealousy to a prevention regulatory focus and benign envy to a promotion regulatory focus, it illustrates how these two emotions can be conceptualized as distinct constructs with distinct implications for workplace relationships. © 2020 Academy of Management.

To advance understanding of the effects of diversity initiatives, I develop a typological theory of their unintended consequences. I propose that diversity initiatives produce four unintended consequence types: backfire (negative diversity goal progress), negative spillover (undesirable effects on outcomes other than diversity goal progress), positive spillover (desirable effects on outcomes other than diversity goal progress), and false progress (improved diversity metrics without true diversity goal progress). I then adopt a signaling perspective to identify mechanisms underlying the four types and the diversity practices most likely to produce them. The resulting typological theory not only provides an organizing framework for prior work on the unintended consequences of diversity initiatives but also specifies new unintended consequence types, identifies signals that serve as their root causes, and suggests that the unintended consequences of diversity initiatives are interrelated and multidetermined. Collectively, these contributions advance a broader conceptualization of diversity initiative effectiveness, in which a wider range of mechanisms and outcomes, as well as the relationships among them, must be considered. More comprehensive theory regarding their unintended consequences provides a foundation for increasing diversity initiative effectiveness.

In our framework we integrate upper echelons theory with regulatory focus theory to examine the relationship of promotion and prevention focus with the timing, pace, and nature of retiring executive role separation, transition, and reincorporation. We then construct four CEO ideal types-icon, custodian, balancer, and chairwarmer-which are based on configurations of the orthogonal dimensions of promotion and prevention focus, and by following each type along a unique pathway, we show how an integrated view of these dimensions leads to nuanced predictions. Finally, we highlight the dynamic nature of our model by investigating the role of two salient contextual factors-CEO age and past achievements-and show how they can alter retirement pathways.

We argue that the effects of individual-level diversity (personal range) and team-level diversity may not be independent. Specifically, we propose that their interaction may be the missing link explaining how and why diversity impacts team outcomes. We distinguish between tasks with high and low levels of interdependence and suggest that for some sources of diversity, individual- and team-level diversity are complementary, whereas for others they are substitutes.

I build a conceptual model encompassing both the established view of identity adaptation following role change and a new perspective of identity stability and “lingering identities,” the expression I use to describe identities that are premised on former roles that persist significantly beyond role change. I show how identity adaptation-the cognitive restructuring we have long associated with role change and successful socialization-is not the default response to the ongoing uncertainty that many role changes engender. Rather, ongoing uncertainty triggers cognitive continuity responses that, when sustained, support identity lingering. I examine when lingering identities might inspire role crafting, neutral identification, or disidentification in new roles and when these outcomes might be functional or maladaptive for individuals and organizations. Finally, I discuss the implications lingering identities have for research and for managing people as they move within, between, and beyond today's workplaces. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Yet each team member may perceive or experience varying degrees of conflict with other team members, suggesting that individuals may have unique conflict experiences. Moreover, individual members may interact differently with each other on task assignments, which leads to a complex interplay between task flow and conflict relations. Therefore, we propose a more fine-grained theoretical conception of conflict dynamics as multiplex network configurations in conjunction with task flow interdependencies. Dyadic tie configurations of conflict and task relations generate different interpersonal dynamics, which, in turn, affect overall task effectiveness. As a way of bypassing dysfunctional conflict relations, members may pursue workarounds, which result in deviations from optimal task flow patterns and have implications for overall team effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of the network conceptualization with three illustrative network configurations that may arise from different combinations of dyadic patterns and conclude with theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of adopting this multiplex network conception. © 2020 Academy of Management.

In existing scholarship there is the implicit assumption that organizations experience and respond holistically to acute forms of adversity. We challenge this assumption by theorizing about how adversity can create differential strain, affecting parts of an organization rather than the whole. We argue that relations among those parts fundamentally shape organizational resilience. We develop a theoretical model that maps how the differentiated emergence of strain in focal parts of an organization triggers the movements of adjoining parts to provide or withhold resources necessary for the focal parts to adapt effectively. Drawing on core principles of theories about intergroup relations, we theorize about three specific pathways—integration, disavowal, and reclamation—by which responses of adjoining parts to focal part strain shape organizational resilience. We further theorize about influences on whether and when adjoining parts are likely to select different pathways. The resulting theory reveals how the social processes among parts of organizations influence member responses to adversity and, ultimately, organizational resilience.

The consideration of individuals' emotional origins and destinations during an emotion regulation episode leads to the key tenet that both distance and direction are essential concepts that must be integrated into theory and research on emotion regulation. Accordingly, we reconceptualize emotion regulation as a journey involving the joint interplay of distance, direction, and method of travel. Drawing from the circumplex model of affect, we introduce the concepts of ""emotional distance""and ""emotional direction""to map the discrepancies between the emotion an individual currently feels and the emotion that individual attempts to display via emotion regulation.

Yet as the landscape of work shifts toward digitization of coordination processes, organizations increasingly rely on digitally mediated structured coordination to accomplish work, reducing opportunities for personal interactions. In this article we explore the interplay between employees' work relationships and differently structured coordination mechanisms to theorize about the role of relational coordination in coordination that is becoming increasingly structured owing to digitization. Specifically, we identify four categories of coordination mechanisms by leveraging two distinct components of a coordination mechanism-actor selection and content delivery-and recognizing that either component can be structured or unstructured. This granular categorization of coordination mechanisms allows us to delineate three causal routes by which relational coordination adds value to coordination enactment: Informing actor selection, informing customization of content, and enabling shared interpretation. We complement prior research focusing on how, over time, coordination mechanisms influence the development of relational coordination by theorizing about how relational coordination enables the effective enactment of coordination mechanisms at a point in time.

Opening the black box between LMX differentiation and work behaviors, we draw on social comparison theory to develop a conceptual model of the cross-level implications of LMX differentiation for employee emotions and discretionary behaviors. Since each LMX dyad is nested within the broader workgroup, we incorporate multilevel relationships in our theorizing. Relying on social comparison theory, we theorize that specific instances of resource allocation by leaders function as affective events that trigger social comparison emotions. More specifically, we posit that these affective events trigger an emotion appraisal process that causes relative individual LMX status and justice perceptions to interact as sources of social comparison information, influencing the type of social comparison emotion that emerges, with subsequent effects on interpersonal discretionary behavior. Overall, our social comparison perspective unravels emotional mechanisms that provide one explanation for why LMX differentiation has inconsistent effects on employee work behaviors. © 2020 Academy of Management.

We theorize about how organizational identification can be influenced by an employer's horizontal partnerships with entities such as sports teams or charities. Drawing on insights from the organizational identification literature and marketing literature, we explore how events concerning an organization's horizontal partner become salient to employees, how employees evaluate the implications of the partnership, and how their identification may shift as a result. Surprisingly, our model reveals that partnerships having low congruence may lead to significant positive identification shifts for some individuals, whereas partnerships that are seemingly positive for an organization may result in negative identification shifts. Our theorizing makes two important contributions. First, it introduces the potential of horizontal relationships with other organizations to shape the important work relationship of identification with the focal employing organization. Second, it outlines the processes through which horizontal partners can make a difference in work relationships and sets the stage to better understand how they can strengthen and hinder these relationships, as well as encroach on nonwork life. © 2018 Academy of Management Review.","",""

In this article we introduce the construct “work-family image” as a cross-domain, collective image representing how competent an individual is perceived to be as a parent and a professional by key constituents in both work and life domains. We present a theoretical framework to explicate a process in which work-family image management drives work-family identity adaptation. Specifically, we suggest that work-family image management occurs when work-family norms, derived from societal, organizational, and familial expectations, create image discrepancies that drive impression management behavior. These behaviors, in turn, can create image-identity asymmetries and lead to work-family identity adaptation. We contribute to existing research by highlighting the dynamic interplay between image management and identity adaptation and explain the process by which work-family norms can influence working parents' identities. © Copyright of the Academy of Management.","",""

Questioning the field’s ontological dualism between individualism and societism, we engage with practice theory’s relational ontology and its main conceptual and methodological ideas. From this we develop a practice-based theory of diversity, arguing that practices and their connections, not individuals or discourses, are the unit of analysis to best study and understand the social life of a diverse organization. We apply this theoretical lens to (in)equality through two research examples, showing how the practicing of career mentoring is connected to other inequality-(re)producing practices and how the equal social order of a dance organization is accomplished through the situated practice of mixing. In the discussion we highlight the value of a practice theory for diversity. A practice-based theory of diversity renews the research agenda of diversity studies, forwarding postdualistic forms of theorizing, reconceptualizing diversity practices along the theoretical logic of practice, and conceiving of diversity-related phenomena as the net effect of social order–producing practices.

Our spatial model of work relationships proposes that these elements work through relationship-building mechanisms, such as communication content, face-to-face frequency, communication duration, and identity marking, as well as through relationship-straining mechanisms, such as territoriality and ego depletion, to differentially influence both positive and negative relational ties at work.

Evidence suggests that many people transition from one social class to another over their lifetime, and we do not have a framework for understanding how transitioners experience the workplace or affect their organizations. This omission is consequential because social class is a permeable and intersectional form of diversity, and those who have transitioned between social classes might accumulate cultural tools from different class contexts, making them particularly well suited to understanding and bridging class-based cultural differences within groups. We argue that the range of one’s cultural understanding depends on the class distance one has traveled, the time spent in each class position, and the direction of the transition. We then articulate strategies that transitioners can use to deploy their cultural skills, the factors influencing which strategies they select, and how each strategy involves trade-offs between individual and group outcomes. We conclude by discussing the contributions of this work to the literature on social class and diversity, on culture, and on groups and teams and by suggesting future research directions.

Accordingly, theories account for the ways creativity takes place in teams and groups and the role that social networks play in shaping creativity. However, scholars have largely overlooked the role that dyads play in creative work within organizations. This article builds theory on how intimate co-creation occurs and how it influences the generation of creative ideas over time. I theorize that as people create together, they engage in intimate creative interactions, which under certain circumstances lead to the development of a shared interpersonal boundary (i.e., a sense of ""we""). This shared interpersonal boundary influences creativity by circumscribing a closed, safe space in which the dyad can explore divergent ideas and manage the paradoxes of creativity; it also enables shared scripts and schemas that help the dyad move through creative blocks. By integrating theories of intimate interactions, psychological ownership, and interpersonal relationships, this article advances our understanding of how dyads- specifically, intimate co-creation-influence creative work. © 2020 Academy of Management.

In this article we offer a conceptual framework articulating four types of demographic identities that are misaligned with traditional categorization systems, which are not adequately recognized in existing organizational diversity research or in organizations: intracategorical multiplicity, intracategorical mobility, intracategorical uncertainty, and identities that are acategorical in nature. We build from this framework to theorize that individuals who identify demographically in these nonnormative ways may experience categorization threat, a particular form of identity threat infrequently studied in diversity scholarship, because their needs for identity autonomy and identity legitimacy are likely to be frustrated in organizations whose categorization systems are based on traditional assumptions.

Unfortunately, there has been little theoretical progress in explaining how dual-earner couples navigate worklife shock events, which we define as disruptive, novel, and critical events that require investment of a couple's resources. Drawing from identity and sensemaking theories, we develop a theory of work-life shock events to explain how dual-earner couples perceive and respond to these events. We theorize that partners initially make sense of the event as individuals and then engage in couple-level sensemaking. We argue that each individual's shock intensity perceptions are shaped by the shock event's characteristics and the identity factors of role salience hierarchy and future self. A subsequent couplelevel process of sensemaking ensues, influenced by the salience of the originating domain and partner role, as well as relational identity factors. Couple-level shock intensity perceptions result in the couple's decision regarding resource investment in the shock event's originating domain.

Rather than viewing declining usage or failed emergence as different processes, we argue that they are two aspects of the single problem of understanding what makes a category viable. Focusing on the coherence of the items included in a category and how distinct they are compared to items in other categories, we develop the concept of category viability and argue that viable categories are those found useful for sensemaking, analysis, and coordination because they balance both coherence and distinctiveness to fall within what we call a zone of viability. To illustrate how category viability helps explain both change and continuity of categories, we also offer a framework to describe the process by which categories move in or out of the zone of viability with deliberate actions or with shifting circumstances that change their members or positions relative to other categories. © 2020 Academy of Management.

We argue that such polity imprints shape how different organizational groups construe their conflicting interests in relation to new logics, how they mobilize for and against changes emanating from these logics, and how the outcomes of group conflict become stabilized. To develop this argument, we identify four ideal types of organizational polities, based on differences in the centralization of authority and the unity of organizational elites. Each ideal type gives rise to a characteristic pattern of how organizations process the advent of new logics. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of conceptualizing organizations as open polities—political entities that interact with their external environment—and the importance of taking historically imprinted political features of organizations into account in studies of organizational responses to institutional complexity. © Academy of Management Review","",""

The answer, we propose, is that when employees are faced with ambiguous coworker behavior, they will, under certain circumstances, make an envy attribution for that behavior. We position envy attributions as a type of a relational attribution and elaborate a model grounded in theory on self-regulation that explains both how and when employees come to attribute the behaviors of their coworkers to envy. Going further, we then draw from research on approach-avoidance to explain the subsequent behavior of an employee who has attributed coworker behaviors to envy.

In this article we develop a multilevel, bottom-up model that explains two paths through which employees in noncore roles facilitate the dissemination of relational coordination in organizations. We leverage insights from self-categorization theory and relational coordination theory to explain different ways noncore role incumbents attempt to enact their noncore role identities. We then describe how the relational stances of those occupying core roles can enable or hinder the identity validation of those in noncore roles, and how validating the role-based identities of members in noncore roles fosters relational coordination at the group level while fostering positive identification with noncore roles.

However, findings on the actual career consequences of such use are mixed. We debundle work-life policies, which we view as control mechanisms that may operate in an enabling way, giving employees some latitude over when, where, and how much they work, or in an enclosing way, promoting longer hours on work premises. Drawing on signaling and attributional theories, we construe the nature of the policies used as a work devotion signal; specifically, we argue that supervisors attribute lower work devotion to employees who use more enabling policies than to employees who use more enclosing policies. However, this relationship is moderated by employees' work ethic prior to the use, by supervisors' expectations of employees, and by the family supportiveness of organizational norms. In turn, the work devotion attributions made by supervisors lead to positive and negative career consequences for work-life policies users, depending on organizational norms. Our model opens up new avenues of research on the work-life policies implementation gap by differentiating between the policies and by teasing out the roles played by policies, organizational norms, supervisors, and employees. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

I then consider the consequences of these practices on the novelty of knowledge outcomes. Because knowledge work continues to rely upon increasingly complex epistemic technologies, I suggest that the salience of status differences is of central importance to the production of new and updated knowledge. © 2018 Academy of Management Review.","",""

Structures of governance rest on stakeholder engagement, particularly on how stakeholders assess the prospects for earning a return by committing their specialized resources to the organization. Once formalized, governance structures and processes can resist change. Yet, under special circumstances, some stakeholders that are a party to an organization may seek to adapt governance in response to changes in the external environment that surrounds the organization. Adaptation often requires renegotiation: who has claims on the organization and who gets what? In this article we analyze the relationship between the institutional change that drives adaptation and the outcome of renegotiation. We draw on institutional economics and organization theory to identify four pathways of governance adaptation: continuity, architectural change, enfranchisement change, and redistribution. We call for further theoretical and empirical research on governance adaptation and its implications for organizational value creation and capture. © 2018 by the Authors.","",""

We theorize that as business-owning families are socialized with actors who provide new information, their collective knowledge structures are altered and, thus, the nature of reference points used in strategic decision making is impacted. Specifically, we link the socialization of next-generation family members to the temporal focus of reference points (i.e., backward or forward looking) and socialization into the capitalist class to the spatial focus of reference points (i.e., internally or externally oriented). Further, we theorize that the use of nonfamily professional advisors accelerates reference point shift. Our theory reveals the decisive role of social capital in reference point change and sheds light on how business-owning families may break free from old strategic frames. In doing so our framework provides a route to explore the sociocognitive processes underlying reference points' development and use, as well as sensemaking and interpretation more generally. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

We address the conditions under which each strategy is used, depending on the malleability of resources and barriers for goal attainment, time to deadline of goals, and feedback and monitoring of progress across work and family goals.

In turn, radical competitive actions will lead to shifts where these firms increase their market commonality with competitors with dissimilar resources and/or decrease their market commonality with competitors with similar resources.

But when might an adverse event that strikes one partner become too burdensome for another partner? Extant theories of alliance instability provide incomplete answers, which is problematic: for stricken organizations, anticipating whether their nonstricken partners will remain in the alliance can be essential for survival. Integrating insights from the alliance dynamics literature and organizational stigma literature, we theorize about how an organization-specific adverse event affects a nonstricken partner’s decision to continue with or defect from an alliance by considering factors that shift the balance between cohesive and disruptive forces. We propose that high stigmatization risk will increase the probability of partner defection through two disruptive mechanisms: relational uncertainty and stigma anxiety. Building on the idea that the same factors contributing to alliance formation may also condition partner defection, we theorize about the roles of partner resource interdependencies, relational embeddedness, and perceived partner similarity in amplifying or attenuating disruptive mechanisms triggered by an adverse event.

Drawing on institutional theory, coupled with both the entrepreneurship and corporate governance literature, we advance a middle-range theory of the antecedents of corporate governance deviance that considers both the institutional context and firm-level agency. Specifically, we highlight the centrality of a firm's entrepreneurial identity as it interacts with the national governance logic to jointly create corporate governance discretion (i.e., the latitude of accessible governance practices) within the firm. We argue that as a firm's governance discretion increases, it will be more likely to adopt overconforming or underconforming governance practices that deviate from established norms and practices. Moreover, we propose that adopting a deviant corporate governance practice is contingent on the governance regulatory environment and a firm's corporate governance capacity. We conclude by advancing a new typology of corporate governance deviance based on a firm's over-or underconformity with the dominant national logic, as well as its entrepreneurial identity motives.

Drawing from the three drivers of competitive response (awareness, motivation, and capability), we build a framework to theorize why firms sometimes use actions, sometimes use words, and sometimes use both in response to a rival's attack. By placing two frequently studied characteristics of attacks (attack magnitude and attack complexity) in a 2 × 2 matrix, we predict that word responses are more likely when attacks are not of low magnitude and low complexity.

We ground our framework in the time-dependent perspectives of sensemaking and dynamic behavior to specify precise temporal relationships between triggering cues and OCB modifications. Specifically, we define a baseline OCB trend and then develop propositions about how sensemaking cues linked to role transitions and work episodes can prompt differences in four trend effects: lag, rate of change, magnitude, and permanence. In doing so we identify circumstances that interrupt good citizens' ongoing flow and that could spark permanent modifications to OCB. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Typically, researchers have focused on how firms use nonmarket actions, including lobbying, campaign contributions, and related activities, to gain policy influence. We argue that firms may also attempt to change the effects of policies through market actions.Market actionsmay lead to both formal policy change (i.e., transformations of codified rules) and interpretive policy change (i.e., transformations of the effects of rules without changes in their codified form). We identify two pathways by which firms' market actions may produce interpretive policy change: implementation and innovation. Implementation-driven change occurs when firms' interpretations of incomplete laws alter and clarify the meaning of those laws. Innovation-driven change occurs when firms engage in novel activities that are difficult to interpret within existing regulatory frameworks and, thus, alter the effects of those regulations.We then theorize how firms' market actions may complement traditional, nonmarket political mobilization in an analysis of sequences of formal and interpretive policy change. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

I propose that contextual features present early in a group's life can cause members to quickly converge on one of two cognitive relational models for leadership. Some groups adopt an authority ranking model, in which leadership influence is consolidated in the hands of a few high-status members. Others adopt a communal sharing model, in which leadership is the collective responsibility of all members. A positive feedback loop develops between group members' relational model convergence and leadership emergence such that members enact leadership in a manner consistent with their shared relational model, and these interactions reinforce the model.

First, we argue that following the ""historic turn,"" organizational history has developed as a subfield of organization studies that takes seriously the matter of history, promoting historical research as a way to enrich the broad endeavor of organization. Second, if ""historymatters,"" then organization theory needs a theoretical account of the past that goes beyond the mere use of history as a context to test or as an example to illustrate theory. Third, the focus on ""history that matters"" in the present leads to two important considerations: How organizations can use ""rhetorical history"" as a strategic resource and the need to engage with historiographically significant subjects that connect organization theory to larger humanistic concerns, such as slavery and racism. © 2016 Academy of Management Review.","",""

We present a typology of common celebrity CEO archetypes (creator, transformer, rebel, savior) and then detail a model highlighting the consequences associated with attaining celebrity of a given type. These consequences include an array of sociocognitive outcomes, which, in turn, constrain celebrity CEOs to those behaviors associated with their particular celebrity archetype. The sociocognitive outcomes’ main effects are moderated by the role intensity of the specific archetype, the CEO’s degree of narcissism, and the temporal arc (rate of ascent and duration) of celebrity. Finally, we argue that the effects of CEO celebrity on firm performance are contingent on the continuity of external and internal contextual conditions. If conditions change appreciably, the celebrity CEO’s rigidities become severe liabilities, explaining the documented tendency for CEO celebrity to bring about, on average, unfavorable firm outcomes. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

However, there is little theoretical underpinning to explain how social performance is evaluated and integrated into strategic decision making. We fill this void with new theory built on the premise that inherently ambiguous social performance is evaluated and interpreted differently than largely clear financial performance. We propose that firms seek to negotiate a shared social performance reference point with stakeholders who identify with the organization and care about social performance. While incentivized to align with the firm, firm-identified stakeholders provide intense feedback when there are major discrepancies between their expectations and the firm’s actual social performance. Firms frame and respond to feedback differently depending on the feedback valence: negative feedback will be framed as a legitimacy threat, and firm responses are likely to be substantive; positive feedback will be framed as an efficiency threat, and firm responses are likely to be symbolic. However, social enterprises face a double standard in evaluations and calibrate responses to social performance feedback differently than do nonsocial enterprises. Our behavioral theory of social performance advances knowledge of organizational evaluations and responses to stakeholder feedback. Q Academy of Management Review 2018","",""

In doing so we make three primary contributions. First, we propose that the availability of information about the salient and socially significant elements of an organization's identity makes the media more likely to cast the organization as a main character in their dramatic narratives. Second, we theorize that the salience of these elements attracts constituents' attention and the social significance evokes their emotional responses. However, because some constituents may view the elements of an organization's identity as congruent and others as incongruent with their personal identities, an organization may simultaneously gain celebrity among some constituents and infamy among others.

Here we turn to an important piece of the puzzle that has been undertheorized: laypeople's beliefs about the nature of networks. Borrowing from the literature on lay theories in motivational psychology, we examine the effects of how laypeople construe different components of networks-individuals and their social intelligence, social relations, and social capital-as relatively fixed or malleable. We explain how each belief affects people's attitudes toward both the utility and morality of networking, with consequences for their engagement in different forms of networking (searching for new ties, maintaining existing ties, and leveraging social capital). We also consider these beliefs' downstream consequences for the size, diversity, and cohesiveness of networks people build.

Against this background, we highlight ""paradoxical"" contexts where respectful inquiry is likely to be especially rare but would also be especially valuable. These paradoxical contexts include situations where interpersonal power difference, time pressure, physical distance, cognitive load, follower dissatisfaction, or organizational control focus is high. We additionally outline how the effect of respectful inquiry behaviors critically hinges on the interaction history a follower has with a leader.

I first develop an integrated framework based on the twin perspectives of economic efficiency and legitimacy. When the political audience faces little uncertainty about lobbying content, firms make sourcing decisions to maximize economic efficiency in producing such content in line with transaction cost economics and the capabilities view. However, when the political audience faces substantial uncertainty about lobbying content, it relies on the perceived legitimacy of the lobbying entity to draw inferences about the quality of such content; therefore, the legitimacy of a potential lobbying entity matters to firms making sourcing decisions related to lobbying. I then connect firms’ sourcing decisions with several concrete characteristics of lobbying entities that can affect political audiences’ judgment regarding their legitimacy. Finally, I examine the tension that develops when legitimacy and economic efficiency considerations call for different forms of sourcing, as well as how complementarities in plural sourcing help resolve this tension in certain situations.

In addition to the natural entropic tendency to forget, collective memory is also undermined by instrumental ""forgetting work,"" which we conceptualize in this article. Forgetting work involves manipulating short-term conditions of the event, silencing vocal ""rememberers,"" and undermining collective mnemonic traces that sustain a version of the past.

The path to recovery involves escape through identity play and the oscillation between disciplined identity play and identity refinement/validation. The path to dysfunction involves escape though cognitive deconstruction. Regulatory focus is important in distinguishing between those who engage in identity play to generate possible new positive identities (i.e., promotion focus) and those who engage in cognitive dysfunction (i.e., prevention focus).

Drawing from previous research, we argue that high-quality LMX relationships progress through three stages: role taking, role making, and role routinization. Affective events theory indicates that emotions are relevant at each of these three stages, although their influence is manifested in different ways and at different levels of analysis. During the initial role-taking stage, leaders' affective expressions serve as affective events influencing member emotions through the processes of emotional contagion and affective empathy, which determine the progress of further relationship development. Next, during the role-making stage, leaders and members are both sources of affective events, and they may gradually become affectively entrained such that their affective states tend to fluctuate in a common rhythm. This pattern of dyadic-level affect helps to build high-quality LMX relationships over time. Finally, during the role routinization stage, an LMX relationship has been formed but, we argue, could subsequently change based on member emotional responses to the distribution of LMX relationships within a workgroup (LMX differentiation). © 2017 Academy of Management Review.","",""

Shareholder-dominant (agency) theory holds that all residual income claimant rights belong to shareholders, circumscribing other key stakeholders’ ability to appropriate value from their investment. However, recent enhancements to stakeholder theory grounded in property rights suggest that such stakeholders may need protection for implicit residual claims. A central purpose of this article is to build a model of the protection devices used to ensure these implicit rights. Individual ex ante devices such as stakeholder ownership only partially incentivize stakeholders’ firm-specific investments because they are subject to two types of uncertainties—behavioral and environmental—and individual devices aimed at reducing one type of uncertainty may exacerbate the other. We therefore expand on efforts to establish a stakeholder theory of strategic management by proposing an integrated model of protection devices, which seeks to overcome the incentive dilemma in reducing both uncertainties by reducing barriers to stakeholder firm-specific investment. Our model also explores the conflicts and complementarities associated with device implementation. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities associated with our model. Q Academy of Management Review 2018","",""

In doing so I provide a conceptual framework that enables understanding of specific factors that determine when anger is directed away from fight that harms others and toward fight that benefits others, and when fear is directed away from flight and toward increased protective effort (fight).

We build on relational models theory to examine how individual stakeholders' contributions to joint value creation are shaped by stakeholders' mental representations of their relationships with the other participants in value creation, and how these mental representations are affected by the perceived behavior of the firm. Stakeholder theorists typically contrast a broadly defined ""relational"" approach to stakeholder management with a ""transactional"" approach based on the price mechanism- and argue that the former is more likely than the latter to contribute to social welfare. Our theory supports this prediction for joint value creation but also implies that the dichotomy on which it is based is too coarse grained; there are three distinct ways to trigger higher contributions to joint value creation than through a transactional approach. Our theory also helps explain the tendency for firms and their stakeholders to converge on transactional relationships, despite their relative inefficiency in the context of joint value creation. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

To explain the effects of chronotype diversity on team outcomes, we develop a theory of team energetic asynchrony. Team energetic asynchrony refers to temporal asymmetries among team members' daily peaks and troughs in physical and psychological energy. In our theoretical model we delineate how chronotype diversity affects team performance by specifying three specific team processes (coordination, information processing, and backing up behavior) that convey unique team diversity effects of energetic asynchrony. In doing so we propose that chronotype diversity can have either positive or negative effects on team processes and outcomes, depending on whether teams recognize differences in members' chronotypes and structure team work accordingly.

From both the theoretical and empirical points of view, this increased attention has generated many inconsistencies. In this article we propose that a conceptualization of the idea journey encompassing phases that the literature has so far overlooked can help solve existing tensions. We conceptualize four phases of the journey of an idea, from conception to completion: idea generation, idea elaboration, idea championing, and idea implementation. We propose that a creator has distinct primary needs in each phase: cognitive flexibility, support, influence, and shared vision, respectively. Individual creators successfully move through a phase when the relational and structural elements of their networks match the distinct needs of the phase. The relational and structural elements that are beneficial for one phase, however, are detrimental for another. We propose that in order to solve this seeming contradiction and the associated paradoxes, individual creators have to change interpretations and frames throughout the different phases. This, in turn, allows them to activate different network characteristics at the appropriate moment and successfully complete the idea journey from novel concept to a tangible outcome that changes the field. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

I argue that the three are distinct correlates of social reality corresponding to the semiotic triangle composed of referent, signifier, and signified, which is key to understanding institutionalization. I combine the semiotic triangle and the chain of signification to conceptualize the process of institutionalization as the coevolution of the three correlates of the sign. Specifically, I identify two kinds of institutionalization: denotational and connotational. Whereas denotational institutionalization entails the coupling of the referent, signifier, and signified, connotational institutionalization involves decoupling among the three. Furthermore, decoupling occurs not only between doing and saying, as shown in existing management studies, but also between doing and meaning, as well as between meaning and saying. Based on this conceptualization, both kinds of institutionalization processes increase the taken-for-grantedness of the sign, but what is taken for granted differs drastically, which explains the heterogeneity in the institutionalization process. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Collective memories are shared accounts of the past shaped by historical events that mold individuals' perceptions. The two concepts provide a valuable point of departure for incorporating historical concepts into the study of entrepreneurial dynamics and offer a framework for understanding how entrepreneurs' historically situated experiences affect them.

Second, we specify mechanisms through which imprinting occurs and persists over time.

To address this problem, we use organizational climate theory to advance the construct of affect climate and provide a conceptual foundation for understanding its processes and effects in organizations. We propose that through various sources of climate, such as company practices, leaders, and routines, organizations can create environments that promote, among employees, (1) certain types of affective experiences or expressions, (2) specific uses of desirable affect for functional goals, and (3) particular ways to manage undesirable emotions and moods. We suggest that these three interrelated processes work together to form one of six unique organizational affect climate types.

Ultimately, our theory positions affect climate as another key performance differentiator for organizations, and it provides knowledge of the specific affect climate types that enable or inhibit distinct strategic priorities. © 2017 Academy of Management Review.","",""

Wethen develop a theoretical model to explain howthe representation, storage, and retrieval of collectivememory lead to the emergence of societal logics. In turn, societal logics shape memory making and the reproduction and reconstruction of history itself. To illustrate our theory, we discuss the rise of the corporate logic in the United States.We identify two sources of discontinuity that can disrupt this memory-making process and create notable disjunctures in the evolution of societal logics.

Unpacking the concept of executive symbolism and describing why executive actions carry symbolic significance, we primarily assess the ""theme-aligned symbolic action""-an executive action undertaken with the intention of sending a message in support of some new theme. We draw from social influence theory to develop an integrated set of propositions for predicting members' reactions, or affective responses, to such actions. The predictive factors include attributes of the action itself, the reputation of the executive, and predispositions of respective members to the theme. As an outgrowth of this analysis, we conclude that theme-aligned symbols, no matter how artful, will almost always be ineffective in eliciting positive reactions from members who are antagonistic toward the theme. In turn, we introduce the concept of the ""theme-muting symbol""-a symbolic action intended to minimize the prominence or apparent implications of a new theme-and we place this concept in the social influence framework as well. We discuss practical implications and present an agenda for future research. © 2018 Academy of Management Review.","",""

In this article we concede many of the criticisms pioneered by the creation approach but resist abandoning the preexisting reality of opportunities. Instead, we use realist philosophy of science to ontologically rehabilitate the objectivity of entrepreneurial opportunities by elucidating their propensity mode of existence. Our realist perspective offers an intuitive and paradox-free understanding of what it means for opportunities to exist objectively. This renewed understanding enables us to (1) explain that the subjectivities of the process of opportunity actualization do not contradict the objective existence of opportunities, (2) acknowledge the category of agencyintensive opportunites, (3) develop the notion of ""nonopportunity,"" and (4) clarify the ways individualsmight make cognitive contactwith opportunities prior to their actualization.

Second, interpretive history can add to our knowledge of the historical embeddedness of strategic practices, and microhistory can specifically help us understand the construction and enactment of these practices in historical contexts. Third, poststructuralist history can elucidate the historical embeddedness of strategic discourses, and genealogy in particular can increase our understanding of the evolution and transformation of strategic discourses and their power effects.

While research suggests performance benefits, an obvious question remains: If instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder treatment is so valuable, why isn’t it the dominant mode of relating to stakeholders? We argue that the existing instrumental stakeholder theory literature has three shortcomings that limit its ability to explain variance in performance. (1) Little theory exists around how instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder management could provide sustainable competitive advantage. (2) The literature has largely neglected the potential downsides (i.e., costs) associated with pursuing these sorts of stakeholder relationships. (3) There is a paucity of theory on the contexts in which the incremental benefits of instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder relationships are most likely to exceed the costs. As our primary contribution, we develop a theoretical path from a communal sharing relational ethics strategy—characterized by an intention to rely on relational contracts, joint wealth creation, high levels of mutual trust and cooperation, and communal sharing of property—to a close relationship capability, which we argue is valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate and, thus, a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage.

In terms of the decision to lead, a decision maker employing the logic of absurdity acknowledges the likely futility of leading but decides to commit to it nonetheless.

In this article we propose that middle-power positions and mindsets lead to frequent vertical code-switching-the act of alternating between behavioral patterns that are directed toward higher-power and lower-power interaction partners. We draw from identity and role transition theories to develop propositions specifying when frequent vertical code-switching will, in turn, result in heightened role conflict. We further situate our theoretical analysis by updating and extending the approach/inhibition theory of power on the basis of insights from revised reinforcement sensitivity theory to introduce an integrative framework called the approach/inhibition/avoidance theory of power.

In contrast to traditional transaction cost economics hazards, which are derived from transaction characteristics, interpretive uncertainty is driven by relational characteristics (the attributes of the parties in relation to each other). Additionally, interpretive uncertainty is mitigated by aligning the frames of the exchange partners rather than by traditional safeguards, such as penalty clauses. As a result, effective governance must support the development of a common dominant frame that facilitates the completion of the transaction.

More recently, organizational theorists have begun to explore the role of categories and their associated labels in industry dynamics. Yet little is known about how technological designs and categories coevolve. We build on these two bodies of literature to develop an integrative model of how industries emerge and evolve. We propose that the evolution of both technological designs and categories follows a similar pattern, characterized by an early period of divergence followed by a period of convergence, and we identify the mechanisms that account for this coevolutionary process. We add to the literature on technological evolution by explicating the mechanisms through which designs evolve and identifying how different stakeholders' categorical understandings shape design competition. Our model also augments the categorization literature by detailing categorical evolution as a contested process of category creation and selection, which, in turn, is influenced by the designs that the categories are trying to group. Our model creates a much needed bridge between two bodies of literature that, while addressing similar topics, have evolved largely separately.

We argue that analyzing exit from fieldwork is important for theorizing. We combine two streams of research-ethnography in the broader social sciences and business marketing on dissolving relationships-to propose a relational framework for conceptualizing and analyzing exit. The framework represents a first attempt to examine exiting in a systematic and nuanced manner, with the objective of understanding why and how breaking the silence about exiting fieldwork may advance theorizing. We develop a typology of four exit types leading to four different approaches to theorizing. We suggest that exit may bring about a new beginning in theorizing rather than closure and that it is not only high-quality relationships in the field but also those that are disruptive that may lead to interesting theorizing. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

We argue that directness of conflict expression is a function of the ambiguity of expression and who is involved (antagonists versus involving other people). Oppositional intensity of conflict expression is indicated by the communicated entrenchment in positions and subversiveness of actions. We argue that while oppositional intensity and directness are universal dimensions characterizing conflict expression, the cultural context and characteristics of the disputants will influence how conflict is expressed and perceived.

We also identify an intrapersonal mechanism of cognitive bias (e.g., sinister attribution tendencies, interpretive bias), and an interpersonal process of victim precipitation whereby employee state paranoia can influence both experienced and subjective evaluations of abusive supervision. In addition, we identify personal, relational, and contextual factors that moderate the relationship between abusive supervision and employee state paranoia.

Systemic shame we conceptualize as a form of disciplinary power, animated by persons' sense of shame - a mechanism of ongoing intersubjective surveillance and self-regulation. We theorize how the duo of systemic shame and sense of shame drives the self-regulation that underpins persons' conformity to institutional prescriptions and institutional reproduction. We conceptualize episodic shaming as a form of juridical power used by institutional guardians to elicit renewed conformity and reassert institutional prescriptions, and also explain how episodic shaming may have unintended effects, including institutional disruption and recreation, when it triggers sensemaking among targets and observers that can lead to the reassessment of the appropriateness of institutional prescriptions or the value of social bonds.

First, we focus on individual directors, arguing that effective monitoring is highly likely when a given director possesses certain qualities. Based on prior research not previously coalesced, we set forth this baseline proposition: a director's likelihood of being an effective monitor in any given domain (say, financial matters) is greatly increased when he or she has all four of the following qualities: independence, expertise in that domain, bandwidth, and motivation. Second, we extend this quadrilateral model-or quad model-to make propositions at the board level. We argue that it is not sufficient for these four qualities to be distributed among all directors on a given board, since this makes it likely there will be no directors who can rise to the challenging task of monitoring. We propose that having just one quad-qualified director will be more predictive of board efficacy than will be any customary board descriptors. And we posit that if a board has two or more quad-qualified directors who can bolster and amplify each other, the company's likelihood of governance failures will be especially reduced.

This ""means-ends decoupling"" prevails especially in highly opaque fields, where practices, causality, and performance are hard to understand and chart. I conceptualize the conditions under which the adoption of institutions in relatively opaque fields leads to the achievement of the envisaged goals. Voluntary sustainability standards governing socioenvironmental issues illustrate these arguments. I argue that the lack of field transparency drives institutional entrepreneurs to create and maintain concrete and uniform rules, apply strong incentives, and disseminate ""best practices"" to ensure substantive adopter compliance. However, such rigid institutions are ill-equipped to deal with the causal complexity and practice multiplicity underlying opacity while they smother adopter agency. The ensuing tension between substantive compliance and goal achievement leads to an inherent trade-off: institutional entrepreneurs who remedy the policy-practice decoupling may enhance the disparity between means and ends, and vice versa. While sustainability standards and other institutions in highly opaque fields can, therefore, not fully achieve the envisaged goals, the trade-off can be reduced through systemically designed institutions that promote goal internalization and contain niche institutions.

In the first part of the analysis, I establish a basic mechanism whereby a rational, profit-maximizing firm that is risk neutral with respect to realized profits would nonetheless benefit from risk in the antecedent process of developing a competitive advantage. This result serves to motivate two game-theoretic models demonstrating that (1) the trade-off between risk and expectation in developing a competitive advantage and (2) the shape of this risk each define a different and previously unexplored dimension of differentiation along which firms choose distinctive competitive positions. Two other important aspects of market rivalry-the number of competing firms and their product market overlap-affect where firms position themselves and which firms have higher expected profit than others.

Specifically, when organizational identification is heightened, an employee's engagement with external stakeholders will paradoxically become more adversarial and less collaborative. This effect can be attenuated, or even reversed, to the extent that (a) the employee construes that the stakeholder is an organizational member and (b) the organization's identity orientation is collectivistic.

These three dualisms underpin our explication of four alternative research strategies for organizational history: corporate history, consisting of a holistic, objectivist narrative of a corporate entity; analytically structured history, narrating theoretically conceptualized structures and events; serial history, using replicable techniques to analyze repeatable facts; and ethnographic history, reading documentary sources ""against the grain.""

To this end, we synthesize research on affective forecasting and theorize connections between affective forecasting and project success (versus failure), rooting our arguments in the claim that affective forecasting shapes a key motivation-related aspect of performance-regulatory focus. Further, we account for systematic biases underlying affective forecasting and consider how organizational factors may shape the strength of these biases.

In particular, online social networks present employees with boundary management and identity negotiation opportunities and challenges because they invite nontailored self-disclosure to broad audiences while offering few of the physical and social cues that normally guide social interactions. How and why do employees manage the boundaries between their professional and personal identities in online social networks, and how do these behaviors impact the way they are regarded by professional contacts? We build a framework to theorize about how work-nonwork boundary preferences and self-evaluation motives drive the adoption of four archetypical sets of online boundary management behaviors (open, audience, content, and hybrid) and the consequences of these behaviors for respect and liking in professional relationships.

Based on an interdisciplinary review of literature on identity and work, we develop a model of how people negotiate nonwork identities (e.g., national, gender, family) in the context of organizational/occupational pressures and personal preferences regarding this identity. We propose that the dual forces of pressures and preferences vary from inclusion (e.g., incorporating the nonwork identity within the work identity) to exclusion (e.g., keeping the identities separate).

In transaction cost economics opportunism traditionally takes the front seat, while bounded rationality is primarily relegated to the support role of invoking incomplete contracts. The theory also suggests that hierarchical governance effectively mitigates opportunism-based transaction costs, making it difficult to explain why hierarchies are not always used. However, when an augmented bounded rationality assumption is incorporated into transaction cost economics, we argue, first, that bounded rationality is a separate source of transaction costs and, second, that these costs are not equally mitigated by all forms of hierarchy. Instead, different hierarchical forms are associated with particular frames and social referents that naturally enhance specific bounded rationality-based conflicts, allowing certain hierarchical forms to mitigate bounded rationality-based transaction costs better than others. As a result, bounded rationality takes a front seat in the theory, addressing prior critiques of the theory, expanding the governance questions addressed by the theory, and creating a new moderating role for asset specificity in internal exchanges. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

One research stream, the ""inertial view,"" argues that the pervasiveness of interdependencies among activities increases inertia, which inhibits strategic renewal. Another research stream, the ""adaptive view,"" argues that the pervasiveness of interdependencies among activities allows for a rich flow of resources and information, which enables strategic renewal.

We explain how the two frames lead to differences in the breadth and depth of scanning, differences in issue interpretations in terms of sense of control and issue valence, and different types of responses that managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. By considering alternative cognitive frames, our argument contributes to a better understanding of managerial decision making regarding ambiguous sustainability issues, and it develops the underlying cognitive determinants of the stance that managers adopt on sustainability issues. This argument offers a cognitive explanation for why managers rarely push for radical change when faced with complex and ambiguous issues, such as sustainability, that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects. © Academy of Management Review 2014.","",""

We use this model to describe how the communicative practices of decision makers both enable and constrain how actors manage the risk and uncertainty of their judgments and decisions within an institutional context. We first develop a dual conception of reason as both communication (public argument) and cognition (private argument). With this dual conception of reason, we conceptualize actors as active and passive speakers and listeners who interpret, produce, and present public and private arguments to persuade themselves and others to adopt, maintain, or reject practices. Speakers and listeners have cognitive limits and thus create presumptions or shared decision-making rules to help them efficiently produce and process the arguments needed to debate, evaluate, and adjudicate recurring institutional decisions. We suggest that arguments shape actors' reasoning and judgment because they reflect appeals to pathos (emotion), logos (logic), and ethos (values) that support or criticize decisions to act. These appeals also shape the nature and construction of presumptions that bind rationality. We describe how these binds on rationality affect the formation of judgments and decisions, as well as the performance evaluation of institutional practices. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Our model draws on the ""spiral of silence"" theory, which originated in the mass communication literature and suggests that social actors tend to support majority views. At the micro level, this behavior triggers a spiral of silence that leads to homogenous public opinion. We use analogical reasoning to posit the existence of a spiral of silence at the institutional field level. When public opinion becomes hostile to a particular practice, institutional fields tend to resist this external opposition. Insiders face the dilemma of whether to align with the majority view expressed by public opinion or to comply with the one expressed at the field level. After discussing the mechanisms by which insider voices mediate and diffuse the hostility of public opinion at the field level, we discuss the boundary conditions applicable to our analogy.

Drawing from social identity theory, we develop a theory of lying as a socially motivated behavioral response to identity threats at the personal, relational, or collective levels of identity in organizational life. Specifically, we propose that perceived identity threats undermine the unique fundamental identity motives at each level of self, and that as threat sensitivity and threat intractability increase, individuals become more likely to use lying as a threat management response in their interactions with other organizational members. Further, we propose that identity-based characteristics of organizational members with whom threatened individuals interact (i.e., the audience) determine the likelihood that lying will occur by assuaging or amplifying threats during identity enactment. Thus, by applying an identity lens to examine normatively unethical behavior, we develop a comprehensive model of everyday lying as socially motivated and identity-based behavior with implications for ongoing workplace relationships. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

In this article we offer a rigorous theoretical examination of CEO severance with the goal of developing a foundation for a systematic research agenda. In particular, we consider if, and how, severance agreements can be effective in serving the interests of both CEOs and shareholders. We argue that severance agreements have potential value as both an executive recruitment and a governance tool but that the way they are conventionally structured undermines the value shareholders realize from them. The implications of structure have been almost entirely overlooked by scholars, perhaps because the influence of compensation consultants has left little variance in how severance agreements are implemented across firms. We address this gap by theorizing about how severance agreements could be structured to effectively generate value for executives and shareholders. To do this, we introduce a categorization of key dimensions of CEO severance agreements and consider how each of these dimensions can be structured to facilitate CEO recruitment while simultaneously mitigating future governance problems.

Importantly, events can originate at any hierarchical level and their effects can remain within that level or travel up or down throughout the organization, changing or creating new behaviors, features, and events. This impact can extend over time as events vary in duration and timing or as event strength evolves.

Although there is considerable scholarly work on rule-breaking, efforts to explain it remain theoretically fragmented. Here we identify two fundamental dimensions of bureaucratic rule-breaking and develop a coherent theoretical conception of it as a structurally patterned and interactionally mediated sociological fact. First, rule-breaking may be permitted or contested by those charged with rule enforcement. Manifestations of rule-breaking take on a routine character only where it is unofficially allowed; where it is not, conflict ensues. Second, the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy is mirrored by an organizational hierarchy of rule-breaking. Rule-breaking can be undertaken by individuals acting alone, it can be coordinated by workgroups, or it can be organized by top management as a matter of unofficial policy. Considering how these two dimensions of rule-breaking interact provides insight into how such actions vary with respect to the full range of organizational cross-pressures. Finally, the framework we develop offers an important corrective to the overreliance on the formal aspects of Weber's theorizing about bureaucracy and has considerable utility for generating hypotheses across an array of institutional arenas. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

However, a discrepancy exists between the popularity and prevalence of XSPs and evidence of their ability to produce value with respect to the problems they address. We therefore offer a framework for increasing and assessing XSP value based on an alternative conception of organizational constitution rooted in communication theory. Our central argument is that the overall value of XSPs is not merely in connecting interested parties but, rather, in their ability to act-to substantially influence the people and issues within their problem domain. This ability, we argue, comes from the constitution of organizational forms that are distinct from their members and that display collective agency-the capacity to influence a host of relevant outcomes beyond what individual organizations could do on their own. Our primary contributions are developing a framework for understanding XSP constitution in terms of communication processes and explaining how XSP value can be increased and assessed through communication practices. © 2012 Academy of Management Review.","",""

Family influence induces companies to strive for continuity, command, community, and connections and, thus, alters the mix of constraints under which firms operate. Consequently, family influence weakens several of the inertial forces described in the discontinuous change literature, particularly the level of formalization, dependence on external capital providers, and political resistance. However, it also aggravates critical sources of organizational paralysis, specifically emotional ties to existing assets and the rigidity of mental models. We aggregate these seemingly contradictory effects to show that, overall, discontinuous change conflicts with essential goals and values of the family system, and, therefore, family influence entails fundamentally different dilemmas than those described in extant research. In turn, although highly family-influenced companies recognize discontinuous technologies later than their less family-influenced counterparts, they implement adoption decisions more quickly and with more stamina. Moreover, family influence reduces adoption aggressiveness and flexibility. We discuss important implications of our research for conversations on discontinuous change as well as for the debate on the advantages and disadvantages of family influence in firms. © Academy of Management Review 2013.","",""

These conditions are (1) the firm's ex ante market position; (2) its ex ante resource base, which allows for complementarities; (3) its position in interorganizational networks, which gives it access to privileged information; and (4) the prior knowledge and experience of its managers, which allow superior judgment concerning the value-creating potential of the resource.

Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked.

Research on occupational segregation invalidates this assumption, confirming that we judge the nature of work in large part by the social identities aligned with it. Management theorists have yet to digest this evidence because of a unilateral view of the work-practitioner relation (i.e., people derive identity from work), which conceals a reciprocal relation (i.e., work derives identity from associated people). I build a bilateral view that accommodates available evidence by theorizing a new glass metaphor - the glass slipper - to capture occupational identity by association as it yields systematic forms of advantage and disadvantage. The metaphor elucidates how occupations come to appear ""naturally"" possessed of features that fit certain people yet are improbable for others. This article thus contributes to management knowledge by redefining the current division of scholarly labor as a consequential theoretical problem and developing the requisite theoretical tools to redress that problem.

Drawing on an episodic perspective of work, I argue that there is unaccounted for variability in the nature of a caregiver's client interactions such that some are actually restorative rather than depleting. I outline the foundations of such variability through simultaneous consideration of the extent to which a given interaction is (1) depleting of regulatory resources and (2) generative of three particular resources shown to compensate for the effects of ego depletion. Beyond the depleting interactions that have been the focus of research to date, the resulting typology reveals two restorative interaction types (replenishing and breakthrough) that I theorize positively shape compassionate care provision in both the short and long term. Replenishing interactions primarily serve as a regulatory break with momentary effects on caregivers' subsequent ability to self-regulate, while breakthrough interactions have a more lasting effect on caregivers' positive professional identity. This framework articulates how restorative experiences may be concurrent with the accomplishment of work and provides a more nuanced alternative to the long-held view of client interactions as a source of caregiver depletion. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

In so doing, we theorize that there are two distinct institutional dimensions necessary for understanding how practice adoption takes place: acceptance and implementation. We develop these dimensions to provide a framework showing that different within-organization responses will be associated with differing levels of acceptance of the need to adopt a practice - the acceptance dimension - and differing levels of conscious reflection during implementation of the practice - the implementation dimension. We then unpack this framework to explain how variations in discourse play a determining role in how practice adoption unfolds.

Here we develop a theoretical perspective that explicitly focuses on irresponsibility and that particularly helps explain attributions of social irresponsibility in the minds of the firm's observers. In contrast to approaches in the corporate social responsibility literature that tend to deemphasize the role of the individual perceiver of firm behavior in favor of emphasizing such broader social structures as value systems, institutions, and stakeholder relations, our focus is on how the social reality of external expectations for social responsibility is rooted in the perceptions of the beholder. We draw on attribution theory to describe how attributions of irresponsibility stem from the observer's subjective assessments of effect undesirability, corporate culpability, and affected party noncomplicity. We describe how those assessments affect each other and how they are influenced by the observer's perceptions of effect and firm characteristics and by the observer's social identification with the affected party or the implicated corporation.

The resolution of the trade-off between benefits of discovery and costs of divergence determines the best approach to innovation. © Academy of Management Review.","",""

Second, we make the case for greater analytical attention to be paid to the so-called lesser tropes of anomaly, paradox, and irony, which are based on dissimilarity. These operate within the ""cognitive discomfort zone,"" open up genuine alternative possibilities, and, analogically, provide a more fruitful source of knowledge generation.","",""

Both feed back to promote further organizational restructuring, making restructuring a self-reinforcing loop.

This article theorizes that fundamental beliefs and multiple sources of influence must be taken into account to predict a participant's reaction. Burrell and Morgan's (1979) work on paradigmatic differences is used to identify polar opposite beliefs about multiculturalism. Ideal states of multiculturalism are then defined and predicted from these fundamental beliefs. These belief systems are compared to sources of influence to predict reaction to a formal diversity-training program. We conclude with some cautionary dialogue about realistic expectations of diversity and the polarizing effects of Balkanizing rhetoric.","",""

One reason for lack of integration is that no clear definition of trust exists. In this article we grapple with this issue by going back to first principles to derive a mathematically precise and statistically rigorous definition of trust. In giving a rigorous meaning of trust, we also capture the key elements of the concept as highlighted by various disciplinary lenses. Our definition of trust, although rationally based, is consistent with many of the findings of earlier behavioral and sociological research. Its contribution is in adding precision and richness to our understanding of how trust is created and maintained in various social and economic interactions.","",""

Organizations are not mere substitutes for structuring efficient transactions when markets fail; they possess unique advantages for governing certain kinds of economic activities through a logic that is very different from that of a market. TCE is ""bad for practice"" because it fails to recognize this difference.

Firm-Level Political Risk and the Cash Flow Sensitivity of Cash,2024,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186654365&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139224500046&partnerID=40&md5=e91807409b8aef971b4217c496fcdb3f,"We examine the impact of firm-level political risk on the cash flow sensitivity of cash. Using a large sample of U.S. firms from 2003 to 2018, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash decreases in political uncertainty and the impact of political risk is asymmetric to cash flow types (positive versus negative). Intensified political uncertainty induces positive/negative cash flow firms to reduce savings out of cash flows to finance investment opportunities/terminate unprofitable projects to retrieve cash. The results are robust to various model specifications, alternative variable definitions, and the control for non-political risks. In addition, we show that a firm's financial status moderates the relation between the two, with financially constrained positive/negative cash flow firms saving more out of cash flows/decreasing existing savings as firm-level political risk increases.  © 2024 The Author(s).",cash flow sensitivity of cash; financial constraints; Firm-level political risk; positive (negative) cash flow firms,
Managing Climate Change Risks: Sea-Level Rise and Mergers and Acquisitions,2024,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191720532&doi=10.1142%2fS201013922450006X&partnerID=40&md5=11a380bcc61320835194ca67c9fd6d17,"Using a large sample over the period 1986 to 2017, we show that companies with higher exposure to climate change risk induced by sea-level rise (SLR) tend to acquire firms that are unlikely to be directly affected by SLR. We find that acquirers with higher SLR exposure experience significantly higher announcement-period abnormal stock returns.

We find that acquirers purchasing an innovation-oriented firm (prospector) experience significantly lower announcement returns and worse long-run operating performance than when they purchase an efficiency-oriented firm (defender). The effect is more pronounced for the acquirer with severe agency problems. Further analysis finds that synergies can be obtained from combining business strategies. We also show that acquirers respond to the presence of a prospector target by using stock payment in their offers. © World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.,efficiency-oriented strategy; innovation-oriented strategy; Mergers and acquisitions,

Passive Institutions and Long-Run CEO Compensation: Evidence from Proxy Voting,2024,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195784359&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139224500083&partnerID=40&md5=505c5ab60c1785001886400d549cc315,"A one-standard-deviation increase in passive ownership leads to a 25% increase in the compensation duration. I find proxy voting is the channel through which passive investors affect incentive horizons. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, passive funds tend to vote more against Say-on-Pay (SOP) proposals, and SOP proposals are less likely to pass with higher passive ownership. Moreover, passive ownership is associated with a greater number of shareholder-sponsored compensation proposals and an increased likelihood of these proposals passing. The overall findings indicate that passive institutions work to lengthen CEO compensation to align incentive horizons, and proxy voting is the mechanism through which they exert influence.  © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",incentive horizons; institutional investors; Passive funds; proxy voting,

In this class of models, yields are constrained to be above an effective lower bound, thus rendering standard bond pricing methods inapplicable. I propose approximating the nonlinear relationship between yields and state variables using moments of the censored normal distribution. In an empirical application, this approximation technique is accurate to within a fraction of a basis point. As I show, minimizing the yield approximation error is crucial for model estimation as even seemingly small errors can lead to economically meaningful inference biases.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Asset pricing; effective lower bound; shadow rate model; term structure model,
Does Random Auction Ending Curb Stock Price Manipulation?,2023,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181727746&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139224500010&partnerID=40&md5=0520fd889ab811d22a01de9aa8ca2f5b,"This paper examines the effect on stock market efficiency and potential market manipulation of introducing a random ending time for the call auctions that start and end continuous trading on three equity markets. We find that the probability of a price dislocation at the end of the auction declines, indicating a lower risk of market manipulation. In addition, the variance ratio and market-adjusted return volatility measures decrease, suggesting a more efficient and less volatile price discovery process. We confirm a behavioral change in order submissions by observing the timing of order entry, amendments, and deletions on one of the exchanges for which we have access to order data. Overall, our results indicate that adding a random auction ending time can reduce the risk of stock market manipulation and improve price efficiency.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Market manipulation; price efficiency; random auction ending,

Considering all venture-backed exits, we find that VCs are able to time the initial public offerings (IPOs) to occur after market run-ups. However, we find no evidence that VCs can time IPOs to precede low or negative market returns. Focusing on the biotech sector, we do find evidence of successful market timing in that IPO activity is highest following market run-ups and before periods of low market returns. Controlling for leading and lagging market returns, we find little evidence that media attention influences IPO exit timing. As to new VC investments in biotech, we find that when market returns are low (high), VCs focus their investments in the sector on earlier (later) investment rounds with longer (shorter) times to anticipated harvesting.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",investment timing; IPO market timing; Venture capital,

Deviating from the standard 30th and 70th percentile selection, we use an extensive set of anomaly test portfolios to uncover two main findings: First, there is a trade-off between specification and diversification. More centered breakpoints tend to result in less (idiosyncratic) risk. More extreme sorts lead to greater exposure to the underlying anomalies and thus to higher average returns. Second, the models are robust to varying degrees.

We find that bank competition and revenue diversification have a positive impact on banks' propensity to create liquidity. Competition appears to primarily impact on-balance-sheet liquidity creation while revenue diversification is a key driver of off-balance-sheet liquidity creation. When considered together, each has a moderating effect on the other in relation to liquidity creation suggesting a substitution effect between competition and revenue diversification. Such substitution effect, however, is found predominantly for small and medium banks and during crisis periods. Our findings suggest that policymakers and regulators should be cautious of a one-size-fits-all approach to bank competition and revenue diversification in promoting bank stability.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",competition; Liquidity creation; liquidity risk; revenue diversification,

Contrary to theories that emphasize liquidity problems, we find that most investment banks maintain funding levels during these downturns. Investment banks typically respond to shocks with a shift into deposits or by raising equity, rather than selling assets at a loss. We do not find strong evidence of fire sales, as asset declines mainly reflect write-downs rather than sales at unusually low prices. Write-downs are combined with strategic use of Level 3 assets, suggesting that banks mask insolvency. Investment banks often rely on cherry picking of assets in order to boost reported capital in a downturn.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",credit risk; financial crisis; fire sales; funding shocks; Investment banks; Level 3 assets; liquidity shocks,

Much of the existing literature interprets changes in short rates around the announcement windows as policy surprises. In contrast, we follow the ""Fed information effect""literature, which posits that financial markets react to central bank announcements not just for unexpected changes in monetary policy stances (monetary policy news), but also for central bank's assessment of economic conditions (non-monetary policy news). We identify the good/bad news using a combination of sign restrictions with high-frequency financial data. ""Bad news""events are times when the market interpreted the Fed decisions/announcements as revealing negative Fed information about the economy, and vice versa for ""good news""events. A novel finding is that following bad news events, we observe significantly positive stock returns in a 20-day period. This observation is largely consistent with a story of asymmetric effects of good and bad news on the level of uncertainty. Further analysis shows that the post-FOMC drift to economic news in Fed announcements is a market-wide phenomenon.

"Circular Economy, Stock Volatility, and Resilience to the COVID-19 Shock: Evidence from European Companies",2023,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165152395&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139223400062&partnerID=40&md5=e7d745b818e98ed231f9eda88f1745ba,"Background: By decoupling economic growth from an intensive use of resources, preventing the impairment of natural capital, and enhancing resilience to system-wide shocks, the Circular Economy (CE) is a powerful opportunity to hedge against ""linear""risk factors. In fact, it helps shielding against the risk of assets becoming stranded, can generate fresh and non-speculative demand for investments, and can improve investment results at both individual and portfolio levels. Problem: Therefore, equity investors into circular undertakings could benefit from (H1) reduced stock return volatility, as well as (H2) a greater ability to withstand exogenous negative events. Approach: For testing these hypotheses, we constructed a sample of 644 listed companies across EU-15 countries, plus Switzerland, and 17 different industries. We retrieved their market data in 2019-2020, as well as their accounting fundamentals in 2018-2019. By controlling for the latter, we investigated whether equity risk - either in total terms (i.e., the standard deviation of returns) or circumscribed to the systematic component thereof (i.e., the Beta against a European or global market index) - may be explained by a company's degree of circularity, measured by the Circularity Score (CS). This is a novel indicator originally proposed by Zara and Ramkumar (2022), based on Refinitiv ESG data, the methodology whereof we significantly amended. As a core innovation, in weighting an entity's performance on a CE framework, we assessed the latter's ""financial materiality""(i.e., relevance to the company's business) at sub-industry level, applying the SASB Materiality Maps. Via OLS estimation, we tested our hypotheses (i) over the whole-time horizon, in a panel model; (ii) on specific timeframes, in a standard cross-sectional model. The latter was applied to either the entire 2020 or subperiods thereof: namely, with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak, we distinguished between a pre-shock, a shock and a post-shock phase. Our quest was refined to conduct a deeper investigation into the Oil & Gas industry, which is intrinsically the most exposed to linear risks and, also, did experience the widest volatility in 2020. Findings: Both H1 and H2 received widespread confirmation. The CS was found to exert a negative, significant and robust effect on all the three risk measures, over the whole timespan as well as in subperiods (particularly the post-shock phase). Also, amplifying effects were recorded on the Oil & Gas industry. Conclusions: Our results lend remarkable support to the idea that the CE is a powerful enabler of de-risking, also in case of a severe shock, with a view to mitigating the negative consequences and building back better. They call on firms and policymakers to foster the circular transition, thereby accelerating economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic crisis.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",circular finance; circularity metrics; COVID-19; de-risking; equity risk; public equity; sustainable finance,

Globally, there are more than two thousand banks running Basel internal models. However, there are countries that have no such banks. They face the dilemma of which of the transition paths to adopt: the voluntary path, as in the EU, or the mandatory path, as in the US. Our objective is to take an investor's perspective and benchmark the two modes. Thus, we wish to determine whether there is a premium for either of them or whether they are, perhaps, equivalent. The novelty of our research is in its robust estimate that investors prefer a mandatory transition to a voluntary one if we consider the period of the 2007-2009 crisis. However, the use of the common post-crisis sample yields the opposite conclusion. A voluntary transition is preferred, though it implies a rise in stock volatility, and thus, the overall risk-return relationship is preserved. This is mostly driven by the tighter used when adopting internal models in the US compared to the EU. European banks have had more room to expand their business after the IRB transition, while for US banks, the transition involved a reduction in business, all else being equal. Our findings are of value primarily to emerging economies such as Argentina or Indonesia. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Basel II; Basel III; BCBS; CAR; D-SIB; difference-in-differences; G-SIB; IRB; risk weight,
Ascertaining the Inference of Bank Internal Default Probabilities Variations on Variable Rate Institutional Loan Prepayments,2023,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162817065&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139223400037&partnerID=40&md5=c55e9829fd572396d4d79a9f1621107c,"This paper aims to evaluate an inference of bank internal PDs (Default Probabilities) on subsequent prepayments of variable rate institutional loans. Since variable rate loans hardly present an economic motivation for early prepayments in that they would not offer a cheaper refinancing alternative, we test the conjecture of a correlation between improvements in obligors' creditworthiness (as reflected by negative changes in Bank Internal PDs) and subsequent loan prepayments, as obligors might be tempted to renegotiate more advantageous terms (lower credit spreads) with their lenders. The analysis is purported to serve as an early warning mechanism for banks pursuing the Basel III internal rating-based (IRB) approach for unexpected inflows of liquidity in the near future. We use Machine Learning (ML) ensemble methods to forecast potential prepayments and perform a conditional prepayment analysis to make an inference on the prepayment amounts and the prepayment timing distributions while controlling for macroeconomic and corporate idiosyncratic characteristics. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",default probabilities; institutional loans; Prepayments,

The results of this paper, in agreement with predictions of current financial theory, indicate that patent real option value increases when the following input factor conditions exist: increased patent asset value, longer time to the expiration of patent protection, higher interest rates, larger variability of future values of the patent asset, decreased patent commercialisation investment, and lower cost of delay in commercialisation investment decisions. Furthermore, patent real option value sensitivities are estimated for each of these input factors of the binomial decision tree model. More broadly, the paper provides a novel valuation tool for the monetary appraisal of patents and contributes to the IP literature on devising timely indicators of innovative activities.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",binomial model; patent real option; Patent valuation,
Return of the NPLs to the Bright Side: Which Unlikely to Pay Firms are More Likely to Pay?,2023,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162741814&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139223400049&partnerID=40&md5=633cca5d43cd59798ae7541a0a1c4c28,"Bank loans are divided into performing and non-performing loans (NPLs). NPLs are in turn divided into categories characterized by different degrees of difficulty of the debtor and level of risk for the creditor bank. Unlikely to pay loans (UTPs) are NPLs that have a non-zero probability of returning to the performing status. This paper analyzes at the firm and bank level the entire pool of UTPs vis-à-vis firms (UTP firms) in Italy from 2005 to 2019 to detect the characteristics of UTP firms that are more likely to return to the performing state. So far, the literature focused only on status changes from performing to NPLs. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that reverses the perspective and examines the drivers of return to the performing state. The paper shows that the factors most closely related to the new upgrade are - negatively - firm size and absolute value of debts, and - positively - capital and liquidity endowments. Results show that the soundness of lending banks increases the likelihood that firms return to the performing state.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",firm distress; firm recovery; Non-performing loans,

Volatility of volatility-increases, rather than that of volatility-decreases, contributes to the effect of implied volatility uncertainty, supporting the gambling-preference channel. We further strengthen this channel by examining the effects of option end-users net demand and lottery-like features, and by decomposing implied volatility changes into systematic and idiosyncratic components.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Delta-hedged option returns; gambling preference; model risk; volatility uncertainty; volatility-of-volatility,

Using a disclosure quality measure that captures the completeness of accounting information in the income statement and balance sheet, we show that a firm's default risk is significantly and negatively associated with the completeness of its accounting information. We further show that the negative relation is mainly driven by the information completeness of the balance sheet, relative to that of the income statement. In addition, the information completeness of the long-term liabilities on the balance sheet better explains a firm's default risk, compared to the current liabilities.

Specifically, a rise in female board representation by one standard deviation improves an innovative culture by 4.37%. The findings corroborate the argument that female directors infuse the firm with new ideas and different perspectives, thereby enhancing an innovative culture. Furthermore, we also show that female board representation's interaction with the takeover market, which is a crucial external governance mechanism, spurs a corporate innovation culture as well. This implies that board gender diversity substantially softens the negative effect of hostile takeover threats on corporate innovation. Our study is the first to link board gender diversity to a culture of innovation and show the interaction effect with takeover threats.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",board gender diversity; Corporate culture; corporate governance; female board representation; innovation; innovative culture,

We find that increasing the tick size deters institutional trading participation, as it results in unfavorable stock characteristics, such as greater price impact and depressed share prices. In particular, we show that the implementation of the pilot program creates a substitution effect, which causes mutual funds to migrate from pilot (wider-tick) stocks to control (narrower-tick) peers. Furthermore, we document that widening the tick size increases adverse selection and inventory costs and thus reduces market making profitability, leading to lower market-making activities. Further analysis shows that these adverse effects can be attributed to the trade-at rule that prevents price-matching in non-displaying trading centers, while the quote rule that mandates a minimum quote increment of five cents enriches market makers and promotes liquidity provision. Finally, we show that our results are more pronounced for tick-constrained stocks than for unconstrained ones. Overall, the evidence contradicts the SEC's intent to use a larger tick size to incentivize market making in small-cap stocks and attract more investors to trade these stocks, and dispraises the ""one-size-fits-all""approach undertaken by regulators. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",institutional investors; JOBS Act; liquidity; market maker; spillover effects; Tick size,

My analysis reveals that borrowers (especially with non-performing loans) did not actively seek out mortgage forbearance (conditional on communication) in response to this policy, which was intended to prevent a pandemic-induced foreclosure. This is an outcome of the servicer's differential treatment between government and private loans, as the CARES Act was designed for government loans only and left scope for servicer discretion for private loans.

Similarly, we show that compensating executives with well-designed coco bonds can also reduce risk-shifting incentives. In practice, however, most coco bonds have characteristics that result in both stock and coco compensation having large sensitivities to changes in asset risk - equity-based compensation encourages executives to increase risk, coco compensation to reduce risk. We show that a pay package combining both stock and coco can practically eliminate risk-shifting incentives and that it can be implemented with a bank's preexisting coco bonds.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Banking regulation; Coco compensation; Contingent capital; Executive compensation; Risk-shifting,

The adoption of inadequate transition matrices causes a misevaluation of credit risk, a consequent misallocation of capital, with the prospect that the lending process will be affected by increasing transaction costs and limited rationality, especially after a shock. Comparing the mover-stayer and the Markov chain approaches to estimate the SME rating transition matrix, we find that the risk of a structural credit shock imposes flexible estimates not constrained by the long-run trajectory of borrowers. Improved migration estimation mitigates adverse selection in banks' lending behavior. This conclusion is particularly true during economic downturns with the consequence of reducing the cyclicality and empowering the resilience of banks.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",absorbing state; Credit risk; Markov chains; rating migration,

We employ the adaptive multi-factor (AMF) model to test the GAPT utilizing a Groupwise Interpretable Basis Selection (GIBS) algorithm to identify the relevant factors from among all traded exchange-traded funds. We compare the performance of the AMF model with the Fama-French 5-factor (FF5) model. For nearly all time periods less than six years, the beta coefficients are time-invariant for the AMF model, but not for the FF5 model. This implies that the AMF model with a rolling window (such as five years) is more consistent with realized asset returns than is the FF5 model.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",adaptive multi-factor model; Asset pricing; GIBS algorithm; high-dimensional statistics; machine learning,

Furthermore, unrealized securities losses and loan loss reserves seem to better capture the risks stemming from banks' asset management and provide supporting evidence for the precautionary nature of liquidity hoarding. Moreover, I find that more than one-fourth of the reduction in bank lending during the crisis is due to the precautionary motive. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",banks; Financial crisis; liquidity risk,

Based on a matched sample of banks participating and not participating in this Capital Purchase Program (CPP), of each dollar of new government equity, on average participants levered roughly 13 cents to support increased lending while they used roughly 60 cents to increase their regulatory capital ratios. Over the previous business cycle, 2000-2008, allocation of new capital to support lending was higher than in 2008-2009 by nearly 30 cents per dollar of new capital. Moreover, in the previous downturn, 2000-2001, allocation to new lending was higher by an even greater amount. Banks' exposure to past-due loans, which was higher in 2008 than in 2000 or in any other sample year, negatively predicts allocation of new capital to new lending. Characteristics of CPP participants suggest they were of two types: Those with high commitments and opportunities for new lending, and those with exposures to certain troubled loan classes. Banks with high leverage and high expected costs of regulatory downgrades also were more likely participants.

A consistent SDF then implies the corresponding state dynamics in the data-generating measure. Our approach offers novel flexibilities to extend several popular asset pricing frameworks: affine and quadratic interest rate models, as well as models built on linearity-generating processes.

The model generates predictions that provide rational (non-behavioral) explanations for documented empirical evidence regarding leverage dynamics around mergers. When anticipating a longer and costlier integration period, acquiring firms strategically plan ahead by choosing a lower leverage prior to and at the time of the merger, and gradually lever up as the post-merger integration process nears completion. Deals with longer integration periods are financed with a larger fraction of equity. The model also implies that acquiring firms optimally time takeovers of underleveraged firms that experience negative shocks to their earnings. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",acquisition; Capital structure; financing policy; firm financial structure; leverage; merger; merger integration,

It is based on a hand-collected panel dataset of mutual fund governance characteristics from 1995 through 2004, which covers about 60% of assets listed in the CRSP mutual fund database. The results show that funds overseen by an independent chair charge fees that are 12 basis points lower and that the fraction of independent directors is associated with higher fees during the earlier part of the sample and with lower fees during the latter part. Both measures of board independence are associated with lower fund performance, although funds with higher director ownership and lower unexplained compensation charge lower fees and deliver higher returns. Fund board characteristics do not seem to affect the likelihood of litigation by regulators and shareholders. These results suggest that fund investors do not necessarily benefit from greater board independence if boards negotiate low fees without closely evaluating fund performance. In contrast, higher director ownership and relatively low compensation seem to align incentives between fund boards and investors. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Board of directors; governance; mutual funds; Securities and Exchange Commission,

These results are consistent with the view that arm's length creditors have a bias toward excessive liquidation in environments with strong creditor rights. Hence as creditor rights strengthen, firms switch to relationship lenders as they are less likely to sub-optimally liquidate the firm when continuation is more efficient. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",arm's length creditors; Banking relationships; creditor rights; liquidation bias,

We empirically examine the predictability of the market variance risk premium - a proxy of economic uncertainty - for bond risk premia and we show the strong predictive power for the one-month horizon that quickly recedes for longer horizons. The variance risk premium is largely orthogonal to well-established bond return predictors - forward rates, jumps, and macro variables. We rationalize our empirical findings in an equilibrium model of uncertainty about consumption and inflation which is coupled with recursive preferences. We show that the model can quantitatively explain the levels of bond and variance risk premia as well as the predictive power of the variance risk premium, while jointly matching salient features of other asset prices. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",bond risk premia; economic uncertainty; expectations hypothesis; inflation dynamics; Variance risk premium,

We find that a greater amount of advertising is associated with a larger stock return in the advertising year but a smaller stock return in the year subsequent to the advertising year, even after we control for other price predictors, such as size, book-to-market, and momentum. We conjecture that advertising affects stock returns by attracting investors' attention to the firm's stock. Stock price increases in the advertising year due to the attracted attention, but decreases in the subsequent year as the attracted attention wears out over time. We test this investor attention hypothesis and document consistent findings. We find that advertising increases a firm's visibility among investors in the advertising year. We further find that the negative effect of advertising on the long-run reversal in stock returns is more pronounced if a firm attracts greater investor attention in the advertising year, or if investors face a larger cost of short selling the firm's stock. It is also more pronounced for small firms, value firms, and firms with poor ex-ante stock or operating performance. Finally, we find that the effect of advertising on future stock returns is stronger when advertising increases compared to the case when advertising decreases. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Advertising; investor attention; stock returns,

Our calibrated model can match the variance premium, the equity premium, and the risk-free rate in the data. We find that about 97% of the mean-variance premium can be attributed to ambiguity aversion.

We find that CEO departures are associated with a subsequent increase in bank loan financing. The negative effect that CEO departures have on borrowing costs is largely driven by forced CEO turnovers. Following such departures, firms pay higher loan spreads, see an increase in covenants, and are more likely to be subject to collateral requirements, when compared to matched non-turnover and voluntary turnover firms. Evidence suggests that asset substitution and changes in accounting information quality help to explain the observed worsened terms following forced dismissals. On the other hand, more traditional voluntary departures are unrelated to changes in price and non-price loan terms. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",agency cost of debt; bank loan terms; CEO turnover; forced turnover; information uncertainty,

However, such an extraction generally assumes that agents are risk-neutral, which is not necessarily the case. Accordingly, it might be useful to account for the agents' risk-aversion when doing these forecasts, which one can implement by adding a risk-correction. In this context, we use TIIE-28 swaps to forecast changes in monetary policy in Mexico, using a set of financial variables to account for the risk-correction. We assess whether models with a risk-correction outperform the TIIE-28 swaps rates, and find that the in-sample explained variability improves when using a risk-correction. Centrally, we document that our main model's out-of-sample forecasts are similar for short horizons (3-month), and statistically significantly better for longer horizons (9 to 24-month), compared to the direct use of TIIE-28 swaps interest rates. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",expected monetary policy; interest rates; monetary policy; risk-adjustment; swaps; TIIE-28,

Using the reconciliation of the change in Level 3 net assets, I then directly examine the periodic re-measurement of the fair value estimates and document a significantly positive association between Level 3 net gains and quarterly returns. This result manifests even among observations with thin capital cushion, poorer information environment, and weaker corporate governance.

We combine that information with detailed data on limited partner investments in VCs provided by LP Source and test whether PPFs respond differently to the litigation shocks compared to other types of limited partners. Our triple-difference framework reveals that VCs who were defendants in lawsuits suffer a significant subsequent decline in investment by university endowments and several other types of institutional investors, but experience an increase in the investment share of PPFs. Pension funds are about three times more likely to re-invest in post-lawsuit funds offered by litigated VCs. The additional pension fund investments thus partially compensate for the shortfall in post-lawsuit fundraising caused by the exodus of other investors. Our results indicate that the investment choices of PPF managers reduce the effectiveness of reputational penalties imposed by other limited partners in venture capital funds. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",differences-in-differences; limited partners; litigation; PPFs; Venture capital,

Finally, we assess the impact of credit quality and capital adequacy variables on the systematic risk associated with growth opportunities. Our results suggest that stress tests act as a credible anchor to market expectations leading betas to decline. The effect is more pronounced for banks involved in multiple stress tests over time. Our second finding shows a significant and positive impact of Tier 1 capital ratios on betas, i.e., higher capitalization levels contribute to reducing the exposure to systematic risk. Moreover, market betas are responsive to bank vulnerability to stress scenario, in particular, regarding asset riskiness. Finally, betas of growth opportunities are affected by provisioning policies in the sense that conservative provisioning policies impair the ability to invest in growing assets. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",capital adequacy; Credit quality; event study; stress tests; systematic risk,

The general approach to solving this problem is to assume borrowers' portfolios as given. Although this assumption is reasonable in the corporate sector, the situation differs radically in the mortgage markets, where borrowers are unobservable and banks' screening capacity is tightly limited. We propose a novel dynamic model that assumes potential mortgage takers arrive randomly and sequentially at a bank. In a simulation, we show that the effect of a more stringent level of perceived risk on a bank's expected net income can be positive or negative. Remarkably, if both level of wealth inequality and screening capacity are low, a more severe level of perceived risk can decrease a bank's expected net income. In this situation, regulators should be particularly careful about increasing regulation in the form of a lower loan-to-value ratio. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Mortgage loans; power law distribution; screening capacity; stress testing; wealth distribution,

The paper aims at comparing the systemic risk measures and the earlier market risk measures regarding their predictive ability toward the failure of financial companies. Focusing on the 2007-2008 period and considering 28 large US financial companies (among which nine defaulted in the period), four systematic and four systemic risk measures are used to rank the companies according to their risk and to estimate their relationship with the company's failure through a survival Cox model. We found that the two groups of risk measures achieve similar scores in the ranking exercise, and that both show a significant effect on the time-to-default of the financial institutions. This last result appears even stronger when the Cox model uses, as covariates, the risk measures evaluated one, three and six months before. Considering this last case, the most predictive risk measures about the default risk of financial institutions were the Expected Shortfall, the Value-at-Risk, the CoVaR and the SES. We contribute to the literature in two ways. We provide a way to compare risk measures based on their predictive ability toward a situation, the company's failure, which is the most catastrophic event for a company. The survival model approach allows to map each risk measure in terms of probability of default over a given time horizon. We note, finally, that although focused on the Great Recession in US, the analysis can be applied to different periods and countries. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",CoVaR; Cox proportional hazard model; dynamic conditional beta; expected shortfall; marginal expected shortfall; regression beta; SRISK; systemic expected shortfall; Systemic risk; value-at-risk,

This question is related to the issue of the cost of capital and how it is affected by leverage. If we accept the Modigliani-Miller (M&M) theorem (1958), then the capital structure is irrelevant for both the cost of capital and the value of the bank. Specifically, the M&M hypothesis argues that higher levels of equity capital reduce bank leverage and risk, leading to an offsetting decline in banks' cost of equity capital. Hence, we ask the question whether banks are special firms such that M&M theorem does not apply to banks. We show that M&M propositions cannot be applied for banks primarily because of explicit guarantees and subsidies that provide incentives for increasing leverage. Then, some of the risk faced by the bank is transferred at no cost to the providers of these guarantees and subsidies, giving banks the incentive to increase leverage as much as they can. We show that under perfect market conditions, when risk is fairly priced, this opportunity vanishes. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",accounting vs. market value of equity capital; bank regulation; capital structure; CCA (Contingent Claim Approach); cost of capital; deposit insurance; GFC (Great Financial Crisis); leverage; M&M (Modigliani-Miller) Propositions; pricing risk,

Furthermore, there is an optimal degree of irrationality in the population depending on the degree of environmental randomness. In this process, mutation provides the important link between rational and irrational behaviors, and hence the variety in evolution.

In particular, loan growth, in conjunction with earnings, conveys meaningful information about bank value for small banks only, for commercial loans, and during normal times. Further, I posit that if the market reaction conveys meaningful information about a bank's value, then loan portfolio growth should predict future performance measures of the bank. In fact, I find that loan portfolio growth, when interacted with earnings, predicts future non-performing loans. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Bank lending; financial crisis; loan losses,
Dealing with Overleverage: Restricting Leverage vs. Restricting Variable Compensation,2018,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034240360&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139218500015&partnerID=40&md5=252a2a71c8cfafa749b378a38f3050c8,"We study policies that regulate executive compensation in a model that jointly determines executives' effort, compensation and firm leverage. The market failure that justifies regulation is that executives are optimistic about asset prices in states of distress. We show that shareholders propose compensation packages that lead to socially excessive leverage. Say-on-pay regulation does not reduce the incentives for leverage. Regulating the structure of compensation (but not its level) with a cap on the ratio of variable-to-fixed pay delivers the right leverage. However, it is more efficient to directly regulate leverage because restricting the variable compensation impacts managerial effort more than if shareholders are free to design compensation subject to a leverage constraint. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Executive compensation; leverage; moral hazard; optimism; overborrowing,

We calculate two measures of limit order imbalance and examine the relation between limit order imbalances and returns.

On average, bondholder value increases 14.4 basis points in a 3-month observation window. We find that country-level governance and national culture are dominant drivers of bondholder wealth effects. More specifically, bondholders benefit more from JVs and SAs if they are from countries with poorer institutional governance or greater regulatory governance in creditor protection (higher creditor rights and lower shareholder rights). In addition, bondholders gain more when they are from countries characterized with greater individualism, less power distance, a higher level of trust, or larger culture distance. Robustness tests and subsample analyses confirm the main findings. We find a positive impact of JVs and SAs on stockholder wealth, but little evidence for wealth transfer between stockholders and bondholders. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",bondholders wealth; country governance; Joint ventures; national culture; strategic alliances,

By focusing only on this component of monetary policy, our results are more comparable over time. We find a hump-shaped response of the yield curve to monetary policy surprises, both in the pre-crisis period and since 2013. During the crisis years, Fed path-surprises, largely through their effect on term premia, account for the impact on interest rates, which is found to be increasing in tenor.

But the likelihood of a transfer from the sovereign risk to corporate default risk can be mitigated by legal institutions that provide strong property rights protection. Using a novel credit default swaps (CDSs) dataset covering both government and corporate entities across 30 countries, this paper studies the strength of the transfer risk and the role of institutions in mitigating such risk. We find that sovereign risk on average has a statistically and economically significant influence on corporate credit risk. All else equal, a 100 basis points increase in the sovereign CDS spread leads to an increase in corporate CDS spreads by 74 basis points. The sovereign-corporate relation varies across corporations, with state-owned companies exhibiting a stronger relation. However, strong property rights institutions tend to weaken the connection. In contrast, contracting institutions (protection of creditor rights or minority shareholder rights) do not appear to matter in this context. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",CDS; contracting institutions; property rights institutions; Sovereign risk; transfer risk,

In contrast, the theory of firm-specific investments implies that when a customer raises its leverage, a firm will respond by lowering its own leverage to minimize the risk of bankruptcy. We test these theories by examining the relationship between the leverage decisions of suppliers and customers. We find that a firm's leverage is positively associated with its customer's leverage. Moreover, consistent with the bargaining theory, we find that the positive leverage relationship is stronger if the customer has a higher ex-ante bargaining power. We also find some support for the relation-specific investment theory of capital structure in that the positive leverage relationship is weaker if the supplier-customer relationship requires more relation-specific investments. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",bargaining; Capital structure; relation-specific investments; supply chain,

We conclude that the litigation risk differential is consistent with the bonding hypothesis of [Stulz 1999, Globalization of Equity Markets and the Cost of Capital, Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 12, 8-25], wherein the higher litigation risk of CRMs is a reflection of increased but varying levels of monitoring, starting with the regulatory oversight at the pre-listing stage and a post-listing tradeoff between enforcement and monitoring by shareholders. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",bonding; Cross-listings; initial public offering; litigation risk; private class action lawsuits; reverse merger,
"Corporate Governance Consequences of Accounting Scandals: Evidence from Top Management, CFO and Auditor Turnover",2017,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027367824&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139216500142&partnerID=40&md5=fa6132a57957398ee31b4e0a13b0fc3c,"This paper examines the consequences of accounting scandals to top management, top financial officers and outside auditors. We examine a sample of 518 U.S. public companies that announced earnings-decreasing restatements during the 1997-2002 period and an industry-size matched sample of control firms. Using logistic regressions that control for other determinants of management turnover, we find strong evidence of greater turnover of chief executive officers (CEOs), top management and chief financial officers (CFOs) of restating firms compared to the control sample. On average, over the three-year period surrounding the year of restatement announcement, CEOs and CFOs face, respectively, a 14% and 10% greater probability of being replaced in restating firms than in control firms, after controlling for other factors. These represent increases of about 42% and 23%, respectively, compared to the usual turnover probabilities for CEOs and CFOs. The magnitudes of these effects are even larger for restatements that are more serious, have worse effects on stock prices, result in negative restated earnings, are initiated by outside parties, are accompanied by Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs), or trigger securities class action lawsuits. We find little systematic evidence that auditor turnover is higher in restating firms. Our paper provides evidence of effective functioning of internal governance mechanisms following accounting scandals. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",accounting scandals; auditor turnover; CFO turnover; earnings manipulation; earnings restatements; financial restatements; Management turnover,

We show that arbitrage activity, proxied by short interest, focuses on mispricing of firms with high accruals. In particular, we provide evidence that high accrual firms experience significant negative returns when high short interest levels are announced. In contrast, the announcement effect does not vary by short selling activity for low accrual firms. Our findings are consistent with the view that the accrual anomaly is due to overpricing. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",accruals; arbitrage; mispricing; Short selling,

Previous research suggests that skewness is related to the choice of target in corporate acquisitions, which may reflect CEOs' behavioral biases. However, if the acquiring firms' stock returns are also skewed, then the acquirer CEOs may rationally use their stock as currency in these deals. We investigate the skewness of the acquiring firm and the method of payment to determine if takeovers involving high skewness stocks are consistent with shareholder wealth maximization. We find that firms with high levels of skewness are more likely to become takeover targets and that takeover premiums increase with skewness, but there is no relation between the target's skewness level and acquirer announcement returns. We also find that acquirers with high skewness are more likely to pay with stock and have higher announcement returns. We conclude that acquirer CEOs often take advantage of investor preference for skewness when undertaking mergers and acquisitions activity. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",acquisitions; idiosyncratic skewness; lottery stocks; Mergers; post-merger performance,

In these models, banks take deposits from households and lend to firms. Empirically, other financial channels that are missing in the models, such as corporate bonds and equity, are also important. This paper analyzes a model in which bank loans and equity are both feasible. Households have limited ability to enforce their claims. If either the bank or the equity market are undistorted, the equilibrium is socially efficient. If both are distorted, the equilibrium is inefficient. In that case, government policy aimed at the bank or at the firm can be helpful. Suitably chosen equity injections, loans, or interest rate subsidies can all work. Interest rate subsidies have the advantage that they occur later and there is less concern about cheating. Equity injections have the advantage that they minimize the necessary level of tax imposed on households that is needed to achieve optimality. Optimal equity injections and optimal loan subsidies induce reductions in household savings ('crowding out'). Optimal interest rate subsidies induce increases in household savings ('crowding in'). © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",crowding out; general equilibrium with frictions; moral hazard; Optimal policy,

It is sensitive to the proportion of the jump component to total volatility, but also to the expected amplitude for a given proportion. The shift becomes small when the relative risk aversion increases, but it becomes major when the solvency constraint is active in the presence of jumps.

However, another stream of research asserts that governance mechanisms may benefit bondholders by paring down agency costs and decreasing information asymmetry between the firm and the lenders (monitoring hypothesis). We reexamine this issue by considering the self-selection effect. We find that both hypotheses can be true, and that firms consider the reduction of cost of debt when self-selecting their governance, and the cost of debt would have been much higher had the alternative governance decision been made. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Corporate governance; cost of debt,

Understanding the households' decision on housing finance has important implications from a policy perspective, due to the effects it may have on the housing prices, on the housing market stability and on household welfare. The theoretical literature on housing finance focused on figuring out the optimal choice between fixed rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). We argue that the standard economic criteria are sometimes inadequate to explain household's choices, which may be motivated by psychological factors. In other words, we claim that household's choice depends only partially on the findings of the theoretical literature. We examine the effect of changes in the short-Term market interest rate on the households' choice between FRMs and ARMs. We test this effect using a unique data provided to us by the Bank of Israel, which contains detailed information on the household's decision between FRM and ARM contracts in Israel in the past decade. The results of our analysis demonstrate a significant association between FRM preference and short-Term interest rate reduction. Moreover, we find that the change in the short-Term interest rate is more salient to the borrowers in periods of a high interest rate environment. We attribute these findings to Tversky and Kahneman (1974) availability and representativeness heuristics. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",adjustable and fixed rate mortgages; cognitive biases; household finance; Mortgage decision-making,

We examine changes in cash holdings around CEO turnover events, a period in which discrete changes in managerial preferences and abilities are likely to have the most dramatic effect on cash holdings. Our results suggest that cash holdings increase significantly following forced departures. The increase is persistent over the successor's tenure and is robust to controls for the standard firm-level determinants of cash holdings and corporate governance characteristics. We find that higher cash holdings arise mainly through the management of net working capital, as opposed to asset sales or reductions in investment. This suggests that the changes are optimal for shareholders rather than an indication of serious agency problems. This conclusion is supported further by our finding that the marginal value of cash does not decrease following the turnover. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",agency problems; cash holdings; CEO turnover; corporate governance,

This paper describes and evaluates a proposed security that converts from debt to equity automatically when the issuer's equity ratio falls too low. ""Contingent capital certificates"" (CCCs) can greatly reduce the probability that a large financial firm will suffer losses in excess of its common equity, and will provide market discipline by forcing shareholders to internalize more of their assets' poor outcomes.

However, none of the three-factor models can fully match bond return predictability and yield volatility jointly.

In our theoretical model, an informed manager compensated by stock options is mandated to issue an earnings report. Uninformed investors price the stock based on this report. The manager can manipulate the report to affect the stock price, but earnings management is costly to the manager. The optimal report balances the benefits from exercising stock options and the costs of earnings management. Earnings management and insider trading occur at the vesting date only if the options are in the money post manipulation, and are intensified by larger grants. The model identifies three major determinants of the extent of both earnings management and insider trading: The moneyness of the options at the vesting date, the size of the grants, and cumulative stock returns between the grant date and the vesting date. Our empirical results confirm that the moneyness of newly granted stock options and cumulative stock returns are strongly correlated with both earnings management and insider trading in vesting years.

Funds holding Treasury securities at greatest risk of default or with market values below their 1 share price experience flows that are insignificantly different from other funds, all else equal. We also find evidence that a significant portion of the outflows stem, not from liquidity concerns, but from an opportunistic yield play on the repo market created by the crises.

We also find that violating firms experience an average increase of 8.48% in the implied cost of equity capital. By comparing analysts' earnings forecasts before and after the violations, we conclude that the negative effects on equity owe to the loss of flexibility that accompanies covenant violations, and are not simply a reflection of the deteriorating health of the firm. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",cost of capital; Covenant violations; seasoned equity offerings; underpricing,

This paper investigates whether a dynamic capital structure model can explain the cross-sectional size-leverage relationship. The driving force that we consider is the presence of fixed costs of external financing that lead to infrequent restructuring and create a wedge between small and large firms. We find four firm-size effects on leverage. Small firms choose higher leverage at the moment of refinancing to compensate for less frequent rebalancings. Their longer waiting times between refinancings lead to lower levels of leverage at the end of restructuring periods. Within one refinancing cycle, the intertemporal relationship between leverage and firm size is negative. Finally, there is a mass of firms opting for no leverage. The analysis of dynamic economy demonstrates that in cross-section, the relationship between leverage and size is positive and thus fixed costs of financing contribute to the explanation of the stylized size-leverage relationship. However, the relationship changes sign when we control for the presence of unlevered firms. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Capital structure; default; dynamic economy; dynamic programming; firm size; leverage; refinancing point; transaction costs; zero-leverage,

Our database is larger than that of previous studies and includes 1,804 contracts. Our main finding is that California-based entrepreneurs receive less harsh contract terms. In particular, investors subject to California-based or California style contracts have less downside protection. This ""California effect"" remains large and significant even after we include all the previously discovered controls which determine contract design. We find a similar effect if the VC is located in California, or if a non-California VC had a large exposure to the California market. We do not find evidence that VCs are substituting cash flow contingencies for control rights or for performance-based CEO compensation contracts. We also document several other new contractual features of VC contracts. In particular, we find that better companies and more experienced VCs receive better contract terms, whereas older companies receive harsher contracts. We also confirm the role of concentration and proximity in financial contracts. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",California style contracts; downside protection; harshness index; VC Contracts,

We investigate whether the relation between financial constraints and the value of corporate cash holdings varies across firms with different engagement in research and development activity. Among firms with R&D investment, the marginal value of cash is significantly higher for financially constrained firms than unconstrained ones, whereas this difference is weak among firms without R&D investment. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of financial constraints and alternative methods to define R&D intensity. Our study extends the cash literature by showing that the value of cash holdings is affected by the status of financial constraints and the nature of investment jointly. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",financial constraints; investment; research and development; Value of cash,

For robustness, we perform the same exercise for bond spreads by the same issuers on the same trading date. As expected, bond spreads relative to the treasury curve are systematically underestimated.

These results are consistent with the monitoring cost hypothesis.

Timeseries analysis reveals that this cost is lowest immediately post-IPO and it increases monotonically in the first 8-12 weeks of secondary market trading. Order flow variability and the fraction of small trades (both proxies for the extent of uninformed trading) are at their highest in the immediate aftermarket and their levels decay for the next 8-12 weeks.

The key is to exploit the differentials in LQ exhibited by different securities on the same underlying firm. By using equity and option data, I show that one can efficiently extract pure measures of λQ that are not contaminated by recovery information. Equipped with this knowledge of pure default dynamics, prices of any defaultable security on the same firm with non-zero recovery can be inverted to compute the associated LQ corresponding to that particular security. Using data on credit default swap premiums, I show that, cross-sectionally, λQ and LQ are positively correlated. In particular, this positive correlation is strongly driven by firms' characteristics, including leverage, volatility, profitability and q-ratio. For example, 1% increase in leverage leads to 0.14% increase in λQ and 0.60% increase in LQ. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",corporate bonds; Default risk; loss given default,

Using a novel dataset, we document that this sell-off appears to have generated significant liquidity risk for market-makers, as evidenced by a significant imbalance in their quotes towards sales. We find that simultaneously there was a substantial increase in the co-movement between innovations in the credit default swap (CDS) spreads of GM and Ford and those of firms in all other industries, the increase being the greatest during the period surrounding the actual downgrade and reversing sharply thereafter. We show that the corporate bond market makers' imbalance towards sales in GM and Ford bonds explains a significant portion of this co-movement.

We summarize and test the implications for what we refer to as the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC), using a large sample of privately placed corporate debt. Our results are consistent with many of the implications of the ATC, including a negative relation between the promised yield on corporate debt and the presence of covenants. We also find that borrower and lender characteristics, as well as macroeconomic factors, determine covenant structure. Loans are more likely to include protective covenants when the borrower is small, has high growth opportunities or is highly levered. Loans made by investment banks and syndicated loans are also more likely to include protective covenants, as are loans made during recessionary periods or when credit spreads are large. Finally, we show that consistent with the ATC, firms that elect to issue private rather than public debt are smaller, have greater growth opportunities, less long-term debt, fewer tangible assets, more volatile cash flows and include more covenants in their debt agreements. An important byproduct of our analysis is to demonstrate empirically that covenant structure and the yield on corporate debt are determined simultaneously. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",agency costs; bank loans; capital structure; debt covenants; Financial contracts,

Therefore, these features appear to signal superior managerial and/or fund skill.

In my model, firms invest more than workers because of a production externality and because it is less costly to invest in health capital than to compensate the worker for bearing the risk of an uncertain labor realization. This result improves welfare, contrary to the benchmark that workers consume more health care than is efficient ex post when firms provide health insurance. Unlike the benchmark model of a worker and insurer, my model includes a profit maximizing firm, includes an endogenous probability of getting sick, and allows the insurer to set premiums by anticipating the health care investment level of the insured. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Health capital; human capital; insurance; moral hazard; social welfare; wages,

The proposed models are flexible and parsimonious, and include many asymmetrically heavy-tailed error distributions-such as skew-t and skew-slash distributions-as special cases. We estimate a variety of specifications of our models using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, with data on daily returns of the S&P 500 index over 1987-2009.

This paper investigates what happens to CEO compensation when a turnover event occurs. Specifically, I examine CEO compensation levels and pay-performance sensitivity for incoming and outgoing CEOs involved in turnover events at public companies in the United States. My main findings are as follows: (1) incoming CEOs are paid as much as or more than those they replace, (2) outsider replacements are paid more than their predecessors even after controlling for education and skills, and (3) CEOs who are forced out are not paid differently from those who replace them, while CEOs who leave voluntarily are paid significantly less than their replacements. Further analysis reveals that proxies for managerial power including CEO tenure, CEO centrality, founder status, and high CEO ownership cannot explain these results. Overall, these findings are difficult to reconcile with the view that managerial power is the primary determinant of CEO compensation. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Compensation; managerial power; optimal contracting; turnover,

In the few cases for which we do find some statistical evidence of an effect, it tends to be short-lived or not economically significant. On the other hand, we find evidence that interventions which objective is to restore and/or assure the proper functioning of exchange rate markets have a higher probability of success.

Starting with the seminal work of Hall (Hall, R., 1978, Stochastic Implications of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income Hypothesis: Theory and Evidence, Journal of Political Economy 86, 971-987), researchers have used an Euler equation framework to estimate the EIS, relating the growth rate of consumption to the after-tax interest rate facing consumers. This large literature has, however, produced very mixed results, perhaps due to an important limitation: The impact of the interest rate on consumption or savings is identified by time-series movements in interest rates. Yet the factors that cause time-series movements in interest rates may themselves be correlated with consumption or savings decisions. I address this problem by using variation across individuals in the capital income tax rate. Conditional on observable characteristics of individuals, tax rate movements cause exogenous shifts in the after-tax interest rate. Using data on total non-durable consumption from the Consumer Expenditure Survey over two decades, I estimate a surprisingly high EIS of two.

The research presented here operationalizes this idea in two important ways. First, since future income and tuition are uncertain, a contingent claims model is developed and the appropriate discount rate for valuing future earnings is, therefore, endogenized given an economy that does not permit arbitrage. Second, the model is sensitive to the valuation of the real option to obtain an advanced degree in addition to the valuation of the earnings for an individual with an undergraduate degree. In this framework, the value of a high school diploma is shown to be the sum of: (1) capitalized earnings, (2) the real option to obtain an undergraduate degree and (3) the embedded or compound real option to obtain an advanced degree. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the performance and key drivers of the model.

We characterize several properties of these innovations, including their covariance with aggregate equity returns, long-term bond returns, and returns on several other assets. Aggregate equity returns are uncorrelated with the occupation-level income innovations, but a portfolio formed on firm size is significantly correlated with income innovations for several occupations, and so are selected industry-level equity portfolios. An application of the theory to the empirical results shows (a) large predicted levels of risky asset holdings compared to observed levels, (b) considerable variation in optimal portfolio allocations over the life cycle, and (c) large departures from the two-fund separation principle. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",graphical approach; Life cycle portfolio choice; occupation-level income shocks; risky labor income,
Restrictions on Allocation Discretion: Evidence from Clawbacks in Hong Kong IPOs,2013,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009498830&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139213500183&partnerID=40&md5=07df0dd93709405509430ebba26afff7,"The presence of both restricted and unrestricted, US-style, bookbuilt initial public offer (IPOs) in Hong Kong provides an ideal environment to test numerous underpricing models by simultaneously measuring the effects of allocation restrictions on the investment bankers' price discovery, underwriting, and distribution functions. While clawbacks, a set of allocation restrictions favoring retail investors not participating in the roadshow result in diminished and more expensive price discovery, they also reduce the investment bankers' dependence on institutional investors to dispose off IPO shares, resulting in lower underpricing. This favors models that highlight the importance of the underwriting function on underpricing, and shows that allocation restrictions can impact more than just price discovery. In addition, this study shows that individual investors can partially offset the loss of roadshow information caused by clawbacks, countering the idea that investment banks are unable to extract any pricing information from investors outside their list of roadshow regulars. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",allocation policy; bookbuilding; IPOs; underpricing; underwriting,

Using three valuation approaches, the findings suggest that: (1) the valuation of firms issuing seasoned equity is the most favorable at the time of the offering and (2) the estimated valuation errors are significantly related to the probability that firms will undertake a seasoned equity issue. These results are consistent with firms optimizing the timing of the seasoned equity offering so as to take maximum possible advantage of misvaluation of their shares. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Seasoned equity offering; timing; valuation,

In particular, we show that HFTs reduce (increase) the prices that LTs receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. (ii) Although PTs lose revenue in every trade intermediated by HFTs, they are compensated with a higher liquidity discount in the market price. (iii) HF trading increases the microstructure noise of prices. (iv) The volume of trades increases as the HFTs intermediate trades between the LTs and PTs. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading. In equilibrium, HF trading and PTs coexist as competition drives down the profits for new HFTs while the presence of HFTs does not drive out traditional PTs. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",execution costs; flash trading; High frequency traders; high frequency trading; institutional investors; liquidity traders; market microstructure; market quality; microstructure volatility,

We test these links using data on all end-user currency trades received at Citibank over 6.5 years, a sample sufficiently long to analyze real-time forecasts at the quarterly horizon. The predictions are borne out in four empirical findings that define this paper's main contribution: (1) transaction flows forecast future macro variables such as output growth, money growth, and inflation, (2) transaction flows forecast these macro variables significantly better than the exchange rate does, (3) transaction flows (proprietary) forecast future exchange rates, and (4) the forecasted part of fundamentals is better at explaining exchange rates than standard measured fundamentals. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Exchange rate dynamics; microstructure; order flow,

Many observers consider angel investments to be one of the key drivers behind the startup and growth of new businesses (Council on Competitiveness, 2007), despite a paucity of information to confirm whether or not this is true. Unlike venture capital investments, angel investments are made by individual investors who do not make up a known population. Therefore, much of what is reported about angel investing comes from anecdotes and surveys of convenience samples, which are prone to biases and inaccuracies. Moreover, research on this topic is plagued by definitional confusion, in which different investigators confound informal investors, friends and family who invest in startups, accredited and unaccredited angel investors, and individual and group investing; this confusion makes it difficult to compare findings across studies. This report seeks to provide an accurate understanding of the role of angel investing in the entrepreneurial finance system. It defines angel investing and reviews the current state of understanding of the phenomenon, focusing on answering four questions: (1) How large is the angel capital market? (2) How much demand is there for angel capital? (3) What are the primary characteristics of angel investments? (4) What do the companies that receive angel financing look like? It answers these questions by reviewing the literature, providing a statistical evaluation of data sources drawn from representative samples of known populations, examining new non-representative surveys of angel investors, and comparing the results of these new analyses to previous studies of non-representative samples of business angels. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Angel investor; entrepreneur; informal finance,

In terms of expected returns, the total estimated liquidity risk premium is around 0.6% per annum for US long-maturity investment grade bonds. For speculative grade bonds, which have higher exposures to the liquidity factors, the liquidity risk premium is around 1.5% per annum.

We consider four aspects of forecast quality: Accuracy, bias, and revision frequency of quarterly earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and relative optimism in long-term earnings growth (LTG) forecasts. Using a unique dataset that contains the annual revenue breakdown of analysts' employers among IB, brokerage, and other businesses, we uncover two main findings. First, accuracy and bias in quarterly EPS forecasts appear to be unrelated to conflict magnitudes after controlling for forecast age, firm resources, and analyst characteristics. Second, relative optimism in LTG forecasts and the revision frequency of quarterly EPS forecasts are positively related to the importance of brokerage business to analysts' employers. Additional tests suggest that the frequency of quarterly forecast revisions is positively related to analysts' trade generation incentives. Our findings suggest that reputation concerns keep analysts honest with respect to short-term earnings forecasts but not LTG forecasts. In addition, conflicts from brokerage appear to play a more important role in shaping analysts' forecasting behavior than has been previously recognized. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",analyst conflicts; analyst forecasts; brokerage commissions; conflicts of interest; investment banking; security analysts; Stock analysts,

We find that such heterogeneous responses exist in usual characteristics such as method of payment, relative size, acquirer size, leverage, and market-to-book ratios. After these heterogeneous responses are incorporated, the puzzling ""listing effect"" disappears.

Second, despite having the same asymptotic efficiency as maximum likelihood, the small-sample performance of Efficient Method of Moments (a commonly used method for estimating complicated models) is unacceptable even in the simplest term structure settings.

Using the Lipper TASS database it provides category and fund specific factors that affect the survival probability of hedge funds. The findings show that in general, investors chasing individual fund performance, thus increasing fund flows, decrease probabilities of hedge funds liquidating. However, if investors chase a category of hedge funds that has performed well (favorably positioned), then the probability of hedge funds liquidating in this category increases. We interpret this finding as a result of competition among hedge funds in a category. As competition increases, marginal funds are more likely to be liquidated than funds that deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. We also find that there is a concave relationship between performance and lagged assets under management. The implication of this study is that an optimal asset size can be obtained by balancing out the effects of past returns, fund flows, competition, market impact, and favorable category positioning that are modeled in the paper. Hedge funds in capacity constrained and illiquid categories are subject to high market impact, have limited investment opportunities, and are likely to exhibit an optimal size behavior. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Competition; fund flows; hedge funds; optimal asset size; performance; strategy capacity,

In principle, trained professionals gather time-varying information (""financial news"") and analyze it statistically to reduce it to a single dimension, allegedly for the benefit of investors, which, in turn, enables issuers to finance themselves at lower cost. In practice, the issuer-pays business model currently used for funding the production and distribution of ratings information creates an incentive to favor high-volume issuers by over-rating private-label securitizations. While the Dodd-Frank Act intensifies SEC oversight of CRO activity, the SEC has a history of being captured by regulatory clients. We argue that the fundamental solution is to create accountability in the ratings process so that private label securitizations can play a constructive role in the provision of credit and we go on to offer some conjectures about how this could be done. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",credit rating regulation; Credit ratings; credit risk; securitization,

We simulate this model and show that, consistent with the empirical literature, in situations in which growth options are important, regressions of investment on Tobin's Q and cash flow yield small positive coefficients on Q and larger coefficients on cash flow. We also show that growth options increase the volatility of firm value relative to the volatility of cash flow. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Growth options; investment; technology upgrades; Tobin's Q,

Theory suggests that since debt is a concave claim, it may be mispriced when outside investors are uninformed about firms' risk. The empirical literature has however paid little attention to the caveat that the ""lemons"" problem of external financing first identified by Myers (1984) only leads to debt issuance, i.e., a pecking order, if debt is risk free or, if it is risky, that it is not mispriced. This paper examines whether and for what firms the adverse selection cost of debt is more than a theoretical possibility and how this cost relates to other costs of debt such as bankruptcy. In the absence of any direct measure of something that is unknown to investors and thus cannot be in the econometrician's information set, we present extensive strong and robust evidence in a large unbalanced panel of publicly traded US firms from 1971 to 2001 that firms avoid issuing debt when the outside market is likely to know little about their risk. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",adverse selection costs of debt; asymmetric information; Capital structure; pecking order; risk; security issuance,

Tradeoffs in Corporate Governance: Evidence from Board Structures and Charter Provisions,2011,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892993192&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139211000183&partnerID=40&md5=efa57d3ded30d9a0c2fac0b77c4cede9,"We provide arguments and present evidence that corporate governance structures are composed of interrelated mechanisms, which are in turn endogenous responses to the costs and benefits firms face when they choose those mechanisms. Examining board structures and the use of corporate charter provisions in a sample of more than 2,300 firms over a four-year period, we find that firms cluster in their use of governance mechanisms. In particular, the set of charter provisions that firms use, as measured by the Gompers et al. (2003) G Index, is associated with board structure, with the laws of the state in which the firm is incorporated, and with firm and industry characteristics. We also find that some governance structures appear to serve as substitutes. Specifically, firms that have powerful boards (as measured by board independence) also have the greatest number of charter provisions, suggesting that the market for corporate control is less effective as a monitoring mechanism for these firms. In contrast, firms that have less powerful boards tend to have few charter provisions, suggesting that the market for corporate control plays a greater monitoring role at such firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we employ three-stage least squares analysis to estimate these relationships within a system of equations. Our results from this analysis are consistent with the hypothesis that powerful boards serve as a substitute for the market for corporate control. Finally, our findings suggest that causality runs from the board to the choice of charter provisions, but not vice versa. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",board structure; charter provisions; complements or substitutes; Corporate governance; governance indices,

Housing Finance Reform: Should There Be a Government Guarantee?,2011,Quarterly Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046085249&doi=10.1142%2fS2010139211000201&partnerID=40&md5=12d37b3a1025e93d0a30396ae0ed4f10,"In 2007 and 2008, the mortgage market failed. It failed in a number of dimensions: Default rates rose to their highest levels since the great depression, and mortgage liquidity ground to a halt. This failure has produced recriminations: Blame has been laid at the feet of borrowers, brokers, lenders, investment banks, investors and government and quasi-government entities that guaranteed mortgages. These recent events have produced an important debate: Whether the U.S. mortgage market requires a federal guarantee in order to best serve consumers, investors and markets. My view is that such a guarantee is necessary. I will divide my argument into four areas: (1) I will argue that the United States has had a history of providing guarantees, either implicit or explicit, regardless of its professed position on the matter. This phenomenon goes back to the origins of the republic. It is in the best interest of the country to acknowledge the existence of such guarantees, and to price them appropriately before, rather than after, they become necessary. (2) I will argue that in times of economic stress, such as now, the absence of government guarantees would lead to an absence of mortgages. (3) I will argue that a purely ""private"" market would likely not provide a 30 year fixed rate pre-payable mortgage. I think that this is no longer a particularly controversial statement; what is more controversial is whether such a mortgage is necessary-I will argue that it is. (4) I will argue that in the absence of a federal guarantee, the price and quantity of mortgages will vary across geography. In particular, rural areas will have less access to mortgage credit that urban areas, central cities will have less access than suburbs. Condominiums already are treated less favorably than detached houses, and this difference is likely to get larger in the absence of a guarantee. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",government guarantees; moral hazard; Mortgages,

Predetermined financial variables are used to estimate both the conditional mean and volatility of equity returns, and these moments are combined to estimate the conditional Sharpe ratio, or the Sharpe ratio is estimated directly as a linear function of these same variables. In sample, estimated conditional Sharpe ratios show substantial timevariation that coincides with the phases of the business cycle. Generally, Sharpe ratios are low at the peak of the cycle and high at the trough. In an outofsample analysis, using 10year rolling regressions, relatively naive markettiming strategies that exploit this predictability can identify periods with Sharpe ratios more than 45% larger than the full sample value. In spite of the wellknown predictability of volatility and the more controversial forecastability of returns, it is the latter factor that accounts primarily for both the insample and outofsample results. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",predictability; Sharpe ratio; stock market,

The model explains why valuemaximizing firms conduct mergers that appear to lower shareholder value. In a Cournot setting, the model demonstrates a prisoners' dilemma for merging firms in a merger wave. Consistent with the model's implications, the paper empirically documents that horizontal mergers are followed by substantially worse performance when they occur during waves. Moreover, further empirical tests show that the empirical relation between performance and merger waves is independent of the method of payment and increasing in the acquirer's managerial ownership. These findings are difficult to reconcile with alternative interpretations from existing theories. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",,

These results imply that traditional unconditional performance measures understate the value added by active mutual fund managers in recessions, when investors' marginal utility of wealth is high. The riskadjusted performance (or alpha) difference between recession and expansion periods is statistically and economically significant at 3% to 5% per year. Our findings are based on a novel multivariate conditional regimeswitching performance methodology used to carry out one of the most comprehensive examinations of the performance of US domestic equity mutual funds in recessions and expansions from 1962 to 2005.

The greater is the commonality across assets in prior uncertainty about parameters, the more an asset's inferred expected return should depend on its having survived. If there is no commonality, then a surviving asset's average return can possess substantial sampling bias while nevertheless equaling the appropriate conditional expected return. Survival bias as typically computed generally makes too severe an adjustment to survivors, unless one assumes that expected returns on all assets, dead or alive, are equal to one common value that is completely unknown before observing returns data. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Survival bias; survival effects,

The economy studied in this paper consists of traditional (Markowitz) investors as well as statusseekers who are concerned about relative wealth. The model highlights the strategic and interdependent nature of portfolio selection in such a setting: Lowstatus investors look for portfolio choices that maximize their chances of moving up the ladder while highstatus investors look to maintain the status quo and hedge against these choices of the lowstatus investors. In equilibrium, asset returns obey a novel twofactor model in which one factor is the traditional market factor and the other is a particular high volatility factor that does not appear to have been identified so far in the theoretical or empirical literature. This twofactor model found significant support when tested with stock market data. Of particular interest is that the model and the empirical results attribute the low returns on idiosyncratic volatility stocks to their covariance with the portfolio of highly volatile stocks held by investors with relatively low status. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",asset pricing; Idiosyncratic risk; portfolio choice; status concerns,

We generalize Pratt's risk premium to uncertainty premium based on Klibanoff et al.'s (2005) smooth model of ambiguity. We show that the uncertainty premium can decrease with an increase in decision maker's risk aversion. This happens because increasing risk aversion always results in a lower ambiguity premium.

But convertible debt terms are usually set before the asset substitution opportunity. This allows shareholders and convertible debtholders to play a strategic noncooperative game. Two risk-shifting Nash equilibria are attainable: pure asset substitution when, despite no conversion, shareholders benefit from shifting risk, and strategic conversion when, despite early conversion, convertible debtholders expropriate wealth from straight debtholders. Even when initial convertible debt is designed to minimize the risk-shifting likelihood, the risk of asset substitution remains economically substantial-contrasting with the agency theoretic rationale for issuing convertible debt. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",Convertible debt; noncooperative game; risk-shifting,

We employ a new model where liquidity plays an important role in forecasting excess returns. We document the significant utility benefits an investor gains by optimally including corporate bond indices in his portfolio. The benefits are bigger for lower-grade bonds. We also find that investment-grade indices are different from high-yield indices in that different risks are priced in these two asset classes. One important difference is that there exist positive ""flight-To-liquidity"" premia in investment-grade bonds, but we find no such premia in high-yield bonds. We calculate the portfolio behavior and the utility benefits for three types of investors, the ""sophisticated"", the ""average"" and the ""lazy"" investor. We provide practical portfolio advice on investing throughout the business cycle and we study how the total allocations and hedging demands vary with the business conditions. In addition, utilizing our model, we evaluate the significance of the liquidity variable information for the investor. We find that the liquidity information greatly enhances the investor's portfolio performance.

We derive optimal contracts for delegated portfolio management and show that they always contain relative performance elements. We then show that this biases fund managers to deviate from return-maximizing portfolio allocations and follow those of their benchmark (herding). In many cases, the trustees of the fund who employ the fund manager prefer such a policy. We also show that fund managers in some situations ignore their own superior information and ""go with the flow"" in order to reduce deviations from their benchmark. We conclude that incentive provisions for portfolio managers are an important factor in their asset allocation decisions. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",delegated portfolio management; Herding; mutual funds,

For hedge funds, this link can be confirmed by comparing the return autocorrelations of funds with shorter vs. longer redemption-notice periods. We also document significant positive return-Autocorrelation in portfolios of securities that are generally considered less liquid, e.g., small-cap stocks, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and emerging-market investments. Using a sample of 2,927 hedge funds, 15,654 mutual funds, and 100 size-and book-To-market-sorted portfolios of US common stocks, we construct autocorrelation-sorted long/short portfolios and conclude that illiquidity premia are generally positive and significant, ranging from 2.74% to 9.91% per year among the various hedge funds and fixed-income mutual funds. We do not find evidence for this premium among equity and asset-Allocation mutual funds, or among the 100 US equity portfolios. The time variation in our aggregated illiquidity premium shows that while 1998 was a difficult year for most funds with large illiquidity exposure, the following four years yielded significantly higher illiquidity premia that led to greater competition in credit markets, contributing to much lower illiquidity premia in the years leading up to the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",equity premium; hedge funds; illiquidity; Liquidity; market microstructure; mutual funds,

Increasing automation and the entry of new trading platforms have resulted in intense competition among trading platforms. Despite these changes, traders still face the same challenges as before. They seek to minimize the total cost of trading, including commissions, bid/ask spreads, and market impact. New technologies allow traders to implement traditional strategies more effectively. For example, dark pools and indications of interest are just an updated form of tactics that NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) floor traders used to search for counterparties while minimizing the exposure of their clients' trading interest to prevent front running. Virtually every measurable dimension of US equity market quality has improved. Execution speeds and retail commissions have fallen. Bid-ask spreads have fallen and remain low, although they spiked upward along with volatility during the recent financial crisis. Market depth has increased. Studies of institutional transactions costs find US costs among the lowest in the world. Unlike during the Crash of 1987, the US equity market mechanism handled the increase in trading volume and volatility without disruption. However, our markets lack a market-wide risk management system that would deal with computer-generated chaos in real time, and our regulators should address this. 'Make or take' pricing, the charging of access fees to market orders that 'take' liquidity and paying rebates to limit orders that 'make' liquidity, causes distortions that should be corrected. Such charges are not reflected in the quotations used for the measurement of best execution. Direct access by nonbrokers to trading platforms requires appropriate risk management.

Given an initial population of individuals, each assigned a purely arbitrary behavior with respect to a binary choice problem, and assuming that offspring behave identically to their parents, only those behaviors linked to reproductive success will survive, and less reproductively successful behaviors will disappear at exponential rates. When the uncertainty in reproductive success is systematic, natural selection yields behaviors that may be individually sub-optimal but are optimal from the population perspective; when reproductive uncertainty is idiosyncratic, the individual and population perspectives coincide. This framework generates a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, and the simplicity and generality of our model suggest that these derived behaviors are primitive and nearly universal within and across species. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association.",adaptive markets hypothesis; behavioral finance; evolution; loss aversion; Probability matching; risk aversion; risk preferences,

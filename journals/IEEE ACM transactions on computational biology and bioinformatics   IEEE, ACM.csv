Naïve Bayesian classifiers with multinomial models for rRNA taxonomic assignment.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906216437&partnerID=40&md5=ec26d2c100a771ac1c847735c3f79a27,"The introduction of next-generation sequencing in ecological studies has created a major revolution in microbial and fungal ecology. Direct sequencing of hypervariable regions from ribosomal RNA genes can provide rapid and inexpensive analysis for ecological communities. To get deep understanding from these rRNA fragments, the Ribosomal Database Project developed the ""RDP Classifierâ utilizing 8-mer nucleotide frequencies with Bayesian theorem to obtain taxonomy affiliation. The classifier is computationally efficient and works well with massive short sequences. However, the binary model employed in the RDP classifier does not consider the repetitive 8-mers in each reference sequence. Previous studies have pointed out that multinomial model usually results a better performance than binary model. In this study, we present the naÃ-ve Bayesian classifiers with multinomial models that take repetitive 8-mers into account for classifying microbial 16S and fungal 28S rRNA sequences. The results obtained from the multinomial approach were compared with those obtained from the binomial RDP classifier by 250-bp, 400-bp, 800-bp, and full-length reads to demonstrate that the multinomial approach can generally achieve a higher predictive accuracy in most hypervariable regions.",,"Algorithms; Base Sequence; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Pattern Recognition, Automated; RNA, Ribosomal; Sequence Analysis, RNA; ribosome RNA; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; Bayes theorem; biological model; classification; computer simulation; genetics; methodology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; sequence analysis"
Fast computation of minimal cut sets in metabolic networks with a Berge algorithm that utilizes binary bit pattern trees.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906095977&partnerID=40&md5=ceb4afcccb9532b5579d498593719dda,"Minimal cut sets are a valuable tool for analyzing metabolic networks and for identifying optimal gene intervention strategies by eliminating unwanted metabolic functions and keeping desired functionality. Minimal cut sets rely on the concept of elementary flux modes, which are sets of indivisible metabolic pathways under steady-state condition. However, the computation of minimal cut sets is nontrivial, as even medium-sized metabolic networks with just 100 reactions easily have several hundred million elementary flux modes. We developed a minimal cut set tool that implements the well-known Berge algorithm and utilizes a novel approach to significantly reduce the program run time by using binary bit pattern trees. By using the introduced tree approach, the size of metabolic models that can be analyzed and optimized by minimal cut sets is pushed to new and considerably higher limits.",,"Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Metabolome; Models, Biological; Proteome; Signal Transduction; proteome; algorithm; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; human; metabolic flux analysis; metabolism; metabolome; methodology; physiology; signal transduction"
Statistical detection of boolean regulatory relationships.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906090034&partnerID=40&md5=56ff88578dd580d3e8ebcae2553de9f1,"A statistic tool for the detection of multivariate Boolean relationships is presented, with applications in the inference of gene regulatory mechanisms. A statistical test is developed for the detection of a nonzero discrete coefficient of determination (CoD) between predictor and target variables. This is done by framing the problem in the context of a stochastic logic model that naturally allows the inclusion of prior knowledge if available. The rejection region, p-value, statistical power, and confidence interval are derived and analyzed. Furthermore, the issue of multiplicity of tests due to presence of numerous candidate genes and logic relationships is addressed via FWER- and FDR-controlling approaches. The methodology is demonstrated by experiments using synthetic data and real data from a study on ionizing radiation (IR)-responsive genes. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is a promising tool for detection of gene regulatory relationships from gene-expression data. Software that implements the COD test is available online as an R package.",,"Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Logistic Models; Models, Genetic; Proteome; Signal Transduction; proteome; algorithm; article; biological model; computer simulation; gene expression regulation; genetics; signal transduction; statistical model"
Rough-fuzzy clustering for grouping functionally similar genes from microarray data.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894618805&doi=10.1109%2ftcbb.2012.103&partnerID=40&md5=3d3d5bfca37baf7a7f4bfaf3c0006ee4,"Gene expression data clustering is one of the important tasks of functional genomics as it provides a powerful tool for studying functional relationships of genes in a biological process. Identifying coexpressed groups of genes represents the basic challenge in gene clustering problem. In this regard, a gene clustering algorithm, termed as robust rough-fuzzy c-means, is proposed judiciously integrating the merits of rough sets and fuzzy sets. While the concept of lower and upper approximations of rough sets deals with uncertainty, vagueness, and incompleteness in cluster definition, the integration of probabilistic and possibilistic memberships of fuzzy sets enables efficient handling of overlapping partitions in noisy environment. The concept of possibilistic lower bound and probabilistic boundary of a cluster, introduced in robust rough-fuzzy c-means, enables efficient selection of gene clusters. An efficient method is proposed to select initial prototypes of different gene clusters, which enables the proposed c-means algorithm to converge to an optimum or near optimum solutions and helps to discover coexpressed gene clusters. The effectiveness of the algorithm, along with a comparison with other algorithms, is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on 14 yeast microarray data sets.",,"Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Fuzzy Logic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Fungal; Models, Genetic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Yeasts; algorithm; biological model; biology; cluster analysis; DNA microarray; fungal gene; fuzzy logic; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetics; procedures; yeast"
Evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility using improved genetic algorithms to generate genotype SNP barcodes.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893405040&doi=10.1109%2ftcbb.2013.27&partnerID=40&md5=c3a4f972a77df33c5f3e83657acd731d,"Genetic association is a challenging task for the identification and characterization of genes that increase the susceptibility to common complex multifactorial diseases. To fully execute genetic studies of complex diseases, modern geneticists face the challenge of detecting interactions between loci. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to detect the association of genotype frequencies of cancer cases and noncancer cases based on statistical analysis. An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is proposed to improve the reliability of the GA method for high-dimensional SNP-SNP interactions. The strategy offers the top five results to the random population process, in which they guide the GA toward a significant search course. The IGA increases the likelihood of quickly detecting the maximum ratio difference between cancer cases and noncancer cases. The study systematically evaluates the joint effect of 23 SNP combinations of six steroid hormone metabolisms, and signaling-related genes involved in breast carcinogenesis pathways were systematically evaluated, with IGA successfully detecting significant ratio differences between breast cancer cases and noncancer cases. The possible breast cancer risks were subsequently analyzed by odds-ratio (OR) and risk-ratio analysis. The estimated OR of the best SNP barcode is significantly higher than 1 (between 1.15 and 7.01) for specific combinations of two to 13 SNPs. Analysis results support that the IGA provides higher ratio difference values than the GA between breast cancer cases and noncancer cases over 3-SNP to 13-SNP interactions. A more specific SNP-SNP interaction profile for the risk of breast cancer is also provided.",,"Algorithms; Automatic Data Processing; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk; Signal Transduction; Tumor Markers, Biological; tumor marker; algorithm; biological model; biology; breast tumor; female; genetic database; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; information processing; procedures; risk; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model"
FNphasing: a novel fast heuristic algorithm for haplotype phasing based on flow network model.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894628743&doi=10.1109%2ftcbb.2013.18&partnerID=40&md5=6bae8bdb173d7be0f9e9cff27733d359,"An enormous amount of sequence data has been generated with the development of new DNA sequencing technologies, which presents great challenges for computational biology problems such as haplotype phasing. Although arduous efforts have been made to address this problem, the current methods still cannot efficiently deal with the incoming flood of large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a flow network model to tackle haplotype phasing problem, and explain some classical haplotype phasing rules based on this model. By incorporating the heuristic knowledge obtained from these classical rules, we design an algorithm FNphasing based on the flow network model. Theoretically, the time complexity of our algorithm is (O(n(2)m+m(2)), which is better than that of 2SNP, one of the most efficient algorithms currently. After testing the performance of FNphasing with several simulated data sets, the experimental results show that when applied on large-scale data sets, our algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art Beagle algorithm. FNphasing also achieves an equal or superior accuracy compared with other approaches.",,"Algorithms; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Genotype; Haplotypes; HapMap Project; Humans; Models, Genetic; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Recombination, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; algorithm; biological model; biology; computer simulation; DNA sequence; genetic recombination; genetics; genotype; haplotype; haplotype map; human; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism"
GENESHIFT: a nonparametric approach for integrating microarray gene expression data based on the inner product as a distance measure between the distributions of genes.,2013,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894638720&doi=10.1109%2ftcbb.2013.12&partnerID=40&md5=2b16b68c863abf1736f19f8d9b3c43fa,"The potential of microarray gene expression (MAGE) data is only partially explored due to the limited number of samples in individual studies. This limitation can be surmounted by merging or integrating data sets originating from independent MAGE experiments, which are designed to study the same biological problem. However, this process is hindered by batch effects that are study-dependent and result in random data distortion; therefore numerical transformations are needed to render the integration of different data sets accurate and meaningful. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold. First we propose GENESHIFT, a new nonparametric batch effect removal method based on two key elements from statistics: empirical density estimation and the inner product as a distance measure between two probability density functions; second we introduce a new validation index of batch effect removal methods based on the observation that samples from two independent studies drawn from a same population should exhibit similar probability density functions. We evaluated and compared the GENESHIFT method with four other state-of-the-art methods for batch effect removal: Batch-mean centering, empirical Bayes or COMBAT, distance-weighted discrimination, and cross-platform normalization. Several validation indices providing complementary information about the efficiency of batch effect removal methods have been employed in our validation framework. The results show that none of the methods clearly outperforms the others. More than that, most of the methods used for comparison perform very well with respect to some validation indices while performing very poor with respect to others. GENESHIFT exhibits robust performances and its average rank is the highest among the average ranks of all methods used for comparison.",,"Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Models, Statistical; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tissue Array Analysis; biology; computer program; computer simulation; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetic database; human; nonparametric test; procedures; reproducibility; statistical model; tissue microarray"
A new efficient data structure for storage and retrieval of multiple biosequences.,2012,"IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899772520&partnerID=40&md5=c06390ec01689b11bc557818b73e7ca3,"Today's genome analysis applications require sequence representations allowing for fast access to their contents while also being memory-efficient enough to facilitate analyses of large-scale data. While a wide variety of sequence representations exist, lack of a generic implementation of efficient sequence storage has led to a plethora of poorly reusable or programming language-specific implementations. We present a novel, space-efficient data structure (GtEncseq) for storing multiple biological sequences of variable alphabet size, with customizable character transformations, wildcard support and an assortment of internal representations optimized for different distributions of wildcards and sequence lengths. For the human genome (3.1 gigabases, including 237 million wildcard characters) our representation requires only 2 + 8 &#x00D7; 10^-6bits per character. Implemented in C, our portable software implementation provides a variety of methods for random and sequential access to characters and substrings (including different reading directions) using an object-oriented interface. In addition, it includes access to metadata like sequence descriptions or character distributions. The library is extensible to be used from various scripting languages. GtEncseq is much more versatile than previous solutions, adding features that were previously unavailable. Benchmarks show that it is competitive with respect to space and time requirements.",,"Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Genetic; Multigene Family; Sequence Analysis; algorithm; biological model; biology; genetic database; information retrieval; multigene family; procedures; sequence analysis"

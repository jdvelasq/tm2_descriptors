"Organizational slack, entrepreneurial orientation and product innovativeness: Evidence from China",2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863347233&partnerID=40&md5=944fc94784992c5edc58302f017d5e2a,"We use dynamic capability theory to examine the influence of EO on the relationship between slacks and product innovativeness, highlighting how this relationship might differ depending on the nature of the slack and the level of firm''s EO. In doing so, we extend the scope of dynamic capability theory by examining the moderating effect of EO on the slack 'C product innovativeness linkage. Using a sample of Chinese firms in high-technology sectors, we find that unabsorbed slack has a stronger positive relationship with product innovativeness than that absorbed slack has. Furthermore, EO positively moderates the relationship between unabsorbed slack and product innovativeness, whereas EO negatively moderates the relationship between absorbed slack and product innovativeness. Theoretical and empirical implications are also provided for shedding contributions in this interesting research area.",Entrepreneurial orientation; Organizational slack; Product innovativeness,Industry; Chinese firms; Dynamic capabilities; Entrepreneurial orientation; High-technology; Innovativeness; Moderating effect; Organizational slack; Research areas; Research
The entrepreneur's mode of entry: Business takeover or new venture start?,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858627266&partnerID=40&md5=ab33295dfcf6be0322b17dfd28ef3f97,"We extend the well-known occupational choice model of entrepreneurship by analyzing the mode of entry. Individuals can become entrepreneurs by taking over established businesses or starting up new ventures from scratch. We argue that the new venture creation mode is associated with higher levels of schooling whereas managerial experience, new venture start-up capital requirements and industry-level risk promote the takeover mode. A sample of data on entrepreneurs from the Netherlands provides broad support for these hypotheses, and also bear out a prediction that entrepreneurs whose parents run a family fi'rm tend to invest the least in schooling. We go on to discuss the implications for researchers, entrepreneurs and public policy-makers.",Business startup; Business takeover; Human capital,Business start-ups; Capital requirements; Human capitals; Managerial experiences; Netherlands; New venture creation; New ventures; Occupational choice; Policy makers; Start-ups; Research
Is it better to receive than to give? Empathy in the conflict-distress relationship,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858680132&partnerID=40&md5=369c116c70ff919ec999b2eaa45bb315,"The moderating effect of partner empathy on the relationship between both directions of workfamily conflict (work-to-family and family'to-work) and psychological distress of both the job incumbent and partner are examined in this study. Considering empathy as a specific dimension of emotional social support, we hypothesized that receiving empathy would buffer negative spillover to the job incumbent while giving empathy would exacerbate negative crossover to the partner. A study of 270 job incumbents and their partners revealed that receiving partner empathy fully buffered spillover effects due to family-to-work conflict but had no effects with work-to-family conflict. Interestingly we also found that giving partner empathy buffered the crossover effects on family-to-work conflict and had no effects with work-to-family conflict. Implications of these findings and avenues for future research are discussed.",Distress; Empathy; Work-family conflict,Crossover effects; Distress; Empathy; Moderating effect; Social support; Spillover effects; Work-family conflict; Research
r WG is not enough: Detecting subgroup disagreement,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858640758&partnerID=40&md5=aca7051552ab539dd6801a85bcb30ef8,"Within-group agreement is traditionally measured with the rWG family of indices. These variance-based indices can detect the absence of consensus, but are not designed to detect when the members of a group have split into two or more disagreeing subgroups. This article introduces and reviews four subgroup disagreement tests that can detect this pattern of disagreement: (1) the visual inspection test, (2) the mixture modeling test, (3) Silverman's multimodality test, and (4) the dip test. A subgroup disagreement test should be used whenever researchers calculate the level of agreement within a group.",Multilevel; RWG; Within-group agreement,Management science; Research; Dip tests; Mixture modeling; Multi-modality; Multilevel; RWG; Visual inspection; Testing
Nursing home financial performance: The role of ownership and chain affiliation,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863373083&partnerID=40&md5=87b89c79b509c90ea82e2f7672c7dd51,"Using longitudinal data for a national sample of nursing homes for the period of 1999- 2004, this study examined the effects of ownership (for-profit status) and chain affiliation on financial performance. Data included the Medicare Cost Reports, the On-line Survey Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR), and the Area Resource File (ARF). The dependent variable consisted of financial performance tier based on operating and total margins: low (bottom 10%), medium (middle 80%), and high (top 10%). Independent variables included four ownership/chain affiliation combinations: for-profit chain, for-profit independent, not-for-profit chain, not-for-profit independent. Control variables consisted of size, payer mix, occupancy rate, case mix, Herfindahl Index, excess capacity, hospital-based nursing home beds, metropolitan area, percent of population over 65, and per capita income. Ordered logit regression results show that for-profit nursing homes had better operating margins than not-for-profit homes, but the latter outperformed for-profit homes among independents with respect to total margins.

The spatial and temporal dynamics of entrepreneurial activity: New firm creation in Korea,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858692525&partnerID=40&md5=c7fa120564766081f0afa5885408c631,"While the analysis of temporal dependency is well-established, in entrepreneurship research the issue of spatial heterogeneity ' how not just the phenomena of interest (e.g., new firm formation) but also the relationships of interest (e.g., the predictors of start-up activity) differ from region to region ' has neither been extensively discussed nor subject to significant methodological evolution. In this paper we respond to the challenge to engage seriously with the issue of spatial dependence in entrepreneurship research, and with the need to develop new approaches to the analysis of this dependence, through the analysis of both temporal and spatial dependence in new firm creation. An application of the combined serial and spatial dynamic panel regression with system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to study of a new regional data set on the formation of new manufacturing firms in Korea over the period of 2000-2004 indicates that new firm creation is serially and spatially correlated, which highlights the significance of temporal and spatial dynamics in entrepreneurship activity.",Korea; New firm creation; Spatial dynamic panel,Research; Data sets; Entrepreneurial activity; Generalized method of moments; Korea; Manufacturing firms; New firm creation; Spatial dependence; Spatial dynamics; Spatial heterogeneity; Start-ups; Temporal and spatial dynamics; Temporal dynamics; Industry

Interviews with trainers showed that the organization uses institutionalized socialization tactics that seek to impose an organizationally espoused identity on newcomers, thereby imbuing organizational identification. Interviews with trainees showed that an individual's organizational identification is generated through a twofold process'cognitive path and affective path. Subsequent quantitative analysis with longitudinal survey data from trainees confirmed this process of organizational identification. It also revealed that mentor identification, overlapping both paths, plays a significant role in increasing organizational identification, but this is not necessarily true for team identification.",Korea; Organizational identification; Organizational socialization,Industry; Social sciences; Korea; Multi methods; Organizational identifications; Organizational socialization; Survey data; Team identification; Training program; Personnel training
"The ""live-case"" intervention method: Leadership skills through experiential learning",2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858691036&partnerID=40&md5=935f1aa251da480e95b2d1bb4bd3861b,"This paper describes a pedagogical technique that has been used successfully for over 35 years as a capstone experience in selected Executive MBA programs: the live-case intervention. This method consists of a CEO bringing to the classroom a strategic issue that he/she is currently struggling with and having a team of students address the strategic challenge real-time together with the CEO. The technique builds on the organization development and change framework presented by Coghlan and Rashford (2006) which provides a blueprint for the student team to tackle the issue in class through a question-and-answer format. The ensuing dialogue and analysis becomes a living example of how the CEO thinks and makes decisions for the benefit of the whole class. We describe the live case intervention in detail, examine process considerations, and discuss its advantages and limitations. We argue that the resulting active participation in the CEO's thought process as he/she seeks to solve a significant problem, i.e., the opportunity to 'see the wheels turning' and follow all streams of thought (including those with a dead end), is of the upmost importance in developing the tacit knowledge that is so valuable for senior executives. We further argue that a by-product of participation in several of these live case interventions is an expanded ability to engage in systemic thinking and to bridge theory and application in an open way. We also report anecdotal evidence that both students and CEOs who have gone through this process have benefitted substantially.",Experiential learning; Life case; Management education,Students; Anecdotal evidences; Bridge theories; Capstone experience; Experiential learning; Intervention methods; Leadership skills; Management education; Organization development; Pedagogical technique; Strategic challenges; Strategic issues; Student teams; Systemic thinking; Tacit knowledge; Thought process; Teaching
National institutional differences and performance of international venture capital syndicates,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863376996&partnerID=40&md5=b828701e6af6a025222b5b9a1196bbf3,"The VC industry represents a context where global convergence of industry practices and professional culture has occurred. Thus the industry provides a unique opportunity to study the role of cross national institutional differences on the performance of international business in a globalizing economy. We investigate whether and how cross national institutional differences affect the performance of international VC syndicates and the roles that international experience plays in attenuating the impacts of such differences. We argue that differences in national informal and formal institutions are reflected in value systems, standard operating procedures, contingency response patterns, and in the ways of perceiving, communicating, and relating. Such differences are likely to increase transaction costs and conflict, reduce the effectiveness of collaboration among syndicate partners, and amplify the liability of foreignness in relations with the investee. Some cross national differences, however, also represent opportunities permitting the exploitation of complementarities. We also argue that while international experience may close the gaps in formal institutional differences, which are reflected more strongly in practices, it is less likely to close the gaps in cultural differences, which are reflected more strongly in values. Based on over 11,000 international venture capital investments between 1990 and 2008, we find strong empirical evidence to support our theoretical arguments.

We collected multisource data from 400 white collar workers and their supervisors in 86 organizational teams. Results show that educational background similarity and team members' relative expertise predict the development of perceived expertise affirmation within teams. Team longevity and team size explain differences between teams in their levels of perceived expertise affirmation. Moreover, we show that, at the individual level, perceived expertise affirmation is positively related to supervisor-rated individual performance. At the team level, perceived expertise affirmation is also positively related to supervisor-rated team performance, but only in teams with a shared mental model of 'who knows what'.",Expertise; Interpersonal perception; Teams,Expertise; Individual performance; Multi-level; Multilevel model; Multisource data; Shared mental model; Team members; Team performance; Team size; Teams; Work team; Supervisory personnel

Understanding overbidding behavior in C2C auctions: An escalation theory perspective,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858650271&partnerID=40&md5=8fddd3725345649350391679d82a6ba8,"With millions of online auctions per day, sites such as eBay have revolutionized how consumers buy and sell goods from one another. Despite the benefits associated with online consumer-toconsumer (C2C) auctions, there can be drawbacks. Consumers who purchase goods in online auctions may get caught up in auction fever, causing them to engage in overbidding, and sometimes leading to what has been referred to as the winner's curse. While several theoretical explanations have been proposed to explain overbidding behavior, there has been little empirical work in this area. Drawing on escalation theory, this study develops and tests a model of the overbidding behavior exhibited by individuals in on-line auction settings. Our model posits that certain escalation drivers such as sunk cost, the completion effect, and self-justification affect an individual's willingness to continue bidding which, in turn, influences overbidding behavior. Survey data collected from 250 on-line auction participants was used to test the model using partial least squares analysis. Sunk cost, the completion effect, and self- justification were all found to have significant impacts on overbidding behavior that were either partially or fully mediated by willingness to continue bidding. We also found that competition intensity moderates the relationship between willingness to continue and overbidding behavior such that when competition is more intense, the relationship becomes even stronger. The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.",Escalation; Online auctions; Overbidding,Electronic commerce; Research; Surveys; Auction settings; Escalation; Online auctions; Overbidding; Partial least squares analysis; Significant impacts; Sunk cost; Survey data; Theoretical explanation; Winner's curse; Consumer behavior

Is foreign investment for outperformers or underperformers?

It is argued that a firm's performance relative to its aspiration levels influences its propensity to engage in foreign investment as well as its choice of investment location. We propose that an improvement in performance relative to aspiration levels of performance reduces the propensity for international investment and that the deterrent impact of country distance on foreign entry is contingent on relative performance. Consistent with the theory, an analysis of investments in foreign manufacturing facilities made by 206 Japanese machinery firms between 1986 and 2002 shows that foreign investment propensity is overall negatively related to prior firm performance relative to aspiration levels. The likelihood of foreign investment decreases when firm performance exceeds historical and social aspirations. The probability of foreign entry does not significantly increase as performance falls below aspirations, however is still greater than when performance exceeds aspirations. In addition, outperforming and underperforming firms were more likely to enter host countries with larger geographic and institutional distances from Japan, implying extended search efforts and/or greater risk-taking behavior.",FDI; Location Choice; Performance feedback,Industry; International law; Location; Machinery; Corporate performance; FDI; Firm Performance; Foreign investment; Host countries; International investments; Location Choice; Machinery firms; Manufacturing facility; Performance feedback; Relative performance; Risk taking; Investments

CEOs who have an incentive to take large risks and pursue the maximum level of profit may not divert organizational resource into corporate social responsibility-related issues, which do not contribute to profit immediately. In addition to establishing a conceptual link between stock-based CEO compensation and CSP, this paper clarifies their relationship by addressing three empirical issues overlooked in previous studies. First, I examine the possible difference between cumulative and annual stock option grants. Second, I examine the unique effect of in-the-money stock options. Third, I show that accounting for firm-level unobserved heterogeneities makes a substantial difference in estimation results. The results reveal that the relationships between stock-based compensation and CSP are substantially different when unobserved heterogeneities are accounted for, that a single year''s stock option grant does not have a significant impact on CSP while a cumulative grant does, and that in-the-money and at-the-money stock options have opposite effects on CSP.",Corporate social performance; Risk-taking; Stock-based CEO compensation,Industry; Estimation results; Risk taking; Significant impacts; Social performance; Social responsibilities; Stock options; Unobserved heterogeneity; Profitability

We first contrast several critical theory strands to articulate whether, when and how beneficiaries may (or may not) engage in value creation in cross-sector partnerships. We then introduce the construct of beneficiary voice to delineate three distinct roles that beneficiaries may play in value creation in cross-sector partnerships: voice-receiving, voice-making and voice-taking. For each role, we unpack the principles, relations and relational processes underpinning value creation. We then develop a set of generative tensions that help 'fill out' the interstices among different critical theory strands. The resulting creative hybrid of critical management theories complements mainstream management theorizing by contributing a more nuanced and more overtly socialized relational foundation of value creation to the resource based view.",Beneficiary voice; Cross-sector partnerships; Value creation,Cross-sector partnerships; Management theory; Resource-based view; Value creation; Mergers and acquisitions

Macro practices of R&D management and micro behaviors of scientists,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858667498&partnerID=40&md5=683cc0992e1aac1f0d9b4c5407526465,"A better understanding of decision making under uncertainty has led to the wide diffusion of firm-level practices such as sequential investments and portfolio diversification to manage R&D projects. While the impact of these choices on firm R&D productivity has been extensively examined, their effect on micro-behaviors of scientists has been understudied. We argue that midway project termination, a consequence of sequential investments and portfolio diversification, creates a sorting process among R&D scientists and results in a separation between scientists that disagree with the termination decision and those that do not. The likelihood of disagreement is systematically higher in projects that are characterized by higher uncertainty and for scientists that are more productive and talented. Using longitudinal scientist level data on pharmaceutical discovery, we find consistent evidence that scientists pursuing more novel projects at the frontier of science, and scientists with higher quality, productivity, and diversity in their research, are more likely to leave incumbent firms to pursue their ideas elsewhere. This finding underlines a reverse lemons problem in the market for R&D scientists. We discuss the theoretical implications for management of R&D scientists and their effect on firm-level R&D productivity.",Innovation management; R&D strategy,Industry; Productivity; Research; Decision making under uncertainty; Innovation management; Pharmaceutical discovery; Portfolio diversification; Project termination; Sequential investments; Sorting process; Wide diffusion; Behavioral research

A new ontology of agency is proposed which explains disruptive endogenous agency in highly institutionalized settings based on the inherent tensions between three autonomous, but interpenetrating categories of agency: institutional, strategic, and relational affective.",Agency; Institutions; Tradition,Agency; Cambridge; Tradition; Societies and institutions

Emerging markets like India are also characterized by a large number of family owned and managed businesses. Therefore, we attempt to unravel the moderating influences of family business on the internationalization-governance relationship. We utilized multidimensional and comprehensive measures to assess firms' degree of internationalization and to identify family business firms. The use of multiple theoretical lenses drawing from the information processing, agency and resource dependence streams enabled us to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of the impact of internationalization on governance. The extent of internationalization positively influences CEO compensation and the percentage of outside directors on company boards, whereas it negatively influences CEO duality. These findings offer strong support for the information processing and resource dependence perspectives. We find some evidence that family businesses negatively moderate the underlying relationship between internationalization and governance. Therefore, on the one hand family businesses mitigate the primary principal-agency problems, but on the other hand they exacerbate the secondary principal-principal agency problem. This paper contributes to the relatively sparse literature examining internationalization influences on governance, particularly in emerging economies. It provides several insights through employing multiple theoretical lenses in examining internationalization- governance relationships in emerging economy contexts.",Board characteristics; Family business; Internationalization,Data processing; Industrial management; Board characteristics; Corporate governance; Degree of internationalization; Emerging economies; Emerging markets; Family business; Indian firms; Internationalization; Principal agencies; Industry

In addition, we found several significant cross-foci interactions among the components. Namely, affective and normative commitments to beneficiaries were more strongly related to turnover intentions when affective organizational commitment was low. Similarly, normative commitment to beneficiaries was more strongly related to turnover intentions when the lack of alternatives dimension of continuance organizational commitment was low while continuance commitment to beneficiaries was more strongly related to turnover intentions when lack of alternatives was high.

Considering the dynamic aspects of industry growth is important in that the sources of competitive advantage change over time as an industry grows, thereby affecting the competitive positions of foreign firms in a host country''s market. We collected and analyzed 5-year panel data of the Korean asset management industry, and our data show that possessing firm-specific resources and capabilities becomes more important for firm performance as the industry grows. Additionally, we find that foreign firms'' disadvantageous position in accessing location-specific resources diminishes while the advantageous position of foreign firms in firm-specific capabilities strengthens as the industry grows.

But how can entrepreneurs encourage interns to join? Based on social identity theory (Ashforth & Mael, 1989) and organizational justice theory (Sweeney & McFarlin, 1993), I hypothesize that the extent to which interns can get involved with the host organizations has positive effects on interns' intentions to join after controlling for their preinternship infiltration intentions, and such effects are mediated by perceived justice. Longitudinal data were collected from 104 entrepreneurship interns, and the results support my hypotheses. In addition, I compared entrepreneurship interns with a group of 175 corporate interns using multigroup structural equation modeling analysis, and found entrepreneurship interns are more likely to change their minds after the internship, and justice perception plays a more significant role among them.",Entrepreneurship; Justice; Recruitment,Entrepreneurial firms; Entrepreneurship; Justice; Longitudinal data; Multi-group; Recruitment; Social identity theories; Structural equation modeling; Human resource management

We argue that, in new technological domains, portfolio capability diversity'the partners' mix of skills'follows a path of initial increase centered on exploratory learning, followed by a decrease focused on exploitative learning. Importantly, the rate at which capability diversity peaks depends upon the dominant mode of alliance governance. The greater asset specificity and interdependence in strongly governed alliances constrain the scope of external capabilities available to the firm and accelerate partner-specific learning, leading to an earlier peak in capability diversity than in portfolios with weakly governed alliances. These ideas are supported in our analysis of 760 alliance portfolios from the fuel cell industry, suggesting that governance choices can lead to heterogeneity in firm capabilities.",Alliance portfolio; Capability evolution; Governance,Alliance portfolio; Asset specificity; Capability evolution; Dominant mode; Exploratory learning; Firm capabilities; Fuel cell industry; Governance; Industry

Drawing on previous research, we argue that reframing, defined as a switch in the frame of reference from which a problem is approached, constitutes an important process to consider in explaining creative benefits on the group level. Based on an analysis of the relevant literature on group composition and processes we identify the interplay of a group's diversity and the degree to which group members engage in perspective taking as crucial antecedents to both reframing and group level creativity. We hypothesize that perspective taking moderates the effect of functional role diversity on group creativity and that this moderation effect is mediated by reframing. Results of a group experiment manipulating both diversity and perspective taking in students groups (N=77) performing a creative task largely confirm our propositions. Perspective taking and diversity interact to predict group creativity. Furthermore, audio-video coded use of reframing in the group interaction partially mediates this moderated effect. Our results indicate the importance of perspective taking to realize the potential diverse groups hold. Accordingly, in order to increase our knowledge on how to manage diverse teams, further research of the factors conducive to perspective taking represents a promising avenue for future research.",Creativity; Diversity; Teams,Creative work; Creativity; Diversity; Frame of reference; Group composition; Group interaction; Group level; Group members; Perspective taking; Reframing; Team creativity; Teams; Research

In an empirical examination of the downstream laser printer industry and upstream laser engine industry, we first replicate empirical results commonly found in the organizational ecology literature. We then show that an increase in the density of upstream suppliers reduces mortality rates for downstream firms. This relationship is more pronounced for the density of non-integrated upstream firms than for that of integrated upstream firms. We also find that expansion of the empirical lens to include vertically related populations alters a key empirical regularity of the extant organizational ecology literature.",Industry evolution; Organizational ecology; Vertical integration,Ecology; Integration; Empirical examination; Empirical regularities; Governance forms; Industry evolution; Laser engines; Laser printers; Mortality rate; Organizational ecology; Vertical integration; Industry

In other words, treating the hazardous traces of our actions alone is insufficient without modifying our values and norms. Building on a longitudinal study of sustainability in the car industry, we argue that the prevailing techno-centered discourse on green information technology and the consequent actions are unlikely to yield the desired outcome. In turn, we suggest that an understanding of the sociomateriality of the construction and disruption of technological development is indispensible for triggering the desired change toward sustainable information technology. Therefore, we propose extending the prevailing scope of Green IT/IS discourse to include a wide array of sustainable value considerations. Sustainable value refers to value as worth and value as norms. Hence, rather than focusing on ecological sustainability alone, sustainable value refers to a broader conception of value that includes economic, social and environmental value for all stakeholders involved. Moreover, sustainable value is about nourishing normative values that support and promote system-wide sustainable attitudes, behaviors and practices. Following the analysis of the path-dependent nature and the sociomateriality of sustainable value creation in the automotive industry, we apply a number of relevant insights to the information technology domain. First, our results demonstrate the pathdependent nature of sustainable technological development, which is constrained and influenced by the materiality, social structures, and institutional frameworks that comprise the overall sociotechnical system. Second, our findings show that respective social and institutional support is needed to complement technological innovation in order to disrupt existing paths and construct more sustainable alternatives. Third, our results suggest that sustainable value creation requires a concerted effort of all stakeholders to reshape existing norms and values, formulate new standards, and reconfigure work systems vis-'-vis the social and environmental vistas of sustainable value.

We use signaling theory to develop theoretical arguments on the dual effects of signals in M&A markets: Signals are beneficial to an acquirer in reducing its risk of adverse selection, but have the drawback of offering similar benefits to other potential bidders. This creates a contracting problem for the focal acquirer that risks losing any deal-specific investments it makes in due diligence, negotiations, and post-acquisition planning if the target would sell to another firm. Under these conditions, acquirers can secure the deal by negotiating termination payment provisions (TPPs) in the form of termination fees and lockup options. Our empirical analyses focus upon acquisitions of newly-public firms and reveal that market signals available during and after the IPO increase the usage of TPPs in acquisition contracting.",Initial public offerings; Mergers and acquisitions; Termination fees,Economics; Investments; Mergers and acquisitions; Research; Risk assessment; Risk management; Adverse selection; Dual effect; Due diligence; Empirical analysis; Information economics; Initial public offerings; Potential bidders; Signaling theory; Termination fees; Theoretical arguments; Sales

An inductive comparative case study of four social enterprises embedded in competing 'social welfare' and 'commercial' logics suggests that when facing these competing organizational templates, organizations attempt at striking a balance at the organizational level by adopting a combination of 'pure' practices from each logic rather than by compromising on each practice. Data shows that organizations emanating from the business world adopted more social practices than organizations originating from the social sector.

Driven by the various institutional, social and economic forces, a FPN develops through several distinctive stages, which in turn, partly explain variations in foreign subsidiary performance. Our analysis of 1,685 FPNs involving 26,439 Japanese foreign subsidiaries worldwide confirmed our arguments.

In this paper, I theorize a link between macro-level field outcomes and the micro-foundations of reactions to the intentional actions by field entrepreneurs. When field entrepreneurs in pursuit of resources frame their ideas broadly enough to connect to multiple audiences, they increase both the diversity of field participants and the ambiguity of the field. While moderate levels of diversity permit nascent fields to develop, too much diversity undermines development of either a clear identity or consistent evaluation criteria.

However, literature about the comparison of work attitudes between public and nonprofit managers is scant. The current study addresses this topic. By using the NASP-III survey data, the author found that nonprofit managers are more likely than public managers to show positive work attitudes. This attitudinal difference, based on the results of mediation tests, originates from two important reasons. First, higher levels of rule constraints (i.e. red tape and personnel flexibility) in the public sector undermine managers'' work attitudes. Second, individuals attracted to work in the public sector have stronger extrinsic motivation, stronger amotivation, and weaker intrinsic motivation. These motivation styles compromise their work attitudes.",Mediation; Public-nonprofit comparison; Work attitudes,Job satisfaction; Management; Managers; Motivation; Research; Empirical studies; Extrinsic motivation; Intrinsic motivation; Mediation; Organizational Commitment; Private sectors; Public sector; Public-nonprofit comparison; Red tape; Survey data; Work attitudes; Human resource management
Where to explore?

However, exploring new knowledge domains beyond one's existing expertise is also challenging and fraught with uncertainty. A firm's appetite for the inherent uncertainty of exploring new domains may be limited in an already uncertain environment.To reconcile this dilemma, firms can explore new and unfamiliar domains by mimicking other firms that have borrowed knowledge originally created by the exploring firm. Recipient firms often combine the originating firm's knowledge with knowledge outside of the originating firm's areas of expertise. In doing so, these recipient firms provide insight to the originating firm regarding the viability of exploring such new knowledge. By mimicking their recipient firms, the challenge and uncertainty of exploring these new knowledge domains is reduced for the originating firm. We examine the exploration activities of 87 telecommunications equipment manufacturers over a 10-year time period. We argue that those firms that operate in competitive and dynamic market environments will more highly value such uncertainty reduction and rely to a greater extent on recipient firms for guidance as to where to explore for new expertise. Whereas firms in munificent, high-growth market environments are more likely to look beyond the activities of recipient firms when exploring new technological domains and rely less on mimicry.",Exploration; Imitation; Spillovers,Natural resources exploration; Telecommunication equipment; Dynamic market; Equipment manufacturers; High growth markets; Imitation; Industry growth; Knowledge domains; Knowledge spillovers; Spillovers; Time-periods; Uncertainty reduction; Industry

We theorize how hospital performance is contingent upon network embeddedness, the extent to which a hospital is involved in a network of interconnected inter-organizational relationships. Objective: To explore the effects on hospital performance resulting from both collaborative network ties and competitive relationships between providers. Methods: We used panel data collected between 2003-2007 from 35 hospitals (n=175) in Abruzzo, one of the most populated regions of the central Italy. We use secondary data of hospital activities regarding both clinical and administrative aspects. For each year, we examine the intensity of inter-hospital competition and the unique position each provider has within a larger network of relationships with other hospitals. As well, other idiosyncratic organizational characteristics are examined. Findings: Our results show that hospital productivity is both negatively related to the degree of competition a hospital faces, and positively related to the degree with which hospitals establish collaborative relationships. We also found that the negative impact on hospital productivity due to competitive aggressiveness was lessened when hospitals were more likely to create cooperative network ties. Practice Implications: Because inter-hospital collaboration and competition are related to organizational performance, they should constitute a core element in the strategic planning of a hospital's operation. In particular, health administrators should implement policies that favor collaborative network ties at the regional level, and hospital managers should mitigate the rivalries facing their organizations when establishing collaborative relationships with local competitors.",Hospital performance; Inter-hospital rivalry; Network ties,Productivity; Central Italy; Collaborative network; Collaborative relationships; Competition and cooperation; Cooperative networks; Core elements; Health systems; Hospital activities; Inter-hospital rivalry; Inter-organizational relationships; Larger networks; Network embeddedness; Network tie; Network ties; Organizational characteristics; Organizational performance; Panel data; Regional levels; Hospitals

Organizational learning studies in these settings have largely investigated autonomous learning via cumulative experience as a strategy for needed performance improvement. Whether induced learning through the use of deliberate learning activities provides additional performance benefits has been neglected. We argue that the use of deliberate learning activities offers performance benefits beyond those of cumulative experience because their use counters the learning challenges presented by rapid knowledge growth, uncertainty, and complexity in dynamic settings. We test whether there are additional performance benefits to using deliberate learning activities and whether the effectiveness of these activities depends on interdisciplinary collaboration in the workgroup. We test our hypotheses in a study of 23 hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The results support our hypothesis that the use of deliberate learning activities is positively associated with workgroup performance, as measured by NICUs' risk-adjusted mortality rates for 1061 patients, after accounting for cumulative experience. Moreover, our data show that the use of deliberate learning activities is associated with improved workgroup performance equivalent to the benefit of cumulative experience (20% reduction in mortality). Contrary to prediction, interdisciplinary collaboration mediates, rather than moderates, the relationship between the use of deliberate learning activities and workgroup performance. Thus, our data suggest that the use of deliberate learning activities fosters interdisciplinary collaboration.",Deliberate learning; Interdisciplinary collaboration; Organizational learning,Intensive care units; Knowledge management; Autonomous learning; Complex environments; Deliberate learning; Dynamic services; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Learning Activity; Mortality rate; Neonatal intensive care units; Organizational learning; Performance benefits; Performance improvements; Risk-adjusted; Workgroup performance; Workgroups; Human resource management

The paper juxtaposes geographical proximity and triadic closure ' i.e. the formation of closed triangles ' as two alternative mechanisms in the evolution of networks. It argues that the role of both mechanisms is subject to change over time as the technological regime of an industry changes. More precisely, the paper proposes that geographical proximity between inventors is mostly relevant for tie formation in the early stage of the industry, when knowledge is predominantly tacit. By contrast, the closed triangles as produced by triadic closure act as vehicles of trust gaining relevance once the industry gets more established, with higher levels of knowledge codification and the associated risk of unintended and costly knowledge leakages. These trends are empirically tested taking biotechnology in Germany as an example of an evolving, spatially agglomerated knowledge-intensive industry. On the basis of a patent-based reconstruction of the inventor network and a stochastic estimation model of network evolution, the study confirms that geographical proximity becomes less important and triadic closure more important over time as a determinant of tie formation.",Biotechnology; Geographical proximity; Network dynamics,Biotechnology; Dynamics; Geographical proximity; Germany; Industry change; Knowledge codification; Knowledge-intensive industries; Network dynamics; Network evolution; Stochastic estimation; Technological regime; Industry

We introduce the concept of 'capability cues,' which are contextual signals that decision makers might reasonably interpret as indicators of their current level of overall ability, arguing that positive cues will induce boldness, while negative cues will induce timidity. Drawing from prior theory and research about how narcissists react to stimuli, we hypothesize that highly narcissistic CEOs will be relatively unresponsive to objective indicators of their performance; in contrast, highly narcissistic CEOs will be exceptionally emboldened by social praise (in the forms of media praise and media awards). We test our theory on a longitudinal sample of 152 CEOs in the computer hardware and software sectors, using multiple archival data sources. We find considerable support for our several hypotheses, thus opening a new theoretical avenue, and contributing new evidence, regarding the antecedents of risk-taking.",Capability cues; CEOs; Risk-taking,Computer hardware; Contrast media; Decision making; Risk management; Software testing; Archival data; Capability cues; CEOs; Chief executive officer; Current levels; Decision makers; Hardware and software; Risk taking; Risk assessment

The model proposed in this paper aims to examine the nature and features of the integration process using a knowledge lens to view the cultural/organizational integration mechanism, leading to integration effectiveness. Drawing from advances in the acquisition, strategic HRM, knowledge management and leadership literatures, the model identifies knowledge-leadership, cultural knowledge integration, early involvement in integration process design, and variables related to causal ambiguity, under the rubric of a relational (or cooperative) HR archetype, as key components of an effective set of practices for integration in these contexts. The model explains the processes through which these constructs impact integration effectiveness.

Using two waves of data, we find that change in pay satisfaction has a statistically significant and negative relationship with change in WFC. A finer-grained analysis reveals the facets of satisfaction with benefits and pay structure are significantly and negatively related to WFC whereas satisfaction with pay level and pay raise are not. We also examine the role of perceived job inputs in moderating the pay satisfaction-WFC relationship. We find that the non-job related input of number of children and the job-related input of education both moderate the relationship between pay satisfaction and WFC.

Broadly, these biotech firms possess competency in the initial discovery stage of the lengthy and complex drug-development cycle. For the remaining downstream stages of product development, the biotech firms form strategic alliances. We examine alliances between biotech firms and pharmaceutical players and the association with entrepreneurial success. Specifically, we focus on two aspects of entrepreneurial behavior in alliances: depth (or multiple alliances with the same pharmaceutical player) and operating with a product development orientation (or having multiple partnerships within an alliance, focusing on not just R&D but also production, marketing, and distribution activities). Employing regression analysis on a full sample of 1408 biotech firms and re-running the analysis on a sub-sample of 395 publicly listed firms, we find that depth depicts an inverted Ushape relationship with the likelihood of entrepreneurial success.

The existing literature is relatively silent on the question whether ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium are equally viable mechanisms, or what would be the conditions under which one model would be prevalent over the other. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether for service firms, the question of ambidexterity is as important as it is for manufacturing firms, and whether there are differences in the way a balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved. Drawing on longitudinal data of the Belgian Community Innovation Survey and the bel-first database, we examine 532 firms. Results show that both ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium have a positive effect on firm performance growth. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in innovation behavior between service firms and manufacturing firms, whereby manufacturing firms are more likely to use the ambidexterity model and service firms the punctuated equilibrium model. As the positive effect on financial performance did not explain the difference in the use of various methods to achieve ambidexterity, we performed multiple case study research to understand in'depth the drivers why service firms prefer the punctuated equilibrium over the simultaneous ambidexterity model. Environmental pressure, leadership and available resources can be considered as the main drivers why managers prefer ambidexterity or punctuated equilibrium.",Ambidexterity; Punctuated equilibrium; Service firms,Ambidexterity; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Community innovation surveys; Environmental pressures; Exploration and exploitation; Financial performance; Punctuated equilibrium; Service firms; Manufacture

However, in the presence of a serious performance downfall, declining demand, or external institutional pressures, workforce downsizing sometimes cannot be avoided. Therefore, the primary question for most companies is not whether or not to downsize but rather how to downsize successfully. So far, however, few empirical studies have focused on the internal characteristics of the downsizing process that influence the relationship between workforce downsizing and organizational performance. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing the effects of magnitude, timing, and realization of workforce downsizing on downsizing firms' subsequent financial performance. Based on an analysis of the workforce downsizing actions by the largest European firms (Eurostoxx 50/Stoxx50) between 1996 to 2006, we find that the relationship between the magnitude of workforce downsizing and subsequent firm profitability is non-linear. Counter intuitively, however, the relationship is not inverted U-shaped but U-shaped. Further, findings suggest that this relationship is enhanced by the early timing of the downsizing and weakened by the use of divestitures for realizing the workforce reduction.",Downsizing; Firm profitability; Timing,Profitability; Timing circuits; Downsizing; Financial performance; Firm profitabilities; Institutional pressures; Internal characteristics; Organizational performance; Timing; Workforce reduction; Personnel

Based on the CCO perspective, terrorist organizations can be conceptualized as essentially consisting of communicative events which necessitate to become interconnected over time. Keeping in mind this rather ephemeral notion of organizations, CCO points our attention to the constitutive conditions which allow for the emergence and stabilization of terrorist organizing.

Although ranking mechanisms are not new, they become 'powercharged' ' to use Donna Harraway's term ' when enacted through Web 2.0 technologies. As such, they perform a substantial redistribution of accountability. We draw on data from an ongoing field study to highlight the experience of a small hotel in a national park area whose business revenues have increased significantly since it became ranked as the number one hotel in the area on TripAdvisor. Using a sociomaterial approach, we discuss how phenomena such as Trip Advisor can have acute implications for small businesses in remote geographical areas.

The dynamics of how such 'core-periphery' structures evolve and become embedded in a firm's innovation routines has been shown to be a major factor in predicting survival, especially in turbulent technology-based industries. To date however, there has been little empirical evidence on the propensity with which core-periphery structures are observed in practice, the factors that explain differences in the design of such structures, or the manner in which these structures evolve over time. We address this gap by analyzing a large number of systems in the software industry. Our sample includes 1,286 software releases taken from 19 distinct applications. We find that 75-80% of systems possess a core-periphery structure. However, the number of core components varies widely, even for systems that perform the same function. These differences appear to be associated with different models of development ' open, distributed organizations developing systems with smaller cores. We find that core components are often dispersed throughout a system, making their detection and management difficult for a system architect.

We begin by suggesting that CEOs who ascend to positions of higher social status in the corporate elite by acquiring more board appointments become increasingly attractive targets of ingratiation from colleagues. We then address the potentially negative consequences for CEOs of becoming the target of such ingratiation. Our theory suggests how high levels of ingratiation can increase CEOs'' overconfidence in their strategic judgment and leadership capability, which results in biased strategic decision making. Specifically, we contend that heightened overconfidence from high levels of ingratiation reduces the likelihood that CEOs will initiate needed strategic change in response to poor firm performance. We then suggest how strategic persistence that results from high levels of ingratiation directed at the CEO can ultimately increase the likelihood of the CEO''s dismissal.

Does individuals' adoption of new technologies supplement or substitute for incumbent technologies?

Existing literature on individual-level technology adoption has explored many aspects of why an individual might adopt a new technology, but has paid little attention to how this adoption affects the incumbent technology. The relationship between new and incumbent technologies is explored in research on whether new technologies cannibalize incumbent technologies, but this literature examines the relationship at the population level and tends not to consider how the relationship may vary among individuals. To fill this gap, we propose that individual-level technology adoption be disaggregated into adoption that supplements the incumbent technology and adoption that substitutes for it. We develop this conceptualization and propose a comprehensive typology of disaggregate adoption patterns by considering the relationships between new and incumbent technologies that individuals may have. We test our conceptualization by examining the adoption of electronic purchasing channels by 13,013 used car dealers over 6.25 years, focusing on whether each dealer used the electronic channels to supplement or substitute for the incumbent physical channel. The patterns proposed in the typology are evident in the data. We also show that several dealers whose total adoption patterns are similar followed different disaggregate adoption patterns. This illustrates that our approach reveals important information which would otherwise remain hidden, which validates our basic premise and helps extend technology adoption theory.",Substitutes; Supplements; Technology adoption,Adoption patterns; Electronic channels; Incumbent technology; Individual levels; Substitutes; Supplements; Technology adoption; Technology adoption theories

In contrast, we virtually lack any knowledge on how the timing of strategic actions which involve the shedding of resources, such as divestitures, affect firm performance. This paper thus aims at advancing our understanding of the importance of divestiture timing. Specifically, we analyze how the timing of a divestiture relative to industry peers in the context of an industry divestiture wave affects a seller's stockmarket returns. Our large-scale empirical analyses are conducted across eleven industries covering a total of 2478 divestitures during the time period from 1993 to 2007. Findings suggest that companies that divest ahead of industry peers at the outset of a divestiture wave and companies that bide their time and divest after industry divestiture activity has peaked outperform companies that divest at the peak of a wave. Surprisingly, late divestors in an industry divestiture wave generate even higher announcement returns than early divestors. A seller's financial performance is found to amplify the impact of divestiture timing on stockmarket returns in industry divestiture waves. The relatedness of the divested unit with the parent firm has no moderating influence on the relationship between divestiture timing and stockmarket returns.",Divestiture; Industry wave; Timing,Divestiture; Empirical analysis; Financial performance; Firm Performance; Industry waves; Product introduction; Strategic management; Timing; Timing circuits

By leading to a change in the composition of knowledge and to routine in organizations, inbound mobility results in lower path dependence and greater technological experimentation, both indications of lower inertia. As a consequence, the impact and influence of innovations created by an organization increases. Analysis reveals a particularly strong effect of inbound mobility on innovation impact in the case of more inert organizations, such as older firms, rather than for younger organizations, supporting the thesis that inbound mobility helps to avert obsolescence. In line with this argument, the data reveal that the composition of technologies core to biotechnology firms changes over time, indicating that firms may effectuate major changes to their strategy and structure through the accumulation of small changes. To validate these claims, I study mobility and change in the context of patenting in the U.S. and Canadian biotechnology industry over a period of 38 years from 1970-2007.",Inertia; Mobility; Obsolescence,Biotechnology; Carrier mobility; Biotechnology firms; Biotechnology industry; Inertia; Path dependence; Obsolescence

Online reverse auctions thus provide fertile ground for the study of ethical issues in virtual settings, particularly as there has been little investigation of these issues by the IS community. We adopted a qualitative approach based on a narrative study of a major French retailer and its suppliers. We held seventy interviews with three groups of informants (technology initiators, buyers and suppliers) to explore how these actors interpret and deal with the unethical use of the technology. Our main findings reveal that while there is a consensus on broad ethical criteria, divergences remain about how specific behaviors are interpreted as ethical or non-ethical. Sanctions, a formal ethical charter, learning and utilization strategies were developed as initial solutions to deal with the unethical use of ORAs. At the same time, factors such as public discourse and rumor influenced ethical criteria and the crafting of legal remedies to the unethical use of ORAs.",Online reverse auctions; Storytelling; Unethical behavior,Electronic commerce; Ethical concerns; Initial solution; Online environments; Online reverse auctions; Qualitative approach; Storytelling; Unethical behavior; Utilization strategy; Philosophical aspects

Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI), governance institutions gathering corporations, civil society and governments, are one type of regulatory mechanisms that tries to fill this gap. However, in order to do so, they have to be democratically legitimate, which induces two main challenges. First, MSIs have to ensure that their structure and processes are perceived as legitimate (input legitimacy). Second, the implementation of their regulations and their problem-solving capacity must be effective (output legitimacy). Governance on a global context is witnessing increasing shifts, such as the development of soft law mechanisms or the participation of private actors in the definition of rules. Therefore, traditional and nationally developed mechanisms for ensuring democratic (input and output) legitimacy, such as elections, cannot simply be applied to global regulatory initiatives such as MSIs. This paper studies this problem by examining the conditions of transfer of input and output legitimacies to MSIs. Precisely, it addresses the following research question: 'What drives input and output legitimacies in MSIs?'. Specifically, driving factors of input and output legitimacies of MSIs are identified and discussed: stakeholder inclusion, democratic deliberations and transparency are deemed to be driving factors of input legitimacy, whereas rule coverage, adequacy, and enforcement are assessed as output legitimacy factors. Then, the interplay between these driving factors are analyzed.",Democratic legitimacy; Global governance; Multi-stakeholder initiative,Democratic legitimacies; Driving factors; Global governance; Input and outputs; Multi-stakeholder initiatives; Regulatory initiatives; Regulatory mechanism; Research questions; Laws and legislation

The costs of developing, implementing and enforcing policy increase as the likelihood of compliance by firms diminishes. Regulators balance their public mandate with the costs of regulation, which depend in part on the capabilities of the firms that they oversee. As a result, firms influence policy by their relative ability to comply. I develop a series of empirical predictions that explains how the stringency of state-level environmental policy in the U.S. electric utility industry is determined by the regulator strategically accounting for firms' technical ability to manage a diverse fuel portfolio, their financial capacity, and market position. Using a dataset of 144 firms in 48 states between 1991 and 2006, I find that regulators were more likely to adopt aggressive policies when the regulated jurisdiction was simultaneously populated with both (1) technologically capable firms and (2) a single market dominant firm that had the technical and financial capacities to respond in kind. Moreover, when the market dominant firm was a technical laggard the likelihood of a demanding environmental policy was reduced despite the strength of other firms in the jurisdiction. As a result, when firms within a regulated jurisdiction are heterogeneous the regulator can strategically set environmental policy that leads to an asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits. This can have important implications for firm strategy as the incentive for firms to invest to become technological leaders, especially in the case of a dominant firm, may be reduced as they anticipate an onset of more stringent environmental standards in response. Firm strategies that do not incorporate the regulator's strategic behavior can be ineffective as they have not taken into account all requisite information.",Capabilities; Energy; Sustainability,Commerce; Electric utilities; Investments; Sustainable development; Asymmetric distribution; Capabilities; Electric utility industry; Empirical predictions; Energy; Environmental standards; State-level environmental policies; Technological capability; Environmental protection

But is this discount due to what a candidate has done or how they did it? I propose that a candidate's past historic sequence of category membership acts as a cue to potential evaluators. Candidates who have cumulatively moved between categories separated by stronger boundaries (more cognitively distant) will be disadvantaged. This is because when audiences attempt to apply a narrative to a candidate, those with past job sequences that span more cognitively distant categories will be perceived as a dilettante. Those with more regimented paths, who move between more cognitively proximate jobs, will be inferred as being more deliberate and conscientious. Job sequences traversing greater distance lead a candidate to look erratic. I find support for this theory in an online market for freelancing services by showing that those freelancers who have sequences of employment between more cognitively distant job categories are less likely to garner subsequent work. This holds net of alternative explanations, such as inherent skill, breadth, or relatedness of past experiences. I also show support for this by matching bidders with identical work backgrounds, who only vary in the order in which they accumulated their experiences. Even among this conservative dataset, I demonstrate that bidders who have moved between more distant job categories are chosen less often.",Categories; Job sequences; Markets,Marketing; Categories; Job sequences; Online markets; Renaissance man; Electronic commerce

Our analysis demonstrates that boundary spanners in MNCs may perform four functions of key importance for interunit knowledge transfer ' transacting, linking, facilitating and intervening' and that the extent to which they perform these functions is strongly related to their social capital and linguistic and cultural skills. Based on these findings, we present a typology which highlights the existence of a hierarchy of boundary-spanning roles, implying that future research may do well to approach boundary spanners in terms of 'degrees' or 'levels' of boundary spanning rather than a homogenous group. We note that while previous research has focused on the role of group leaders, we find important boundary spanners also at other hierarchical levels.

We also examined some Confucian practices to achieve self-regulation including ritual, music, selfexamination and mentoring. We balanced the discussion by exploring the potential problems in applying Confucian principles to develop ethical self-regulation including whistle-blowing. Confucian moral philosophy offers an East Asian theoretical framework for developing ethical self-regulation in managers. This is relevant for Confucian oriented societies, such as China, Korea, Japan, and Singapore for those who relate to managers in Confucian oriented societies.

I use qualitative data from 70 interviews with attorneys from a large U.S. law firm to examine how attorneys go about preserving relationships when they enact flexibility. My analysis revealed four relationship-preserving activities: yielding to role senders' expectations, bypassing them, ascertaining them, and affecting them. Attorneys combined these activities to manage the risks that each of them posed on relationships while increasing their chances of enacting the desired flexibility. Despite attorneys' attempts to preserve relationships, their flexibility enactment occasionally damage their relationships. In light of these findings, I argue for a reconceptualization of work-nonwork conflict as a relational conflict and for the importance of focus on instances of acute work-nonwork conflict.",Relationships; Work-life; Workplace flexibility,Law firm; Qualitative data; Recent researches; Relationships; Work life; Workplace flexibility
Better lagged than never: The lagged effects of process interventions on group decisions,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088183588&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54496075&partnerID=40&md5=aef958d0e425f14558636155ddf926db,"This study investigated three issues regarding process interventions in group decision making: (1) how process interventions affect group decision making processes and outcomes; (2) how persistent these effects are, and (3) how the timing (earlier vs. later) and type (directive vs. participative) of process intervention moderate these effects. The key finding was that process interventions had immediate effects on critical group processes, but did not significantly improve decision quality during the task in which the intervention was received. Surprisingly, postintervention processes continued to improve and resulted in improved decisions in a subsequent task. This 'lagged' effect was mediated by the degree to which groups aggregated unique information and avoided advocating for individual members' preferences. Hypotheses regarding the effects of the timing and type of intervention were not supported. However, directive interventions were more effective than participative interventions at reducing the amount group members advocated for their own preferences. Implications for improving group decision making and group process research are discussed.",Group decision making; Team coaching; Timing,Critical groups; Decision quality; Group decision; Group Decision Making; Group decision making process; Post interventions; Team coaching; Timing; Decision making

Supporting those who dare to care: Five case studies of high-performance work practices in healthcare,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088341051&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54493439&partnerID=40&md5=bd488b79ec631d64a650c959d9f9c996,"Central to the delivery of high-quality care is the presence of a capable workforce. Evidence from a breadth of sources suggests that innovative human resource (HR) practices (also known as high-performance work practices (HPWPs)), such as systematic personnel selection and incentive compensation, serve to attract and retain highly qualified health care staff, and that HPWPs may represent an important and underutilized strategy for improving health care system performance. We designed this study in order to improve our understanding about potential links between HPWPs and quality of care and patient safety in U.S. healthcare organizations. Following an extensive literature review and synthesis, we developed a preliminary model of key subsystems ('bundles') of HPWPs, relations among them, and their organizational effects. We then, performed five case studies of U.S. healthcare organizations purposively selected based on known success in implementing HPWPs. Site visits conducted in 2009 included 71 interviews with key organizational and clinical informants, as well as collection of organizational documents on HPWPs in use. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim to permit rigorous qualitative analysis. We found emphasis on all four of the HPWP subsystems that we previously characterized as directly relevant to healthcare'organizational engagement, staff acquisition/development, frontline empowerment, and leadership alignment/development. Moreover, we found substantial variation in HPWPs and innovative applications of them. In addition, we found evidence of links between HPWPs and employee outcomes (e.g., turnover, higher satisfaction/ engagement). Our informants reported that HPWPs made important contributions to care system and organization-level outcomes (e.g., fewer 'never events', innovation adoption, lower agency costs, and lower turnover costs). These case studies provide preliminary evidence and examples of ways that HPWPs can improve operations in healthcare organizations and can impact quality and safety. HPWPs should be regarded as very promising forms of performance improvement in healthcare. Further research is likely to specify which HPWP practices and combinations are of greatest potential for healthcare management.",Health care; Human resources; Quality of care,Personnel; Personnel selection; Health-care managements; Healthcare organizations; High-performance work practices; Incentive compensation; Organizational effects; Quality and safeties; Quality of care; Substantial variations; Health care

We examine three conditions: source of external resource (cluster and network), characteristics of external resources (volume and quality of technological resources), and types of firm (technologically strong or weak) that access the external resources. Results from firm-level panel data during the years 1986-2000 of publicly traded, U.S.-based, semiconductor firms show that although both sources of external resources generally increase the likelihood of breakthrough innovation, the impacts of the quality of cluster and network technological resources are different for different types of firms. While technologically strong firms benefit from the resources of other firms in their cluster, they benefit less from the resources in their network. Furthermore, we find that technologically weak firms seem to reap complementary benefits from their cluster and network resources, but such resources have a substitution effect for technologically strong firms. Technologically weak firms generate high breakthrough innovations when both cluster resources and network resources are high. However, technologically strong firms would be better off when cluster resources are high but network resources are low.",Cluster; Innovation; Network,Networks (circuits); Breakthrough innovations; Cluster; External resources; Network resource; Panel data; Substitution effect; Technological resources

People in general and people in business have their own sets of beliefs that may have been somewhat influenced by business ethicists and organizational scholars but not more than a bit. Those beliefs often have flaws, an obvious one being that especially in the business world these beliefs are (morally) unimaginative and too undemanding. Perhaps this is all we can reasonably hope for. But business ethicists should seriously consider what we can expect to contribute to these ethics and to the field. Two academic traditions are in the process of consolidation in our field, namely, normative and behavioral business ethics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the plausibility of the very distinction between a normative and a behavioral domain of research in business ethics and the examination of strategies for the collaboration of both traditions. In the course of this paper, I shall argue that the normative/descriptive divide in business ethics research is just a reflection of the is/ought distinction. And I shall conclude that the two strategies business ethicists have postulated to deal with the dichotomy, namely, separation and integration, are equally problematic because of the entanglement of facts and values and because of the need to preserve the logic and identity of the normative and the empirical inquiry. Rather than separation or integration, I shall propose a strategy of reconciliation, which does not entail synthesizing or dividing them but rather respecting the identity of both approaches while recognizing the limitations they place on each other.",Is-ought thesis; Normative ethics; Psychological realism,Behavioral research; Business ethics; Is-ought thesis; Normative ethics; Psychological realisms; Philosophical aspects

By raising the supply of information in a region, they encourage specialization of more knowledgeintensive workers in knowledge-intensive activities. If this also weakens the complementarity across skills, the region will experience greater wage inequality. We then discuss four antecedents of localized knowledge spillover: market and technological specialization, sciencebased knowledge intensity and cultural openness. We test our theory by using data on 146 U.S. cities. Since managers and production workers are widespread occupations, and they are not industry-specific, we employ the ratio between their salaries as our city-level proxy of the dependent variable. We find that that cities with higher intensity of localized knowledge spillovers exhibit higher wage inequality across skills. We control for several factors, including inter-industry differences, and we take into account the potential endogeneity of knowledge spillovers. We also find that downstream market specialization and cultural openness are statistically significant antecedents.",Cultural traits; Knowledge spillovers; Wage inequality,Commerce; Wages; Cultural traits; Dependent variables; Endogeneity; Knowledge spillovers; Knowledge-intensity; Market specialization; Production workers; Wage inequalities; Human resource management

The relationships between team reflexivity, a demanding work environment (i.e. quality of the physical work environment and work load) and team innovation was examined among 98 primary health care teams (PHCTs) in the UK, comprised of 1137 individuals. Results showed that team reflexivity is positively related to team innovation, and that there is an interaction between team reflexivity, team level workload, and team innovation, such that when team level workload is high, combined with a high level of team reflexivity, team innovation is also higher. The complementary interaction between team reflexivity, quality of physical work environment, and team innovation, showed that when the quality of the work environment is low, combined with a high level of team reflexivity, team innovation was also higher.

We interpret these results as evidence that employees, based on the source of the resource (e.g., work or non-work), are differentially motivated to invest resources into effort and performance.

Substantial streams of scholarly research have addressed coping with job loss, underemployment, and reemployment, though chronic unemployment has garnered much less research attention. Often not recorded in official unemployment figures are the ""marginally attached"" who want a job, are available to work, and have looked for work within the last year but are not currently looking, as well as ""discouraged workers"" who want to work but have not looked for over a year for a variety of reasons. In this paper, we model factors beyond human and social capital that can lead racial minorities to be particularly prone to marginal attachment and discouragement. First, discrimination can reduce job opportunities and individuals' career self-efficacy. Second, well-intentioned racial socialization by minority parents can foster individuals' ethnic identity which may increase or decrease their career self-efficacy. In turn, low career self-efficacy and minimal job opportunities are key antecedents of minorities' marginal attachment and discouragement about employment prospects.

Study one also contributes to the network literature by demonstrating that teams serve as a more powerful conduit for network formation than other organizational structures or sources of proximity or homophily. Study two further delineates the role of teams in network formation by demonstrating network formation differences contingent on the properties of the team.

Spanning multiple categories is thought to be detrimental because it makes an actor's identity unclear and dilutes their focus. Still, straddling categories is an important driver of innovation and has implications for the emergence, evolution, and redirection of institutional fields. Despite this, understandings about the mechanisms which affect category spanning are limited. Building on research which shows the institutional shaping of identities and innovation, I argue that evolving relationships amongst categories facilitate spanning by linking particular categories together in meaningful ways. Moreover, I argue that the relational structuring of categories is shaped endogenously by prominent actors in ways that condition the effects of alternate explanations based on category richness, networks, and social influence.

We also find that the impact of industry-adjusted firm one- year lagged stock return performance on turnover is reinforced in high-discretion industries consistent with our theory that considering industry discretion can reduce board attribution errors when attributing firm performance to the CEO.

The group polarization theory explains how board discussions can induce directors to make a collective decision that amplifies their average pre-meeting position. For example, the group polarization theory suggests that when directors on average used to pay high levels of CEO compensation, they tend to pay the focal CEO even more following board discussions; but when directors on average used to pay low levels of CEO compensation, board discussions will cause them to pay the focal CEO even less. Results based on decisions made by Fortune 500 directors provided strong support to the theory. This study introduces a fundamental group decision making bias into the study of boards, and explains how group discussions may induce directors to approve a focal decision that is more extreme than the average decision experienced by them on other boards, thus suggesting how group processes may distort the network diffusion effect.

Inter-role conflict has consistently been found to be negatively related to life satisfaction. The work recovery and coping literatures suggest similar strategies to offset this negative relation, albeit with opposite effects. Drawing from the work recovery literature, psychologically detaching oneself from role demands is predicted to be an adaptive strategy. Drawing from the coping literature, avoidance-focused coping is predicted to be a maladaptive strategy. The primary goal of the present study was to examine the potential paradox across these two literatures by simultaneously examining these two strategies in 304 individuals who were faced with the challenge of balancing work, family, and school responsibilities. Participants completed questionnaires at two times, separated by one month. Confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the distinctiveness of the two constructs.

In this article, we try to get away from this traditional view and examine the effects of a management instrument that has been used in professional services firms for some fifteen years: Knowledge Management systems (KMS). First generation KMS are designed to facilitate coding of knowledge so it can be reused on a large scale. In a context of fiercer competition between PSFs on costs and delivery time, and a propensity by clients to sue in the event of any problems, do these systems make the work process more standardisable, and therefore more formally controllable? This interpretative, exploratory case study, conducted between 1999 and 2008 in an international business law firm, suggests that use of KMS brings about a new mode of control that removes the need for a controller by creating lateral pressure between peers on the technical quality of the output produced. However, this new mode of control helps to weaken confraternity and solidarity which make up the 'ethos of partnership' of PSF.",Knowledge management systems; Organizational control modes; Professional service firms,Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Professional aspects; Exploratory case studies; International business; Knowledge management system; Lateral pressures; Organizational control modes; Professional service firms; Professional services firms; Technical quality; Quality control

The current study reports results from a Monte Carlo simulation examining how the presence of heterogeneous voluntary turnover decision paths affects our ability to understand and predict employee decisions to quit.

The model, grounded in literature on trust not only theorizes the role of user trust for 'emergent use intentions' (EUI) of VWs for collaborative purposes, but also identifies the antecedents of user trust in the context of VWs. It broadly proposes two dimensions of user trust in VWs as trust in virtual world community (VWC) and trust in virtual world platform (VWP) which are further subdivided as party trust and control trust. Further, the moderating roles of individual traits on user trust are also studied to understand the role of individual differences for EUI of VWs for collaborations. The proposed model is tested via data collected from VW users in Singapore. Results demonstrate the importance of control trust for using VWs as a collaborative tool.

The current study used experimental methods to test four competing models describing the combined influence of contextual information and ratee bodyweight on performance judgments. Results of this study supported an additive model, such that contextual information and ratee bodyweight combined independently to affect performance ratings and suitability judgments. Consistent with the so-called 'double-jeopardy' effect, the least favorable performance judgments were observed for an overweight ratee with poor previous performance.

Consistent with theories of ideology formation, I show that these understandings are shaped by interests and by enactment.

To analyze the impact of parenting events on advertising agency survival, we use the life history data of all advertising agencies and executives that operated in the New York City area from 1924 to 1996. The findings show that parenting events have a negative impact on the competitive viability of the parent firms. Parents are more likely to fail than are their progeny spin-offs, an effect that increases with the number of executives departing. We go beyond previous genealogical research by investigating the functional backgrounds of high-level members of the organization as a proxy for their individual knowledge. We find that parent firm survival is hurt most by the departure of chief executives and back office executives and that progenies benefit from being founded by a chief executive. These effects are asymmetric and that neither functional background nor founding team size has an effect on the survival chances of progeny firms. Overall, these findings support the view that the critical capabilities within professional service organizations do indeed reside substantively at the individual level, but that all knowledge of the organization cannot be decomposed to the knowledge of individuals.",Capabilities; Knowledge,Marketing; Professional aspects; Advertising agency; Capabilities; Human capitals; Individual levels; Knowledge; Knowledge capabilities; Professional service firms; Professional services; Knowledge management

However, the interplay between these two dimensions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we draw upon a framing-based perspective to study the influence of the nature of the contractual design on the level of trust. We suggest that the type of contract framing plays a key role in shaping the development of trust. Our empirical analysis uses a quasiexperiment to compare promotion-framed versus prevention-framed franchise contracts. Consistent with our hypotheses, our results indicate that promotion-framed contracts influence more positively trust than prevention-based contracts. We also find that perceived contract completeness and perceived control of the franchisor have different effects on trust according to the type of contract framing. We point out the importance of our study for the contract-trust relationship debate and discuss its implications for the contract design literature.",Contract; Framing; Prospect theory,Contract design; Different effects; Empirical analysis; Framing; Prospect theory; Trading partners; Trust relationship; Two-dimension; Contracts

Examples include texting or voice-mailing someone when you could call them, and instant messaging, emailing or calling someone who sits nearby. This paper presents an interview-based grounded theory of interaction control as a way to explain why coworkers engage in VBC. The theory contends that colleagues sometimes deliberately distance themselves based on their desire to control the time/timing, location, quality, permanence, and other dynamics of their interactions. Rather than attempting to maximize bandwidth, replicate FTF, or expand an existing communication channel, people use supposedly 'lean' media as a way to control their work and workplace relations. The theory appears to explain VBC in a way that existing theories of media choice do not ' and may help explain other types of communication media choices as well.",Computer mediated communication; Media choice; Media use,Control theory; Communication media choices; Communication partners; Computer mediated communication; Instant messaging; Interaction controls; Media choice; Media use; Mediated Communication; Quality control

We propose a model of international responsiveness that encompasses concepts of founding team experience, firm experience, supply chain focus, strategic orientation and international responsiveness. We then test the model using data from 293 new ventures from three emerging economies: China, India, and South Africa. Within new ventures, results indicate that international supply chain focus impacts strategic orientation which in turn impacts international responsiveness. While previous OM research accounted for firm experience, results indicate that experience of the founding team has a noticeable, greater effect.

A critical aspect is team members' expertise in what they do, that is, the tasks they perform and hierarchical roles they fulfill. Equally important is the ability to coordinate their complementary expertise and interdependent activities and one mechanism is team familiarity, that is, experience with who they work with. Project teams are, however, fluid, raising the issue of how team members can coordinate effectively. In this paper, we propose and investigate the performance consequences of two alternative mechanisms: shared firm experience, that is, experience with firm specific routines about how to coordinate with others within the firm; and teaming experience, that is, experience with how to coordinate with others in general. Using data on development teams working on electronic games released in the U.S. between 1995 and 2007, we find that shared firm experience and teaming experience are positively associated with the commercial success of electronic games, and that these effects are equally important across all levels of team familiarity.

The emergence of cognitive legitimacy is traditionally explained as emerging slowly from the increased prevalence of an organizational form. Building on insights from cognitive social psychology, we suggest institutional beacons as an alternative path by which this type of legitimacy can rapidly arise. We argue that a single, salient demonstration of perceived success is often sufficient to facilitate legitimacy. We test and find support for this logic in a study of the foundings of venture capital firms, and explore the influence of both successful, single venture capital investments and the Yale endowment.

In particular, we study how the positions of stocks within the coverage network of sell- side security analysts influence analysts' ability to exert leadership in the provision of information on the stocks they follow. Information leadership is an important feature of information circulation in financial markets that materially influences how value is determined. Our analysis of analysts' earnings forecasts for publicly traded US firms from 1994 to 2000 provides evidence of both the role of the analysts' coverage network and its interaction with the attributes of analysts and their brokerage firms. A counter-intuitive finding is that analysts possessing favourable personal and brokerage firm attributes assert greater information leadership on stocks occupying constrained network positions. Our focus on information control and diffusion (in addition to access) thus points to conditions under which constraint, rather than structural holes, produces conditions conducive to information advantages.",Network constraint; Networks; Securities,Access control; Commerce; Investments; Networks (circuits); Earnings forecast; Important features; Information access; Information circulation; Information control; Network constraints; Network information; Securities; Financial markets

Most researchers have addressed this question exploring the objective circumstances that allow actors to adopt new practices even when their intentions, actions, and rationality are conditioned by institutional scripts. In contrast, this paper asks why actors exposed to similar objective circumstances engage in different forms of institutional work. It argues that actors decide to preserve, change, or erode institutional scripts because of tensions engendered as they incarnate these scripts in their practice. It contributes to the emergent inhabited view on institutions with a conceptualization of why actors engage in institutional work that articulates that how people do things together (instead of simply what they do) crucially frames their decision making. The conceptualization offered abandons false dualities of institutional actors as either dopes or heroic entrepreneurs for actors as people. From this perspective, actors' decision making is framed by interests that do not necessarily precede but can also emerge with their acting, and it is modulated by relational dynamics (trust, reputation, social distance, and status competition) generated through a history of social interactions.",Institutional agency; Institutional change; Institutional work,Decision making; Finance; Exposed to; Institutional agencies; Institutional change; Institutional work; Microfinance; Social distance; Social interactions; Behavioral research

We use a longitudinal analysis of sixty multipartner alliances, and find that while on average, higher levels of embeddedness across the various partner dyads within a multipartner alliance generally enhance stability, an unequal distribution of interorganizational embeddedness across the partner dyads decreases stability. We argue that highly variable interorganizational embeddedness levels across the partner dyads lead to destabilizing coalitions, and hamper the development of informal mechanisms that reduce opportunism and coordination costs. Our analyses suggest a negative aspect of interorganizational embeddedness which has not been previously considered.",Alliance stability; Embeddedness; Multipartner alliance,Coordination costs; Embeddedness; Inter-organizational; Longitudinal analysis; Multipartner alliance; Stability

Greater power was associated with less advice taking, and the mediating mechanism was elevated confidence. This pattern was replicated in an experiment, where a power prime increased participants' confidence in their initial judgments, which in turn reduced the extent to which they revised their judgments in the direction of an advisor and resulted in lower final accuracy for higher power individuals. Power can thus exacerbate the tendency for people to overweight their own judgment, such that the most powerful decision makers can also be the least accurate.",Advice; Decision making; Power,Behavioral research; Advice; Decision makers; Field surveys; Power; Self-ratings; Working professionals; Decision making

We provide a theoretical framework and empirically test a series of hypotheses pertaining to the relationships between socialized charismatic leadership (SCL) and its consequences in terms of group norms. We then examine whether norms predict the density of instrumental ties inside groups and, consequently, their performance. Our findings, based on assessments of 70 leaders that included data from over 500 of their subordinates, colleagues, and supervisors, show that SCL is associated with heightened norms of cooperation and reduced norms of enforcement in formal groups. Norms of cooperation, in turn, were associated with group density of instrumental ties. Our findings also demonstrate that when groups are characterized by more face-to-face work arrangements, group density of instrumental ties is associated with group performance. The study contributes to an understanding of the consequences of group social psychological processes on the development of instrumental social networks inside formal organizational groups. Specifically, the investigated framework examines the processes of leadership and norm development to understand the genesis of group social networks.",Leadership; Norms; Social ties,Group behavior; Group performance; Leadership; Norms; Psychological process; Social network structures; Social ties; Theoretical framework; Economic and social effects

It analyses how the initial imprinting of organizational routines during founding and their evolution over the years, induced by different external and quasi-external institutional environments, influence firms' trajectory of technological knowledge sourcing. The multi-industry longitudinal study of 3026 firms reveals: legacies of historical institutional context determine a firm's position in the trajectory, depicted by the extent of technological knowledge sourcing through different modes. However, the direction of its evolution, depicted by the change in the technological knowledge sourcing through the different modes, is influenced by the legacies as well as the new environmental contingencies. By illustrating how past and present institutional contexts influence the trajectory of technological knowledge sourcing the study adds insight of a path dependent (historical) contextual antecedent of technology strategy of firms. It also illustrate that different layers of institutional environment of the firms influence firm strategy directly and interactively. It also extends organizational imprinting theory by positing and illustrating that organizational imprints are not only incorporated during the founding of organizations but are modified at subsequent periods. Theoretical insight from this study can potentially enrich theories on organizational routines, especially their origin.

Ethical leadership evaluations after moral transgression: Social distance makes the difference,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088338893&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54493471&partnerID=40&md5=b7fed4313e405893bda4768d4dd019bf,"The present study investigates the influence of social distance on ethical leadership ratings after moral transgression. Recent research based on Construal Level Theory has shown that higher social distance leads to more severe evaluations of unethical behavior in moral dilemmas. From a higher social distance perspective, people tend to focus more on abstract moral principles than on concrete circumstantial information regarding unethical conduct. Recently, there has been increased interest in investigating the effects of social distance and proximity on moral judgment in applied business contexts (e.g., human resource management). We extend this body of research by investigating social distance effects on ethical leadership evaluations and its consequences for leader-member exchange (LMX). Participants read a scenario describing a moral situation in which a leader, who was presented in either high or low social distance, behaves unethically towards an employee. Our results show that in the high social distance condition participants judged leaders more harshly (i.e., they gave lower ethical leadership ratings) than in the low social distance condition. Thus, social distance moderates the extent to which leaders are perceived as ethical leaders after moral transgression. Moreover, as expected, ethical leadership ratings had a positive influence on LMX. We discuss research and managerial implications of our findings.",Ethical leadership; Moral judgment; Social distance,Human resource management; Philosophical aspects; Business contexts; Construal  levels; Ethical leadership; Leader-member exchanges; Managerial implications; Moral judgment; Recent researches; Social distance; Economic and social effects

However, disasters also have negative impacts on the very same firms, and we typically expect firms to give less, not more, under adverse economic conditions. This paper explores a strategic explanation for high-profile corporate magnanimity in times of crisis. Specifically, we investigate whether those firms known for social irresponsibility suffered the greatest losses in firm value when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and whether such firms were more likely to make donations as a result. We generate a number of findings that contribute to the literature on the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR), reputation, and corporate philanthropy. First, we find that the more a firm was known for bad deeds, the greater the loss of firm value when Katrina hit, regardless of its concurrent history of good deeds. Second, we find that philanthropic disaster response is significantly more likely when a firm is known for bad deeds. We conclude that short-term value-enhancing motives for philanthropic disaster response may be misguided: managers interested in capturing value from CSR should focus instead on reducing their firms' irresponsible behaviors.",Corporate philanthropy; Firm value; Irresponsibility,Contracts; Hurricanes; Asian Tsunami; Corporate philanthropies; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Disaster response; Economic condition; Firm value; Hurricane katrina; Irresponsibility; Emergency services

Individuals and organizations often base their decisions on the judgments of third-party raters when making large stake decisions based on the assumption that such raters provide objective judgment. We argue that the ratings of third parties are often based on some form of aggregation of the opinions of various experts based on the assumption that the possible judgment biases of experts cancel each other out. In this paper we suggest that experts are not exempt from cognitive bias and their biases can exist in the same direction. When such a situation occurs, aggregating expert biases can lead to an amplified bias as opposed to an elimination of bias. Specifically, we show that the judgments of academicians and recruiters concerning the quality of universities have been biased by university sport team successes and that the bias of these 'experts' mediates the aggregated bias in the rankings of MBA programs that was published by US News & World Report between 1993 and 2008.",Cognitive bias; Expert; Salience,Cognitive bias; Expert; Expert bias; Organizational levels; Salience; Team success; Third parties; University Sports

Conversely, induced strategic behavior is considered to operate as a force that reduces variation. We review this idea by examining a case in which intra-organizational variation has actually resulted from decisions made within the induced strategic process of the firm. We do so by analyzing the decision by Walt Disney International (WDI) to organize its international operations under three different and coexisting region-specific organizational forms: EMEA, Asia and Latin America. The focal point of the story is the evolution of the administrative system of Walt Disney Latin America (WDLA), the form that was ultimately selected as the fittest of the three and diffused to the rest of WDI. This experience helps explain the conditions under which intra-organizational variation can arise out of the intended strategy process of the firm.",Administrative systems; Experimentation; Organizational evolution,Experimentation; International operations; Latin America; Organizational evolution; Organizational forms; Strategic Behavior; Strategic process; Strategy process

Results showed that job seekers' perceptions of an organization's CSR relating to its environmental and communityfocused practices explained variance in organizational attractiveness beyond the effects of other variables (e.g., location favorability, job offer expectancy).

Second, we use metaanalysis to extend Harrison, Newman, and Roth's (2006) Attitude-Engagement Model, showing that the A-factor robustly predicts a broad work-behavior criterion (r =.51). Third, we metaanalytically review the strong overlaps between the higher-order attitude A-factor and attitudinal employee engagement, to show that typical employee engagement measures are essentially redundant with the A-factor (r =.77). Finally, factor-analytic evidence suggests engagement items likely measure the same construct, in the same way, as classic job attitude/satisfaction measures.

For multinational firms operating in multicultural environments it is essential to understand how culture influences reward allocation decisions and preferences. Much of the research to date has focused on the influence of values on reward allocation. This work conceptually examines the relationships between the five universal social beliefs, or social axioms (social cynicism, fate control, reward for application, religiosity, and social complexity) and the four reward allocation principles (equity, equality, need, and seniority). I propose that individual differences in endorsement of the five social axioms are likely to lead to different preferences for reward allocation principles. The five general social beliefs are argued to explain and predict personal reward allocation preferences in addition to individuals' values.",Human resource management practices; Reward allocation; Social axioms,Employee behavior; Human resource management practices; Individual Differences; Multicultural environment; Multinational firms; Organizational performance; Reward allocations; Social axioms; Human resource management

In other words, buyers and suppliers confronting a high rate of component technological change will have recourse to information sharing even in the presence of highly modularized components. On the other hand, modularity reduces the need for information sharing only in the presence of low component technological change.

More specifically this paper examines the ways in which these formal structures are a) decoupled from b) inhibit the collaborative praxis. Innovativeness conceptualized through the concept of innovative behaviour and the practice perspective is used in order to dig deeper into the social nature of the innovative activity. In the examination of the interplay between the informal praxis and the formal structure of innovation management the concepts of canonical and non-canonical practice introduced by Brown and Duguid (1991) are used.

Through a discourse analysis of more than 750 projects presented to the Asian CSR Awards we firstly acknowledge the homogeneity of the discourse used by companies of all sorts to legitimize their actions. We distinguish two main argumentation repertoires, one based on a symbolic logic and a second based on a managerial logic. We argue that the two argumentation repertoires are used in confrontation that mirrors the paradoxes of managing sustainability projects. The firm rhetoric reproduces the distance between the output oriented legitimacy (through the managerial rhetoric) and the input oriented (through the symbolic rhetoric). We also observe that each type of rhetoric has evolved over the past 6 years in a way that we can trace the trends in the management of sustainability projects. Finally, we acknowledge differences in the argumentation repertoires depending on the organization characteristics. Each type of company manages its rhetoric to serve their legitimacy needs. On the one hand, local and small organizations tend to use a more managerial discourse as their legitimacy need is centered in the maintaining of the license to operate.

This paper examines the growing demands for impact and their implications for performance measurement in nonprofits. We begin with a review of the debates around performance and impact, drawing on three literatures: strategic philanthropy, nonprofit management, and international development. We then articulate two key dilemmas facing nonprofit leaders in measuring their social impact: where to position their measurement on a logic chain, and how to address multiple and competing accountability demands. Drawing on this analysis, we develop a contingency framework for measuring results, arguing that it is neither feasible nor desirable for all organizations to measure impact. Some may be better off measuring their activities and outputs rather than outcomes or impacts. The contingency framework may be helpful to professionals in the social sector in critically differentiating among the types of results they can and should measure. In closing, we discuss the implications of our analysis for future research on performance management and control.",Accountability; Performance; Social enterprise,Accountability; International development; Nonprofit managements; Performance; Performance management; Performance measurements; Social enterprise; Social performance; Nonprofit organization

Understanding motivation for continued participation in online communities is an understudied area of research with practical relevance. We propose that continued participation in online communities is a multi-dimensional construct. To investigate individual-level and online community-level antecedents of two dimensions of continued participation, participation continuance intentions and participation intensity intentions, we analyze 535 survey responses and communication history of 135,477 messages from members of 33 different online communities. Our cross-level analysis furthers the understanding of the relationship between interaction with online community leadership, psychological safety, participation continuance intentions and participation intensity intentions. This study provides support for the proposition that participation intentions in online communities is a multi-dimensional construct. Further, we find evidence that online community psychological safety is both a contextual factor influenced by online community leadership as well as an influence on individual participation intentions. The findings demonstrate the importance of a multi-level approach to studying online community participation. We illustrate the use of HLM as one technique for expanding multi-level research into the field of online community study. The improved understanding of continued participation in online communities provided by this study extends theories of online communities and expands practitioner knowledge of this important phenomenon.",Continued participation; Online community; Psychological safety,Online systems; Safety factor; Communication history; Contextual factors; Continuance intentions; Continued participations; Critical component; Multi dimensional; On-line communities; Psychological safety; Social networking (online)

A smaller literature has proposed demand-side factors such as shopping costs, learning costs or costs of interoperability as basis for business expansion, where firms expand their business in order to sell several products to the same customer. In such demand-side driven diversification, firms focus on increasing the customers' willingness-to-pay for a combination of products rather than reducing the focal firm's cost base through economies of scope. We propose the concept of unique demand complementarities as a unifying framework to explain demand- side driven diversification. We argue that unique demand complementarities can be viewed as a firm's unique resource or capability to create and exploit increased willingness-topay, leading to competitive advantage based on differentiation. Through analytical modeling, we show that the expected performance of diversification through economies of scope and unique demand complementarities differs substantially and that performance effects are different in terms of market share gain and firm profitability. We further find that the performance effect of unique demand complementarities depends on market share and market connectedness.",Demand-based theory; Diversification; Resource-based view,Commerce; Competition; Business expansion; Competitive advantage; Demand-based theories; Diversification; Economies of scope; Firm profitabilities; Resource-based view; Willingness to pay; Sales

Using an organizational learning perspective, we uncover several boundary conditions to the benefits from prior collaborative endeavors. Specifically, we argue that experience with collaboration alone is insufficient to allow firms that were formerly in collaborations to establish autonomous operations. Collaborative experience needs to be partner-specific, gathered in contexts involving low levels of causal ambiguity, and fairly recent to allow former partner firms to obtain the resources that they require to establish autonomous operations.

We begin by presenting a nomological net that distinguishes the concept from psychological and sociological ambivalence - as well as group conflict. We then articulate the antecedents of two types of group ambivalence: holographic and ideographic. Holographic group ambivalence occurs when each member of a group shares the same conflicting thoughts and feelings. Ideographic group ambivalence occurs when the conflicting thoughts and emotions are represented in different people across the group. These types of group ambivalence result in outcomes ranging from response flexibility to response fluidity. We then propose ways for companies to manage group ambivalence in order to maximize its positive outcomes. We conclude by discussing the implications of group ambivalence.",Ambivalence; Group processes; Optimizing group outcomes,Holography; Ambivalence; Group conflicts; Group emotions; Group process; Optimizing group outcomes; Response flexibility; Group theory

Our theory suggests why (1) there may be a systematic tendency for analysts to underestimate the extent to which other analysts share their reservations about stock repurchase plans (i.e., reservations about whether such plans reflect well on the performance prospects of adopting firms), such that (2) analysts mimic others and issue more positive earnings forecasts and stock recommendations in response to the adoption of repurchase plans despite having private reservations about whether the plans reflect well on adopting firms. We also contend that analysts are less likely to underestimate the extent to which others share their reservations about repurchase plans to the extent that they have frequent communication ties to other analysts. We test our specific hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes original survey data from a large sample of security analysts and found strong support for our theory. While prior neo- institutional research on mimetic isomorphism has primarily adopted a cognitive perspective in which actors imitate others based on their understandings of a particular policy or practice (i.e., they either take the value of the policy for granted or infer the value of the policy from others' prior decisions), this study begins to develop a more social psychological perspective on imitation wherein actors imitate others based on their biased perceptions of others' beliefs about the policy. Our theory and findings also extend perspectives on institutional persistence by explaining why constituents may continue to publicly endorse a policy despite having private reservations about the policy's efficiency benefits. In particular, we suggest that constituents may continue to respond positively to the adoption of a policy not because they assume or take-for-granted the benefits of the policy, but because they overestimate the extent to which other constituents hold this assumption. Accordingly, this study suggests a novel social psychological mechanism by which the institutional value of organizational policies is maintained.",Corporate governance; Institutionalization; Neo-institutional theory,Set theory; Statistical tests; Cognitive perspectives; Corporate governance; Efficiency benefits; Institutional persistences; Institutionalization; Neo-institutional theories; Organizational policies; Psychological bias; Large dataset

Using a dataset of 105 new practices developed in China's biopharmaceutical industry in 2008, the results challenge existing theoretical understandings and analytical approaches to examining innovation phenomena twofold. First, there is not one way that leads to practice innovation. Instead, a diversity of configurations of actor-based features, governance mechanisms, and environmental influences has been identified that allows firms to devise new practices. Second, all conditions show asymmetric effects on the process questioning conventional variance based approaches to analyzing sets of empirical data.",Empirical study; Inter-firm collaboration; Practive innovation,Biopharmaceutical industry; Empirical studies; Environmental influences; Governance mechanisms; Inter-firm collaboration; Organizational designs; Practive innovations; Qualitative comparative analysis

The sociotechnical congruence (STC) metric helps to make sense out of complicated the highly-dynamic task dependencies between software developers by analyzing the relationship between developer communication and task dependencies obtained from software artifacts. Previous unreplicated research computed STC from data contained in software repositories and showed that high values of STC in a commercial software engineering setting led to higher team performance, but did not differentiate cleanly between the effects of aligned communication and the effects of general communication. In this work we utilize software repository data from an Open Source software community to evaluate STC in a very different setting. We then extend STC, creating an individual metric and two sub-measures that distinguish between communication that is aligned with task dependencies and general communication, and show that general communication has little benefit, while communication aligned with our measure of task dependencies reduces bug resolution time.",Communication; Coordination; Software engineering,Communication; Open systems; Software design; Software engineering; Coordination; Development teams; Open source software community; Software artifacts; Software developer; Software development projects; Software repositories; Task dependencies; Open source software

This research tests whether a war for talent provides an explanation for the rise in management compensation. According to defenders of the high salaries, resting on the efficient labor market view, the rise in executive compensation is the product of a shift toward transferable managerial skills, particularly in large firms, and this trend contributes to firm performance. Relying on an internationalized and deregulated managerial labor market, i.e. the Swiss banking sector, the empirical findings confirm that a shift toward transferable managerial skills in large firms is indeed an explanation for the rise in management compensation. However, the shift towards transferable managerial skills in large firms does not improve firm performance, giving no supporting evidence for a war for talent.",Efficient labor market view; Executive compensation; Transferable skills,Commerce; Deregulation; Employment; Wages; Academic research; Banking sectors; Efficient labor market views; Empirical findings; Executive compensation; Firm Performance; Managerial skills; Transferable skills; Managers

In this paper we study to what extent data on user-generated designs and user designers that is readily available in web 2.0 settings can be used to predict the attractiveness of user-generated designs from the perspective of a focal producer firm. Applying multilevel generalized linear modeling, we analyze 1799 designs from 116 user designers in the LEGO user community. We find an inversely U-shaped relationship between the complexity of a user-generated design and its perceived attractiveness. Furthermore, we find a positive relationship between positive feed-back that a given design receives within the peer community and its perceived attractiveness as well as a U-shaped relationship between the intensity of design activities of a certain user designer and the likelihood that his/her designs will be perceived as attractive. Based on these findings we provide implications for theory and management at the interface of marketing and innovation.",Communities; New product development; User innovation,Ecosystems; Design activity; Empirical studies; Firm boundaries; Generalized linear model; New product development; User communities; User innovation; Web 2.0 Technologies; Product development

Results from multilevel analyses based on a sample of 1941 migrant and local workers in 211 Korean (domestic and overseas) plants indicated that NCD, whether based on Hofstede's national culture scores or on Project GLOBE's national culture scores, had similar predictive power. Further, the effects of both NCD measures on OC were largely direct (i.e., not mediated by WCD).",National Culture; Organization effects; Organizational Commitment,Cultural difference; Distance measure; Hofstede; Multi-level analysis; National cultures; Organizational Commitment; Predictive power; Work behavior

I test this using hand-collected employment, travel, demographic similarity and patent data for 1315 inventors in a Fortune 50 multinational R&D center in India. To test for the contribution of returnee managers, I consider new graduates, for whom manager assignment is plausibly random. To test for the effect of travel, I consider employees who could not travel because they got married/had children and match them to similar employees without such constraints. Both mechanisms lead to higher patenting. However the marginal effect of the compensating mechanism (travel) is about half the returnee effect.",Knowledge creation; Multinationals; Return migration,Patents and inventions; Emerging markets; Knowledge creations; Labor resources; Marginal effects; Multinational firms; Multinationals; Patent datum; Return migrations; Managers

Yet, the literature remains divided in its measurement approach ' either aggregated or disaggregated ' and therefore little is known specifically about how the overall nature (breadth and depth) of the corporate social strategies pursued by the firm might affect CFP. More importantly, little research has considered specifically that the absence of any social or environmental programs is also a strategic choice that is conceptually distinct from firms that choose to pursue even one CSP initiative. Herein I introduce the new construct of corporate social strategy (CSS) which reflects this strategic choice and defines the nature of stakeholder and social issues pursued by the firm by using an Entropy measure to assess the breadth of CSS and a specialization ratio to assess the depth of CSS. The resulting typology allows one to classify corporate social strategies as either disengaged, derivative, diffuse, dedicated or devoted. This new typology is tested using a sample of 147 manufacturing firms. Findings confirm that a disengaged CSS in particular is negatively related to CFP. This reframing of CSR as CSS thus has important implications for both research and practice.",Corporate social performance; CSR,Corporate financial performance; Corporate social performance; Empirical research; Entropy measure; Environmental programs; Manufacturing firms; Social strategy; Strategic choice

Over the evolution of this stream of research, models have been designed around conceptualizing two distinct types of knowledge: tacit and explicit. The focus is then on how to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Tsoukas (2003) contested the idea of two types of knowledge. Reflecting Polanyi's (1966) conceptualization of tacit and explicit as two interdependent dimensions of knowledge, he argues that all knowledge contains at least some tacit component. We argue that strategic human resource management research would benefit from focusing on what sociologists call 'working knowledge' or knowledge-in-practice rather than trying to distinguish tacit from explicit knowledge. We propose a typology of knowledge-in-practice that reflects varying dimensions of tacitness and learnability. This reconceptualization makes several contributions to strategic human resource management research. First, by clarifying the misunderstanding involving the 'two types' of knowledge, we explain how this leads to inadequate theories and practice. Second, we create a refocused dimensional understanding of the knowledge construct based on Polanyi's (1966) original work, which we believe effectively re-directs the focus from knowledge conversion, to the learnability and/or leverageability of knowledge involved in organizational practices. Third, we articulate the implications of this refocused dimensional understanding for strategic human resource management and management research in general. The implications for strategic human resource management, we argue, becomes how to manage human capital by understanding how knowledge-in-practice is acquired, developed, and retained.",Knowledge management; Strategic human resource management; Tacit knowledge,Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Explicit knowledge; Human capitals; Knowledge conversion; Knowledge-based views; Management research; Organizational practices; Strategic human resource managements; Tacit knowledge; Human resource management

First, we develop and empirically test a structural equation modeling (SEM) model of the influence of purchasing maturity to both operational performances and to business profitability. Purchasing maturity comprises four strategic PSM practices, supplier management, performance management, talent management, and cross-functional integration. The operational performances measure PSM's contribution to cost reductions, quality improvements, and innovation. Second, we analyze the influence of three contextual factors industry sector, degree of centralization, and reporting level of the chief purchasing officer (CPO) on the implemented level of purchasing maturity and its relationship on performance. This study combines multiple data sources, from telephone interviews, questionnaires, and objective financial data collected from a global, cross-industry sample of 306 major companies. Our results confirm that a sophisticated purchasing maturity has a positive impact on operational performance as well as an indirect positive effect on business profitability. Furthermore, the results indicate that both the implementation of purchasing maturity and its relationship on performance are to some degree context-dependent.

We focus on individual-level cognitions of situations and actions as key factors in routine formation, and explicate how these cognitions change over time as situations recur. We treat actions as signals that both call for subsequent action and trigger a retrospective evaluation of the situation. The retrospective sense-making gives rise to expectations regarding future actions in similar situations. Over time, the amount of information conveyed by these signals decreases and eventually disappears - a situation which we identify as routine operation. In such situations, actors' perceptions, and their corresponding expectations for actions, become aligned, so that no ""surprises"" can happen and no further sense-making is required. We discuss the implication of our model on the empirical study of routines, as well as its contribution to the theoretical understanding of routines and learning in organizations.",Cognition; Learning; Routines,Amount of information; Cognition; Empirical studies; Individual levels; Learning; Retrospective evaluations; Routines; Strategic management; Game theory

Although the deal flow, i.e. the generation of a constant stream of investment opportunities is essential for business angels, little is known about the deal flow phenomenon within the context of angel investing. Based on one of the largest confirmatory studies on business angels in German-speaking countries and, seen from an international perspective, this is the first large-scale study to capture ego-centric network data on business angels. In this study of 101 business angels who have made 1227 angel investments and capturing ego-network data on 579 individuals, we empirically investigate different drivers of the two deal flow dimensions, i.e. quantity and quality. As a theoretical framework the two opposing views of network openness and closure have been applied. Results show that the relational and structural embeddedness of business angels within their contact network have a significant effect on both deal flow dimensions. With regard to the relational embeddedness we found that strong ties positively affect both deal flow quantity and quality, thereby supporting the view of network closure. In contrast to that, our results show that concerning the structural embeddedness of a business angel open network structures are positively related to deal flow quality. We discuss the implications of these findings for business angel as well as for social network research.",Business angels; Deal flow; Social networks,Business angels; Deal flow; Ego-centric networks; Flow quantity and qualities; International perspective; Investment opportunities; Relational embeddedness; Theoretical framework; Social networking (online)

New labor market entrants rated their familiarity with actual employers and then compared them in pairs, choosing which was more attractive as an employer and why. Results indicated that firm names and industries influenced preferences for unfamiliar firms, whereas prior awareness and perceived reputation affected preference for familiar firms. Respondents chose familiar over unfamiliar firms in 75% of comparisons, and were equally likely to draw inferences about firms regardless of their familiarity. However, respondents drew fewer false objective inferences per firm when they rated themselves as more (.42) rather than less familiar (.78) with the firm, and they drew fewer false objective inferences for chosen (.14) than non-chosen firms (.41). These findings suggest that although new labor market entrants may draw fewer false inferences about chosen familiar firms, they may discount unfamiliar firms for invalid reasons.",Job choice; Job search; Recruitment,Commerce; Job choice; Job search; Job seekers; Labor markets; Recruitment; Employment

In addition, we study how personality traits and perceived organizational variables affect these behaviors. Results, based on a Chilean sample, show that social exchange with the organization predicts both, OCB and TCB. In contrast, social exchange with the immediate supervisor is only related to some dimensions of OCB. This effect is higher for employees low in power distance.

We test empirical implications of these mechanisms using longitudinal data on merchant cooperation networks in the 18th century English city of Bristol, where a severe political cleavage between Tory and Whig merchants consistently failed to damage cross-party business cooperation. Our results are inconsistent with the integration mechanism, which implies that cross-party business relations are forged in joint activities that obviate group identity, such as joint participation in civil associations. Instead, we find that such relations resulted from political rivals' maintenance of pointedly arm's length, unequal-status contacts while avoiding same-status business partnerships common within their own parties. These findings expand the perspective of the research on economic endogamy, which has hitherto emphasized non-relational forces, external to contexts at hand, as antidotes to endogamy.",,Business partnership; Business relations; Cooperation networks; Group identities; Integration mechanisms; Joint participation; Longitudinal data; Relational mechanisms

We surveyed faculty in 104 management departments of AACSB accredited, researchoriented U.S. business schools to determine the prevalence, sources, and effects of pressure to publish. Results indicate that pressure to publish affects nearly all faculty, although tenure track faculty feel significantly more pressure than those who are tenured. The primary source of this pressure is faculty themselves, who are motivated by the prospects of enhancing their professional reputation, leaving a permanent mark on their profession, and increasing their salary and job mobility.

I contend that the prevailing view about spatial proximity ' that high spatial density leads to greater opportunities to expand one's network ' is at best incomplete and potentially misleading. Instead, I argue that an individual's spatial proximity must be considered in an ecological context ' i.e., in relation to the location and expertise of proximate colleagues. Using a unique dataset of email communication patterns, fine-grained blueprints of office-locations, scientific publication records and associated keywords, as well as the formal organization chart from the research division of a biotechnology firm, I find that co-location alone is not associated with an individual's ability to assume network positions that bridge structural holes. In fact, spatial proximity to workgroup (i.e., same laboratory) members inhibits an individual's ability to form networks that reach across the organization. By contrast, proximity conditioned on the expertise overlap of nearby, non-workgroup (i.e., different laboratory) colleagues is associated with having a less constrained network (i.e., one rich in structural holes). Lastly, spatial ecological effects are as important as human capital in providing an individual with opportunities to occupy brokering positions in the network. This paper contributes to the literature on networks and the organization of innovative work by developing a theory of spatial ecology and demonstrating its connection to network structural features that have been repeatedly linked to superior performance in knowledge production contexts.",Network antecedents; Organizational ecology; Propinquity,Biotechnology; Location; Email communication; High spatial density; Knowledge production; Network antecedents; Organizational ecology; Propinquity; Scientific publications; Spatial environments; Ecology

In this study, we build upon both perspectives to develop a new theory: the shifting balance perspective of corporate turnarounds.

Building on 19 case studies and more than 100 interviews with managers of strategic management, innovation management, corporate development, and corporate foresight, we identify five dimensions and 20 elements that combined capture OFO. By defining four maturity levels for each element, we provide a framework that can be used for benchmarking, improving, and designing OFO practices. We hope that this article will serve as a starting point for a much-needed discussion on how to build more robust and agile organizations. This article also contributes to dynamic-capabilities theory by defining barriers and a process model that illustrates how the elements of OFO need to be combined to create the ability to identify and acquire needed strategic resources. Furthermore, the article shows how OFO contributes to organizational ambidexterity by enhancing the ability to identify discontinuous change and develop radical innovations.",Dynamic capabilities; Environmental scanning; Organizational future orientation,Agile organizations; Corporate development; Dynamic capabilities; Environmental scanning; Innovation management; Organizational future orientations; Strategic management; Strategic resource; Enterprise resource management

This assumption is so ingrained that broader ways of considering recipients' negative responses to change are rarely considered. In this paper, contrary to starting with the assumption of resistance, we consider the possibility that there are more complete and more appropriate ways of understanding responses to change. Based on anomalies uncovered in a study of UK senior managers who were recipients of a large scale change initiative in their multinational corporation, we take an abductive approach (Locke, Golden-Biddle & Feldman, 2008) to the development of theory-building about responses to organizational change. Through iterating back and forth between the data and theory, we have developed a model of responses to organizational change that incorporates shared emotion, and group and intergroup dynamics, including social comparison and group cohesion. This model makes evident that what appears on the surface as simply 'resistance' actually encompasses, over time, a number of crucial components that have implications not only for the understanding of change, but also for change agent practice.",Organizational change; Resistance; Strategic change,Electric resistance; Managers; Change agents; Group cohesions; Multi-national corporations; Organizational change; Senior managers; Strategic changes; Theory building; Strategic planning

Public reporting of quality and patient satisfaction data, increasing costs, stiffer competition, and anticipated tightening of budgets have created new levels of urgency among medical school deans and hospital CEOs to increase the effectiveness of the clinical enterprise on multiple fronts. This study models an AMC as a loosely coupled system and examines how interdisciplinary teams'comprising administrators, physicians, and nurses'work to harmonize seemingly disparate quality improvement goals. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to rigorously test the premise that contextual ambidexterity mediates the relationships between team characteristics, the team's organizational context and goal harmony. Several cross-product terms were modeled to isolate interaction effects. This research contributes to the field in three ways. First, it offers a novel conceptualization of contextual ambidexterity as a twostage alignment-to-adaptability process and draws linkages to the theory of the Toyota Production System. Second, it offers preliminary guidance on key characteristics of teams that sponsors should seek, and on the nature of the context they should create. Finally, the study suggests that sponsors should be wary of charismatic leaders who achieve goal harmony through equifinal meaning construction which often does not survive post-implementation sensemaking.",Ambidexterity; Sensemaking; Toyota Production System,Automobile manufacture; Budget control; Competition; Academic medical centers; Ambidexterity; Contextual ambidexterities; Interdisciplinary teams; Loosely coupled systems; Sensemaking; Structural equation modeling techniques; Toyota Production System; Hospitals

Study 2 helped establish causality by manipulating the leader's demeanor through the use of a research confederate; it also tested the mediating effects of perceived leader competence and threat. We found that, in participative decision making, the effect of the leader's demeanor on follower voice was mediated by perceived leader competence. In other words, while leaders who exhibit a powerful demeanor may boost their appearance of competence, they also risk stifling follower voice precisely because they appear more competent.",Leadership; Participative decision making; Voice,Image enhancement; Speech; Laboratory studies; Leader-follower; Leadership; Mediating effect; Participative decision makings; Unintended consequences; Decision making

This paper analyzes how the creativity dependency of an organization impacts managers' choices of organizational control mechanisms. Building on theory from creativity research and research on organizational control mechanisms, we propose a model that links the creativity dependency of an organization with two main influencing factors of organizational control mechanisms: high importance of intrisic motivation and low programmability of tasks, that is, a lack of knowledge about the relationship between employee behavior and the achieved outcomes. Using survey data from 458 firms in the German-speaking countries, we test our theoretical model and provide evidence on how the perceived creativity dependency of organizations influences the choice of organizational control mechanisms.",Creativity; Organizational control mechanisms,Competition; Managers; Motivation; Competitive advantage; Creativity; Employee behavior; Intrinsic motivation; Organizational control mechanisms; Perceived creativities; Theoretical modeling; Work environments; Behavioral research

Chandler's own firms are analyzed financially as their structure evolves through successive phases of being matched to their strategy, mismatched, and then finally matched again. Over 70 longitudinal tests are performed, yielding mostly statistically significant results. These tests surprisingly suggest that mismatched firms generally outperform firms that match structure to strategy. Plausible explanations are provided as to the reasons for this apparent reversal of Chandler's theoretical insight. The importance of strategy implementation is discussed in relation to its theoretical connection to culture. It is conceivable that Chandler's mismatched firms are actually matched in terms of strategy and culture with the latter becoming a substitute for formal structure. Matching culture to strategy may thus be the intuitively missing element, subtly nested within Chandler's Strategy and Structure (1962).",,Financial analysis; Formal structures; Strategy implementations

Building on Lewin, Lippitt, and White's (1939) classic work on how leaders shape the social climates of groups, we conducted a study of leaders and members in 92 branches of a large bank in the mid-Atlantic U.S., and found that leader attributes, including need for closure, extraversion, and childhood experiences with conflict, are associated with the emergence of distinct conflict culture types (i.e., avoidant, dominating, or collaborative). Consistent with attraction-selection-attrition processes (Schneider, 1987), we also found that conflict cultures are a function of group member personality, including agreeableness and extraversion. Finally, the results demonstrate that conflict cultures have wide-ranging consequences for macro branch-level outcomes, including creativity, customer service, cohesion, trust, burnout, and conflict efficacy.

Arbitration is the most prominent of the ADR mechanisms used for both domestic and international commercial transactions. Despite the rising popularity of arbitration, few studies have examined the factors motivating firms to use the arbitration mechanism in their technology agreements. In particular, empirical research on this issue is surprisingly rare in the strategic management and business economics literature. In this paper, we propose to palliate this important lack of empirical research by studying the trade-off between arbitration and litigation in technology licensing agreements. Given the expertise of the arbitrators, the confidentiality of the arbitral procedure, and the use of idiosyncratic rules, the arbitration mechanism offers numerous advantages when disputes involve technology and IP. However, licensing partners do not systematically decide to include an arbitration provision in their licensing contract. It is therefore important to understand the advantages offered by arbitration but also its drawbacks. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework addressing the trade-off between arbitration and litigation by using as our frame of reference Transaction Cost Economics. We argue that the likelihood that an arbitration provision will be included in a licensing contract increases when the transaction governed by this contract presents high risk of opportunism and great difficulty of writing a complete contract. To test our theoretical framework, we use a database of 118 licensing transactions collected through an online survey launched with the support from the Belgian technology trade association.",Arbitration; Technology partnership; Transaction costs,Costs; Economic and social effects; Laws and legislation; Alternative dispute resolution; Arbitration; Arbitration mechanisms; Commercial transactions; Technology partnerships; Theoretical framework; Transaction cost; Transaction cost economics; Copyrights

We interpret this as evidence that the shareholder elected nomination committees effectively channel shareholder concerns and preempt other kinds of activism. In addition, we find more shareholder activity in large firms and less activity in leveraged firms.

We show the empirical implications of this approach, but also the importance of local institutions such as nomination committees in shaping the nature of shareholder activism.

However, how critical developmental transitions come about has not yet been thoroughly delineated. Drawing on adult learning theory, constructive developmental theory, and mentoring theory, we illustrate how developmental networks can serve as holding environments for leaders' development. We systematically consider how the composition of a focal leader's developmental network - and in particular, the developmental positions of each mentor in the network and the adult learning approaches they model - provide the necessary confirmation, contradiction and continuity that are essential for movement to a new developmental stage. (Kegan, 1982). We offer four propositions regarding how developmental networks can serve as holding environments that foster greater authenticity and versatility in leadership.

They are often characterized as relying on low-quality patents, an assessment that, if correct, would imply that eradicating such patents would effectively terminate the troll business. In this paper, we shed light on this issue by empirically analyzing trolls' patent acquisitions. We draw on a unique dataset of 565 patents acquired by known patent trolls between 1997 and 2007, which we compare to 1,130 patents acquired by practicing firms. Our findings regarding patent characteristics support recent theoretical propositions about the troll business model. Trolls focus on patents that have a broad scope and that lie in patent thickets. Surprisingly, and contrary to common belief, we find that troll patents are of significantly higher quality than those in the control group. This result implies that elevating minimum patent quality will not put an end to the patent troll business, and suggests that it is sustainable in the long run. Furthermore, we discuss the fact that trolls are peculiar players on markets for technology insofar as they are solely interested in the exclusion right, not in the underlying knowledge. We posit that transactions involving patent trolls may only be the tip of the iceberg of 'patent-only' transactions, a conjecture with strong implications for the efficiency of markets for technologies.

We address the question of why firms may not conduct broad search despite its many benefits. We argue that the costs of broadening search may inhibit exploration and identify two cost-leveraging strategies that can help firms overcome this constraint: (1) locating some of their activities in foreign countries (offshoring), and (2) joint development with other firms (partnering). Our model takes into account the costs of search on innovative activities and we find that by applying these cost-leveraging strategies, firms can 'afford' to conduct more exploratory search than if they did not use such strategies. Moreover, the degree to which offshoring and partnering benefit the firm is likely to be contingent on the firm's level of R&D spending, such that firms with lower amounts of R&D spending will enjoy greater benefits from offshoring and partnering than firms with greater amounts of R&D spending. Hypotheses were tested with longitudinal data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The main contribution of this research is to show that that firms' search behaviors are driven not just what they can do (competencies), but also by what they can afford to do (costs). Though underemphasized by prior research on learning and exploration, costs matter and have implications for search and innovation activities.",Innovation; Offshoring; Search,Exploratory search; Foreign countries; Innovation activity; Innovative activities; Joint development; Off-shoring; Pharmaceutical industry; Search

We find that if VCs are more impatient than Business Angels, the founders will prefer Business Angel to VC investment, provided that their technology is distant from the market. Conversely, they will prefer VC investment when a technology is closer to the market. If Business Angels are more impatient than VCs, the reverse occurs. Because Business Angels and VCs have different preferences regarding the signals they receive, the founders will send relatively more of the ""own investment"" signal, if they want to attract Business Angel investment, and more of the patent signal, if they want to attract VC investment. Empirical estimations of the theory support the view that the signaling value of patents and founders' investment depends on both the preferences of the signals' recipient and on the distance of a technology from the market.",Business Angels; Technology startups; Venture Capitalists,Binary alloys; Commerce; Navigation; Patents and inventions; Business angels; Empirical estimations; Potential investors; Technology start-up; Venture capitalists; Investments

We test our predictions in a large sample of 4,575 invention disclosures by teams of scientists. We find a pattern of results that confirm that the anticipated coordination costs influence whether an invention is licensed. The implications for the literatures in coordination and innovation are discussed.",Coordination; Innovation; Mutual knowledge,Patents and inventions; Coordination; Coordination costs; Mutual knowledge; Human resource management
The importance of legitimacy building when preparing for a trade sale,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399517&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54493685&partnerID=40&md5=8a9381a6a98dd66558348d707036185b,"The venture capital literature suggests that the most likely exit for a VC, who invests in a young technology-based firm, is a trade sale. In line with the empirical observation that the number of trade sales of young technology-based firms is increasing, an increasing number of scholars have investigated the determinants of a successful acquisition. However, most of the received literature analyzes acquisitions from the perspective of the acquirer and focuses on managerial actions in the period before and after acquisition that are likely to increase the acquisition success. In this paper, we take the perspective of the young technology-based firm and analyze to what extent managerial actions that are undertaken by these firms have an impact on its likelihood of being acquired and its eventual acquisition price. We use a neo-institutional perspective to position the managerial actions taken by those firms. Scholars in the neo-institutional perspective suggest that firms will take managerial actions to adjust to the expectations of the institutional environment in which they act. Doing so, they create different forms of legitimacy towards the different stakeholders in the ecosystem. In a sample of 296 UK young technology based firms, we find that signalling legitimacy is a determinant of success.",Exit; Legitimacy; Technology acquisitions,Commerce; Investments; Managers; Acquisition price; Exit; Institutional perspective; Legitimacy; Managerial actions; Number of trades; Technology acquisitions; Technology-based firms; Mergers and acquisitions
Enacting technological change in organizations: Devising accommodations of disconcerting events,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085780726&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54497750&partnerID=40&md5=678c17fbff96ea64d16d5769132d1cc0,"The performative stream in management research has gained increased attention in recent years. Such studies have provided highly contributing theoretical and empirical accounts, approaching organizational phenomena as emerging through the local accommodations of human agents. In particular, the impact this stream has had on the study of technological change has been noteworthy. While shifting focus to practice, performative studies also encompass an appreciation of change as ever-present in organizational life. Nonetheless, they have not yet provided adequate insight on how ever-present change is actually encountered and how it gives way to certain accommodations. This paper addresses this gap by theoretically drawing on the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and, in specific, his concept of the event. Enacting technological change in organizations is conceptualized as accommodating ceaseless disconcerting events upon a thus far enacted backdrop of significance. Such events are accommodated through various devices, a non-exhaustive list of which is presented in this paper, grounded on ethnographic data. This account concludes with a discussion of the originality or ordinariness of such accommodations and their implications for the trajectory of technological change in organizations.",Disconcerting event; Significance; Technological change,Disconcerting events; Exhaustive lists; Human agent; Management research; Significance; Technological change
When and how rewards increase creative performance: A theoretically-derived meta-analysis,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087224111&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54485861&partnerID=40&md5=a0c38b55b148db66ea3078ce52c96e3f,"Companies often want to motivate employees to be more creative - but whether and how rewards may increase creativity remains unclear. We integrated two motivation theories, expectancy theory and self-determination, to hypothesize that information and control are central to the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of creativity. To test our hypotheses, we meta-analyzed 71 studies (including 80 independent outcomes) that examined the reward-creativity relationship. Our results suggest that informational elements in the reward and context increase the positive effect of rewards on creativity, and that controlling elements in the reward or context reduce the positive effects of information on creative performance.",Creativity; Job performance; Rewards,Controlling elements; Creative performance; Creativity; Expectancy theory; Extrinsic motivation; Job performance; Motivation theories; Rewards; Motivation

We highlight a firm's strategic use of signaling in generating positive outcomes by examining how consultations with a central institutional actor (the FDA) can serve as a signal of quality of GMOs regulated by the USDA. Although FDA consultations do not provide any substantial information about GMOs, they positively affect their approval rates. Our study further shows that firm and product uncertainty increases the signaling benefits.",Genetically modified organisms; Regulatory environments; Signaling,Decision making; Genetically modified organisms; Product uncertainties; Regulatory approvals; Regulatory decisions; Regulatory environment; Signaling

While some may raise the question of methodological rigor as seen in a quarter of the 120 studies depending on basic descriptive statistics for primary findings or the low number (4) of fully randomized design studies, we believe researchers are uncovering important findings from the large number of predictors, control variables and criterion variables examined over the years and employing appropriate and increasingly sophisticated techniques such as structural equation models in many recent studies (16) within a field setting. To increase methodological rigor, researchers need to consciously incorporate control variables that are known to influence criterion variables of interest so as to clearly partial out the influence of their predictor variables of interest. This will help address shortcomings from inability to convince sample respondents such as institutional administrators and graduate business students on the benefits versus the cost of a fully randomized design approach. Suggestions on some future research issues are also discussed in the findings.",E-learning; Online learning; Research methods,Education computing; Students; Analytical approach; Business educations; Control variable; Descriptive statistics; Online learning; Predictor variables; Randomized design; Structural equation models; E-learning
Towards a theory of strategic absenting: Absenting as a strategic choice,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085782075&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54500928&partnerID=40&md5=85785d3fdafb18855cdc97044a15e83b,"In this case study, we build new theory regarding the relationship between absenting and absence, and strategic choice. By absence we are referring to the strategic significance of an organization being without something, lacking an activity/practice, or being absent from a particular field or location. Based on conventional understanding, properties of 'absence' can be explained solely by reference to what is 'present'. This belief has discouraged research efforts to investigate properties of absence. We challenge this belief by building new theory regarding the properties of absenting and absence in relation to strategic choice. We argue there to be significant asymmetries in organizations relative powers to decide strategic presence and absence, which can be systematically deployed to enhance strategic choice available to firms. We theorize how these asymmetries stem from properties of (1) unilateral absenting, (2) selfperpetuating absence, and (3) irreversible absence. As a result, we argue that 'absence' has a significant role as a facilitator of strategic choice, which cannot be addressed purely by what is 'present'. More generally, we argue that there are distinctive benefits to epistemically treat 'absence' as real, if absence is observed to have causal powers.",Absence; Critical realism; Strategic choice,Absence; Critical realisms; New theory; Research efforts; Strategic choice

Shifting from sheep to shepherds: Seeking a context-focused paradigm for international business,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087223819&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54501110&partnerID=40&md5=04788942dbb131986d6324ac4e343368,"A critical look at the field of international business ('IB') reveals lack of identity, confusion and frustration. Over a decade after Toyne and Nigh (1997) addressed the problem, there is little progress. Many have searched for the 'holy grail' theory, unique to IB that justifies the field's existence and steers its future course. However, IB's origins thwart this effort. Prior research identifies symptoms and encourages collaborative efforts to overcome field deficiencies; this paper explores the source of IB's challenges. Comprehensive diagnosis clarifies why the solution cannot be found in traditional thinking that treats IB as an extension of other disciplines. To achieve legitimacy and recognition as an independent domain, IB must embrace its core contribution of context and build theory not from the perspective of the firm but from the perspective of the business environment context. To claim our domain involves a paradigm shift nothing short of intellectual revolution.",Context; International business; Paradigm shift,Business environments; Context; International business; Paradigm shifts
The interaction of contributive and absorptive capacities in post-acquisition integration,2010,"Academy of Management 2010 Annual Meeting - Dare to Care: Passion and Compassion in Management Practice and Research, AOM 2010",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086493460&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2010.54501094&partnerID=40&md5=583982e71d422908e531b9e983f45b3b,"Post-acquisition integration is considered critical to value-creation from acquisitions. The strategy literature on acquisitions has to a large extent has focused on the acquiring firm's role in securing value creation in the integration process. I argue that both the target and the acquiring firm are critical for value creation. I introduce the concept of contributive capacity, referring to the target firm's active role in creating value in post-acquisition integration. This study shows that 1) the target's contributive capacity positively influences serendipitous value creation in postacquisition integration, and 2) the acquirer's absorptive capacity is not a constant or accumulative capacity, but rather relative and dependent on the characteristics of the target and the integration process, and 3) value is created through the interaction of the target's contributive and the acquirer's absorptive capacities.",Absorptive capacity; Contributive capacity; Post-acquisition integration,Integration; Absorptive capacity; Contributive capacities; Integration process; Post-acquisition integrations; Value creation; Mergers and acquisitions
Where do conflictual ties come from?

It explores the role of spatial distribution of principals (firms) and mediating agents (intellectual property litigation firms) in facilitating and sustaining the conflictual relationships. Spatial propinquity is hypothesized to determine the nature of social relationships between the principal's and the mediating agent's employees, subsequently affecting the mediating agent's involvement in identification of opportunities for conflictual interactions by the principal. Propinquity is also predicted to decrease principal's communication and transportation costs while maintaining a professional relationship with the mediating agent, hence proving a more positive economic outlook of entering into and sustaining conflictual ties. The context of this study is the patterns of spatial distribution of 405 U.S. firms in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals (the principals) and 57 leading intellectual property litigation firms (the mediating agents). It relates these patterns to the involvement in patent infringement disputes by the biopharmaceutical firms in 1998-2006. The study additionally utilizes evidence from thirty-two semi-structured interviews with business executives, in-house legal counsel, patent attorneys, and litigators. Results suggest that, for a litigious firm, both proximity to and the concentration of proximate IP law firms increase the number of lawsuits the firm files and the number of litigation days the firm has in a given year.",Conflict; Distance; Litigation,Laws and legislation; Patents and inventions; Biopharmaceutical firms; Conflict; Distance; Inter-organizational relationships; Litigation; Patent infringements; Professional relationships; Semi structured interviews; Spatial distribution

Under these conditions, women can explore their leadership challenges with the emotional and intellectual support of the other participants and instructors. The analysis expands the transformational learning framework by including an additional stage in the process, incorporating transition points between stages, identifying the conditions necessary for transformation, and demonstrating the potential of transformational learning for improving women's leadership effectiveness.",Transformational learning; Women's leadership; Women-only training practices,Metadata; Learning environments; Qualitative data; Teaching and learning; Transformational learning; Transition point; Women's leaderships; Women-only training practices; Computer aided instruction

"ORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CONTINGENCY FRAMEWORK","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166545929&doi=10.5465%2fannals.2021.0073&partnerID=40&md5=025d02406b77e6b58ff401b218fa402d","Organizational experience is generally expected to have a positive effect on subsequent task performance. However, research over the past two decades has recognized an increas-ing number of circumstances in which the performance effects of experience are less clear or even negative. Given the inconclusive evidence on the nature of the experience– performance relationship, we conduct a systematic review and synthesize previously unconnected streams of literature on the organizational experience–performance relationship into a contingency framework on how the applicability, accessibility, and adoption of experiential knowledge jointly moderate the commonly assumed positive effect of organizational experience on performance in a focal task. Based on our integrative contingency framework, we identify important gaps in our understanding of these boundary conditions and develop a research agenda to expand our understanding of organizational experience effects on organizational performance. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""
"The effects of mandatory and voluntary regulatory pressures on firms’ environmental strategies: A review and recommendations for future research","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078258942&doi=10.5465%2fannals.2018.0014&partnerID=40&md5=ae5ce3b14e70362b12cc895c97e169c3","This article presents an in-depth review of scholarship on how mandatory and voluntary regulatory pressures on firms affect their environmental strategies and performance. Although mandatory regulation typically has a strong and positive influence on firms’ environmental performance, studies of the effects of voluntary pressures demonstrate that by themselves they are unlikely to bring about significant improvement in environmental outcomes. Accordingly, future research should focus on the complementary impacts of mandatory and voluntary programs on organizations’ environmental strategies and performance rather than analyzing their separate influence. Scholars should examine i) more than a single environmental pressure at a given time, ii) more than one response to the regulatory context, iii) the synergy between mandatory and voluntary pressures, iv) the impact of imperfect enforcement, and v) the political influence corporations exert on the mandatory and voluntary pressures that affect them. This essay argues that managers react to environmental regulations in different ways depending on how they understand the multiple pressures that they confront and their opportunities to influence the outcomes. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Synthesizing research in the fields of management, entrepreneurship, innovation, operations, information systems, and marketing, we conduct an integrative review of the crowdfunding research accumulated over the past decade. We aim to break down disciplinary silos to develop a framework that integrates insights across research communities. We identify three underlying dimensions that differentiate extant research: the goal of the campaigner, the role of the crowd, and the boundary of the crowdfunding event. Scholars have brought two perspectives to bear on these questions: an elemental perspective and a processual perspective. We outline an integrative model that takes account of crowdfunding as a process involving heterogeneous participants with idiosyncratic monetary and nonmonetary goals at different stages. Our multidisciplinary review of this expanding body of literature not only integrates dispersed insights but also, more importantly, stimulates a future research agenda that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of crowdfunding research. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""
"Entrepreneurial network evolution: Explicating the structural localism and agentic network change distinction","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090664207&doi=10.5465%2fannals.2018.0063&partnerID=40&md5=feb0e7940e42425d77fa489e29d5a982","Literature has long highlighted that entrepreneurs benefit from having the right network connections. We observe, however, that although the large and growing literature on entrepreneur network evolution shares a common focus around the formation and dissolution of entrepreneurs’ interdependent, socially embedded relationships, this literature is fragmented and does not always use the explicit language of network theory. We conduct an integrative review to put forth a typology of five core drivers of entrepreneur network evolution. A core insight of our review is that most entrepreneurial network research emphasizes an overarching pattern that suggests substantial path-dependence, with new ties often being local to entrepreneurs’ existing network, hier-archical, and geographic positions. We label this perspective structural localism. By contrast, more recent, emerging research on entrepreneurial action in forming inter-organizational relationships, much of which does not use the language of network theory (e.g., ties and networks), suggests a more dynamic and path-creating pattern. We label this perspective agentic network change. After explicating the distinct theoretical foundations and behavioral assumptions of each perspective, we sketch a research agenda for better balancing our understanding of the two and how they intertwine. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

While detrimental effects of identification in organizations have been captured in vari-ous studies, the field of management lacks a comprehensive blueprint of the state of this research. This omission is particularly significant given recent calls for some “course corrections” in the field, which signal the need to balance the dominant preoccupation with the positive effects of identification and identity with more consideration of their negative effects. It is also a missed opportunity for impact given the relevance of the topic to understanding current identity-related tensions and issues within organizations (e.g., debates around diversity and inclusion). We address this oversight with a comprehensive review of the dark side of strong identification, focusing specifically on exclusive, mixed, and multiple identifications. In doing so, we highlight the need for a more bal-anced understanding of the ways identification processes influence our lives, organiza-tions, and society at large. @ Academy of Management Annals, all rights reserved.","",""

Strategy research has suggested that senior managers, through their decisions, influence capabilities at the organizational level. Organizational behavior research has suggested that teams, through engaging in learning within and across their boundaries, contribute to organizational-level capabilities. Only recently have researchers started to link the two sets of insights, exploring the idea that team learning plays a critical bridging role in how decisions by senior managers translate into organizational performance outcomes. This paper organizes these insights into a model of capability development focused on how different kinds of team learning routines may support organizational capabilities that create competitive advantage. The model introduces a strategic view of team learning, highlighting the ability of senior managers to shape team learning routines effectively as a critical skill because of its role in building organizational capabilities.

Over the past two decades, there has been growing research in the organizational sciences on four types of resource seeking behaviors: feedback seeking, information seeking, advice seeking, and help seeking. However, research on these four behaviors has existed in separate silos. We argue that there is value in recognizing that these behaviors reflect a common higher order construct (resource seeking), and in integrating the findings across the four literatures as a basis for understanding what we do and do not know about the predictors and outcomes of resource seeking at work. More specifically, we use conservation of resources (COR) theory as a framework to guide our integration across the four literatures and to both deepen and extend current understandings of why and when employees engage in resource seeking, as well as how resource seeking behaviors may lead to both individual-and collective-level outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of future research needs and how COR theory can provide a fruitful foundation for future resource seeking research. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""
"THEORIZING ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF MULTIPLEXITY: AN INTEGRATIVE TYPOLOGY","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166536805&doi=10.5465%2fannals.2021.0193&partnerID=40&md5=d409a0356fe223c04a57c5132b19d368","Multiplexity, the coexistence of more than one type of relationship between two actors, is a prevalent phenomenon with clear relevance for a wide range of management settings and phenomena. While there is a substantial body of work on multiplexity, the absence of a shared terminology and a typology for the mechanisms and arguments that are used in theorizing about its implications nevertheless hamper its appeal to organizational network scholars and slow its progress. Based on content analysis of 103 studies, we pro-pose “relational harmony,” “task complementarity,” and “relational scope” as three cat-egories to integrate the mechanisms and arguments used in the literature to theorize about the implications of multiplexity. We then survey the literature in light of this typol-ogy to show how it is also useful in revealing patterns of theorizing; for example, with respect to the types of relationships that are studied in relation to multiplexity. We conclude with suggestions for future research directions, focusing on how these can be pur-sued based on our integrative typology. We hope that the common ground we provide for theorizing about the implications of multiplexity will make it an even more engaging topic for organizational network and management scholars, and place it in the company of more prominently used relational constructs in management research, as aligned with its prevalence and relevance. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

In reviewing the literature, we find that Bourdieu’s concepts of economic, cultural, social, and symbolic capital provide a useful beginning, yet are imprecise and insufficient for organizational research. We therefore modify and extend Bourdieu’s typology to include knowledge, reputational, organizational, and institutional capital as distinct varieties of political capital in organizations. We provide an integrative framework and further review the concept of political capital as determinant of power within organizations, focusing on its activation and mobilization, its convertibility, and the contingency of its value in organizations. We also bring to the fore various mechanisms latent in the extant literature that explain how political capital generates power—not only resource dependence but also status, identification, and legitimacy. Our proposed political capital framework provides a foundation for further research on power in organizations. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

This tension leads people to engage in complex behaviors that stretch the boundaries of honesty. Such behaviors include strategically avoiding information, dodg-ing questions, omitting information, and making true but misleading statements. Though not lies per se, these are nonetheless deviations from honesty that have serious interper-sonal, organizational, and societal costs. Based on a systematic review of 169 empirical research articles in the fields of management, organizational behavior, applied psychol-ogy, and business ethics, we develop a new multidimensional framework of honesty that highlights how honesty encompasses more than the absence of lies—it has relational elements (e.g., fostering an accurate understanding in others through what we disclose and how we communicate) and intellectual elements (e.g., evaluating information for accu-racy, searching for accurate information, and updating our beliefs accordingly). By acknowledging that honesty is not limited to the moment when a person utters a clear lie or a full truth, and that there are multiple stages to enacting honesty, we emphasize the shared responsibility that all parties involved in communication have for seeking out and communicating truthful information. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Yet, research on work and mental health challenges remains frag-mented and sparse. We provide a historical overview of workplace attention to mental health versus physical health, noting areas where workplaces’ response to physical health could serve as a model for attention to mental health. We then share results of an interdisciplinary review of 556 studies on mental health challenges and work, wherein we integrate themes in three broad categories: antecedents, outcomes, and interventions for mental health challenges. Our review suggests that a primary impediment to progress is the frequent theoretical and methodological conflation between (poor) mental health and mental illness, with unexplained inconsistency in the temporality, severity, and content of mental health measures across studies. Based on these findings, we present sugges-tions for critical areas of future research, including increased emphasis on proactive workplace interventions and research that addresses the distinction—and relationship— between mental health and mental illness at work.

Over the last decades, scholars from a broad range of theoretical and methodological traditions have generated a vast yet dispersed body of literature on technology evolution. We offer a comprehensive synthesis of the major streams of scholarship on technology evolution by dividing the literature into four perspectives: Technology-realist, economic realist, cognitive interpretivist, and social constructionist. We further show that each perspective offers a divergent account of three central mechanisms— variation, selection, and retention—that drive discrete, continuous, and cyclical patterns of technology evolution. We integrate these perspectives by highlighting that they all emphasize recombination, environmental fit, and path dependence as central drivers of those three mechanisms. This integration opens paths toward a more complete account of technology evolution than that offered by the currently scattered state of the extant literature. We emphasize the need for a coevolutionary framework that cuts across the four perspectives to push the literature forward. Subsequently, we outline the foundation of this framework and propose future research opportunities by which the literature on the evolution of technology can advance. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite growing interest in the topic, however, research has been fragmented across management areas. To advance scholarly knowledge in this field, we reviewed the empirical work dealing with aesthetics. Our review yields two major insights. First, we identify three perspectives on the role of aesthetics. Scholars have treated aesthetics as (a) a directed stimulus (that elicits product evaluation and work organization), (b) a knowledge tool (that is entwined with creative work and everyday organizational tasks), or (c) an open-ended outcome (that serves as a personal experience). Second, we find that each perspective highlights emotional and cognitive mechanisms through which aesthetics is implicated in organizing. Building on these two insights, our review offers an integrative framework that provides a comprehensive picture of the state of the field, illuminating the work of aesthetics in and around organizations and providing avenues for future studies. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Yet these streams are underintegrated, creating a lack of nuanced understanding of how virtuality impacts gender equality. We review findings from 100 articles and synthesize two main research perspectives to develop an integrative framework of virtuality’s mixed effects for women. Studies grounded in person–environment fit theory have tended to emphasize positive effects, while those based on social role theory have examined both positive and negative effects. A critical insight from our review is that while growing virtuality holds promise for advancing gender equality by enabling opportunities for women to overcome persistent career challenges, it may simultaneously inhibit their success. However, few studies have examined these dynamics together. Our review illuminates the career-enhancing and career-damaging mechanisms through which virtuality–gender interactions concurrently improve and undermine women’s equality outcomes. These dual mechanisms create three virtuality tensions for women between: (a) work–nonwork boundary control and interference, (b) enhanced and reduced job opportunities, and (c) social integration and exclusion. We offer a research agenda that attends to both sides of these tensions, identifies their interdependencies, and examines how they operate over time. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Three key theoretical insights emerge from our evidence-based integration: (a) Membership change first disrupts team cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal processes and states (e.g., transactive memory systems, coordination) but can benefit team performance after teams adapt to form new processes and states; (b) whether and to what extent team performance benefits from membership change is contingent on the magnitude of membership change, requirements of team communication, member adaptation-related attributes, change in team knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs), and team knowledge work; and (c) poor team experiences motivate member departure and may make it challenging for newcomers to join and teams to adapt to membership change.

We review 156 empirical team climate studies spanning the last decade, observing a widely held assumption that environmental stimuli influence climate strength. However, closer inspection of these studies suggests that this relationship is far more complex and nuanced than previously considered. This is problematic, since an oversimplified view of how climate strength develops may lead to erroneous conclusions—for example, that everyone will share similar perceptions if exposed to the same stimuli. Our review: (a) distinguishes experiences from interpre-tations, explaining how some stimuli are experienced by all (some) yet are interpreted differently (the same); (b) distinguishes stimuli from the contexts in which they occur, explaining how contextual elements—specifically, the structural dimensions of teams—are not stimuli but rather act as a lenses through which experiences and interpretations occur; and (c) develops a more complete theory of climate strength reflecting contemporary work practices—including informal structures and teams with more fluid boundaries—by explaining how these lenses simultaneously filter multiple stimuli in either complementary or competing ways. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

In our integrative review of 313 cross-discipline empirical articles, we find that the transitions attributes defined by Ebaugh (1988) and Ashforth (2001), the field’s seminal works, have been largely left unintegrated and unmeasured. Rather, while scholars may refer to attributes, they in fact study people’s lived transition experiences. To bring coherence and relevance to a fragmented field, we leverage the literature to propose a field-level shift to an experience-based framework. We organize our review around three vistas that undergird the transition experience we see studied in the research. These include four transition-related movements (psychological, physical, behavioral, and relational); the whole person in transition (interrelated non-work and work life spheres); and the person-in-network transitioning (transitions impacting and impacted by one’s social entourage). We mark a pathway toward this experience-based view, issuing three challenges for management researchers: broadening the study of movements beyond the psychological (first challenge), examining work and non-work transitions’ effects on organization-relevant outcomes (second challenge), and charting how individuals’ transitions impact their entourage and vice versa (third challenge). © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

This review addresses basic questions about values’ nature, origins, and functions, and uncovers many latent connections between these currently separate bodies of research. Drawing on this literature review, our second aim is to elaborate the “value of values” for institutional analysis.

While network research has typically treated relationships between social actors as static, there has been a surge in literature extending a dynamic lens to intraorganizational networks. Critically, there is no comprehensive and systematic review of intraorganizational network dynamics studies. Moreover, the field lacks programmatic coherence, clear and consistent terminology, and methodological clarity. This review attempts to resolve these issues. To foster a common lan-guage, we provide an integrative definition and clarify the scope of intraorganizational network dynamics. This allows us to distinguish four domains of dynamic network theo-rizing. Building on this, we develop an encompassing framework that maps the multiple facets of this literature and apply it to organize our summary and synthesis. We then take a bird’s-eye view of the full body of research and discuss four foundational areas in which network dynamics research can be conceptually and methodologically extended. We end by elaborating on the issue of interdependence in network data and providing an overview of leading statistical approaches for modeling longitudinal network data that explicitly account for dependence among observations. We see this review as an entry point for researchers interested in intraorganizational network dynamics and as a way to spark new scholarship on questions that remain open in this literature. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Yet, despite growing research on the phenomenon, insights have remained fragmented due to a lack of common theoretical infrastructure. In an effort to synthesize the disparate threads of research on craft, we conducted an interpretive review of the concept’s use in management and organizational literature over the past century. Based on this we propose a reconceptualization of craft as a timeless approach to work that prioritizes human engagement over machine control. We identify the distinct work skills and attitudes that are typically associated with craft, and illustrate how these appear across two conventional configurations (traditional and industrialized craft) and three contemporaneous configurations (technical, pure, and creative craft) that are visible in the literature. Finally, we suggest how our framework could be used as a general theory for understanding alternative approaches to work against the backdrop of growing affordances of machine technology, and sketch future research avenues for exploring specific craft-related tensions and evolutionary processes. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

From the recruitment of celebrity chief executive officers to the fierce competition for star scientists, and from lucrative contracts for sports icons to outsized bonuses for top salespeople, human capital strategies have long promoted the importance of star performers. Sixty years of research on stars has witnessed a wide array of contexts, levels of analysis, and subdimensions, much of which is focused on the accomplishments of these alpha-tail individuals. More recently, however, scholars have begun to draw varied conclusions regarding both the favorable and unfavorable impacts of star performers, leading to a balkanization of perspectives comprising the stream. Our review of the multidisciplinary work on stars synthesizes disparate studies, settles definitional problems, and integrates complementary factors into a coherent formative construct.

While these research areas include substan-tial empirical and theoretical work and share notable similarities, the literature streams have evolved separately, limiting our ability to understand underlying mechanisms and dynamics. We comprehensively review these distinct literatures to highlight commonalities and induce novel insights. We introduce the overarch-ing concept of the “managed ecosystem” governance structure through which an organization engages external communities for value creation and capture such that the locus of activity resides outside organizational boundaries while the locus of control remains within the organization. It represents a “translucent hand” between the invisible hand of the market and visible hand of the organizational hierarchy. Because the extant literature only lightly addresses incumbent organizations transitioning to these models and rarely touches upon those operating with multiple governance structures simultaneously, we further review and synthesize research on organizational adaptation and ambidexterity. From this integrative review, we identify capabilities to execute managed ecosystems, including “shepherding communities without exploiting them,” “managing data and intellectual property,” “ecosystem-driven open adaptation,” and “ambidextrous gov-ernance.” We additionally present opportunities for future research across these research domains. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Yet, cultural understandings of what is discreditable or taboo do not come from the individual, occupation, organization, or industry that is stigmatized; on the contrary, they come from particular sources that transcend levels. As such, we propose that current silos within the literature may not only be preventing engagement with insights from different levels of analysis but, importantly, be preventing us from truly understanding stigmatization as a social process.

Based on a systematic literature review of articles about social innovation published in top-tier journals from 2003 to 2021, we argue that a “social innovation trap,” resulting from disciplinary silos, has limited our inquiries thus far. We contend that the social innovation trap has led the field to overlook three key insights. First, fragmentation across disciplines obscures the particular advantages of different sectors to social innovation. Second, the dominance of management within the social innovation field has led us to ignore the extent to which social innovation is embedded in space and place, which makes scale a fundamental dimension in need of exploration. Third, the management bent within social innovation scholarship has favored market perspectives over more democratic approaches. We call attention to two competing schools of thought—the instrumental and democratic perspectives—that open the field to broader inquiries into the role of innovation, knowledge, participation, and outcomes in social innovation.

Although this adaptive turn has contributed significantly to understanding how strategies are implemented and adapted, it has also led to a further fragmentation of the field.We put forward an integrative view that aims at combining the distinctive strengths of the two complementary views.

This review explains how AI differs from other technologies and presents the existing empirical research on the determinants of human “trust” in AI, conducted in multiple disciplines over the last 20 years. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify the form of AI representation (robot, virtual, and embedded) and its level of machine intelligence (i.e., its capabilities) as important antecedents to the development of trust and propose a framework that addresses the elements that shape users’ cognitive and emotional trust. Our review reveals the important role of AI’s tangibility, transparency, reliability, and immediacy behaviors in developing cognitive trust, and the role of AI’s anthropomorphism specifically for emotional trust. We also note several limitations in the current evidence base, such as the diversity of trust measures and overreliance on short-term, small sample, and experimental studies, where the development of trust is likely to be different than in longer-term, higher stakes field environments.

First, we present an integrated account of the current state of crossdisciplinary knowledge on shareholder activism to identify what we know about different aspects of activist–firm engagements. Second, we use that account to develop a detailed map of the shareholder activism process, including how activists identify target firms, the engagement approaches used, the role of stakeholders’ varied reactions, and outcomes of activism campaigns. Third, after mapping this process, we propose that the cumulative interdependencies identified by shareholder activism researchers can be more fully understood as a complex, dynamic, and adaptive system. This system accounts for activists’ interdependence on other stakeholders, dynamic feedback loops whereby current campaigns affect future engagements, and strategic adaptive behaviors by firms and stakeholders over time.

Our structured content analysis situates the literature based on questions addressed for new venture team formation, such as why, how, when, and where entrepreneurial teams are formed. The resulting integrative framework delineates the dynamic nature of the formation process, the origins of new venture teams, primary formation strategies used to initiate cofounding relations, and their effects on team characteristics, processes, and performance.

It is most useful to investigate the unconscious forces that underpin the persistence of dysfunctional organizational features and the appeal of irrational leaders. It is also well equipped to challenge arrangements that stifle individual and organizational development. The article documents the tension, in this body of work, between an “outside-in” perspective, focused on institutions’ influence on individuals, and an “in-side-out” perspective, focused on leaders’ influence on institutions. It also interrogates the marginalization of systems psychodynamic scholarship, positing that its marginality is both a social defense for organization studies as a whole and a generative feature of the systems psychodynamics approach.

From our review, we develop a multistage model that integrates the influences of individual traits and contextual factors with intraindividual moral self-regulation processes. Combining findings from diverse research domains (e.g., management, psychology, marketing, and economics), we emphasize the importance of these factors in understanding the evaluation of initial and compensatory (un)ethical behavior, the selection of targets for compensatory behavior, and shifts in moral reference points. In doing so, we highlight conceptual, empirical, and methods-related contributions to this literature, and we identify paths for future research that integrates different perspectives on behavioral ethics. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Missing from these knowledge advancements are an explicit focus and an integrative framework capturing dynamic processes of errors. Most notably, many extant organizational science studies are rooted in a static error-as-event perspective without incorporating operations management insights on dynamic patterns of errors. We therefore provide a systematic analysis of both organizational science and operations management literatures and offer an error-as-process perspective that sees errors as a cascade (or chain) of emergent triggers, adaptive activities, and social interactions that develop, change, and travel through organizational systems over time. We organize our review around three themes that undergird error phenomena research: (a) the temporal relationship between error prevention (that happens before errors occur) and error management (that arises after errors occur); (b) temporal patterns of error emergence, cumulation, and movement cross work flows; and (c) the dynamic error equilibrium that is characterized by error-amplifying or error-corrective feedback loops. We then mark four pathways toward an integrative view of error-as-process to reposition and broaden error research. Finally, we close with suggestions to understand and study errors as dynamic processes in a more substantial way. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

We use this framework to guide our review of the various forms of memory work within and between mnemonic communities. Our review shows that much of the sociologically informed research has focused on memory work within communities.

Reviewing a century of organizational research on bureaucracy, we find three main perspectives, which developed in succession but persist in parallel: bureaucracy as an organizing principle, as a paradigmatic form of organization, and as one type of structure among others. We argue that these three perspectives should be brought into closer dia-logue and expanded, so we can overcome the decontextualized, reified, and atomized ways in which bureaucracy is often viewed. To that end, we offer three pathways to stimulate future research—exploring bureaucracy in its wider context, bureaucracy in action, and bureaucracy’s interdependencies and configurations.

For example, key OT concepts such as prob-lemistic search, heuristics, exploration, requisite variety, and organizational scripts all have their roots in AI. The main goal of this paper is to expose the full range of AI ideas that have been used in OT. We do so by explaining key AI ideas and showing how OT used them. Our review covers over 100 OT works that depend on AI ideas both critically and explicitly. We group these ideas into 10 AI approaches that speak to three fundamental processes in organizations: search, representation, and aggregation. We argue that this broad and deep borrowing from AI stems from fundamental structural similari-ties between AI and OT, as both fields study how artificial systems (programs and organi-zations) can pursue intelligent behavior. We also identify areas of AI from which OT scholars may continue to draw inspiration and suggest ways in which AI technologies may continue to affect organizations.

We then present a new theoretical framework—the “Structure–Appraisal Model of Multicultural Experiences”—that organizes the overall pattern of findings and provides a roadmap for future research. The structure part of our model proposes that deeper multicultural experiences produce integrative processes that transform intrapersonal cognition, whereas broader multicultural experiences activate comparative processes that influence interpersonal attitudes and behaviors. The appraisal part of our model suggests that these intrapersonal and interpersonal effects are only likely to occur when appraisals of one’s multicultural experiences are positive rather than negative.

Next, we review different streams of management research on curiosity at work (i.e., broad generative and nongenerative effects, curiosity as a catalyst for personal action, curiosity as a catalyst for interpersonal action, curiosity as a catalyst for leadership, curiosity as an organizational or professional norm, and curiosity as a catalyst for organizing). Inter-weaving these diverse literatures and research streams gives us the wherewithal to provide conceptual clarity to curiosity research and highlight how curiosity not only has generative effects at the individual level but also acts as a more dynamic, interpersonal, and organizational property.

Yet, traditional individual-centric explanations for absence are inadequate, particularly given the rise of relational, team-focused, and customer-driven work designs and in growing recognition of the permeable boundary between work and nonwork. Although there has been considerable research interest in social and relational causations of absenteeism, limited effort has been spent systematizing the evidence and formulating an overall model of the social dynamics of the behavior. Our review integrates this multidisciplinary body of research, explicating the social and relational determinants of absenteeism. We propose a multilevel model that identifies the social factors shaping absence that stem from the work (organization, occupation) and nonwork (family, community, nation or society) domains. The model establishes six primary paths and related theories through which these social factors operate, encompassing normative influence, social exchange, job resources, work atti-tudes, emotions, and ethics. The review offers evidence for the influence of the social context and provides insights concerning how team dynamics, occupational norms, gender composition, family demands, community forces, and cultural context affect absenteeism.

As a phenomenon, necessity entrepreneurship is widely associated with capital constraints, marginal profits, and limited economic impact. As a theoretical construct, it is often seen as a crude and pejorative classification device. In this article, we take stock of this emerging body of research, providing an integrative account of extant research and a focused analysis of the main areas of discord within this literature.

Leadership theory is work-centric in conceptualizing leadership styles and underemphasizes nonwork influences on leaders’ and subordinates’ nonwork outcomes. Work–life studies overlook leadership theory regarding how work–life support reflects but one aspect of what leaders do. Competing narratives coexist over whether work–life support mutually benefits work and nonwork outcomes (a synergistic “dual agenda” view) or if one comes at the expense of the other (a “dueling outcomes” view). Based on our review of 127 studies, we define work–life supportive leadership as a leadership characteristic when leaders (a) prioritize actions to provide active support for employees’ needs and preferences for managing work, family, and personal life roles; and (b) are experienced by subordinates as exhibiting such behaviors. We find clear support for the dual agenda view and observe that work–life supportive leadership is embedded within many leadership styles. Future research can advance each field’s understanding of leader work–life support dynamics. For future research, we direct leadership scholars to focus on work–life supportive leadership’s impact on subordinates’ job performance and nonwork outcomes and work–life scholars to broaden their research focus to encompass leadership and the work domain holistically. © Academy of Management.

Although scholars largely agree on the definition of homophily, their empirical measures of it vary widely. This both raises the question of whether everyone is studying the same phenomenon and suggests that our understanding of homophily is incomplete. To address this question, we examined the homophily literature from 1954 through 2018 and constructed a typology that includes the empirical measures most commonly used. We found that these measures tend to neglect the meaning that people attribute to and derive from homophilous relationships in three ways. First, measures often do not capture how individuals’ interactions with others influence their sense of the world—how social constructions affect meaning. Second, measures often do not capture whether individuals interpret and attach importance to their associations or similarities the same way researchers do. Finally, measures often do not capture the meaning-related ambiguities introduced by studies of multiple types of social contexts, associations, and similarities. Because homophily remains a central construct in social science, this divergence between measures and meaning suggests a need for refinement. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

We examine more than 100 articles that address entrepreneur-ship and race, with a focus on underrepresented minorities in the United States: African, Hispanic, and Native Americans. From these articles, we not only derive why minority entrepreneurs continue to be disadvantaged despite widespread support for their entre-preneurship, but we also elevate themes of racial agency endemic to entrepreneurship from marginalized racial positions. We argue that entrepreneurship research needs to consider race; that is, scholars need to incorporate racialized structures into their theo-rizing. Doing so not only will highlight the structural underpinnings of racial disadvantage for underrepresented minority entrepreneurs, but it also casts entrepreneurship as an essential mechanism for racial agency. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Growing literature has generated insights into how, when, and why different emotion-response strategies influence work outcomes.

To provide coherence to this area of inquiry, we offer an integrative review of 220 articles, which form the basis for our inductive point of view. We develop a theoretical framework to show that the influence of emotion-response strategies on work outcomes depends on (a) the relative placement of the strategy within our two-dimensional landscape (characterized by the relative tendency of the strategy to get involved with and to change the expressed emotion) and (b) the specific nature of the context (including nexuses of contextual factors). Our framework yields several insights for future research, including the need to study discrete emotion-response strategies within a common theoretical landscape; to address “change bias,” as lower change-oriented strategies often positively affect outcomes yet remain understudied; and to provide more nuanced integrations of context. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Although this widespread interest is encouraging, a review of the literature reveals a lack of consensus in how researchers conceptualize and operationally define start-up teams. A lack of consensus on the core phenomenon—a foundational part of a strong paradigm—has stifled the systematic advancement of knowledge about start-up teams, which has downstream implications for the viability of this field of research. To advance the development of a stronger paradigm, we present a multidimensional conceptualization of start-up teams that is derived from points of consensus in existing definitions. Our multidimensional conceptualization accounts for the fact that although all are under the umbrella of the concept of “start-up team,” start-up teams vary in a set of key ingredients—ownership of equity, autonomy of strategic decision-making, and entitativity. This conceptualization serves as a framework for reviewing and beginning to integrate past research on start-up teams.

In turn, we find that scholars of such demographic inequity in organizations often focus solely on disadvantaging mechanisms, such as prejudice and stereotypes, belonging threats, and structural barriers. Nevertheless, our review of disparate literatures on attractiveness, nepotism, and social class (which use an advantage lens) demonstrates how specific and distinct advantaging mechanisms – including helping behaviors, permissiveness, and structural advantages – also create inequity. Such advantage mechanisms are largely missing in race and gender inequity literatures, despite the likelihood that such mechanisms contribute to, and ultimately allow the persistence of, race and gender inequity in organizations.

First, we offer an inductively developed process model of organizational body work that comprises five key themes: the triggers, forms, consequences, and contexts of organizational body work, and the variations of bodies targeted. Second, a key observation that emerged from our review was that organizational body work is animated by a set of organizational tensions, and so we explore three such tensions situated in the cultural, health, and political dynamics of organizational life. Third, we suggest eight directions for future research intended to illustrate and inspire rather than set boundaries around the study of organizational body work. © the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

The dominant view of this “attractiveness advantage” is one of taste-based discrimination, whereby attractive individuals are preferred without justification in economic productivity. We conduct a comprehensive review of research on attractiveness discrimination, finding relatively more evidence that this phenomenon constitutes, to some extent, statistical (as opposed to solely taste-based) discrimination, in which decision makers assume that attractive people are more competent and discriminate based on instrumental motives. We then review research that speaks to whether decision makers might be correct in assuming that attractive workers are more productive, finding that the attractive possess a slight advantage in human and a notable advantage in social capital. We finally review studies evaluating whether an advantage exists beyond that explained by capital dif-ferences. We find that the current body of work provides inconclusive evidence of taste-based but relatively more conclusive evidence of statistical discrimination processes. Our integrative view suggests how attractiveness biases can be detected more effectively, and points to key directions for future research on the sources of the attractiveness ad-vantage. We conclude by discussing the promise of an integrative approach to understanding other achievement gaps, such as those on the basis of gender, race, and social class. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

We found that listening research is fragmented across three perspectives: (a) perceived listening, (b) the listener’s experience, and (c) listening structures. We discuss how integrating these perspectives highlights two major tensions in listening research. First, there is a tension between the speaker’s perceptions and the listener’s experience that reveals a listening paradox—while listening is perceived to be beneficial for speakers, it can be experienced as costly and depleting for listeners. This paradox reveals why people struggle with listening when it is needed the most. Second, listening structures in organizations can create tensions between organizational goals and the listener’s experience. While organizations use listening structures to enable and signal listening, these efforts can impose greater costs on listeners, reinforce existing power structures, and create opportunities for unwanted surveillance. Managing these tensions provides fertile ground for future research, in part because recent advances in communication technologies are changing the dynamics and structure of listening in organizations. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Imitation is a pervasive firm behavior, and the literature relating to imitation is growing rapidly. In the resource-based view, for example, imitation is core because it is assumed to undermine interfirm performance heterogeneity and erode leaders’ competitive advantage. We argue that work on imitation is circumscribed by a core set of assumptions: imitation is easy, weak firms imitate, uncertainty promotes imitation, and there is only one imitation strategy. We review the origins and implications of these assumptions in the extant literature, and, more importantly, expose a set of emerging counterassumptions. In light of these counterassumptions, we propose foundations for a new conceptual model of imitation that focuses on evolutionary dynamics. We suggest that imitation may be a key source of dynamic capabilities and innovation, and that it in turn gives rise to competitive advantage. © Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Our systematic review, the first to consider all types of relevant studies, attempts to make sense of the complicated landscape.

In return, technology shapes work and people. As information communication technology (ICT) becomes ever more embedded in today’s increasingly digital organizations, the nature of our jobs and employees’ work experiences are strongly affected by ICT use. This cross-disciplinary review focuses on work design as a central explanatory vehicle for exploring how individual ICT usage influences employees’ effectiveness and well-being. We evaluated 83 empirical studies. Results show that ICT use affects employees through shaping three key work design aspects: job demands, job autonomy, and relational aspects. To reconcile previous mixed findings on the effects of ICT use on individual workers, we identify two categories of factors that moderate the effects of ICT use on work design: user-technology fit factors and social-technology fit factors. We consolidate the review findings into a comprehensive framework that delineates both the work design processes linking ICT use and employee outcomes and the moderating factors. The review fosters an intellectual conversation across different disciplines, including organizational behavior, management information systems, and computer-mediated communication.

This paper reviews the empirical research based in this argument to identify what we know about the effects of diversity on team cognitive processes and identify directions for future research. We first differentiate the effects of diversity that operate through differences in cognitive resources from those that operate through differences in cognitive structures, both of which may derive from diversity in the same attributes.

Defining cognition in terms of both knowledge and cognitive processes or fluid abilities, we show that five types of work characteristics (job complexity, job autonomy, relational work design, job feedback, and psychosocial demands) affect employees’ cognition via multiple pathways. In the short-to-medium term, we identify three cognitively enriching pathways (opportunity for use of cognition, accelerated knowledge acquisition, motivated exploratory learning) and two cognitively harmful pathways (strain-impaired cognition, depleted cognitive capacity).

New technologies, shifting employee-employer relations, and burgeoning expectations of the contemporary workforce blur boundaries between home and work, connect people and things that historically could not be linked, and extend workspaces to nearly everywhere, not just office buildings. Research on these transformations calls for incorporating movement into the physicality of work. Thus, organizational scholars have turned to process studies as ways to examine the dynamic features that create and alter spatial arrangements. However, the rapidly growing work in this area lacks integration and theoretical development. To address these concerns, we review and classify the organizational literature that casts space as a process, that is, dynamically as movements, performances, flows, and changing routines. This review yields five orientations of organizational space scholarship that we label as developing, transitioning, imbricating, becoming, and constituting. We discuss these orientations, examine how they relate to key constructs of organizational space, and show how this work offers opportunities to theorizing about organizations. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Insider social change agents are uniquely poised to propel this work. Operating from within their workplaces, they can advance changes that are linked to external social concerns but have purposes distinct from the organization’s core strategies and operations. They under-take mobilization activities, making local moves that aim toward more broadly impactful changes. These efforts form the micro-foundations of organizational approaches to positive social change. We review and integrate five streams in which such insider social change agents have increasingly appeared: employee activism, issue selling, tempered radicalism, micro-corporate social responsibility, and social intrapreneurship. Our framework maps the features of change efforts, with elements of persons, issues, places, activities, and out-comes. With a shared framework, researchers can better characterize the multiplicity of insider change efforts and ascertain how they compare, collaborate, or compete. Research will benefit from taking a more integrative view, especially toward the aim of understanding how local efforts aggregate to broader social impacts. To understand how change is inhibited or supported, future research can theorize blockers of societal change alongside insider social change agents and look to the ecosystem level for reciprocal and amplifying processes. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

This limitation rests on specifying behaviors as inherently positive or negative and leads to mixing the description of the content of leadership behaviors with the evaluation of their underlying intentions, quality of execution, or behavioral effects. We outline how this conflation leads to amalgamation, construct redundancy, and most problematically, causal indeterminacy, which calls into question the entire evidence base of leadership style research. These weaknesses are not limited to the ten leadership styles but are inherent in the valenced research logic that has been dominant for seventy years. Thus, the common finding that positive leadership styles lead to positive outcomes and negative styles lead to negative outcomes might be an artifact of conflation rather than a reflection of reality. To address these concerns, we suggest distinguishing between intended and displayed leadership styles, as well as their realized effects. We also call for utilizing a configurational approach. These recommended actions would provide a strong foundation for future research on leadership styles. © Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Yet most management research and literature reviews have typically emphasized objective time to the exclusion of subjective time. Our review focuses on this lesser studied “other” time, beginning with a review of how seminal articles on time have historically conceptualized subjective time. From this initial re-view, we offer an integrative and multilevel definition of subjective time as the experience of the past, present, and future, which occurs as individuals and collectives mentally travel through, perceive, and interpret time. Then, using this new definition to frame the remainder of the review, we examine the literature employing subjective time concepts to address three key questions: what is subjective time, how does it operate, and why does it matter? Our analysis provides new ways to understand subjective time and the important role it plays in organizational phenomena. We conclude by chal-lenging management scholars to consider three priorities for future research: the fun-damental relationship between subjective time and meaning, the unclear nature of event time, and the ways in which objective time is dependent upon subjective time. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

With an integrative review of the past two decades of management research on expertise, we map out this fragmented field and outline three perspectives on the concept. A “realist perspective” sees expertise as a substantive ability of individuals, a “constructivist perspective” sees expertise as socially constructed quality of collective actors, and a “situationist perspective” sees expertise as a situated enactment involving human and nonhuman actors. These perspectives make different assumptions about the nature of expertise and therefore reach different conclusions about its benefits and problems. By teasing out similarities and differences across the perspectives, we work toward greater construct clarity and develop six integrative opportunities for future research. We conclude with suggestions about how each of the three perspectives can help us better understand the crisis of expertise. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

I develop a theoretical framework that systematizes the literature and accounts for the seemingly disparate findings, highlighting the underlying functionality of such responses for individuals. I then integrate the literature on individual responses to economic cycles with organizational research to examine the meaning of different individual responses from the perspective of organizational functioning. This integration generates a novel insight that individually functional responses to economic cycles can be dysfunctional from the perspective of organizations, often hindering rather than helping organizations’ performance and undermining the well-being of other organizational members. The systematization of the literature also reveals that many responses which would be predicted by the identified theoretical processes and which would be also relevant to organizations have not been studied, laying an agenda for future organizational research. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Thus, the goal of our integrative review is to advance cumulative knowledge of why leaders are fair, ethical, and nonabusive—which we refer to collectively as principled leader behaviors. Our review is structured around a framework of four theoretical lenses that elucidate what initiates and perpetuates such behaviors: interpersonal motives, focused on relational explanations; instrumental motives, centered on these behaviors as a means to some end goal; moral motives, which characterize these leader behaviors as an end in themselves; and self-regulation and disposition, focused on leaders’ automatic inclinations and capacity to enact these behaviors. We not only synthesize previously fragmented findings of what shapes principled leader behaviors, but also highlight areas of overlap and distinction across them.

Indeed, many consider survival the quintessential indicator of firm performance.

We therefore add order to the diverse survival literatures and clarify how scholars’ conceptualizations of survival differ. Notably, the conceptualization of survival of different streams reflects a multifaceted construct including three dimensions: operations, ownership, and solvency. Identifying these dimensions provides a lens that adds clarity when reviewing the literature as well as important richness to better situate future work on survival and failure. In addition, we highlight outdated assumptions prevalent in this research, which have further limited the theoretical development of survival and failure.

Moving beyond incumbent-entrant dynamics, organizations and innovation research has begun to explore incumbent heterogeneity in response to technological change—why some incumbents do well and adapt, whereas others struggle. As a phenomenon-driven research area, scholars with different theoretical perspectives have brought their own lenses to bear, but these perspectives have evolved independently. The result is a research stream with a scattered collection of detailed, within-industry perspectives on the phenomenon without a clear ability to link different mechanisms or articulate boundary conditions.

In this article, we provide a unique and comprehensive examination of the DCV literature that goes beyond past reviews by combining text-based analysis with surveys of, and interviews with, researchers in the field. With this approach, we are able to examine the evolution of the DCV in written literature and identify missing research themes.

Nevertheless, its present level of scholarship is both narrow in focus and inconclusive in implications for key organizational domains: namely, individual-level performance (why does evidence suggest no effect of worker age on overall performance?), interpersonal-level discrimination (why do older workers face heightened discrimination if their performance is generally valued?), and group-level diversity (why has research failed to identify consistent age diversity benefits?). The present review argues that answering these questions necessitates expanding the older worker space by incorporating research approaches of other, well-established literature studies—each of which offer equally valid ways of understanding (older) worker age, but do not typically cast themselves as covering age per se. Although these other literatures—comprising Generation, Age, Tenure, and Experience (GATE)—potentially foster a more sophisticated conception of older workers than present approaches typically offer, these literatures have remained largely separate, resulting in their own level of inconclusive and sometimes contradictory predictions for an aging workforce. To address each of these issues going forward, researchers must integrate GATE elements in all older worker investigations. A GATE approach avoids overreliance on chronological age as a predictor, more accurately represents the inherent complexity of age as a status category, and potentially offers more definitive conclusions than present approaches do. Such is timely, and crucial, for a topic that is somehow both ubiquitous in the workforce and yet not well understood by mainstream organizational scholarship. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

For example, “insider” activists who are employees of the target organization have certain advantages and disadvantages when compared with “outsider” activists who are members of independent social movement organizations. We also distinguish between the direct and indirect (or spillover) effects of social activism.

We review the recent developments in diversity research and identify two shortcomings. First, an understanding of the microdynamics affecting processes and outcomes in diverse teams is lacking. Second, diversity research has tended to treat different social categories as equivalent and thus not considered how members’ experiences may be affected by their social category membership. We address these shortcomings by reviewing research on stereotypes, which indicates that stereotypes initiate reinforcing microdynamics among (a) attributions of a target team member’s warmth and competence, (b) perceiving members’ behavior toward the target team member, and (c) the target team member’s behavior. Our review suggests that perceivers’ impression formation motivation is the key determinant of the extent to which perceivers continue to treat a target based on categorization.

Progress on understanding these dynamics has been constrained by fragmentation within relevant management research. In this paper, we clarify and describe two narratives that have emerged within past and current research on growth and the internal organization. The first narrative draws attention to the surprising endurance of organizational features during growth; the second, their dramatic change. We juxtapose the two narratives to reveal ongoing gaps in the study of how growth can effect change along three dimensions: organizational design, team composition, and organizational culture. We conclude with recommendations on how future research can be enriched through a systematic examination of how entrepreneurial ventures navigate the organizational dilemmas growth presents. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Thus the extant literature suggests that diversity within teams is a double-edged sword that leads to both positive and negative effects simultaneously. This literature has not, however, fully embraced the increasing calls in the broader groups literature to take account of time in understanding how groups function [e.g. Cronin, M. A., Weingart, L. R., & Todorova, G. (2011). Dynamics in groups: Are we there yet? The Academy of Management Annals, 5, 571–612]. We review the literature on diverse teams employing this lens to develop a dynamic perspective that takes account of the timing and flow of diversity's effects. Our review suggests that diversity in groups has different short-term and long-term effects in ways that are not fully captured by the currently dominant double-edged sword metaphor. We identify an emerging perspective that suggests a tropical depression metaphor—that has the potential, over time, to develop either into a dangerous hurricane or diffuse into a rainstorm that gives way to sunshine, as more apt to capture the dynamic effects of diversity in teams. We conclude by outlining an agenda for redirecting future research on diverse teams using this more dynamic perspective. © 2016 Academy of Management.","",""

We discuss how a social network perspective informs managing employee competencies (recruitment, selection, training, and development), managing employee behaviors and attitudes (performance management, compensation, turnover, and retention), and managing employees for competitive advantage (strategic human resource management and strategic human capital). Our goals are twofold: provide a summary of existing research relevant to human resource management that employs a social network perspective and stimulate future work in social resource management.

We use Edwards’ (1979) perspective of “contested terrain,” wherein managers implement production technologies to maximize the value of labor and workers resist, to synthesize the interdisciplinary research on algorithms at work. We find that algorithmic control in the workplace operates through six main mechanisms, which we call the “6 Rs”—employers can use algorithms to direct workers by restricting and recommending, evaluate workers by recording and rating, and discipline workers by replacing and rewarding. We also discuss several key insights regarding algorithmic control. First, labor process theory helps to highlight potential problems with the largely positive view of algorithms at work. Second, the technical capabilities of algorithmic systems facilitate a form of rational control that is distinct from the technical and bureaucratic control used by employers for the past century. Third, employers’ use of algorithms is sparking the development of new algorithmic occupations. Finally, workers are individually and collectively resisting algorithmic control through a set of emerging tactics we call algoactivism. These insights sketch the contested terrain of algorithmic control and map critical areas for future research. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Despite the significant advances made in this field, the literature still largely relies on assumptions that overlook core features of interorganizational relationships. We build on the organizational research on pluralism to evaluate and identify opportunities to extend the literature on interorganizational relationships. Drawing on a synthesis of the last 20 years of research (1996–2016) on interorganizational relationships, we discuss four major “blind spots” concerning (1) the assumption of symmetry between parties or the focal party’s perception is taken to reflect the whole relationship (single-party focus), (2) the assumption of uniform relationships between parties (single-valence focus), (3) the assumption of an interorganizational phenomenon within one level of analysis (single-level focus), and (4) the assumption of universal time (focus on a single conceptualization of time). Through an analysis of exemplary studies, we discuss how and when overcoming each of these blind spots provides novel insights to revisit theoretical mechanisms concerning the functioning of interorganizational relationships. We also identify a coherent set of strategies to address each blind spot. We advance the literature by articulating a pluralistic perspective to guide future research into core questions about interorganizational relationships. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

We identify and explore the implications of three conceptually distinct but interrelated forms of boundary work emerging from the literature. Competitive boundary work involves mobilizing boundaries to establish some kind of advantage over others. In contrast, collaborative boundary work is concerned with aligning boundaries to enable collaboration. Finally, configurational boundary work involves manipulating patterns of differentiation and integration among groups to ensure that certain activities are brought together, whereas others are kept apart, orienting the domains of competition and collaboration. We argue that the notion of boundary work can contribute to the development of a uniquely processual view of organizational design as open-ended, and continually becoming, an orientation with significant future potential for understanding novel forms of organizing, and for integrating agency, power dynamics, materiality, and temporality into the study of organizing. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

We assess the important contributions of this literature, but we also argue that what scholars identify as discourse, rhetoric, and frames are the residues or echoes of prior social interactions. When scholars miss the opportunity to examine interactions as a key mechanism and source of these meanings, a fundamental dynamic of fields becomes obscured and the accounts become, ironically, static. A focus on interactions enables researchers to observe how institutional fields are understood and tethered to local activity, as actors layer their multiple meanings in ways that may result in unexpected outcomes. As a way to incorporate discourse, rhetoric, and frames into a dynamic approach that features social interaction as an important source of meaning, we examine possibilities evident in the growing line of research on “inhabited institutions,” and we chart productive avenues for future research on the dynamics of fields. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Despite the growth in virtual work research, it has tended to occur in siloes focused on different types of virtual work (e.g., virtual teams and telecommuting) that are grounded in different research traditions. This limits opportunities to leverage research across these different domains. We use a co-citation analysis to examine the degree of segmentation in the field of virtual work into disparate research clusters. We find the emergence of three major research clusters: telecommuting, virtual teams, and computer-mediated work (CMW). Motivated by this finding, we carry out a comparative review of the literature in each cluster with the objective of seeking ways to exploit opportunities that cut across them. Based on our review, we first develop a conceptual model using the dispersion and technology dependence dimensions of virtuality to compare different approaches to studying virtuality-related issues across clusters. Next, we use our comparative review to propose a systematic approach for developing research questions that bridge research across the clusters by considering how different approaches to studying virtuality and the ensuing problem domains addressed in one cluster might help to advance research in another. To illustrate this approach, we discuss 12 research questions for bridging across the three virtual work clusters. Finally, we discuss the research implications of our conceptual model and bridging approach.

Yet, although the research literatures on people’s sense of their own status and respect both explore the same fundamental concerns, they differ in their conceptual origins, theorized assumptions, motivational underpinnings, judgment processes, and the group dynamics that they ascribe to social worth. Overall, the status and respect literatures provide differing images of the dynamics of in-dividuals’ social worth at work. However, these literatures have been largely disconnected from one another, and there have been relatively few systematic efforts to analyze their differences and similarities. We address this gap by reviewing and comparing the status and respect literatures.

Matching, defined as the process by which individuals are dynamically aligned with organizations and the situations (roles, jobs, tasks, etc.) within them, has historically been examined in silos across a broad range of literatures. Consequently,we know little about how seemingly diverse HR activities, such as recruitment, job design, training, promotions, and terminations, might informeach other through the common lens of matching. Emanating from our review, we integrate relevant literatures to develop a comprehensive matching model (termed the “dynamic matching lifecycle model”). Our model extends prior, more static conceptualizations of matching (like attraction, selection, attrition, or ASA) to include four stages: creation, development, reconfiguration, and termination-based on two broad mechanisms-selection and adaptation. Furthermore,we describe how matching contributes to individual and organizational value creation. By evoking human capital theories, we explain how people and organizations engage in matching across the four stages of the model to create human capital-based value.

Furthermore, we review a range of methodological approaches that researchers have employed when conducting construct mixology over the last 30 years. These strategies range from disavowing the role of the constituent constructs to explicitly acknowledging and modeling the relationships between constituent constructs and their corresponding (superordinate) compound constructs. The scientific consequences of these approaches include both unrecognized redundancy (reinventing the wheel, or confirming classic findings without realizing it) and heightened explanatory power (resulting from using broad compound constructs). To illustrate the variation of methods and implications, we review several exemplars of compound constructs that have enjoyed popularity in OB/HR, including work engagement, emotional intelligence, organizational commitment, and core self-evaluations. We also highlight seven cardinal construct domains that are often sampled during construct mixology. Prescriptions for future construct mixology efforts are provided. © 2016 Academy of Management.","",""

This review of the literature identifies three mechanisms—opportunity, motivation, and ability—through which individuals, groups, and organizations learn from failure, and it bridges the gaps between different levels of analysis. Opportunity to learn from failure mostly takes the shape of more information about errors and failures that are generated by one’s own and others’ prior failures or near-failures. Motivation to learn from failure is hindered by punitive leaders and organizations. Finally, the ability to learn from failure partly relies on inherent attitudes and characteristics, but can be further developed through thoughtful analysis and transfers of successful routines. Our review leads us to distinguish between erroneous versus correct processes and adverse versus successful outcomes to better understand the full gamut of events that are faced by organizations. We identify the existence of noisy learning environment, where spurious successes (when erroneous processes still lead to successful outcomes) and spurious failures (when correct processes are combined with adverse outcomes) lower the opportunity to learn. Considering noisy learning situations is helpful when understanding the differences between slow- and fast-learning environments. We conclude our review by identifying a number of unexplored areas we hope scholars will address to better our understanding of failure learning. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

However, few constructs have received as much scholarly attention as knowledge integration while remaining so equivocally defined and measured, leading to a confusing array of conceptualizations, undermining its theoretical, empirical, and practical usefulness. As a theoretical construct, knowledge integration also cuts across the macro-and microlevels, gaining attention from scholars interested in explaining the microfoundations of strategy and capabilities (e.g., Felin & Hesterly, 2007; Lewin, Massini, & Peeters, 2011). However, the interplay among these micro and macro factors is often overlooked, and its implications for theory building are ignored. To address these issues, we examine and integrate micro-and macro-organizational perspectives on knowledge integration. We provide a review of its definitions and offer our definition based on key dimensions identified. We discuss and analyze the micro and macro perspectives, presenting key assertions, propositions, limitations, and conclusions from representative studies.

However, the two fields of study have converged to become deeply entangled and blurred so that researchers from both research traditions now speak to the same business risks and opportunities. A field’s development is shaped by the clarity of its constructs and underlying assumptions; however, such clarity has eroded in responsibility and sustainability research. By tracing the development of these fields, we show that responsibility and sustainability were historically distinctive. Responsibility research took a normative position, railing against the amorality of business; sustainability research took a systems perspective, sounding the alarm of business-driven failures in natural systems. The convergence in responsibility and sustainability has not only confused constructs but has also vacated vast tracts of unexplored territory that can inform the relationship between business and society. By sharpening the distinctiveness between responsibility and sustainability, we call for further research to deepen the areas of research unique to each of these two fields of study and explore their complementarities and intersections. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

We demonstrate how, over time, a dominant norm for conceptualizing and measuring justice has emerged. We posit that although consistent conceptualization and measurement across justice studies can enable the accumulation of knowledge, if the dominant approach is incomplete, this can impede the accumulation of knowledge and risk construct reification. We suggest that these risks are high given that (a) contemporary approaches to measuring fairness perceptions fail to capture the full domain of organizational justice as it was initially conceptualized by early scholars; (b) despite a foundation of “classic” theories, our field has yet to systematically map the justice domain; and (c) the normative operationalizations of organizational justice are based on observations that predate the 21st century workplace. We offer suggestions for future research and new approaches to assessing workplace fairness. Our paper’s goal, ultimately, is to reconsider how justice is conceptualized and measured so that the findings obtained from future empirical justice studies can go beyond the constraints of the current paradigm. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

As a result, there is growing evidence to suggest that there is a dark side to work–life balance (WLB) policies, but these findings remain scattered and unorganized. We provide a synthesis of this literature, defining work–family backlash as a phenomenon characterized by negative attitudes, negative emotions, and negative behaviors—either individual or collective—associated with WLB policies [i.e., on-site provisions, leave policies, and flexible work arrangements (FWAs)] within organizations. We conceptualize and define four primary mechanisms involving multiple levels of analysis through which the phenomenon operates. More micro levels of analysis within organizations are characterized by (1) an inequity mechanism, (2) a stigma mechanism, and (3) a spillover mechanism. Although less developed in the literature to date, more macro levels of analysis—including the organization and societal levels—are characterized by (4) a strategic mechanism. We explain these four primary mechanisms—including the theories and literatures on which they are grounded—and develop an original conceptual model to catalyze future research. © 2018, Academy of Management.

Since then, an impressive volume of studies on the context of escalation has accumulated, and we present a fresh take on the literature by reviewing and analyzing this work. Using a multilevel framework, we elucidate how escalation is influenced by factors at the group and organizational levels, as well as by factors external to the organization.

Three interpretations of the meaning and function of “business models” have emerged from the management literature: (1) business models as attributes of real firms, (2) business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas, and (3) business models as formal conceptual representations of how a business functions. Relatedly, a provocative debate about the relationship between business models and strategy has fascinated many scholars. We offer a critical review of this now vast business model literature with the goal of organizing the literature and achieving greater understanding of the larger picture in this increasingly important research area. In addition to complementing and extending prior reviews, we also aim at a second and more important contribution: We aim at identifying the reasons behind the apparent lack of agreement in the interpretation of business models, and the relationship between business models and strategy. Whether strategy scholars consider business model research a new field may be due to the fact that the business model perspective may be challenging the assumptions of traditional theories of value creation and capture by focusing on value creation on the demand side and supply side, rather than focusing on value creation on the supply side only as these theories have done.

This variety is beneficial in that numerous theories and methodologies have been brought to bear on the topic, but over time has led to increasingly fragmented literatures that often differ widely in their causal accounts of executive behavior. Confronted by such fragmentation, scholars in this domain tend to examine research questions through the lens of a single motivational perspective when developing and testing models. We believe that a more holistic perspective on the drivers of executive behavior can help scholars build richer models that bridge disciplinary silos by reframing existing theories in a new light. We specifically aim to bring clarity to this domain by developing a parsimonious framework for understanding executive motives in terms of the nature of the rewards (pecuniary versus nonpecuniary) that motivate executive action and the motivational frame of reference (individualized versus socialized agency) for conceptualizing rewards. Using this bidimensional framework to synthesize research from the last decade, we outline a platform for research that conceptualizes executive motives as the lynchpin for understanding, integrating, and advancing theoretical perspectives on executive behavior. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Three interrelated streams have emerged from this work, which focus on prosocial motives (the desire to benefit others or expend effort out of concern for others), prosocial behaviors (acts that promote/protect the welfare of individuals, groups, or organizations), and prosocial impact (the experience of making a positive difference in the lives of others through one's work). Prior studies have highlighted the importance of prosocial motives, behaviors, and impact, and have enhanced our understanding of each of them. However, there has been little effort to systematically review and integrate these related lines of work in a way that furthers our understanding of prosociality in organizations.

Often examined at the individual level with fragmented conceptualizations, it can be a trait, capacity, or a process. We conduct a review of (1) management studies and (2) content from O*NET for 11 occupations and disciplinary studies taking a grounded approach to synthesize themes to develop an integrated occupational resilience framework. Our review suggests that resilience is individually and occupationally determined as part of a multi-level system. Our review shows that specific occupational tasks and contextual demands imply different connotations of what exactly “resilience” means and how contexts may constrain or foster resiliency. Occupational resilience involves (1) multiple conceptual strands related to accessing resources (trait, capacity, and processes); (2) positive and negative triggers that are occupationally distinguished; (3) different resilience types (cognitive, emotional, and physical) that vary in need, breadth, and importance across occupations; (4) a dynamic phenomenon that occurs within and across career stages; (5) both content-general, and job-specific occupational tensions; and (6) work and nonwork domains.

As part of our analytical process, we surface theories underlying existing control frameworks used in empirical research and identify key dimensions implied by the frameworks. The three dimensions of control—control formality, control coerciveness, and control singularity—map onto traditional versus more current issues in and around organizations, and therefore prove helpful in assessing the existing research stream. Based on our review, we show how control–outcome research has in fact reached a troublesome point in its evolution, particularly concerning quantitative research.

To better understand how work relationships recover from relationship fractures, we provide an integrative review under the umbrella of relational resilience. We establish a unified definition of relational resilience, and then use two broad attributes—resilience processes and resilience foundations—as an organizing framework for our discussion of relational resilience. Resilience processes describe how fractures are triggered, interpreted, and repaired. We review common triggers of relationship fracture and describe two distinct pathways—gradual drifts and abrupt shocks—to fracture, highlight the important role that positive attributional and prosocial sensemaking processes play in facilitating postfracture repair, and discuss the process by which fractured relationships are restored or strengthened. Resilience foundations describe the preconditions for successfully engaging in prosocial sensemaking and relational repair. Our review identified the relational foundations critical to positive sensemaking and positive relational attributions, and the reparative foundations critical to relational repair. Finally, we organize insights and future directions around six themes: balancing and realigning emotions, synchronizing attributions and cognitions, contingencies of effective repair, fracture pathways and repair, trajectories of repair, and reciprocal relationships. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Successful collective actions can be elusive, however, given that organizational actors can see some collective actions as social dilemmas, where actors have incentive to not contribute; but if all adopt this strategy, the collective action fails. Unfortunately, much of the research on traditional social dilemmas is limited because of the lack of contextual factors likely to be critical in organizational settings. We articulate a portfolio approach to the study of social dilemmas in organizations, arguing that to understand dilemma behavior is to understand each actor’s portfolio of collective actions, goals to purse, resources to allocate, and partners with whom to collaborate. We provide social dilemma illustrations at the individual, team, unit, and firm levels, and discuss how such phenomena could be studied within the portfolio approach. The intent is that the organizational researcher, in addition to the social dilemma researcher, will see social dilemmas as a way to understand how and why actors allocate scarce personal and organizational resources to collective actions when incentives suggest otherwise, and as a consequence, why some organizational collective actions succeed whereas others fail. © 2018, Academy of Management.

This review outlines three fundamental but distinct perspectives found in the literature: authenticity as (1) consistency between an entity’s internal values and its external expressions, (2) conformity of an entity to the norms of its social category, and (3) connection between an entity and a person, place, or time as claimed. The aim of this review was to critically appraise the various research themes within each perspective, highlighting similarities, differences, and relationships between them.

Indeed, the field has largely failed to keep pace with the rising salience of occupational and professional (as opposed to organizational) dynamics in work life. Moreover, not only is there a dearth of studies that explicitly take occupational or professional categories into account, but there is also an absence of a shared analytical framework for understanding what occupations and professions entail. Our goal is therefore two-fold: first, to offer guidance to scholars less familiar with this terrain who encounter occupational or professional dynamics in their own inquiries and, second, to introduce a three-part framework for conceptualizing occupations and professions to help guide future inquiries. We suggest that occupations and professions can be understood through lenses of “becoming”, “doing”, and “relating”. We develop this framework as we review past literature and discuss the implications of each approach for future research and, more broadly, for the field of management and organizational theory. © 2016 Academy of Management.","",""

Attesting to this importance, much research has focused on why individuals lose self-control and the consequences of self-control failure for individuals and organizations. Unfortunately, this research has overly focused on one component of self-control—resource depletion perspectives (and ego depletion perspectives in particular)—while neglecting other components that play equally important roles in the self-control process. As such, we argue that the organizational literature has failed to appreciate the broader picture of what components are involved in the self-control process, and the extent to which these components are intertwined with organizational phenomenon. In this review, we address these issues by using an integrative self-control theory framework to review the management self-control literature, outlining seven components of self-control within three broad phases of the self-control process (activation, exertion, and enactment). This framework integrates the relevant literature into a larger self-control process model, and highlights concerns with existing depletion perspectives as well as the lack of attention paid to other components in the self-control process.

In particular, we aim to grasp the different understandings of tacit knowledge, trace them to the onto-epistemological assumptions researchers make concerning the nature of knowledge and action, and suggest a framework that enables researchers to get a coherent understanding of the diverse literature. We identify three perspectives on tacit knowledge: the conversion, interactional, and practice perspectives.

These unique characteristics of regulatory focus make it especially appropriate for understanding the psychological mechanisms that underlie leadership–followership processes involving dynamic relationships and mutual influences across time and context. To date, the relationships between leadership and regulatory focus and the roles of time and context have not been assessed systematically. We review the literature on regulatory focus and leadership, while integrating the multiple targets and levels of regulatory focus (leaders, followers, dyads, and teams). We further offer a comprehensive conceptual framework that focuses on the significance of time and context across these levels, to advance our knowledge and to suggest a roadmap for future research on leader–follower motivational processes and their influence on multiple-level outcomes. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Prevailing models underscore social structure and focus on the consequences that come frombrokerage-occupying a bridging position between disconnected others in a network. By contrast, emerging models underscore social interactions and focus on brokering-the behavioral processes through which organizational actors shape others’ relationships. Our review led us to develop a novel framework as a means to integrate and organize a wide range of theoretical insights and empirical findings on brokerage and brokering. The Changing Others’ Relationships (COR) framework captures the following ideas that emerged from our review: (a) Different triadic configurations enable different forms of brokering, which in turn produce distinct effects on others’ relationships, (b) brokering is amultifaceted social influence process that can take the form of intermediation (connecting disconnected others) or modification (changing others’ preexisting relationships), (c) comparing social relations prebrokering versus postbrokering reveals a broker’s impact, (d) brokering can influence others’ relationships positively or negatively, and (e) information and incentives are two principal means through which individuals change others’ relationships. Overall, the current review integrates multiple streams of research relevant to brokerage and brokering-including those on structural holes, organizational innovation, boundary spanning, social and political skill, workplace gossip, third-party conflict managers, and labor relations-and links each of the emergent themes identified in the current review to promising directions for future research on brokerage and brokering. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

An important criticism of social exchange theory; however, is that it lacks sufficient theoretical precision, and thus has limited utility. Scholars who apply social exchange theory are able to explain many social phenomena in post hoc manner but are severely limited in their ability to make useful a priori predictions regarding workplace behavior. In this review, we discuss social exchange theory as it exists today and identify four critical issues within the social exchange paradigm that warrant additional consideration. The four concerns, around which we center this review, include the following: (1) overlapping constructs that need to be more clearly distinguished; (2) insufficient appreciation to the positive or negative hedonic value of these various constructs; (3) an assumption of bipolarity, which treats negative constructs (e.g., abuse) as the absence of positive constructs (e.g., support); and, following from the prior three issues, (4) theoretically imprecise behavioral predictions. Given that these problems are inherent in the current unidimensional framework for social exchange theory, we suggest an additional dimension–activity. We explain how conceptualizing social exchange within a two-dimensional space, while giving equal consideration to both hedonic value and activity, creates new opportunities for future research. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

We conclude that the influence of leader affective displays can be understood through the mediation paths of emotional contagion and cognitive interpretation of affect in combination with the first- and second-stage moderators of these paths. We also conclude that the common yet overly simplistic notion that leader displays of positive affect are more effective than leader displays of negative affect can in important part be attributed to an overreliance on subjective ratings as indicators of leadership effectiveness, whereas behavioral indicators of leadership effectiveness suggest a more contingent view of the effectiveness of positive and negative affective displays. We propose that to bolster and further develop these conclusions, we need (a) more research focusing on moderation in dual-path mediation; (b) development of theory about cognitive interpretations following leader affective displays; and (c) more sophisticated models of the difference amongst different affective states to better capture the complexity of their effects. We also outline how evidence regarding the role of follower affect in response to leadership more generally points to the potential for integration of affective and non-affective models of leadership. © 2016 Academy of Management.","",""

Descriptive research conducted by scholars from anthropology, law, and international relations converge on the features required for a general theory. This includes a multiphase process comprising planning, bargaining, and implementation, as well as multiparty process between actors organized within a multilevel structure. We examine to what extent negotiation scholars in management have incorporated such complexities into their empirical work. In a survey of empirical studies, we observe concentrated efforts to model and measure dyadic interactions in just one phase—bargaining—and the near exclusive use of experimental methods. By contrast, we survey prescriptive theory generated by specialized experts from various negotiation contexts and find that they place greater focus on the preparation and implementation phases. From this review, we recommend that scholars (a) theorize and measure negotiation as a multiphase process with possibilities for recursion, (b) incorporate a multiparty and multilevel structure in which actors beyond negotiating parties can influence the process, and (c) consider agreements as action commitments separate from actually realizing outcomes. In doing so, we discuss the value of integrating analogous work to furnish negotiation theory.

There is a mass of research on performance but it is embodied in a variety of disconnected literatures each using their own set of constructs and theoretical lenses.

First, using a bibliometric technique to analyze 9,299 articles, we identify the cumulative intellectual structure of the field and show how the field has evolved over the past 40 years. Second, drawing on the Griffin, Neal, and Parker (2007) model, we classify 97 performance constructs according to their form (proficiency, adaptivity, proactivity) and level of contribution (individual, team, organization). We conclude this model is useful for understanding the similarities and differences among many distinct performance constructs. Third, using the Griffin et al.

Our synthesis identified theoretically relevant and differentiating antecedents of form; whereas the nomological network is underdeveloped in relation to the level of contribution. Finally, we propose 18 recommendations which include ensuring conceptual clarity for performance constructs, expanding theoretical models to account for more performance dimensions, greater attention to the underlying mechanisms through which individual performance contributes to higher-level outcomes, increased consideration of how performance changes over time and across contexts, and more investigations into how multiple performance constructs interact with each other to shape effectiveness. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

The concept of problemistic search has diffused broadly in the management literature—it is a central theoretical concept in a broad variety of organizational theories and an important explanation of a wide variety of organizational behaviors and outcomes. We review the literature and argue that the development of the theory has not kept pace with the breadth of the unfolding literature. We identify six critical issues with extant research that can be traced back to a continued (over)reliance on the initial conceptualization of problemistic search.

A plethora of empirical studies as well as further theoretical elaborations have shed substantial light on a variety of specific, measurable factors connected to dynamic capabilities. Our article starts out by analyzing these studies to develop a meta-framework that specifies antecedents, dimensions, mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes of dynamic capabilities identified in the literature to date.

"A Systems Perspective on Forgiveness in Organizations","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951266768&doi=10.1080%2f19416520.2016.1120956&partnerID=40&md5=a1347a9af418a25e46da5647314192ed","Abstract: Despite the widespread interest in forgiveness across a diversity of disciplines, the study of forgiveness has been strongly influenced by a psychological (i.e. individual-level) approach. Although this has provided many fruitful insights, it has also resulted in a fragmented literature that has underemphasized the multilevel and contextual nature of this phenomenon. Drawing upon a broad multidisciplinary approach, we provide a singular definition of forgiveness and integrate research on forgiveness into a multilevel systems approach. In doing so, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding can be realized by conceptualizing forgiveness as a part of a system of interconnecting psychological, social, structural, and cultural relations. By embedding forgiveness into context, our systems perspective provides novel insights into the factors that facilitate and constrain forgiveness at multiple levels of analysis, how the interplay between contextual levels can shape forgiveness at lower levels (e.g. individual level), and how examining forgiveness in organizational contexts can highlight the importance of examining other outcomes (e.g. reconciliation, peaceful co-existence, and détente) as well as facilitate the development of actionable theory. © 2015 Academy of Management.","",""

Our article makes four main contributions. First, through a review of the literature, we establish the inherent complexities in the D–P relationship and the methodological challenges confronted by the literature in reaching its current conclusion of a nonlinear relationship between diversification and performance. Second, we argue that to better guide managers the literature needs to develop along a complementary path—although past research has often focused on answering the big question of does diversification affect firm performance, this second path would focus more on identifying the precise micromechanisms through which diversification adds or subtracts value. Third, we outline a new approach to the investigation of this topic, based on identifying (a) the precise underlying mechanisms through which diversification affects performance, (b) the performance outcomes that are “proximate” to the mechanism that the researcher is studying, and (c) an appropriate research design that can enable a causal claim.

Our review revealed two types of fields: exchange and issue fields, with three subtypes of each. We describe their characteristics, and subsequently, review field conditions in the extant literature and develop a typology based on two dimensions: the extent of elaboration of institutional infrastructure and the extent to which there is an agreed-upon prioritization of logics. We discuss the implications of field types and conditions for isomorphism, agency, and field change, based on a review of the literature that revealed six pathways of field change and the factors affecting them. We outline a research agenda based on our review highlighting the need for consolidation of field studies and identify several outstanding issues that are in need of further research. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Research has underexamined how work–life flexibility is stratified across occupations. We review how occupational status and flexibility experiences vary and shape work–life inequality, which we identify as a form of job inequality. We investigate the range of definitions, measurement approaches, and theorizing regarding work–life flexibility. We find that employees across occupational groups experience different work–life flexibility outcomes from different flexibility types. Providing employee control over scheduling variation (flextime) may benefit lower level workers the most, yet many are unable to access this flexibility form. Part-time work permitting control over work volume/workload hurts lower level employees the most (because of involuntary income and benefits loss). Yet, these same part-time practices enhance recruitment and retention for upper level jobs but harm promotion and pay. Work continuity control (leaves) benefits upper- and middle-level employees but is largely unavailable to lower level workers. Flexibility to control work location is rarely available for lower level jobs; but benefits middle- and upper level employees, provided that individuals are able to control separation from work when desired and self-regulate complexity.

We review the results of research on diversity and firm performance based on the level of analysis at which diversity was examined, highlighting what we know and do not know about this relationship, and why a new approach to research in this area is needed. To set a future research agenda, we introduce a dynamic capabilities framework for studying diversity and firm performance, identifying a subset of capabilities through which we would expect firms to extract benefit (or loss) from diversity and articulate the underlying mechanisms through which such effects are likely to occur.

Yet this field stands at a critical juncture. Over the past 25 years, management scholars have drawn foundational insights from philosophy and psychology to apply a paradox lens to organizational phenomena. Yet extant studies selectively leverage ancient wisdom, adopting some key insights while abandoning others. Using a structured content analysis to review the burgeoning management literature, we surface six key themes, which represent the building blocks of a meta-theory of paradox. These six themes received varying attention in extant studies: paradox scholars emphasize types of paradoxes, collective approaches, and outcomes, but pay less attention to relationships within paradoxes, individual approaches, and dynamics. As this analysis suggests, management scholars have increasingly simplified the intricate, often messy phenomena of paradox. Greater simplicity renders phenomena understandable and testable, however, oversimplifying complex realities can foster reductionist and incomplete theories. We therefore propose a future research agenda targeted at enriching a meta-theory of paradox by reengaging these less developed themes. Doing so can sharpen the focus of this field, while revisiting its rich conceptual roots to capture the intricacies of paradox. This future research agenda leverages the potential of paradox across diverse streams of management science. © 2016 Academy of Management.","",""

The key focus of societal efforts to ensure socioeconomic mobility has been on the provision of educational opportunities. We review evidence that even with the same education and job opportunities, being born into a poorer family undermines socioeconomic mobility because of processes occurring within organizations. The burden of poorer background might, ceteris paribus, be economically comparable to the gender gap. We argue that in the societal and scientific effort to promote socioeconomic mobility, the key context in which mobility is supposed to happen—organizations—and the key part of the life of people striving toward socioeconomic advancement—that as working adults—have been overlooked. We integrate the organizational literature, pointing to key within-organizational processes impacting objective (socioeconomic) success with research, some emergent in organizational sciences and some disciplinary, on when, why, and how people from poorer backgrounds behave or are treated by others in the relevant situations. Integrating these literatures generates a novel and useful framework for identifying issues people born into poorer families face as employees, systematizes extant evidence and makes it more accessible to organizational scientists, and allows us to lay the agenda for future organizational scholarship. Our hope is that the current review will help bring organizational science—in our view, the best equipped domain of scholarship for studying how workers from different backgrounds fare in organizations—to the forefront of the quest for promoting socioeconomic mobility of workers coming from poorer families. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

In recent years, however, this assumption has been challenged as researchers have acknowledged that leader behaviors are more dynamic than previously thought. To clarify and broaden this literature, we review and synthesize published works focused on dynamic leader behaviors. In so doing, we identify three distinct conceptualizations of time and change in the leader behavior literature: shift (i.e., discontinuous, unidirectional change), growth and decay (i.e., unidirectional evolution over time), and ebb and flow (i.e., fluid, potentially nonlinear). We distill the conceptualization behind each of these approaches and synthesize the conceptual and empirical content of the literature within each approach. In the process, we also highlight several challenges and opportunities for research in this area. Moreover, we propose a new, integrative temporal framework meant to not only provide a richer view of dynamism but also guide future dynamic leader behavior research. © Academy of Management Annals.","",""

Although traditionally viewed as something to be avoided, organizational scholars in fields ranging from microorganiza-tional behavior to strategy have made significant advances in exploring the positive outcomes of ambivalence. However, despite identifying benefits of ambivalence that are critical to organizing (e.g., trust, adaptation, and creativity), research remains fragmented and siloed. The primary purpose of this review is to advance research on ambivalence by reviewing, synthesizing, and ultimately reconciling prior work on the negative consequences with promising emerging work on the positive—that is, functional and beneficial—outcomes of or responses to ambivalence. We significantly extend prior work by demonstrating that the myriad negative and positive outcomes of ambivalence may be organized around two key dimensions that underlie most research on the effects of ambivalence: (1) a flexibility dimension: inflexibility to flexibility and (2) an engagement dimension: disengagement to engagement. We further discuss the mechanisms and moderators that can lead to the more positive sides of these dimensions and suggest avenues for future research. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Accordingly, we seek to provide a more cohesive and dynamic integration of the TDI literature, evolving thinking about TDIs toward a system of interventions that can be optimized.

By taking strategic alliances and other interfirm relations as an exemplary illustration, we elaborate a research agenda on how the understanding of cooperation at each level of analysis—firm/alliance, work group/team, individual and interindividual— would benefit from greater integration of knowledge from other levels. Borrowing from the different disciplines, we explicate the social mechanisms—and related research directions—determining cooperation and their outcomes across levels: from macro-to-micro (e.g., explaining how cultural issues, different alliance structures, and organizational designs affect the cooperative behavior of interfirm team members); micro-to-micro (e.g., how individual motivation to cooperate or defect, or how different leadership styles, affect interfirm team members’ collaboration); and micro-to-macro (e.g., how self-interested individuals who identify with their firm can be aggregated into collaborative interfirm bureaucracies).

However, the often unstated assumption was that, if an organization could effectively improve the performance of individual employees, this would accrue to improvements in firm-level performance as well. A review of the literature suggested that this link had never really been established in a direct way. Instead, we found considerable support for relating ""bundles"" of human resource (HR) practices to firm-level performance, and several models for how these practices could create the transformation from individual-level to firm-level performance.

This process of creating value, however, requires managers to assess which activities should be handled by the market and which should be handled within hierarchy. Indeed, for more than 40 years, economists, sociologists and organizational scholars have extensively examined the theory of the firm's central question: what determines the boundaries of the firm? Many alternative theories have emerged and are frequently positioned as competing explanations, often with no shortage of critique for one another. In this paper, we review these theories and suggest that the core theories that have emerged to explain the boundary of the firm commonly address distinctly different directional forces on the firm boundary-forces that are tightly interrelated. We specifically address these divergent, directional forces-as they relate to organizational boundaries-by focusing on four central questions. First, what are the virtues of markets in organizing assets and activities? Second, what factors drive markets to fail? Third, what are the virtues of integration in organizing assets and activities?

The streams of research vary according to their representations of plural leadership as structured or emergent and as mutual or coalitional.

Unlike those who give, those who give in prefer to avoid the situation that compels altruism altogether, even if doing so leaves the would-be beneficiary empty-handed. We review the existing literature on altruism in behavioral economics, psychology, and organizational behavior and suggest that the distinction between giving and giving in is not only central from a theoretical standpoint, but also has important methodological implications for researchers trying to study prosocial behavior and practitioners trying to encourage it. © 2014 © 2014 Academy of Management.","",""

I consider the difficulties diverse work groups have in forming strong norms and then focus on how anti-bias norms, which are directed toward preventing behaviors associated with prejudice and discrimination and address members' security concerns, and openness norms, which promote people's ability to individuate those whom they might otherwise stereotype as well as address nurturance concerns, may increase a work group's ability to optimize social interaction and performance amidst diversity.

Specifically, we assess the state of organizational theory and knowledge regarding effective approaches to trust repair after internal or external events have weakened or damaged trust in an organization. We define what is meant by trust repair, review the most common ways that trust is broken, and then explore the three major approaches that have received the most attention in trust-repair research.

Concurrently, an ideology underlying U.S. professional norms discourages integration practices such as referencing non-work roles during workplace interactions, expressing emotions in the workplace, and/or displaying non-work-related items in workspaces. In this review, we posit that these two norms firmly coexist because they differentially serve two objectives corresponding to the parallel bodies of research we examine: one addressing boundary management as a tool for handling role responsibilities, and the other considering boundary management as a tool for shaping workplace identity and relationships. Specifically, we posit that segmenting personal and professional domains facilitates the management of role responsibilities, whereas integration is more beneficial for managing workplace identity and relationships. Furthermore, both objectives serve the “ideal worker” imperative of work primacy.

In this context, we reconsider the concept of decoupling as it applies to organizations. Through a review and critique of existing research, we argue that the common understanding of decoupling-as a gap between policy and practice-obscures the rise of a more prevalent and consequential form of decoupling-a gap between means and ends. We describe when to expect both policy-practice and means-ends decoupling, and we indicate promising areas for research. The major consequences of this overlooked form of decoupling are that in an effort to monitor and evaluate activities where the relationship between means and ends is opaque, (a) internal organizational structures become increasingly complex, (b) organizations persist in a state of perpetual reform, and (c) resources are often diverted away from core goals. © 2012 Copyright Academy of Management.","",""

In a critical assessment of the state-of-the-science in this area of research, we question the validity of that conclusion. We identify four problems with theory and research in charismatic– transformational leadership. First, a clear conceptual definition of charismatic–transformational leadership is lacking. Current theories advance multi-dimensional conceptualizations of charismatic–transformational leadership without specifying how these different dimensions combine to form charismatic–transformational leadership, or how dimensions are selected for inclusion or exclusion. Second, theories fail to sufficiently specify the causal model capturing how each dimension has a distinct influence on mediating processes and outcomes and how this is contingent on moderating influences. Third, conceptualization and operationalization confounds charismatic– transformational leadership with its effects. Fourth, the most frequently used measurement tools are invalid in that they fail to reproduce the dimensional structure specified by theory and fail to achieve empirical distinctiveness from other aspects of leadership. Given that these problems are fundamental and inherent in the approaches analyzed, it is recommended that current approaches be abandoned, and that the field forego the label of charismatic– transformational leadership in favor of the study of more clearly defined and empirically distinct aspects of leadership. © 2013 Academy of Management.","",""

We know much from the resource-based view about the relationship between capabilities and organizational performance. Separately, managerial cognition scholars have shown how interpretations of the environment shape organizational responses. Only recently have scholars begun to link the two sets of insights. These new links suggest that routines and capabilities are based in particular understandings about how things should be done, that the value of these capabilities is subject to interpretation, and that even the presence of capabilities may be useless without managerial interpretations of their match to the environment. This review organizes these emerging insights in a multi-level cognitive model of capability development and deployment. The model focuses on the recursive processes of constructing routines (capability building blocks), assembling routines into capabilities, and matching capabilities to perceived opportunities. To date, scholars have focused most attention on the organizational- level process of matching. Emerging research on the microfoundations of routines contributes to the micro-level of analysis. The lack of research on capability assembly leaves the field without a bridge connecting the macro and micro levels.

Constructivists who study implementation generally hold that organizational change emerges from an ongoing stream of social action in which people respond to a technology's constraints and affordances, as well as to each other. Although most students of technology and organizing generally agree on the ontology of constructivism, there are considerable differences in what scholars mean when they say that a technology's affects are socially constructed. We show that research on the social construction of implementation clusters into five coherent perspectives, which we call perception, interpretation, appropriation, enactment, and alignment. The perspectives differ with regard to the social phenomena they study and the processes by which they claim that construction occurs. The perspectives also focus on different phases of the implementation process and operate at different levels of analysis. After elucidating each perspective, we argue that students of technology and organizing could more directly engage issues central to organizational theory if they grappled with materiality and power, which they have heretofore downplayed in an attempt to counteract the field's earlier tendency toward technological determinism. © 2010 Academy of Management.","",""

Yet the research drawing on vocabularies is wide ranging and not integrated. We review work on vocabularies from literatures on rhetoric, culture, cognition, and coordination. We integrate and extend this work on vocabularies, introducing the new concept of vocabulary structure to capture different aspects of vocabulary use that collectively explain how vocabularies yield meaningful categories. We also generate a cross-level model to link work on vocabularies at the level of social collectives with work on vocabulary use in situations. We illustrate the usefulness of vocabularies by showing how they help advance work on institutional logics. Vocabularies offer substantial opportunities for theoretical integration and novel extensions for organizational research and practice. © 2012 Copyright Academy of Management.","",""

Prior research has emphasized cooperation, specifically partners' commitment and alignment of interests, as the key determinant of collaborative success. Scholars have paid less attention to the critical role of coordination-the effective alignment and adjustment of partners' actions. To redress this imbalance, we conceptually disentangle cooperation and coordination in the context of inter-organizational collaboration, and examine how the two phenomena play out in the partner selection, design, and post-formation stages of an alliance's life cycle. As we demonstrate, a coordination perspective helps resolve some empirical puzzles, but it also represents a challenge to received wisdom grounded in the salience of cooperation. To stimulate future research, we discuss alternative conceptualizations of the relationship between cooperation and coordination, and elaborate on their normative implications. © 2012 Copyright Academy of Management.","",""

The objectives of this review are twofold: first, we set out to disentangle the multiple conceptual strands used to describe culture, and second, we examine how culture relates to other key constructs, particularly identity, institutions, and practices. To start, we build from extant work in sociology to identify and discuss five prominent ways in which culture has been theorized in the management literature—values, stories, frames, toolkits, and categories—and we organize these into a framework that hinges on values and toolkits as anchors. Second, we examine the relationship between culture and theorizations of identity, institutions, and practices in organization studies. We focus on these three dimensions because their vicinity with culture often leads to conceptual slippage, as debates in the extant literature document. Finally, we identify some avenues for further research and propose that culture should remain a “code of many colors” that envelops different theoretical perspectives. © 2015 Academy of Management.","",""

In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of the different streams of this literature, highlighting its strengths and shortcomings. We distinguish between two types of literature. On the one hand, there is the programmatic literature, comprising of studies that take the perceived lack of practical relevance as their main point of departure and suggest particular ways of dealing with the issue of relevance in management research. On the other hand, there is the largely neglected descriptive literature, which examines the interplay between management research and management practice. Despite the interesting insights both bodies of literature provide, progress in this area of research is seriously hampered by the fragmentation of the research and the lack of scientific rigor that characterizes many of the studies it comprises. We argue that, in order to advance research on the practical relevance of management studies, it is necessary to move away from the partly ideological and often uncritical and unscientific debate on immediate solutions that the programmatic literature puts forward and toward a more rigorous and systematic research program to investigate how the results of scientific research are utilized in management practice. © 2015 Academy of Management.","",""

The current organizational literature on multiple identities, however, is sparse and scattered and has yet to fully capture this foundational idea. I review and organize the literature on multiple identities into five different theoretical perspectives: social psychological; microsociological; psychodynamic and developmental; critical; and intersectional. I then propose a way to take research on multiple identities forward using an intrapersonal identity network approach. Moving to an identity network approach offers two advantages: first, it enables scholars to consider more than two identities simultaneously, and second, it helps scholars examine relationships among identities in greater detail. This is important because preliminary evidence suggests that multiple identities shape important outcomes in organizations, such as individual stress and well-being, intergroup conflict, performance, and change. By providing a way to investigate patterns of relationships among multiple identities, the identity network approach can help scholars deepen their understanding of the consequences of multiple identities in organizations and spark novel research questions in the organizational literature. © 2014 © 2014 Academy of Management.","",""

What we argue in this paper is that, while history was indeed sidelined by the scientization of management since the late 1950s, it started to make a comeback from the 1980s onwards and is increasingly employed in a number of research programs. We stress that the crucial question for management scholars engaging with history (or wanting to do so) is how it relates to theory. First of all, we present a systematic overview of the way history has been used-both at the micro (organizational) and macro-levels of analysis-distinguishing between what we refer to as ""history to theory"" and ""history in theory"". In the former, we consider those research programs, such as (neo-)institutionalism, where history serves as evidence to develop, modify or test theories. In the case of ""history in theory"" we identify research programs where history or the past are part of the theoretical model itself as a driver or moderator, with ""imprinting"" as a prime example. Second, we also identify a growing number of studies that go further by displaying what we call ""historical cognizance"" in the sense of incorporating period effects or historical contingencies into their theorizing efforts. Finally, drawing on our broad overview, we make more specific suggestions for increasing the visibility and influence of history in organization and management theory. © 2014 © 2014 Academy of Management.","",""

We review and critique research on misconduct with an emphasis on organizational causes. In addition to reviewing some active areas of research, we also examine less-trodden areas and make suggestions for their development. We find that the definition of misconduct is often implicit and the role of socialcontrol agents in identifying misconduct has been neglected, suggesting a need for more rigor in how researchers define the boundary of misconduct and measure the labeling of misconduct. The spread of misconduct within and among organizations has also seen relatively little attention, as has the spread of the consequences of misconduct, suggesting a need to examine diffusion of misconduct. Finally, organizational misconduct has been an effective context for testing theories on themes such as motivation, control, power, labeling, and status, and will continue to be an important research topic for both its applied value and its theoretical import. © 2010 Academy of Management.","",""

In this article, we review this dispersed body of knowledge and synthesize it under a global construct of creative leadership, which refers to leading others toward the attainment of a creative outcome. Under this unifying construct, we classify three more narrow conceptualizations that we observe in the literature: facilitating employee creativity; directing the materialization of a leader's creative vision; and integrating heterogeneous creative contributions. After examining the contextual characteristics associated with the three conceptualizations, we suggest that they represent three distinct collaborative contexts of creative leadership. We discuss the theoretical implications of a multi-context framework of creative leadership, especially in terms of resolving three persisting problems in the extant literature: lack of definitional clarity, shortage of nuanced theories, and low contextual sensitivity. © 2015 Academy of Management.","",""

However, dominant models of workplace unethical behavior fail to account for what we have learned from moral psychology and cognitive neuroscience in the past two decades about how and why people make the moral decisions they do. In this review, we explain how intuition, affect, physiology, and identity support and inform more deliberative reasoning process in the construction and enactment of moral behavior. We then describe how these processes play into how individuals approach a potential moral choice, whether they have the ability in the moment to enact it, and how it is encoded in the action' aftermath, feeding back into future approaches. Throughout, we attend to the role of organizational context in influencing these processes. By reviewing this large body of research and presenting a new framework that attempts to integrate these new findings, our hope is to motivate new research about how to support more moral workplace behavior that starts from what we know now. © 2015 Academy of Management.","",""

This article offers a critical review of this rich yet disparate literature and guides research toward a multilevel theory of imprinting. We start with a definition that captures the general fea-tures of imprinting across levels of analysis but is precise enough to remain distinct from seemingly similar concepts, such as path dependence and cohort effects. We then provide a framework to order and unite the splintered field of imprinting research at different levels of analysis. In doing so, we identify economic, technological, institutional, and individual influences that lead to imprints at the level of (a) organizational collectives, (b) single organizations, (c) organizational building blocks, and (d) individuals. Building on this framework, we develop a general model that points to major avenues for future research and charts new directions toward a multilevel theory of imprinting.

The power of this perspective lies in its ability to explain how strategy-making is enabled and constrained by prevailing organizational and societal practices. Our review shows how SAP research has helped to advance social theories in strategic management, offered alternatives to performance-dominated analyzes, broadened the scope in terms of organizations studied and promoted new methodologies. In particular, it has provided important insights into the tools and methods of strategy-making (practices), how strategy work takes place (praxis), and the role and identity of the actors involved (practitioners). However, we argue that there is a need to go further in the analysis of social practices to unleash the full potential of this perspective. Hence, we outline five directions for the further development of the practice perspective: placing agency in a web of practices, recognizing the macro-institutional nature of practices, focusing attention on emergence in strategy-making, exploring how the material matters, and promoting critical analysis. © 2012 Copyright Academy of Management.","",""

We address those problems by reviewing and systematically integrating relevant work conducted not only in organizational science, but also in psychology and sociology. We offer a definition of group emotions and sort the conceptual space along four dimensions: group emotion responses, recognition, regulation, and reiteration. We provide evidence that group emotions occur at all levels of analysis, including levels beyond small work groups. The accounts of group emotion emergence at higher levels of analysis differ substantially between organizational science, psychology, and sociology. We review these accounts—emergence through inclination, interaction, institutionalization, or identification—and then synthesize them into one parsimonious model. The consequences of different group emotions are reviewed and further constructs (including emotional aperture, group emotional intelligence, emotional culture, and emotional climate) are discussed.

More recently, work has been devoted to studying the processes and content associated with identity formation. Given the amount of scholarly work done to date, it is an appropriate time to reflect on the perspectives, controversies and outcomes of this body of work. Because organizational identity change has received the preponderance of attention, we first review that extensive literature. We consider the conceptual and empirical work concerning the three putative “pillars” of identity (i.e. that which is ostensibly central, enduring, and distinctive). We devote particular attention to the most controversial of these pillars—the debate pitting a view that sees identity as stable over time (a position we term as the “enduring identity proposition”) and a contrasting stance that sees identity as more changeable (the “dynamic identity proposition”). Following our review of the identity change literature, we next take up a review of the notably smaller compendium of work on identity formation. We consider the conceptual and empirical work devoted to studying the external influences on, as well as the internal resources used, to fashion a nascent identity. Finally, we discuss in more depth the controversies associated with the pillars of identity, assess the four prevalent views on organizational identity (the social construction, social actor, institutionalist, and population ecologist views), assimilate the research on both identity formation and change, and consider the prospects for future work on both phenomena. © 2013 Academy of Management.","",""

Analyzing the literatures related to organizational identity and organizational knowledge reveals how organization theorists build on their rich and highly accessible understanding of humans (i.e. the self and others) to (1) make guesses and sense of organizational anomalies, (2) articulate theoretical mechanisms to build stronger theories, and (3) create plausible stories that facilitate sensegiving. Our review shows how some theorists by using particular approaches were able to use anthropomorphizing to generate new organizational theories, yet anthropomorphizing does not always lead to such salutary outcomes. Anthropomorphizing is less likely to enhance theorizing in organization studies when the theorist does not sufficiently doubt their guesses about organizational phenomena, fails to develop stronger explanations of the “how” and “why” of the theory thereby only partially exploring the social mechanisms underlying the proposed relationships, and fails in their attempts to tell the theory's “story”.

At the turn of the twentyfirst century, however, European epidemiologists, interested in determinants of ill health, found that injustice is a source of adverse emotional reactions that put people at risk for mental and physical morbidity (e.g., depression and coronary heart disease). This research is reviewed here, along with studies identifying pathways accounting for these connections. Specifically, perceived injustices lead to negative emotional reactions and to unhealthy behaviors (e.g., being sedentary, smoking, and drinking excessively), both of which trigger various negative bodily reactions (e.g., elevated serum lipids). These, in turn, subsequently put people at risk of illness. Research has found that such effects are mitigated by organizational interventions that promote perceptions of justice. Three limitations warranting consideration in future research are discussed: (a) the need to address methodological concerns (e.g., reducing common method variance, improving efforts to determine causality), (b) the need to assess the cultural generalizability of research findings, and (c) the need to supplement the existing attention to disease with a new focus on health and well-being. © 2010 Academy of Management.","",""

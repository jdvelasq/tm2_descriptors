IRIS: AN OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.,1987,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023244483&partnerID=40&md5=5ef558cfcb9cd678c7974cd5dc742ef5,"The Iris database management system is a research prototype of a next-generation database management system (DBMS) intended to meet the needs of new and emerging database applications, including office information and knowledge-based systems, engineering test and measurement, and hardware and software design. Iris is exploring a rich set of new database capabilities required by these applications, including rich data-modeling constructs, direct database support for inference, novel and extensive data types, for example, to support graphic images, voice, text, vectors, and matrices, support for long transactions spanning minutes to many days, and multiple versions of data. These capabilities are, in addition to the usual support for permanence of data, controlled sharing, backup, and recovery.",,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Applications; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES - Design; DATA DESCRIPTION LANGUAGES (DDL); DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGES (DML); KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASES; DATABASE SYSTEMS
SUPPORTING DISTRIBUTED OFFICE PROBLEM SOLVING IN ORGANIZATIONS.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022747703&partnerID=40&md5=2bd48e0df38f58088242f410989c6223,"To improve the effectiveness of office workers in their decision making, office systems have been built to support (rather than replace) their judgment. However, these systems model office work in a centralized environment, and/or they can only support a single office worker. Office work that is divided into specialized domains handled by different office workers (where cooperation is needed in order to accomplish the work) is not supported. In this paper, we will present a model that supports office problem solving in a logically distributed environment. (In some systems, information is geographically distributed for performance purposes rather than for conceptual need. The term, logically, is therefore used to indicate the logical need of organizing information without having to worry about the physical location of the information). In particular, cooperative tools that can be used to support office workers during the process of their problem solving is discussed.",,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Expert Systems; COMPUTERS, DIGITAL - Data Communication Systems; ELECTRONIC MAIL; MANAGEMENT - Information Systems; OFFICE AUTOMATION; OFFICE COMMUNICATION; COMPUTER NETWORKS"
1986 CONFERENCE ON OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022741217&partnerID=40&md5=26e8cdeff1b9c2d2050f7a310a957754,"This issue contains 5 conference papers. These papers contribute to both laying theoretical foundations and applying fundamental principles to existing office information systems. The main theme of these papers is using artificial intelligence (AI) to support and model office information systems. The main subjects are office information systems as open system, integration of computing and routine work, office problem solving, and visual interfaces for database systems.

INTEGRATION OF COMPUTING AND ROUTINE WORK.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022746620&partnerID=40&md5=1dc69511cddee9d8481533209453fcf0,"Most computing serves as a resource or tool to support other work: performing complex analyses for engineering projects, preparing documents, or sending electronic mail using office automation equipment, etc. To improve the character, quality, and ease of computing work, we must understand how automated systems actually are integrated into the work they support. How do people actually adapt to computing a resource? How do they deal with the unreliability in hardware, software, or operations; data inaccuracy; system changes; poor documentation; inappropriate designs; etc. ; which are present in almost every computing milieu, even where computing a widely used and considered highly successful? This paper presents some results of a detailed empirical study of routine computer use in several organizations.",,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Applications; DATA PROCESSING, BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT - Information Systems; KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; USER/MACHINE SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SOFTWARE"
VISUAL INTERFACE FOR A DATABASE WITH VERSION MANAGEMENT.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022746017&partnerID=40&md5=e13f6f30670a55d659fa3b2e0977c6cf,"This paper describes a graphical interface to an experimental database system which incorporates a built-in version control mechanism that maintains a history of the database development and changes. The system is an extension of ISIS, Interface for a Semantic Information System, a workstation-based, graphical database programming tool developed at Brown University. ISIS supports a graphical interface to a modified subset of the Semantic Data Model (SDM). The ISIS extension introduces a transaction mechanism that interacts with the version control facilities. A series of version control support tools have been added to ISIS to provide a notion of history to user-created databases. The user can form new versions of three types of ISIS objects: a class definition object (a type), the set of instances of a class (the content), and an entity. A version-viewing mechanism is provided to allow for the comparison of various object versions. Database operations are grouped together in atomic units to form transactions, which are stored as entities in the database. A sample session demonstrates the capabilities of version and transaction control during the creation and manipulation of database objects.",,HUMAN ENGINEERING; MANAGEMENT - Information Systems; OFFICE AUTOMATION; SEMANTIC DATA MODEL; USER/MACHINE SYSTEMS; DATABASE SYSTEMS
ANALYZING DUE PROCESS IN THE WORKPLACE.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022746018&partnerID=40&md5=7f092a62860705953d04e9dbc2ad6e54,"Every office is an open system, and the products of office work are the result of decentralized negotiations. Changing patterns of task organization and alliance inevitably give rise to inconsistent knowledge bases and procedures. This implies that there are no globally correct answers to problems addressed by OISs. Rather, systems must deal with multiple competing, possibly irreconcilable, solutions. Articulating alternative solutions is the problem of due process. This problem and its consequences are illustrated by a case study of a rate-setting group in a large health insurance firm. There is no formal solution to the problem of due process. But it must be solved in practice if distributed intelligent OISs are to be developed. We propose an alternative approach based on the work of social scientists concerned with analyzing analogous problems in human organization. Solution of the due process problem hinges on developing local closures to the problem faced by an organization. This means analyzing (a) local, tacit knowledge and its transfer ability; (b) articulation work, that is, reconciling incommensurate assumptions and procedures.",,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Applications; OFFICE AUTOMATION; KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT
OFFICES ARE OPEN SYSTEMS.,1986,ACM transactions on office information systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022747499&partnerID=40&md5=cedc6f529476ab128013ea98fb098f86,This paper is intended as a contribution to analysis of the implications of viewing offices as open systems. It takes a prescriptive stance on how to establish the information-processing foundations for taking action and making decisions in office work from an open systems perspective. We propose due process as a central activity in organizational information processing. Computer systems are beginning to play important roles in mediating the ongoing activities of organizations. We expect that these roles will gradually increase in importance as computer systems take on more of the authority and responsibility for ongoing activities. At the same time we expect computer systems to acquire more of the characteristics and structure of human organizations.,,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Applications; COMPUTER SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING - Multiprocessing Programs; MANAGEMENT - Information Systems; CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING; KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; PROBLEM SOLVING; OFFICE AUTOMATION

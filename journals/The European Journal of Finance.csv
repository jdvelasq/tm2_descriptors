"The classical tax system, imputation tax and capital budgeting",1995,The European Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963146696&doi=10.1080%2f13518479500000012&partnerID=40&md5=a815e97c66baf74055b71a8b8e9a0b09,"Differences in the taxation systems in Britain, France, and some other European countries (which use the imputation system) compared with the USA and the Netherlands, among others (which use the classical tax system), mean that the cost of equity capital should be specified, using a capital asset pricing model methodology, in different ways. Under the imputation system its value should be net of personal taxes; under the classical tax system, it should be gross of personal taxes. Similarly the value of the tax shield on debt for input into adjusted present value calculations differs, being significantly greater under the classical tax system. Formulae are set out to enable the calculation of the magnitude of the tax shield readily to be undertaken. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",,
A reappraisal of share price maximization as a corporate financial objective,1995,The European Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944165822&doi=10.1080%2f13518479500000001&partnerID=40&md5=4f580f75be7de21f5dbc68286ad890ce,"This paper challenges the conventional share price maximizing objective and the assumption that a successful company can expect to achieve share price growth above the normal drift caused by inflation and earnings retention. The share price is an expectations-based measure, and more efficient companies have no greater prospect of outperforming market expectations than less efficient companies. The paper concludes that, given the potentially dysfunctional effects of pursuing a share price maximizing goal, it may be significant that share-price centred economies such as the UK and the US tend to be associated with a more short-termist perspective than bank-centred economies such as Germany and Japan. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Stability of international stock market relationships across month of the year and different holding intervals,1995,The European Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-30944451983&doi=10.1080%2f13518479500000017&partnerID=40&md5=266c44262e031537793a312f60acbf94,"Potential benefits from international diversification depend upon the stability in stock market relationships. Using monthly data of 11 international stock markets, this paper examines the stability in stock market relationships across month of the year and across different holding intervals. Empirical results show that the correlation structure is more stable than the covariance structure. While empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the correlation structure is very stable across different holding intervals, the empirical support for the stability in correlation structure across month of the year is much weaker. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Estimating the time varying components of international stock markets' risk,1995,The European Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963163252&doi=10.1080%2f13518479500000013&partnerID=40&md5=42c850b2fe8164031ae09d21b3ce693d,"In this study an alternative approach for assessing securities' risk is applied. Various authors have argued that security returns are not homoskedastic but exhibit variation over time. They have observed that large changes tend be followed by more large changes in either direction, and so volatility must be predictably high after large changes. This phenomenon of securities' volatility, referred to as clustering, has important implications for security pricing and risk management. Among the most popular techniques currently used to capture the clustering effect and to forecast future volatilityare those belonging to the family of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) models. The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether such volatility modelling can be used to capture the time variation not only in the total risk of a security return but also its systematic and unsystematic components. Using weekly local stock market data, the time varying beta with the World Index has been estimated via a bivariate GARCH-M model. The GARCH-M parameterization used here is a dynamic specification of the SIM. The hypothesis that this dynamic specification holds cannot be rejected for 11 out of 13 local portfolios. The results provide evidence that both the systematic and the non-systematic counterparts are also changing over time. However, in some markets those risk changes may take place with some delay. This suggests that some of the low correlation coefficients computed for certain stock market returns may not be due to differences in business cycles among those countries, but may be caused by the non-synchronous response to world market developments. This finding should have important implications in many investment decisions such as portfolio selection, market timing and risk hedging. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",,
An empirical study of research and development top managers' perceptions of short-term pressures from capital markets in the united kingdom,1995,The European Journal of Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963461995&doi=10.1080%2f13518479500000015&partnerID=40&md5=0cfc8ad8d1d4f9bf78de578ed7dfe675,"It is often argued that capital market pressures are increasingly directed towards shortterm performance evaluation of managers and their operations. Whether these external capital market pressures actually exist or not, short-term pressures on firms are influenced by managers' own perceptions of these external pressures. If managers perceive the existence of these external pressures it is likely that this will lead to shortterm behaviour on their part. The purpose of this paper is therefore to examine (a) research and development (R&D) managers' perceptions of short-term behaviour in capital markets in the UK, and (b) patterns of behaviour relating to R&D which may be influenced by these perceptions. The findings of this study indicate that approximately half of the UK research and development managers perceive capital markets as responsible for putting inappropriate short-term pressures on their companies' manage ment. However, an even larger proportion report short-termist behaviour relating to R&D and its evaluation, suggesting that some at least of the problem of ‘short-termism’ is internally generated. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

An innovation accounting approach based on a multivariate vector autoregressive WAR) model is used to estimate the proportion of each market return's forecast error attributable to innovations in foreign market returns. Three major results appear. The variance decompositions indicate a strong degree of economic interaction among stock markets. The US stock market has a considerable influence on stock market performance in almost every country, while there is no substantial inter-continental influence from the European stock markets on the world's two largest equity markets in New York and Tokyo. Finally, the pattern of the impulseresponse functions illustrates a rapid international transmission of stock market events, supporting the hypothesis of international stock market efficiency. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

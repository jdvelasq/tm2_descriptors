Investigating the relationship between processes and profit: A work-based assessment of process used in Australian financial planning firms,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189832862&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100128&partnerID=40&md5=62d6ab7b09bac35fc14545f4062637cc,"The research explores relationship dynamics between process and profit in Australian professional practise. We analyse data collected from 134 financial planning firms located in Southeast Queensland as a sample size. The research introduces a complete financial planning process framework designed to measure the impact that process may have on the relationship with firm profit. Quantitative profit data was recorded using Dovetail software to capture results and evidence regression between groups. The research found that firms’ processes are positively associated with profit, and both process and profit contribute to the decreasing influence of firm agency theory. The research suggests that process could be leveraged as an asset to develop commercial advantages. The research may help identify new measures of standard practise, develop the perception of Australian financial firms and assist to reduce barriers of accessing financial services. © 2024 The Authors",Agency Theory; Financial planning; Process; Profit,
Overlooked biases from misidentifications of causal structures,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188247432&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100127&partnerID=40&md5=04833ce58781aba3eadb797081005b9f,"Testing theories and explaining phenomena in empirical finance often requires estimating causal effects from observational data. In this note, we argue that some of the standard practices to address endogeneity concerns in regression-based estimation approaches can, when not correctly implemented and their results not appropriately interpreted, generate additional, often overlooked, problems. We identify three main systemic issues in empirical finance, provide theoretical and numerical examples to illustrate and support our arguments, and propose solutions to overcome these limitations. Overall, we suggest that these issues are caused by a systematic underestimation of the importance of robust ex-ante identification, and interpretation, of causal structures in empirical studies in finance. © 2024 The Authors",Causal inference; Empirical finance; Identification,
Cluster-based regression using variational inference and applications in financial forecasting,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194163761&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100130&partnerID=40&md5=9eb98cfeddd6f730a25feac2a22ffaab,"This paper describes an approach to simultaneously identify clusters and estimate cluster-specific regression parameters from the given data. Such an approach can be useful in learning the relationship between input and output when the regression parameters for estimating output are different in different regions of the input space. Variational Inference (VI), a machine learning approach to obtain posterior probability densities using optimization techniques, is used to identify clusters of explanatory variables and regression parameters for each cluster. From these results, one can obtain both the expected value and the full distribution of predicted output. Other advantages of the proposed approach include the elegant theoretical solution and clear interpretability of results. The proposed approach is well-suited for financial forecasting where markets have different regimes (or clusters) with different patterns and correlations of market changes in each regime. In financial applications, knowledge about such clusters can provide useful insights about portfolio performance and identify the relative importance of variables in different market regimes. An illustrative example of predicting one-day S&P change is considered to illustrate the approach and compare the performance of the proposed approach with standard regression without clusters. Due to the broad applicability of the problem, its elegant theoretical solution, and the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the approach may be useful in a number of areas extending beyond the financial domain. © 2024 The Authors",Financial forecasting; Machine learning; Regression; Variational inference,
Explicit formulae for the valuation of European options with price impacts,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195019246&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100133&partnerID=40&md5=88dcdc99bdaa136b6726181be7eade07,"In this work, we examine the consequences of trading a large position in vanilla European options within a multi-period binomial model framework for the underlying asset price, S. Given the significant size of the transaction, we expect both the derivative's price and the underlying asset's price to be affected by market impacts. Consequently, derivative valuation should incorporate these effects. To address this, we not only utilize a multi-period binomial model to represent the price process S but also incorporate trading impacts in a multiplicative manner. Moreover, we conduct our analysis in discrete time to better capture the influence of price impacts. Our findings suggest, for instance, that the strike price should be determined by both the trade's magnitude and parameterized market impacts. We present explicit formulas for European option prices under market impacts and offer numerical examples to elucidate our findings. Upon request, we can provide code implemented in the statistical package R. © 2024 The Authors",91B24; 91B70; 91G15; 91G30; Multi-period binomial model; Price impacts; Valuation of derivatives,
CPC-SAX: Data mining of financial chart patterns with symbolic aggregate approXimation and instance-based multilabel classification,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195570951&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100132&partnerID=40&md5=f35380349818cd6305f1f7e528523319,"In order to be able to classify financial chart patterns through machine learning, we introduced and applied a novel classification algorithm on time series data of different financial assets through SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation), a transformation algorithm. After applying a linear regression model on the features of a dataset to reduce the number of parameters needed, converting real valued data to strings of characters through Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) and labelling each level increasingly with Latin alphabets characters, the new algorithm called CPC-SAX (Chart Pattern Classification) compares vectors describing the ASCII value changes along the string and classifies them using already labelled SAX-transformed data. The results show satisfying accuracy scores on data of different time windows and types of assets. We also obtain information on the appearance of said patterns. By reaching our goal of properly classifying chart patterns as they appear, we can have a better indication of the future price trend, allowing the investor/trader to make better informed decisions. © 2024 The Authors",Chart Patterns; Classification; Multilabel; SAX; Time Series,
Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in high-frequency markets,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191445825&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100129&partnerID=40&md5=479efe8b5690a2bd305f984c2aa18eb2,"Inspired by recent advances in the deep learning literature, this article introduces a novel hybrid anomaly detection framework specifically designed for limit order book (LOB) data. A modified Transformer autoencoder architecture is proposed to learn rich temporal LOB subsequence representations, which eases the separability of normal and fraudulent time series. A dissimilarity function is then learned in the representation space to characterize normal LOB behavior, enabling the detection of any anomalous subsequences out-of-sample. We also develop a complete trade-based manipulation simulation methodology able to generate a variety of scenarios derived from actual trade–based fraud cases. The complete framework is tested on LOB data of five NASDAQ stocks in which we randomly insert synthetic quote stuffing, layering, and pump-and-dump manipulations. We show that the proposed asset-independent approach achieves new state-of-the-art fraud detection performance, without requiring any prior knowledge of manipulation patterns. © 2024 The Authors",Deep learning; Dissimilarity model; Limit order book; Time series anomaly detection; Trade–based manipulation; Unsupervised learning,
Research on credit card default repayment prediction model,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198569851&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100136&partnerID=40&md5=ddc3ddf513503742f14850b62e670631,"This study compares the predictive ability of various machine learning models for credit card default repayment within different prediction frameworks, using data from a commercial bank in China. Firstly, utilizing different tree models, we explore the impact on post-default repayment of different factors. Next, a split-sample time series prediction is carried out with two neural network algorithms, BPNN and ELM. The outcomes indicate that, ELM yields a significantly superior prediction performance compared to the BPNN model. Thirdly, the predictive performances of ten machine learning models are compared using full-sample data. The findings demonstrate that XGBoost and ELM models have superior predictive performances in full-sample analyses. Fourthly, this study employs the EMD data decomposition technique to examine the predictive ability of the XGBoost and ELM models in various frequency data. The results indicate that the predictive efficacy may differ depending on the frequency and repayment period after default. The findings are valuable for commercial banks in developing a framework and selecting a methodology to address the challenge of predicting credit card default payments. © 2024 The Authors",Credit card default repayment; ELM; EMD; XGBoost,
Revising data collection methodology - evidence from the Australian financial sector,2024,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194333858&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2024.100131&partnerID=40&md5=33fd642089b0c030ad93b6ad454a7358,Time requirements of data collection account for a significant portion of the total time required to provide financial advice. This research applies data collection software to the financial planning process seeking to identify benefits that may assist to reduce rising barriers of accessing financial advice. Experimental two-phase study seeks qualitative input surrounding problematic themes before quantitative input records impacts of data collection software use. The research seeks to evidence beneficial impacts that software use may have on the data collection requirements by way of comparison between traditional and software methodologies in Australian professional practice. Respondents were asked to complete data collection inputs using both traditional and digital methods with metrics recorded throughout the process. Input from 112 consumers and 71 practising advisers were recorded. Results suggest the use of software may decrease time taken to complete task and often results in higher levels of data accuracy. Traditional methods were affiliated with extended time periods and lower levels of data accuracy. Results aim to evolve methods of traditional practise within the financial sector. The research provides original contributions to financial planning literature by examining the potential impact data collection methodologies may have on reducing barriers to accessing financial services in Australia. © 2024 The Authors,Data collection; Experimental study; Financial planning,
An analysis of conditional mean-variance portfolio performance using hierarchical clustering,2023,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185917397&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2023.100112&partnerID=40&md5=f8d8da099a366f83bf3e77374511c9d9,"This paper studies portfolio optimization through improvements of ex-ante conditional covariance estimates. We use the cross-section of stock returns over a 52-year sample to analyze trading performance by implementing the machine learning algorithm of hierarchical clustering. We find that higher out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns are achieved relative to the traditional Markowitz portfolio through hierarchical clustering using a 3-month buy-and-hold, long-only strategy. Additionally, the average change in portfolio weights at each rebalancing period is significantly lower for the portfolio formed using machine learning relative to Markowitz, decreasing investor trading costs. The results are robust to various settings and subsamples. © 2023 The Authors",Asset allocation; Asset pricing; Covariances; Machine learning,
A dynamic partial equilibrium model of capital gains taxation,2023,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180353547&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2023.100111&partnerID=40&md5=1d15f3dd0ae9fe7ebeacb0a234e6939a,"We analyze a multi-period model of capital gains taxation with endogenous prices. Relative to an economy without taxation, a capital gains tax tends to lower prices and increase returns. Abstracting from tax redistribution policies, we find that a taxable investor's welfare falls, a nontaxable investor's welfare rises, and, depending on the tax rate, social welfare may either rise or fall. The taxable investor's tax-timing option increases social welfare but may either increase or decrease tax revenue. Tax rebates for capital losses have little effect on welfare or tax revenue. Implications for empirical asset pricing are identified. © 2023 The Authors",Asset pricing; Asset pricing theory; Capital gains taxation; Taxation,
Portfolio optimization using cellwise robust association measures and clustering methods with application to highly volatile markets,2023,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85154035057&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2023.100097&partnerID=40&md5=48b161d4ce19bc5c57273dbc16549696,"This paper introduces the minCluster portfolio, which is a portfolio optimization method combining the optimization of downside risk measures, hierarchical clustering and cellwise robustness. Using cellwise robust association measures, the minCluster portfolio is able to retrieve the underlying hierarchical structure in the data. Furthermore, it provides downside protection by using tail risk measures for portfolio optimization. We show through simulation studies and a real data example that the minCluster portfolio produces better out-of-sample results than mean-variances or other hierarchical clustering based approaches. Cellwise outlier robustness makes the minCluster method particularly suitable for stable optimization of portfolios in highly volatile markets, such as portfolios containing cryptocurrencies. © 2023 The Authors",Cellwise robustness; Distance correlation; Hierarchical clustering; Linkage; Portfolio allocation; Risk contribution,

NonSOEs gained in more liberalized provinces, especially those with high past ETC, productivity, growth opportunities, and external financing. NonSOEs lost in the least liberalized provinces, especially those with high past ETC. These findings support investors' expect reduced official corruption to create value overall, reduce SOE waste, lower bureaucratic barriers to efficient resource allocation where markets function, and impede business in unliberalized provinces, where “getting things done” still requires investment in greasing bureaucratic gears. © 2023 The Authors",China; Corruption; Event study; Market liberalization; Shareholder value,
Stock pledged loans and market crash risk: Evidence from China,2023,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175567723&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2023.100104&partnerID=40&md5=f511685ea823ddd4c08ddb6bb20c1050,"Stock pledged loans have become prevalent among large shareholders of listed firms in China. The largest shareholder pledges a greater fraction of her holdings as collateral for credit when the firm is in growth industries, less profitable, not state owned, and has higher leverage. Stock performance of highly pledged firms is indistinguishable from that of firms with low pledge ratios in 2017. During 2018, however, highly pledged firms have worse stock returns and operating performance, and experienced ‘contagion’ – the crash risk of one highly pledged stock spreading to others. Using a regulatory reform in 2013 that allowed securities companies to provide stock pledged loans, we find that obtaining these personal loans had no adverse effects on the firms when the pledge ratio was low. Overall, forced sales of pledged stocks and worsened agency conflict are responsible for the poor performance of highly pledged firms during the 2018 bear market. © 2023 The Authors",Largest shareholder; Momentum; Related-party transactions; Return; Stock pledged loan,

This study analyzes the current state of research on big data and insurance. Bibliometric analysis and a systematic review were conducted to analyze the patterns and trends of the subject area, with the main focus on citations as a key measurement unit. This analysis is important to fill the existing gap in the examined area because no other bibliometric analysis has been conducted previously on the same subject; it will also help in establishing a scientific background for future research.

The return predictive patterns of bond size, time to maturity, and credit rating are similar in the exchange market, but bond age and Amihud illiquidity predict returns in the opposite direction, implying market segmentation. We construct two factors based on credit rating and Amihud illiquidity to represent the common risk of corporate bonds—credit risk and liquidity risk—and use the Hansen-Jagannathan distance to evaluate the performances of factors in explaining the returns of corporate bond portfolios. We find that the two characteristic-based factors help reduce the model specification errors of the five factors in Fama and French (1993). © 2023 The Authors",Bond characteristics; Chinese corporate bond; Hansen–Jagannathan distance; Interbank and exchange markets,

However, due to delays in the release of government indicators based on macroeconomic factors, there is a high demand for timely estimates or “nowcasting”.

We present a fully data-driven methodology using non-prescribed search engine query data (Search Big Data) to approximate economic variables in real time. We evaluate this model by estimating representative Japanese economic indicators and confirm its success in nowcasting prior to official announcements, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike human-selected variable models that struggled. Our model shows consistent performance in nowcasting indices both before and under the pandemic before government announcements, adapting to unexpected circumstances and rapid economic fluctuations. An exhaustive analysis of key queries reveals the pivotal role of libidinal drives and the pursuit of entertainment in influencing economic indicators within the temporal and geographic context examined.

Online aggregation of experts combine the forecasts of a finite set of models in a single approach without making any assumption about the models. In this paper, a Bernstein Online Aggregation (BOA) procedure is applied to the construction of long-short strategies built from individual stock return forecasts coming from different machine learning models. The online mixture of experts leads to attractive portfolio performances even in non-stationary environments. The inclusion of neural networks experts in the aggregation contributes to a better average return, while Ordinary Least Squares with Huber Loss experts contribute to lower risk. The aggregation outperforms individual algorithms, offering a higher portfolio Sharpe ratio, lower shortfall, with a similar turnover.

In real markets, continuous replication, such as in the model of Black, Scholes and Merton (BSM), is not only unrealistic but is also undesirable due to high transaction costs. A variety of methods have been proposed to balance between effective replication and losses in the incomplete market setting. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI-based hedgers have attracted considerable interest, where particular attention is given to Recurrent Neural Network systems and variations of the Q-learning algorithm. From a practical point of view, sufficient samples for training such an AI can only be obtained from a simulator of the market environment. Yet if an agent is trained solely on simulated data, the run-time performance will primarily reflect the accuracy of the simulation, which leads to the classical problem of model choice and calibration. In this article, the hedging problem is viewed as an instance of a risk-averse contextual k-armed bandit problem, which is motivated by the simplicity and sample-efficiency of the architecture, which allows for realistic online model updates from real-world data. We find that the k-armed bandit model naturally fits to the Profit and Loss formulation of hedging, providing for a more accurate and sample efficient approach than Q-learning and reducing to the Black-Scholes model in the absence of transaction costs and risks. © 2023 The Authors",Hedging; Multi-Armed Bandits; Q-Learning; Reinforcement Learning,

Accurate option pricing is essential to the development of financial markets. For option pricing, existing time series models and neural networks are difficult to extract multi-scale temporal features from option data, which greatly limits their performance. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning model named as MRC-LSTM-CI. It contains three modules, including Multi-scale Residual CNN module (MRC), Long Short-Term Memory neural network module (LSTM) and confidence interval output module (CI). The proposed model can effectively extract multi-scale features from real market option data, and make interval prediction to provide more information to the decision maker. In addition, the proposed model is further improved using the residual prediction strategy, where the output value is chosen as the residual value between BS theory price and actual market price. Experimental results show that our model has better prediction accuracy than other deep learning models and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. © 2023 The Authors",Confidence interval; Deep learning; Multi-scale time series; Option pricing,

Efficient frontiers can be decomposed to their functional form, a square-root second-order polynomial defined by three coefficients, to provide a dimensionality reduction of the return vector and covariance matrix. Each month, the proposed model hierarchically clusters the monthly coefficients data up to the current month, to characterize the market states, then defines a Markov process on the sequence of states. To incorporate these states into portfolio optimization, for each state, we calculate the tangency portfolio using only return data in that state. We then take the expectation of these weights for each state, weighted by the probability of transitioning from the current state to each state. To empirically validate our proposed model, we employ three sets of assets that span the market, and show that our proposed model significantly outperforms benchmark portfolios. © 2023 The Authors",Asset allocation; Clustering; Efficient frontier; Markov; Modern portfolio theory; Portfolio optimization,

In contrast to the U.S. municipal bonds, Chengtou bonds are issued by private corporations but implicitly guaranteed by local and the central governments, which are reflected by novel risk characteristics—real estate GDP and political risk. One standard deviation increase in local real estate GDP (political risk) corresponds to 10 (9) basis points decrease (increase) in bond yields, respectively. However, conditional on political risk, real estate GDP actually increases bond yields, suggesting that only local governments with low political risk can enjoy the low funding costs driven by high real estate growth. © 2023 The Authors",Chinese local government debt; Government guarantee; Political risk; Real estate,

Cryptocurrency provides some level of anonymity allowing its users to create an unlimited number of wallets with alias addresses, which makes it challenging to identify the actual user. This is used by criminals for the purpose of making illegal transactions. At the same time, Bitcoin stores and provides information about all committed transactions, which opens up opportunities for identifying suspicious behavior patterns in this network using data mining. The problem of detecting suspicious activity in the Bitcoin network can be solved with sufficiently high accuracy using machine learning methods. The paper provides a comparative study of various machine learning methods to solve the mentioned problem: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting. Selecting hyper parameters, rebalancing the dataset, and active learning are particularly important. The most important hyperparameters of the algorithms are described. Metrics show that the gradient boosting looks the most promising. In total 38 features of bitcoin addresses were identified.

We document substantial heterogeneity of the pivotal determinants across the FinTech market as a whole and its major segments. Thus, specific rather than general policy measures are needed to foster the development of standalone FinTech market segments.

We provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the factors that influence startup success to create a large set of features for predictive modeling. We train two models for predicting startup success employing light gradient boosting that use LinkedIn data as a standalone and as a complementary data source, and compare them to baseline models based on Crunchbase data. We show that using LinkedIn as a complementary data source yields the best result with a mean area under the curve (AUC) value of 84%.

We first explore diverse pairings of generative model forecasts and objective functions used for portfolio optimization, which are evaluated using performance-attribution models based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We illustrate our approach using extensive simulations of crypto-currency portfolios, and we show that the portfolios constructed using the vine-copula generative model and the Sharpe-ratio objective function consistently outperform. To accommodate a wide array of investment strategies, we further investigate portfolio blending and propose a general framework for evaluating and combining investment strategies. We employ an extension of the multi-armed bandit framework and use value models and policy models to construct eclectic blended portfolios based on past performance. We consider similarity and optimality measures for value models and employ probability-matching (“blending”) and a greedy algorithm (“switching”) for policy models. The eclectic portfolios are also evaluated using LASSO models. We show that the value model utilizing cosine similarity and logit optimality consistently delivers robust superior performances. The extent of outperformance by eclectic portfolios over their benchmarks significantly surpasses that achieved by individual generative model-based portfolios over their respective benchmarks. © 2023 The Authors",Cryptocurrency; Generative model; Multi-armed bandit; Portfolio blending; Portfolio construction,

Consequently, companies have been increasingly characterized by non-financial information, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, based on which companies can be grouped into ESG classes. While many scholars have questioned the relationship between financial performance and risks of assets belonging to different ESG classes, the question about dependence among ESG classes is still open. Here, we focus on understanding the dependence structures of different ESG class indices and the market index through the lens of copula models. After a thorough introduction to vine copula models, we explain how cross-sectional and temporal dependencies can be captured by models based on vine copulas, more specifically, using ARMA-GARCH and stationary vine copula models. Using real-world ESG data over a long period with different economic states, we find that assets with medium ESG scores tend to show weaker dependence to the market, while assets with extremely high or low ESG scores tend to show stronger, non-Gaussian dependence. © 2022 The Authors",Copulas; Cross sectional and temporal dependence; ESG; Sustainability; Vine copulas,

In this paper, we propose a tail risk measure based on the most probable maximum size of risk events (MPMR) that can occur over a length of time. MPMR underscores the dependence of the tail risk on the risk management time frame. Unlike VaR and ES, MPMR does not require specifying a confidence level. We derive the risk measure analytically for several well-known distributions. In particular, for the case where the size of the risk event follows a power law or Pareto distribution, we show that MPMR also scales with the number of observations n (or equivalently the length of the time interval) by a power law, MPMR(n) ∝ nη, where η is the scaling exponent (SE). The scale invariance allows for reasonable estimations of long-term risks based on the extrapolation of more reliable estimations of short-term risks. The scaling relationship also gives rise to a robust and low-bias estimator of the tail index (TI) ξ of the size distribution, ξ = 1/η. We demonstrate the use of this risk measure for describing the tail risks in financial markets as well as the risks associated with natural hazards (earthquakes, tsunamis, and excessive rainfall). © 2022 The Authors",Extreme value; Maximum loss; Power law; Risk management; Risk measure; Tail index,

To address this issue, we use structural causal modeling to identify how classic determinants of leverage are causally linked to capital structure and how this causal structure influences the effect-estimation process. The results provide support for the causal role of variables that measure the potential for information asymmetry concerning firms’ market values. Overall, our work provide a crucial step to connect capital structure theories with their empirical tests beyond simple correlations. © 2022 The Authors",Capital structure; Causal inference; Structural causal models,

An insurance company generally uses the traditional estimation methods with linear estimation to measure loss reserve error, but those methods are often criticized for several statistical shortcomings, such as estimation technique, correlated contributing variables, ignorance of the interactions, and higher-order terms. To overcome such shortcomings, this paper proposes an unsupervised-supervised machine learning approach, hierarchical clustering, and artificial neural network (ANN) by adopting a combined unsupervised-supervised method, cluster analysis (i.e., unsupervised), and various supervised machine learning algorithms such as Boostings, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and RReliefF. We show evidence that each cluster has its own foundation variables to predict and Boosting and ANN estimation provide a more efficient framework to improve insurers' reserve error. Also, the different value and order of RReliefF between Boosting and OLS show the under-or over-estimated predictor, and each year's influential variables are found to be consistent over time, which indicates that the firm's previous year's loss reserve model can predict the future loss reserve error. This paper contributes to the existing literature by suggesting a more robust, consistent, and efficient prediction method (i.e., unsupervised-supervised combination method) to improve insurers' loss reserve error prediction. © 2022 The Authors",Artificial neural network; Cluster analysis; Earnings management; Loss reserve error; Nonlinear estimation,

To this end, we build probability-calibrated Random Forests on various predictors, extracted from both traditional market data and financial news, to predict the closing Sharpe ratio of short one-week delta-hedged straddles. We then demonstrate how the output of these calibrated machine learning models can be used to engineer intuitive new trading strategies.

Price noise is known to affect high beta stocks, hence, noise trading can be expected to significantly affect the performance of these strategies. I study the impact of flows between bond and equity funds (net exchanges) on the Frazzini and Pedersen's (2014) Betting Against Beta (BAB) factor in the US for a period 1984 until 2015. I find mispricing and reversal effects. In particular, when retail investors are caught up in the market euphoria, they are too optimistic, and shift their holdings from bond to equity mutual funds. My results suggest that higher-than-rational beta stocks are particularly exposed to this non-fundamental price pressure. Subsequently, the short-term reversal relation is stronger for high beta stocks and, therefore, returns are significantly lower. As a results, while the market performs poorly, the BAB factor returns are significantly positive. A dynamic trading strategy that is based on signals from past net exchanges and the BAB factor significantly outperforms the market factor by 0.71% monthly on average, during months following positive net exchanges by 1.62% and during market stress episodes by 2.14%.

My findings suggest that a major part of the success of the BAB factor is due to its exposure to flow-induced price noise. © 2022 The Authors",Betting against beta; Factor investing; Fund flows; Market stress; Mutual funds; Net exchanges; Price noise,

We train the models to predict binary relative daily market movements of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies. Our results show that all employed models make statistically viable predictions, whereby the average accuracy values calculated on all cryptocurrencies range from 52.9% to 54.1%. These accuracy values increase to a range from 57.5% to 59.5% when calculated on the subset of predictions with the 10% highest model confidences per class and day. We find that a long-short portfolio strategy based on the predictions of the employed LSTM and GRU ensemble models yields an annualized out-of-sample Sharpe ratio after transaction costs of 3.23 and 3.12, respectively. In comparison, the buy-and-hold benchmark market portfolio strategy only yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.33.

How does the creditor conflict affect bond IPO underpricing?,2021,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106962291&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2021.03.002&partnerID=40&md5=647da56b6e48fc26451a187b0cb8d1c6,"In this paper, we find that the conflict of interest between loan holders and bondholders is positively related to bond IPO underpricing, which serves as a compensation to the initial bond investors. We construct four proxies for the conflict between loan holders and bondholders, namely, a loan covenants index, the outstanding loan amount, the number of lead banks, and the loan remaining maturity. Our empirical tests show that all four variables are positively related to bond IPO underpricing, indicating that the loan structure of firms has a real impact on the pricing of their bond IPOs. © 2021 The Authors",Bond IPO; Underpricing,

Futures on the VSTOXX index can, therefore, be used to hedge against economic uncertainty. We investigate the effect of trader inventory on the price of VSTOXX futures through a combination of stochastic processes and machine learning methods. We formulate a simple and efficient pricing methodology for VSTOXX futures, which assumes a Heston-type stochastic process for the underlying EURO STOXX 50 market. Under these dynamics, approximate analytical formulas for the implied volatility smile and the VSTOXX index have recently been derived. We use the EURO STOXX 50 option implied volatilities and the VSTOXX index value to estimate the parameters of this Heston model. Following the calibration, we calculate theoretical VSTOXX futures prices and compare them to the actual market prices. While theoretical and market prices are usually in line, we also observe time periods, during which the market price does not agree with our Heston model. We collect a variety of market features that could potentially explain the price deviations and calibrate two machine learning models to the price difference: a regularized linear model and a random forest. We find that both models indicate a strong influence of accumulated trader positions on the VSTOXX futures price. © 2021 The Author",Derivatives pricing; Heston model; Machine learning; Trader inventory,

This prediction is a challenging problem due to the following requirements: to incorporate various non-financial factors and to address the lack of negative samples. Concerning the former, we proposed including a network feature that represented the importance of an acquirer and an acquiree in the investment and category networks, as well as a company relation feature associated with their similarity and closeness. Considering the latter requirement, as negative examples, we set the pairs of acquirers and acquirees with the features that were similar to those of positive examples. This allowed learning minor differences between the companies selected for acquisition and the candidate ones. We evaluated our proposed prediction model using 2000–2018 acquisition logs collected from CrunchBase. Based on the analysis of the high SHapley additive explanation (SHAP) value features, we found that the newly considered network and company relation features had high significance (10 out of 22 top key features). We also clarified how these novel features contributed to the prediction of acquisition occurrence by interpreting the SHAP value. © 2021 The Authors",Acquisition prediction; CrunchBase; Machine learning; SHAP value interpretation,

Business adoption of a PD model, however, needs to factor in the long-established business/regulatory conventions built around letter-based credit ratings. A mapping methodology that converts granular PDs into letter ratings via referencing the historical default experience of some credit rating agency exists in the literature. This paper improves the PD implied rating (PDiR) methodology by targeting the historical credit migration matrix instead of simply default rates. This enhanced PDiR methodology makes it possible to bypass the reliance on arbitrarily extrapolated target default rates for the AAA and AA+ categories, a necessity due to the fact that the historical realized default rates on these two top rating grades are typically zero. © 2021 The Authors",Default; Other-exit; Rating stickiness; Sequential Monte Carlo,

This implies that when an NCP event occurs, existing stock holders can earn a riskless profit through a long-short strategy which sells the underlying stock and buys the convertible bond at the same time, then converts the bond into stocks. Facing short sale constraints, traders not holding any position in the underlying stock can still profit from an overnight trading strategy which buys the convertible bond at the NCP event day t, then sells the converted stock on day t + 1. We also find that the next-day opening prices following NCP events are significantly lower, which is evidence for the stock selling from the overnight trading strategy. Overall, our findings show that investors in China are aware of the NCP events and they earn abnormal returns through active trading. However, it remains as a puzzle why existing stock holders such as institutional investors do not trade away the negative conversion premium through the riskless long-short strategy. © 2020 The Authors,",Arbitrage opportunity; Chinese stock market; Convertible bond; Negative conversion premium; Price pressure,

The applied testing methodology developed in 22 and extended in this paper includes two natural language processing (NLP) techniques – the sentiment analysis and the wordscores model – that are used to convert the text corpora into the NLP indices. These indices are explanatory variables in linear regression, Granger causality test, vector autoregressive model and random forest model. The paper extends this methodology by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the newspaper corpus to filter out articles that discuss topics not relevant for economic and financial analysis. The forecasting test is conducted for two major banks in Poland – BZ WBK and mbank and for major daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita, in Polish. It is shown that mbank narratives have the best forecasting power, while BZ WBK and Rzeczpospolita trade second and third place depending on the model applied. In the vast majority of analyzed cases adding an NLP index to the model improves the forecast accuracy. The answer to the title question is – it depends. Before paying for economic research asset managers are advised to apply methods such as presented in this paper to evaluate whether sell-side research offers any forecasting value in comparison with a newspaper. © 2020 The Authors",Economic research; Forecasting; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Wordscores,

Longer maturity CDS spreads show similar patterns with smaller magnitudes. During normal periods, however, CDS spreads are mostly explained by fundamental variables and rollover risk is not a significant determinant.

In the wake of intense competition and changing global and national business environment, the efficiency issues have emerged as an important pillar of success in the Indian banking sector. Therefore, it is an essential task to comprehend the efficiency levels of the overall Indian banking sector and also across different ownership structures (viz. Public, Private and Foreign). The present study endeavors to carry out an assessment of intra-sector efficiency in the Indian banking sector based on a cross-sectional data of 66 banks for the year 2015-16. The authors employ directional distance function based meta-frontier DEA approach and the results reveal that the Indian banking sector is 73.44% efficient. It also confirms the existence of different production functions across different ownership structures of the industry. Among the different ownership structures, the group frontier of foreign banks coincides with the meta-frontier. The group frontier of private sector banks is the second closest to the meta-frontier and public sector banks are found to be the laggards in the overall industry. The study gains special significance in the backdrop of the recommendations floated by the Reserve Bank of India and Ministry of Finance (Government of India) to consolidate the public sector banks in order to retain fewer but healthier banks. The finding of the study fully support these recommendations and affirms that consolidation in the industry will bring positive synergies and will lead to the enhancement of efficiency levels in the industry. © 2018 The Authors",Banking; DEA; Directional distance function; Efficiency; India; Meta-frontier; Ownership structure,

The data are hard to work with, perhaps by design, and contain both big and small extreme values that are unexpected given their origin. It is unclear how these observations are selected for public release. After the data science exercise of managing and merging the predicted earnings surprises with other freely available public information (specifically ticker symbols and return data), we examine the predicted earnings surprises and investigate how the predicted earnings surprises affect short-term stock prices. We find evidence of a linear association between the predicted earnings surprises and subsequent short-term returns, although the significance is driven by extreme outliers. Most importantly, we use the predicted earnings surprises to form short-term trading strategies. The most profitable trading strategy that exploits the predicted earnings surprises is a contrarian trading strategy. © 2018 The Authors",Data management; Data science; Exploratory data analysis; Pre-dicted earnings surprises; Quantitative finance; Regression analysis; Trading,

With the adoption of author's theoretical works on Lee-oscillator with profound transient-chaotic property, COSMOS effectively integrates chaotic neural oscillator technology into: 1) COSMOS Forecaster - Chaotic FFBP-based Time-series Supervised-learning agent for worldwide financial forecast and; 2) COSMOS Trader - Chaotic RBF-based Actor-Critic Reinforcement-learning agents for the optimization of trading strategies. COSMOS not only provides a fast reinforcement learning and forecast solution, more prominently it successfully resolves the massive data over-training and deadlock problems which usually imposed by traditional recurrent neural networks and RBF networks using classical sigmoid or gaussian-based activation functions. From the implementation perspective, COSMOS is integrated with 2048-trading day time-series financial data and 39 major financial signals as input signals for the real-time prediction and intelligent agent trading of 129 worldwide financial products which consists of: 9 major cryptocurrencies, 84 forex, 19 major commodities and 17 worldwide financial indices. In terms of system performance, past 500-day average daily forecast performance of COSMOS attained less 1% forecast percentage errors and with promising results of 8–13% monthly average returns. © 2019 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Actor-critic reinforcement-learning; Chaotic neural networks; Financial prediction system; Intelligent agent-based trading system; Intelligent agents,

First, using modern portfolio theory, a profile of equity funds and investors is created. Then, the profile of investors in the stock market is applied to the fund market by the idea of transfer learning. Finally, a utility-based recommendation algorithm based on prospect theory is proposed and the performance of the method is verified by testing it on actual transaction data.

A unified treatment of the generalized partial differential system for index and constituent stock options in Theorem 1 illustrates that nonlinear interactive terms emanating from stochastic correlation affect index option price and return essentially different from contributions to the aggregated risks of the constituent stock options. Our study contributes to the growing evidence of priced correlation risk in markets for index and constituent stock options. Theorem 1 illustrates the pricing differential, while Proposition 1 illustrates that the pricing differential produces a quantifiable metric of the measure of the nonlinear interactive terms. The quantifiable metric is constructed from the difference between the model free implied variance of the index and a weighted aggregate of the model free implied variances of the constituent stocks. Proposition 2 identifies that index variance risk premium includes additional significant contributions from the nonlinear interactive risks not present in the aggregated returns of the constituent stocks. The nonlinear interactive risks produce a wedge between the instantaneous expected excess index and aggregated stock option returns. © 2018 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Expected excess option return; Risk premium; Stochastic correlation; Stock index option; System of PDE; Systematic equity risk,

To do this, firstly, I have mathematically broadened the scope of the two mostly used formulas of daily return by including daily dividend. Next, I have developed a couple of daily dividend estimation models from both pre and post stockholders' perspective. While developing those models, I have functionally used the compounding factors of time value theory. Finally, I have empirically examined the statistical robustness of Model-1. The findings of the study revealed that inclusion of daily dividend significantly increased the daily and monthly arithmetic and logarithmic returns of the securities. However, after inclusion of daily dividend, the long run variances of the both arithmetic return series remains same whereas the long run variances of both logarithmic return series significantly turns down to around zero percent direct a sharp decline of the risk of logarithmic return. Moreover, after inclusion of daily dividend the Value at Risk (VaR) of the daily logarithmic return declines sharply validates Model 1 for computing the daily logarithmic return. © 2018 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Arithmetic return; Daily dividend; Logarithmic return,
Return smoothing and its implications for performance analysis of hedge funds,2018,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090983487&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2018.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=ddb98afdab6008bd3fee802c66eac463,"Return smoothing and performance persistence are both sources of autocorrelation in hedge fund returns. The practice of pre-processing the data in order to remove smoothing before conducting performance analysis also affects the predictability of hedge fund returns. This paper develops a Bayesian framework for the performance evaluation of hedge funds that simultaneously accounts for smoothing, time-varying performance and factor loadings, and the short-lived nature of reported returns. Simulation evidence reveals that “unsmoothing” predictable, persistent hedge fund returns reduces the ability to detect performance persistence in the second step of the analysis. Empirically, smoothing generates severe biases in standard estimates of abnormal performance, factor loadings, and idiosyncratic volatility. In particular, for funds with high systematic risk, a standard deviation increase in smoothing implies an upward bias in α in excess of 2% annually and a downward bias in equity market beta of more than 20%. For funds with low systematic risk exposure, the smoothing bias is most apparent in estimates of idiosyncratic volatility. © 2018 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Bayesian model; Hedge funds; Performance persistence; Smoothing,

Pattern recognition of financial data using an effective combination of these two types of information is of much interest nowadays, and is addressed in several academic disciplines as well as by practitioners. Recent literature has focused much effort on the use of news-derived information to predict the direction of movement of a stock, i.e. posed as a classification problem, or the precise value of a future asset price, i.e. posed as a regression problem. Here, we show that information extracted from news sources is better at predicting the direction of underlying asset volatility movement, or its second order statistics, rather than its direction of price movement. We show empirical results by constructing machine learning models of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to represent information from news feeds, and simple naïve Bayes classifiers to predict the direction of movements. Empirical results show that the average directional prediction accuracy for volatility, on arrival of new information, is 56%, while that of the asset close price is no better than random at 49%. We evaluate these results using a range of stocks and stock indices in the US market, using a reliable news source as input. We conclude that volatility movements are more predictable than asset price movements when using financial news as machine learning input, and hence could potentially be exploited in pricing derivatives contracts via quantifying volatility. © 2018 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Computational finance; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Technical analysis; Volatility forecasting,

Although the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that it is not possible to anticipate market movements consistently, the use of computationally intensive systems that employ machine learning algorithms is increasingly common in the development of stock trading mechanisms. Several studies, using daily stock prices, have presented predictive system applications trained on fixed periods without considering new model updates. In this context, this study uses a machine learning technique called Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices for large and small capitalisations and in three different markets, employing prices with both daily and up-to-the-minute frequencies. Prediction errors are measured, and the model is compared to the random walk model proposed by the EMH. The results suggest that the SVR has predictive power, especially when using a strategy of updating the model periodically.

The model obtained from game theory is used in four private banks. The results indicate that the profit of banks is higher with coalition than acting alone in the market and it would continue with the increasing demand and the presence of more banks.

The role of credit in Pakistan's agricultural sector,2017,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058480248&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2017.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=f665612b0a4c514cf399e99b5cdeda58,"The aim of this study was to use an econometric analysis to investigate the relationship between the agricultural gross domestic product (AGDP) and variables, such as total food production, cropped area, loan disbursed by ZTBL, cooperative loan and total loan disbursed by various institutions in Pakistan. Data were explored from 1960 to 2015; we used time series data collected from secondary sources, including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Statistical Year Books and the Economic Survey of Pakistan. Data were analysed using the Phillips–Perron (P–P) test, and the results were interpreted using the Johansen Co-integration test. We found that total food production, loan disbursed by ZTBL and the total loan disbursed by various institutions had a positive and significant influence on the AGDP, whereas cropped area and cooperatives loan had a negative but insignificant influence on the AGDP. Based on our results, we suggest that the Government of Pakistan formulate and initiate new policies and funding schemes for the development and improvement of the agricultural sector. © 2017 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Agricultural GDP; Cooperatives; Food production; Loan schemes; ZTBL,
The extent of voluntary disclosure and its determinants in emerging markets: Evidence from Egypt,2017,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060552872&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2017.09.005&partnerID=40&md5=0e3f27df8804736318f12fd468bc0cd9,"The primary objective of this study is to test a theoretical framework relating eight major corporate governance determinants with the extent of the voluntary disclosure provided by listed firms listed on Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX). These corporate governance determinants are firm size, firm profitability, firm leverage, board size, independent directors, duality in position, block-holder ownership and Auditor Type. Using a weighted relative disclosure index for measuring voluntary disclosure, the results indicate that there is a positive significant correlation between firm size, firm profitability, firm leverage, independent directors on board, and auditor type, and the overall corporate governance voluntary disclosure extent. This result implies that these variables are the main voluntary disclosure drivers in Egypt. However, a negative significant correlation was found between block-holder ownership and voluntary disclosure, while no significant correlation was found between board size, and duality in position, and the overall corporate governance voluntary disclosure extent. The empirical proof from this study promotes the perception of the voluntary corporate disclosure environment in Egypt as one of the emerging markets in the Middle East. © 2017 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Corporate governance; Egypt; Firm characteristics; Voluntary disclosure,

A structural break heavy-tailed heterogeneous autoregressive model under the heterogeneous market hypothesis specification is employed to capture the stylized facts of high-frequency empirical data. Using selected averaging forecast methods, the forecast weights are assigned based on the simple average, simple median, least squares and mean square error. The empirical results indicated that the combination of forecasts in general shown superiority under four evaluation criteria regardless which proxy is set as the actual volatility. As a conclusion, we summarized that the forecast performance is influenced by three factors namely the types of volatility proxy, forecast methods (individual or averaging forecast) and lastly the type of actual forecast value used in the evaluation criteria. © 2017 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Combine forecast methods; Heterogeneous autoregressive models; Realized volatility,

It remains a question on whether realized volatility (RV) models that incorporate the use of intraday data produce better VaR forecasts compared to methodologies that are based solely on daily returns. This study provides extensive comparison of out-of-sample volatility and VaR forecast performance on three equity market indices: S&P500, FTSE100, and DAX30 using 13 risk models that consist of 5 GARCH specifications, 4 ARFIMAX specifications and 4 HARX specifications. The out-of-sample volatility forecasts are evaluated by various loss functions and simple scoring procedures in order to identity the model that produces the overall best volatility forecasts. For VaR forecasts, the models are evaluated using a two-stage backtesting procedure where the models undergo unconditional and conditional coverage tests to eliminate underperforming models and the qualified models are then evaluated using the quadratic probability score (QPS) function that is computed based on various VaR loss functions. The results showed that RV models outperform GARCH models for volatility forecasts, but a simple EGARCH model outperforms the rest models for most of the VaR forecasts. The results also indicated that capturing the asymmetric behavior of volatility dynamics is essential for accurate volatility and VaR forecasts. The findings of this study provide useful information for market risk regulation, financial risk management and further investigations such as extension to derivative markets and options pricing. © 2016 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",ARFIMA; GARCH; HAR; Realized volatility; Value-at-risk; Volatility forecasting,

The normally used TSK-type feedforward fuzzy neural network is unable to take the full advantage of the use of the linear fuzzy rule base in accurate input–output mapping and hence the consequent part of the rule base is made nonlinear using polynomial or arithmetic basis functions. Further the Chebyshev polynomial functions provide an expanded nonlinear transformation to the input space thereby increasing its dimension for capturing the nonlinearities and chaotic variations in financial or energy market data streams. Also the locally recurrent neuro-fuzzy information system (LRNFIS) includes feedback loops both at the firing strength layer and the output layer to allow signal flow both in forward and backward directions, thereby making the LRNFIS mimic a dynamic system that provides fast convergence and accuracy in predicting time series fluctuations. Instead of using forward and backward least mean square (FBLMS) learning algorithm, an improved Firefly-Harmony search (IFFHS) learning algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the consequent part and feedback loop parameters for better stability and convergence. Several real world financial and energy market time series databases are used for performance validation of the proposed LRNFIS model. © 2016 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Chebyshev polynomials; Currency exchange rate prediction; Electricity price forecasting; Firefly optimization; Harmony search algorithm; Locally recurrent neuro-fuzzy network; Stock price prediction; TSK fuzzy rules,

In this paper, we review the development of data representation learning methods. Specifically, we investigate both traditional feature learning algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The history of data representation learning is introduced, while available online resources (e.g., courses, tutorials and books) and toolboxes are provided.

In this approach three individual adaptive structures such as adaptive moving average (AMA), adaptive auto regressive moving average (AARMA) and feedback radial basis function network (FRBF) are employed to first train with conventional LMS, conventional forward-backward LMS and corresponding learning algorithm of FRBF respectively. After successful validation of each model the output obtained by each individual model is optimally weighted using Genetic algorithm (GA) as well as particle swarm optimization (PSO) based techniques to produce the best possible different days ahead prediction accuracy. Finally the results of prediction obtained of the NAV values are compared with the results obtained by individual predictors as well as by other four existing ensemble schemes. It is in general demonstrated that in all cases the proposed forecasting scheme outperforms other competitive methods. © 2016 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Adaptive ARMA; Adaptive moving average (MA); Ensemble modelling and particle swarm optimization; Feedback radial basis function network; Net asset value (NAV) prediction,

The forecasting exercise is done for financial assets including seven stock indices (Dow Jones, Nasdaq100, S&P 500, DAX30, CAC40, FTSE100 and Nikkei 225) and three exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar (the GBP- USD, YEN-USD and Euro-USD). Because all return series are skewed and fat tailed, each conditional volatility model is estimated under a skewed Student distribution. Consistent with the idea that the accuracy of VaR estimates are sensitive to the adequacy of the volatility model used, h-step-ahead VaR forecasts are based on the skewed Student-t AR(1)-FIAPARCH (1,d,1). This model can jointly accounts for the salient features of financial time series. Our findings reveal that the skewed Student AR (1) FIAPARCH (1.d.1) relatively outperforms the other models in out-of-sample forecasts for one, five and fifteen day forecast horizons. However, there is no difference for the AR (1) FIGARCH (1.d.1) and AR (1) HYGARCH (1.d.1) models since they have the same forecasting ability. Results indicate also that skewed Student-t FIAPARCH (1,d,1) model provides more accurate one-day-ahead VaR forecasts for both long and short trading positions than those generated using alternative horizons (5-day and 15-day-ahead). This result holds for each of the financial time series. © 2016 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Forecasting volatility; Long-range memory; Skewed student distribution; Value-at-Risk,

Auto insurance fraud detection using unsupervised spectral ranking for anomaly,2016,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022345259&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2016.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=0a50317502dd0a9e693478e289318adf,"For many data mining problems, obtaining labels is costly and time consuming, if not practically infeasible. In addition, unlabeled data often includes categorical or ordinal features which, compared with numerical features, can present additional challenges. We propose a new unsupervised spectral ranking method for anomaly (SRA). We illustrate that the spectral optimization in SRA can be viewed as a relaxation of an unsupervised SVM problem. We demonstrate that the first non-principal eigenvector of a Laplacian matrix is linked to a bi-class classification strength measure which can be used to rank anomalies. Using the first non-principal eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix directly, the proposed SRA generates an anomaly ranking either with respect to the majority class or with respect to two main patterns. The choice of the ranking reference can be made based on whether the cardinality of the smaller class (positive or negative) is sufficiently large. Using an auto insurance claim data set but ignoring labels when generating ranking, we show that our proposed SRA significantly surpasses existing outlier-based fraud detection methods. Finally we demonstrate that, while proposed SRA yields good performance for a few similarity measures for the auto insurance claim data, notably ones based on the Hamming distance, choosing appropriate similarity measures for a fraud detection problem remains crucial. © 2016 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Fraud detection; Kernels; One-class svm; Rare class ranking; Similarity measure; Spectral clustering; Unsupervised learning,

Our pricing formula consists of a Black-Scholes-Merton type formula and a finite sum with the estimation of the remainder term. Moreover, we present explicitly a method to compute each term in our pricing formula. The hedging formulas (greek letters) for the arithmetic Asian options are obtained as well. Our formulas for the long lasting question on pricing and hedging arithmetic Asian options are easy to implement with enough accuracy. Our numerical illustration shows that the arithmetic Asian options worths less than the European options under the standard Black-Scholes assumptions, verifies theoretically that the volatility of the arithmetic average is less than the one of the underlying assets, and also discovers an interesting phenomena that the arithmetic Asian option for large fixed strikes such as stocks has higher volatility (elasticity) than the plain European option. However, the elasticity of the arithmetic Asian options for small fixed strikes as trading in currencies and commodity products is much less than the elasticity of the plain European option. These findings are consistent with the ones from the hedgings with respect to the time to expiration, the strike, the present underlying asset price, the interest rate and the volatility. © 2016",Arithmetic Asian option; Cumulant; Edgworth series expansion; Elasticity; Hedge,
Big data based fraud risk management at Alibaba,2015,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987841602&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2015.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=d7df1506fb0bcce8754cb0f00d9d1637,"With development of mobile internet and finance, fraud risk comes in all shapes and sizes. This paper is to introduce the Fraud Risk Management at Alibaba under big data. Alibaba has built a fraud risk monitoring and management system based on real-time big data processing and intelligent risk models. It captures fraud signals directly from huge amount data of user behaviors and network, analyzes them in real-time using machine learning, and accurately predicts the bad users and transactions. To extend the fraud risk prevention ability to external customers, Alibaba also built up a big data based fraud prevention product called AntBuckler. AntBuckler aims to identify and prevent all flavors of malicious behaviors with flexibility and intelligence for online merchants and banks. By combining large amount data of Alibaba and customers', AntBuckler uses the RAIN score engine to quantify risk levels of users or transactions for fraud prevention. It also has a user-friendly visualization UI with risk scores, top reasons and fraud connections. © 2015 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Big data analysis; Fraud detection and prevention; Malicious behavior; Risk model; Risk score,
Required Market Risk Premium among countries in 2012,2015,Journal of Finance and Data Science,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054320602&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfds.2015.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=210f92787b7ce7d3a7587cfb37c85140,"This paper contains the statistics of the Equity Premium or Market Risk Premium (MRP) used in 2012 for 82 countries. We got 7192 answers for 93 countries, but we only report the results for 82 countries with more than 5 answers. Most previous surveys have been interested in the Expected MRP, but this survey asks about the Required MRP. The paper also contains the references used to justify the MRP. The great dispersion of the answers to the survey shows that the assumption of a representative investor (or homogeneous expectations …) has little to do with the real world. This survey also links with the Equity Premium Puzzle. It may be explained by the fact that many market participants use historical data and advice from textbooks and finance professors. Consequently, ex-ante equity premia have been high, most market prices have been consistently undervalued, and the ex-post risk premia has been also high. Many investors use historical data and textbook prescriptions to estimate the required and the expected equity premium, the undervaluation and the high ex-post risk premium are self fulfilling prophecies. © 2015 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Equity premium; Expected equity premium; Historical equity premium; Market risk premium; Required equity premium,

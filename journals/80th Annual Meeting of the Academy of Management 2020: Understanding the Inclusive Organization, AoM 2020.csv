During this time, employers experimented with practices, like merit-based pay increases, that seemed likely to raise pay. We argue on the contrary that merit pay weakened organizational constraints that previously boosted wages. First, merit pay practices loosen pay fairness constraints. Second, merit pay substitutes for efficiency wages, by providing an alternative mechanism through which employers can elicit worker effort. We introduce new establishment-by-occupation microdata covering the critical early period of wage stagnation.

It draws on elite interviews and documentary sources to explore how the founders of these markets sought to legitimize them as stable, durable venues for security trade. The study uses insights from the STS-inflected study of markets to present an account of legitimacy as embedded in taken-for-granted socio-material structures. We term this phenomenon 'silent legitimacy'. Contributing to a nascent 'material turn' in institutional theory, we argue that the markets-as-institutions literature can be strengthened through attention to the mundane material dimensions of institutional fields. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

While high humility is often associated with effective leadership and constructive behavior, it may also inhibit entrepreneurial action and generative behavior. Our findings show that early-stage investors perceive that humble entrepreneurs have higher constructive qualities and are more compatible with investors than non-humble entrepreneurs. Expressed humility has an overall positive effect on investors' evaluations of the venture's likelihood of success and their willingness to fund the venture. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

Follow-up studies using different methodologies and time periods found much larger corporate effects. Replicating Rumelt's methodology reveals that the original study's results can be reproduced, however, corporate effects have been gradually increasing in importance since the 1980s and are now larger than industry effects. This implies that multi-business firms today should be more concerned with building corporate advantages rather than simply operating in good industries. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

It develops concepts from Durkheim's Division of Labour to advance theoretical understanding of the relationship between individual connectivity and emergence of a coherent network society. Adoption of emerging technologies poses novel legal, ethical and societal challenges: requisite legislation and social norms to deal with their consequences have not yet been established, raising the risk that irresponsible exploitation of new capabilities may undermine social stability. Durkheim's concepts help elucidate how we can mitigate that risk by maintaining social cohesion in the absence of established norms. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

Drawing upon over four years of data we illustrate the critical role of PC 'breach' in triggering sensemaking and sensegiving activity, reinforcing the status quo, and maintaining the explicit PC. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

Based on primary survey data from the largest Italian firms, our empirical tests show that board human capital diversity is a valuable resource enhancing board strategic involvement and subsequent firm performance. Our results illustrate that both perceived and actual board diversity can contribute to board strategic involvement by influencing board processes such as effort norms, use of knowledge and skills and cognitive conflict. However, both types of diversity have differential effect on board processes and performance. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

We studied specific instances in these diary entries where the entrepreneurs reported sensebreaking - the creation of a meaning void - and subsequent sensemaking through their interaction with different stakeholders within and outside the incubator. We describe novel sensemaking that follows sensebreaking via three different mechanisms namely, reframing, redirecting and questioning.

We develop a complementary perspective of the innovation process in which inventors go beyond idea generation to attracting resources towards commercializing their breakthrough inventions. Using historical case studies of how Xerox inventors worked to commercialize office workstations, personal computers, and laser printers, we show that attracting resources required inventors to navigate a set of evaluation criteria used by Xerox managers. In so doing, we highlight two approaches deployed by Xerox inventors-searching for more favorable evaluation criteria and shaping the evaluation criteria. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

In this article, we illuminate how improving the understanding of consumption dynamics within organizations can enable us to take an original scientific approach to accurately estimating a firm's corporate sustainability. To apply the lens of consumption to business, we perform a rigorous integration of the interrelated attention-based view, sensemaking, and the ethical decision-making process. Our findings facilitate an organizational model of consumption and the overconsumption theory of the firm, with implications for the managerial level and beyond. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

Drawing on the folk concept theory of intentionality (Malle, 2011), we suggest that employees' perceptions of the organizations' intentions behind resource provisions have the strongest influence among these factors on social exchange quality. Our three-wave field study showed significant relationships among the organization's provisions of resources, benevolent goal attributions, and change in key markers of social exchange quality. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

In this study we use bibliometric analyses of management research on climate change to understand how management scholars have navigated interdisciplinarity, and what impact their efforts had on top-tier climate change research. We find that management scholarship (1) features substantial engagement with an interdisciplinary knowledge base through backward references, and (2) fails to attract the attention of climate change research in top-tier interdisciplinary journals, as evidenced in very low and stagnant forward citations. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

We also examine the masculinist subtext behind supposedly gender-neutral leadership speak by comparing a best-selling women's leadership book with an equally prominent gender-neutral text. We argue that over-attention to women's leadership as a special case can undermine the very empowerment women's leadership discourse seeks to promote. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

These boundary spanners need to cultivate external search openness by searching broadly and deeply across knowledge sources. This study adopts a temporal perspective to identify search trajectories and systematically analyze the extent to which both external search breadth and depth can be explained by differences within individuals versus differences between individuals. Adopting an attention-based view, we investigate the influence of organizational context and context changes on individual-level search openness trajectories and explore performance implications of such trajectories. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

We build our theory exploiting the fundamental tension in the technology factor market. We argue that the degree of the rareness of a technological resource has an inverted U-shape relationship with the economic value of the resource and the sustainability of that value. We apply a text analysis method to U.S. nanotechnology patents to capture the rareness. Our results provide robust support for our hypotheses.

Using justice-based and consent-based social contract theory, we theorize that CSR at global and local levels improves the degree that a local community grants a SL to a multinational company (MNC), but this degree is moderated by the political division of diverse stakeholder groups within the community. Considering SL as a continuum of emotions, specifically trust versus anger, we use such natural language processing and big data techniques as sentiment and emotion analysis to operationalize SL. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

We investigate incivility's impact on willingness to voice, exploring the effectiveness of amplification (public endorsement of another person's contribution, with attribution to the original contributor) as an intervention. In two online experiments (N = 2,188), we manipulated the incivility and amplification experienced by participants and found that, whereas incivility decreases willingness to voice, amplification restores it. These results indicate a brief intervention can increase willingness to voice in uncivil groups. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

The goal of creating societal impacts is particularly salient in academic spin-offs (ASOs) seeking to commercialize scientific research. Building on the behavioral theory of the firm, we hypothesize that the initial goals of ASOs influence resource mobilization and performance. Using a unique longitudinal dataset of 275 ASOs in Norway, we find that initial goal orientation is a predictor of resource mobilization behavior and performance.

We argue that conceiving of institutions in this way limits the role they can play in addressing conflict. We draw from work by political theorist Chantal Mouffe on agonism, applying it to business ethics. We develop the notion of agonistic business responsibility, which overcomes existing limitations in the literature by legitimizing stakeholder voices and recognizing that greater corporate legitimacy could arise through contestation. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

What has been forgotten, however, is that nearly 20 years before Janis' supposed invention, groupthink was created by William H. Whyte, author of one of the 1950s' most influential and popular books on management. We investigate how Whyte's link to groupthink became invisible to management's history, why this matters, and how recovering Whyte's ideas can provide critical new insights. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

Our findings suggest that several mechanisms and processes contribute to the creation of a context that favors dialogue: self-selection, training, facilitation, a space for managing tensions, and agonism. The commitment to making use of consent/consensus-seeking processes in this context can direct members towards deliberative processes that induce productive dialogue. © 80th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2020: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2020.

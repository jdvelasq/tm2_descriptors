SummerTime: Variable-length Time Series Summarization with Application to Physical Activity Analysis,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146426980&doi=10.1145%2f3532628&partnerID=40&md5=a493e6726eab1a4fa00f244b0f939c19,"SummerTime seeks to summarize global time-series signals and provides a fixed-length, robust representation of the variable-length time series. Many machine learning methods depend on data instances with a fixed number of features. As a result, those methods cannot be directly applied to variable-length time series data. Existing methods such as sliding windows can lose minority local information. Summarization conducted by the SummerTime method will be a fixed-length feature vector which can be used in place of the time series dataset for use with classical machine learning methods. We use Gaussian Mixture models (GMM) over small same-length disjoint windows in the time series to group local data into clusters. The time series' rate of membership for each cluster will be a feature in the summarization. By making use of variational methods, GMM converges to a more robust mixture, meaning the clusters are more resistant to noise and overfitting. Further, the model is naturally capable of converging to an appropriate cluster count. We validate our method on a challenging real-world dataset, an imbalanced physical activity dataset with a variable-length time series structure. We compare our results to state-of-the-art studies and show high-quality improvement by classifying with only the summarization.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",classification; clustering; regression; summarization; Time series,Machine learning; Time series analysis; Activity analysis; Clusterings; Gaussian Mixture Model; Global time; Machine learning methods; Physical activity; Regression; Summarization; Times series; Variable length; accuracy; Article; autocorrelation; energy expenditure; human; indirect calorimetry; physical activity; priority journal; reading; sensitivity and specificity; total quality management; video game; walking; Time series
Multimodal Fusion of Smart Home and Text-based Behavior Markers for Clinical Assessment Prediction,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146431747&doi=10.1145%2f3531231&partnerID=40&md5=b72b14a702040daf561e27e81b78064f,"New modes of technology are offering unprecedented opportunities to unobtrusively collect data about people's behavior. While there are many use cases for such information, we explore its utility for predicting multiple clinical assessment scores. Because clinical assessments are typically used as screening tools for impairment and disease, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), automatically mapping behavioral data to assessment scores can help detect changes in health and behavior across time. In this article, we aim to extract behavior markers from two modalities, a smart home environment and a custom digital memory notebook app, for mapping to 10 clinical assessments that are relevant for monitoring MCI onset and changes in cognitive health. Smart-home-based behavior markers reflect hourly, daily, and weekly activity patterns, while app-based behavior markers reflect app usage and writing content/style derived from free-form journal entries. We describe machine learning techniques for fusing these multimodal behavior markers and utilizing joint prediction. We evaluate our approach using three regression algorithms and data from 14 participants with MCI living in a smart-home environment. We observed moderate to large correlations between predicted and ground-truth assessment scores, ranging from r = 0.601 to r = 0.871 for each clinical assessment.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Behavior markers; clinical assessment prediction; natural language processing; smart homes,Automation; Diagnosis; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Behavior marker; Clinical assessment prediction; Clinical assessments; Cognitive impairment; Home environment; Language processing; Multi-modal fusion; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Smart homes; aged; algorithm; Article; behavior; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; Coping Self Efficacy Scale; data extraction; Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Design Fluency Test; Delis-Kaplan executive function system; digital technology; disease marker; female; Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form; home environment; human; Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Compensation Scale; machine learning; male; memory; mild cognitive impairment; patient monitoring; prediction; priority journal; Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire; Quality of Life Scale Alzheimer Disease; Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status; Satisfaction with Life Scale; scoring system; self report; Wechsler Test of Adult Reading; writing; Forecasting
A Critical Review of Multimodal-multisensor Analytics for Anxiety Assessment,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146416375&doi=10.1145%2f3556980&partnerID=40&md5=edc8aab34993d712d70a070ff50639ba,"Recently, interest has grown in the assessment of anxiety that leverages human physiological and behavioral data to address the drawbacks of current subjective clinical assessments. Complex experiences of anxiety vary on multiple characteristics, including triggers, responses, duration and severity, and impact differently on the risk of anxiety disorders. This article reviews the past decade of studies that objectively analyzed various anxiety characteristics related to five common anxiety disorders in adults utilizing features of cardiac, electrodermal, blood pressure, respiratory, vocal, posture, movement, and eye metrics. Its originality lies in the synthesis and interpretation of consistently discovered heterogeneous predictors of anxiety and multimodal-multisensor analytics based on them. We reveal that few anxiety characteristics have been evaluated using multimodal-multisensor metrics, and many of the identified predictive features are confounded. As such, objective anxiety assessments are not yet complete or precise. That said, few multimodal-multisensor systems evaluated indicate an approximately 11.73% performance gain compared to unimodal systems, highlighting a promising powerful tool. We suggest six high-priority future directions to address the current gaps and limitations in infrastructure, basic knowledge, and application areas. Action in these directions will expedite the discovery of rich, accurate, continuous, and objective assessments and their use in impactful end-user applications.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"My Health Sensor, My Classifier - Adapting a Trained Classifier to Unlabeled End-User Data",2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146420900&doi=10.1145%2f3559767&partnerID=40&md5=6e4c7fb629aa53085b5ab18c84a273c0,"Sleep apnea is a common yet severely under-diagnosed sleep related disorder. Unattended sleep monitoring at home with low-cost sensors can be leveraged for condition detection, and Machine Learning offers a generalized solution for this task. However, patient characteristics, lack of sufficient training data, and other factors can imply a domain shift between training and end-user data and reduced task performance. In this work, we address this issue with the aim to achieve personalization based on the patient's needs. We present an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) solution with the constraint that labeled source data are not directly available. Instead, a classifier trained on the source data is provided. Our solution iteratively labels target data sub-regions based on classifier beliefs, and trains new classifiers from the expanding dataset. Experiments with sleep monitoring datasets and various sensors show that our solution outperforms the classifier trained on the source domain, with a kappa coefficient improvement from 0.012 to 0.242. Additionally, we apply our solution to digit classification DA between three well-established datasets, to investigate its generalizability, and allow for related work comparisons. Even without direct access to the source data, it outperforms several well-established UDA methods in these datasets.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",domain-adaptation; Machine learning; neural networks; personalization; sensors; Sleep apnea,Classification (of information); Iterative methods; Sleep research; Domain adaptation; End-users; Low-cost sensors; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Personalizations; Sleep apnea; Sleep monitoring; Source data; User data; Article; classifier; computer analysis; controlled study; human; machine learning; priority journal; sleep disordered breathing; Machine learning
Leveraging Mobile Sensing and Bayesian Change Point Analysis to Monitor Community-scale Behavioral Interventions: A Case Study on COVID-19,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146417061&doi=10.1145%2f3524886&partnerID=40&md5=8975ac717dc726c20749814a6111aa55,"During pandemics, effective interventions require monitoring the problem at different scales and understanding the various tradeoffs between efficacy, privacy, and economic burden. To address these challenges, we propose a framework where we perform Bayesian change-point analysis on aggregate behavior markers extracted from mobile sensing data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results generated by 598 participants for up to four months reveal rich insights: We observe an increase in smartphone usage around February 10th, followed by an increase in email usage around February 27th and, finally, a large reduction in participant's mobility around March 13th. These behavior changes overlapped with important news events and government directives such as the naming of COVID-19, a spike in the number of reported cases in Europe, and the declaration of national emergency by President Trump. We also show that our detected change points align with changes in large scale external sources, including number of COVID-19 tweets, COVID-19 search traffic, and a large-scale foot traffic data collected by SafeGraph, providing further validation of our method. Our results show promise towards the feasibility of using mobile sensing to understand communities' responses to public health interventions.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",behavior change; change-point detection; Datasets; mobile sensing,Bayesian; Behavioral interventions; Behaviour changes; Case-studies; Change point detection; Change-point analysis; Dataset; Large-scales; Mobile sensing; Privacy and economics; Article; Bayes theorem; coronavirus disease 2019; human; priority journal; COVID-19
Passive and Context-Aware In-Home Vital Signs Monitoring Using Co-Located UWB-Depth Sensor Fusion,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144603570&doi=10.1145%2f3549941&partnerID=40&md5=080d3b82003870d2d74c687abf7476fa,"Basic vital signs such as heart and respiratory rates (HR and RR) are essential bio-indicators. Their longitudinal in-home collection enables prediction and detection of disease onset and change, providing for earlier health intervention. In this article, we propose a robust, non-touch vital signs monitoring system using a pair of co-located Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and depth sensors. By extensive manual examination, we identify four typical temporal and spectral signal patterns and their suitable vital sign estimators. We devise a probabilistic weighted framework (PWF) that quantifies evidence of these patterns to update the weighted combination of estimator output to track the vital signs robustly. We also design a ""heatmap""-based signal quality detector to exclude the disturbed signal from inadvertent motions. To monitor multiple co-habiting subjects in-home, we build a two-branch long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to distinguish between individuals and their activities, providing activity context crucial to disambiguating critical from normal vital sign variability. To achieve reliable context annotation, we carefully devise the feature set of the consecutive skeletal poses from the depth data, and develop a probabilistic tracking model to tackle non-line-of-sight (NLOS) cases. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of the individual modules as well as the end-to-end system for passive and context-aware vital sign monitoring.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",longitudinal in-home monitoring; Non-touch vital signs monitoring; passive sensing,Patient monitoring; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Co-located; Context-Aware; Home monitoring; Longitudinal in-home monitoring; Non-touch vital sign monitoring; Passive sensing; Ultra-wide; Vital sign; Vital signs monitoring; Wide-band; accuracy; breathing rate; classifier; Conference Paper; heart rate measurement; human; long short term memory network; prediction; priority journal; signal detection; signal processing; vital sign; Long short-term memory
Interpretable Bias Mitigation for Textual Data: Reducing Genderization in Patient Notes While Maintaining Classification Performance,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140732696&doi=10.1145%2f3524887&partnerID=40&md5=7ab3833e79cbb425264751f8b25f60c0,"Medical systems in general, and patient treatment decisions and outcomes in particular, can be affected by bias based on gender and other demographic elements. As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models - statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how differences in gender-specific word frequency distributions and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of dataset bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce biases in natural language processing pipelines.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",algorithmic fairness; data augmentation; electronic health records; interpretable machine learning; NLP,Algorithmic languages; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Pipeline processing systems; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Data augmentation; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Interpretable machine learning; Language model; Machine-learning; Textual data; Article; controlled study; degradation; female; frequency; gender bias; human; language; male; natural language processing; priority journal; Patient treatment

However, a significant obstacle to such approaches is that they depend on high-quality annotations generated by domain experts. This study develops and evaluates BioLumin, a novel immersive mixed reality environment that enables users to virtually shrink down to the microscopic level for navigation and annotation of 3D reconstructed images. We discuss how domain experts were consulted in the specification of a pipeline to enable automatic reconstruction of biological models for mixed reality environments, driving the design of a 3DUI system to explore whether such a system allows accurate annotation of complex medical data by non-experts. To examine the usability and feasibility of BioLumin, we evaluated our prototype through a multi-stage mixed-method approach. First, three domain experts offered expert reviews, and subsequently, nineteen non-expert users performed representative annotation tasks in a controlled setting. The results indicated that the mixed reality system was learnable and that non-experts could generate high-quality 3D annotations after a short training session. Lastly, we discuss design considerations for future tools like BioLumin in medical and more general scientific contexts.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",biomedical visualization; human-computer interaction; Immersive technologies; interactive visualization; magic leap; mixed reality; spatial computing,Bioluminescence; Diagnosis; Human computer interaction; Image reconstruction; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Visualization; Biomedical visualization; Domain experts; High quality; Immersive; Immersive technologies; Interactive visualizations; Magic leap; Mixed reality; Mixed-reality environment; Spatial computing; adult; Article; automation; biological model; cell nucleus; computer vision; control system; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; edge detection; experience; eye fixation; feature extraction; feedback system; female; head movement; high throughput imaging; human; human tissue; image segmentation; machine learning; male; medical research; microscopy; omentum; priority journal; process design; three-dimensional imaging; tumor growth; usability; vascular tumor; videorecording; virtual reality; Mixed reality

The issues raised are shown to be widespread, long term, and apparently unrecognized. Problems are traced back to inadequacies in the relevant standards, and, at every stage, regulation through to development, inadequate Software Engineering input. An important finding is that the relevant healthcare standards are inconsistent and written without sufficient rigor to be at all constructive for implementing digital systems.

However, there is more to what an individual eats. While eating patterns form a critical component of their mental well-being, insights and assessments related to the interplay of eating patterns and mental well-being remain under-explored in theory and practice. To bridge this gap, we use an existing real-time eating detection system that captures context during meals to examine how college students' eating context associates with their mental well-being, particularly their affect, anxiety, depression, and stress. Our findings suggest that students' irregularity or skipping meals negatively correlates with their mental well-being, whereas eating with family and friends positively correlates with improved mental well-being.

Evaluating Alarm Classifiers with High-confidence Data Programming,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146419221&doi=10.1145%2f3549942&partnerID=40&md5=bad4c71acfc2243f072449ca439a98ae,"Classification of clinical alarms is at the heart of prioritization, suppression, integration, postponement, and other methods of mitigating alarm fatigue. Since these methods directly affect clinical care, alarm classifiers, such as intelligent suppression systems, need to be evaluated in terms of their sensitivity and specificity, which is typically calculated on a labeled dataset of alarms. Unfortunately, the collection and particularly labeling of such datasets requires substantial effort and time, thus deterring hospitals from investigating mitigations of alarm fatigue. This article develops a lightweight method for evaluating alarm classifiers without perfect alarm labels. The method relies on probabilistic labels obtained from data programming - a labeling paradigm based on combining noisy and cheap-to-obtain labeling heuristics. Based on these labels, the method produces confidence bounds for the sensitivity/specificity values from a hypothetical evaluation with manual labeling. Our experiments on five alarm datasets collected at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia show that the proposed method provides accurate bounds on the classifier's sensitivity/specificity, appropriately reflecting the uncertainty from noisy labeling and limited sample sizes.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",data programming; PAC bounds; Physiological alarms; weak supervision,Alarm systems; Classification (of information); Hospitals; Clinical care; Data programming; High confidence; Labelings; PAC bounds; Physiological alarm; Prioritization; Sensitivity and specificity; Suppression systems; Weak supervision; Article; classifier; computer analysis; computer heuristics; human; noise; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Heuristic methods

This requires multiple sensors to be worn at different locations as well as uncomfortable adhesives and discrete electronic components to be placed on the head. As a result, existing wearables either compromise comfort or compromise accuracy in tracking sleep variables. We propose PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure all the signals required for precise sleep stage tracking and to extract advanced sleep markers such as spindles and K-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography (PSG) and show that it significantly outperforms two commercially-available sleep tracking wearables-Fitbit and Oura Ring. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",EEG; EOG; heart rate; k-complex; respiration; Sleep monitoring; spindle; textile sensors,Brain; Eye movements; Neurophysiology; Sleep research; Wearable sensors; Brain activity; EOG; Heart-rate; K-complex; Physiological signals; Respiration; Robust sensing; Sleep monitoring; Spindle; Textile sensors; arousal; Article; breathing rate; computer analysis; controlled study; electroencephalography; electrooculography; female; heart rate; human; machine learning; male; neuromonitoring; polysomnography; priority journal; sleep; sleep stage; Adhesives
Clean Vibes: Hand Washing Monitoring Using Structural Vibration Sensing,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136939438&doi=10.1145%2f3511890&partnerID=40&md5=686e0487493e38d523a70a90c34cf2c7,"We present a passive and non-intrusive sensing system for monitoring hand washing activity using structural vibration sensing. Proper hand washing is one of the most effective ways to limit the spread and transmission of disease, and has been especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior approaches include direct observation and sensing-based approaches, but are limited in non-clinical settings due to operational restrictions and privacy concerns in sensitive areas such as restrooms. Our work introduces a new sensing modality for hand washing monitoring, which measures hand washing activity-induced vibration responses of sink structures, and uses those responses to monitor the presence and duration of hand washing. Primary research challenges are that vibration responses are similar for different activities, occur on different surfaces/structures, and tend to overlap/coincide. We overcome these challenges by extracting information about signal periodicity for similar activities through cepstrum-based features, leveraging hierarchical learning to differentiate activities on different surfaces, and denoting ""primary/secondary""activities based on their relative frequency and importance. We evaluate our approach using real-world hand washing data across four different sink structures/locations, and achieve an average F1-score for hand washing activities of 0.95, which represents an 8.8X and 10.2X reduction in error over two different baseline approaches. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",hand hygiene; Hand washing; structural vibration sensing,Signal processing; Structural dynamics; Washing; Direct observations; Direct sensing; Hand hygiene; Hand washing; Non-intrusive; Sensing systems; Structural vibration sensing; Structural vibrations; Vibration response; Vibration sensing; Article; deep learning; feature extraction; hand washing; human; monitoring; priority journal; vibration; COVID-19
Flexibility Versus Routineness in Multimodal Health Indicators: A Sensor-based Longitudinal in Situ Study of Information Workers,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141089036&doi=10.1145%2f3514259&partnerID=40&md5=3f5bfa13c106af10486460ded216541a,"Although some research highlights the benefits of behavioral routines for individual functioning, other research indicates that routines can reflect an individual's inflexibility and lower well-being. Given conflicting accounts on the benefits of routine, research is needed to examine how routineness versus flexibility in health-related behaviors correspond to personality traits, health, and occupational outcomes. We adopt a nonlinear dynamical systems approach to understanding routine using automatically sensed health-related behaviors collected from 483 information workers over a roughly two-month period. We utilized multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to derive a measure of health regularity (routineness) from measures of daily step count, sleep duration, and heart rate variability (which relates to stress). Participants also completed measures of personality, health, and job performance at the start of the study and for two months via Ecological Momentary Assessments. Greater regularity was associated with higher neuroticism, lower agreeableness, and greater interpersonal and organizational deviance. Importantly, these results were independent of overall levels of each health indicator in addition to demographics. It is often believed that routine is desirable, but the results suggest that associations with routineness are more nuanced, and wearable sensors can provide insights into beneficial health behaviors. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis; Multimodal; nonlinear dynamics; routine; sensor technology; workplace effectiveness,Dynamical systems; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Wearable sensors; Health indicators; In-Situ Study; Information workers; Multi-modal; Multidimensional recurrence quantification analyse; Recurrence quantification analysis; Routine; Sensor technologies; Well being; Workplace effectiveness; Article; clinical indicator; ecological momentary assessment; health care personnel; heart rate variability; human; medical information; priority journal; recurrence risk; sleep; step count; Health

Early prediction and identification of the children at an elevated risk of developing childhood obesity may help in engaging earlier and more effective interventions to prevent and manage obesity. Most existing predictive tools for childhood obesity primarily rely on traditional regression-type methods using only a few hand-picked features and without exploiting longitudinal patterns of children's data. Deep learning methods allow the use of high-dimensional longitudinal datasets. In this article, we present a deep learning model designed for predicting future obesity patterns from generally available items on children's medical history. To do this, we use a large unaugmented electronic health records dataset from a large pediatric health system in the United States. We adopt a general LSTM network architecture and train our proposed model using both static and dynamic EHR data. To add interpretability, we have additionally included an attention layer to calculate the attention scores for the timestamps and rank features of each timestamp.

Automatic Extraction of Nested Entities in Clinical Referrals in Spanish,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137346329&doi=10.1145%2f3498324&partnerID=40&md5=933ac24918918e7d09cf5b8a24439465,"Here we describe a new clinical corpus rich in nested entities and a series of neural models to identify them. The corpus comprises de-identified referrals from the waiting list in Chilean public hospitals. A subset of 5,000 referrals (58.6% medical and 41.4% dental) was manually annotated with 10 types of entities, six attributes, and pairs of relations with clinical relevance. In total, there are 110,771 annotated tokens. A trained medical doctor or dentist annotated these referrals, and then, together with three other researchers, consolidated each of the annotations. The annotated corpus has 48.17% of entities embedded in other entities or containing another one. We use this corpus to build models for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The best results were achieved using a Multiple Single-entity architecture with clinical word embeddings stacked with character and Flair contextual embeddings. The entity with the best performance is abbreviation, and the hardest to recognize is finding. NER models applied to this corpus can leverage statistics of diseases and pending procedures. This work constitutes the first annotated corpus using clinical narratives from Chile and one of the few in Spanish. The annotated corpus, clinical word embeddings, annotation guidelines, and neural models are freely released to the community. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

An Energy Efficient Health Monitoring Approach with Wireless Body Area Networks,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141030848&doi=10.1145%2f3501773&partnerID=40&md5=657b06b1dc24096826e4ed9d88eafc6c,"Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors subcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate continuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this article, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates ""uninteresting""health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other anomaly detection techniques. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",body area networks; Fault detection; isolation forest; sliding window,Energy efficiency; Health; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Anomaly detection; Bodyarea networks (BAN); Energy; Energy efficient; Faults detection; Health monitoring; Health parameters; Isolation forest; Sliding Window; Wireless body area network; Article; cloud computing; computer analysis; controlled study; energy conservation; health status; human; intensive care unit; medical informatics; online monitoring; outlier detection; priority journal; telehealth; wireless communication; Fault detection
INAP: A Hybrid Approach for NonInvasive Anemia-Polycythemia Detection in the IoMT,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141099526&doi=10.1145%2f3503466&partnerID=40&md5=9fb674b76787b9c6556b826eb8b7d2e8,"The paper presents a novel, self-sufficient, Internet of Medical Things-based model called iNAP to address the shortcomings of anemia and polycythemia detection. The proposed model captures eye and fingernail images using a smartphone camera and automatically extracts the conjunctiva and fingernails as the regions of interest. A novel algorithm extracts the dominant color by analyzing color spectroscopy of the extracted portions and accurately predicts blood hemoglobin level. A less than 11.5 gdL value is categorized as anemia while a greater than 16.5 gdL value as polycythemia. The model incorporates machine learning and image processing techniques allowing easy smartphone implementation. The model predicts blood hemoglobin to an accuracy of 0.33 gdL, a bias of 0.2 gdL, and a sensitivity of 90 compared to clinically tested results on 99 participants. Furthermore, a novel brightness adjustment algorithm is developed, allowing robustness to a wide illumination range and the type of device used. The proposed IoMT framework allows virtual consultations between physicians and patients, as well as provides overall public health information. The model thereby establishes itself as an authentic and acceptable replacement for invasive and clinically-based hemoglobin tests by leveraging the feature of self-anemia and polycythemia diagnosis. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Anemia; cloud; conjunctiva; fingernail; hemoglobin; image processing; internet of medical things; KMeans clustering; non-invasive; polycythemia; region of interest,Blood; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Internet of things; mHealth; Smartphones; hemoglobin; Anemia; Conjunctiva; Fingernail; Haemoglobins; Images processing; Internet of medical thing; K-means++ clustering; Non-invasive; Polycythemia; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; adult; algorithm; anemia; Article; brightness; consultation; controlled study; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; illumination; image processing; internet of things; machine learning; major clinical study; male; physician; polycythemia; priority journal; public health; spectroscopy; Hemoglobin

The design of an optimal computational model that addresses this issue, and at the same time explains the underlying mechanisms that lead to output decisions, is an ongoing challenge. In this study, we focus on assessing the risk of an individual converting to Dementia in the short (next year) and long (one to five years) term, given only a few early-stage observations. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that could assist the prediction of dementia from regular clinical data. The results show that combining various machine learning techniques together can successfully define ways to identify the risks of developing dementia over the following five years with accuracies considerably above average rates. These findings suggest that accurately developed models can be considered as a promising tool to improve early dementia prognosis. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Detecting Smartwatch-Based Behavior Change in Response to a Multi-Domain Brain Health Intervention,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141054717&doi=10.1145%2f3508020&partnerID=40&md5=2faae845063f830f5b6662ea6a239d89,"In this study, we introduce and validate a computational method to detect lifestyle change that occurs in response to a multi-domain healthy brain aging intervention. To detect behavior change, digital behavior markers are extracted from smartwatch sensor data and a permutation-based change detection algorithm quantifies the change in marker-based behavior from a pre-intervention, 1-week baseline. To validate the method, we verify that changes are successfully detected from synthetic data with known pattern differences. Next, we employ this method to detect overall behavior change for n = 28 brain health intervention subjects and n = 17 age-matched control subjects. For these individuals, we observe a monotonic increase in behavior change from the baseline week with a slope of 0.7460 for the intervention group and a slope of 0.0230 for the control group. Finally, we utilize a random forest algorithm to perform leave-one-subject-out prediction of intervention versus control subjects based on digital marker delta values. The random forest predicts whether the subject is in the intervention or control group with an accuracy of 0.87. This work has implications for capturing objective, continuous data to inform our understanding of intervention adoption and impact. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",activity recognition; Behavior change detection; behavior intervention; machine learning from time series,Behavioral research; Brain; Change detection; Decision trees; Activity recognition; Behavior change detection; Behavior intervention; Behaviour changes; Change detection; Health interventions; Machine learning from time series; Machine-learning; Multi-domains; Times series; adult; Article; behavior change; cognitive aging; controlled study; detection algorithm; female; health behavior; human; lifestyle modification; male; middle aged; normal human; pilot study; prediction; priority journal; random forest; validation study; Machine learning

Accurate pose estimation using commodity mobile devices will help early detection and injury assessment of falls, which are essential for the first aid of elderly falls. By following the definition of fall, we propose a Pervasive Pose Estimation scheme for fall detection (PEst), which measures changes in tilt angle and height of the human body. For the tilt measurement, PEst leverages the pointing of the mobile device, e.g., the smartphone, when unlocking to associate the Device coordinate system with the World coordinate system. For the height measurement, PEst exploits the fact that the person's height remains unchanged while walking to calibrate the pressure difference between the device and the floor. We have prototyped and tested PEst in various situations and environments. Our extensive experimental results have demonstrated that PEst can track the body orientation irrespective of which pocket the phone is placed in. More importantly, it enables the phone's barometer to detect falls in various environments with decimeter-level accuracy. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",fall detection; Pervasive; pose estimation; transformation,Gesture recognition; Telephone sets; Accidental injuries; Elderly falls; Estimation schemes; Fall detection; First aids; Injury assessment; Pervasive; Pose-estimation; Transformation; Unintentional injuries; Article; fall risk; falling; human; measurement accuracy; position; priority journal; Fall detection

The main contribution is a novel framework called Machine Assisted Record Selection (MARS). Instead of today's standard practice of relying on human experts to manually decide the order of records for processing, MARS learns the optimal record selection via an online learning algorithm. It further integrates algorithm-based record selection and processing with human-based error resolution to achieve a balanced task allocation between machine and human. Both fixed and adaptive MARS algorithms are proposed, leveraging different statistical knowledge about the existence, quality, and cost associated with the records. Experiments using semi-synthetic data that are generated from real-world patients record processing in the UK national cancer registry are carried out, which demonstrate significant (3 to 4 fold) performance gain over the fixed-order processing.

A Survey on Healthy Food Decision Influences Through Technological Innovations,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126748780&doi=10.1145%2f3494580&partnerID=40&md5=2bebac01dbc18ea19c8a08628f41970c,"It is well known that unhealthy food consumption plays a significant role in dietary and lifestyle-related diseases. Therefore, it is important for researchers to examine methods that may encourage the consumer to consider healthier dietary and lifestyle habits as diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure remain a worldwide issue. One promising approach to influencing healthy dietary and lifestyle habits is food recommendation models that recommend food to users based on various factors such as health effects, nutrition, preferences, and daily habits. Unfortunately, much of this work has focused on individual factors such as taste preferences and often neglects to understand other factors that influence our choices. Additionally, the evaluation of technological approaches often lacks user studies in the context of intended use. In this systematic review of food choice technology, we focus on the factors that may influence food choices and how technology can play a role in supporting those choices. We also describe existing work, approaches, trends, and issues in current food choice technology and give advice for future work areas in this space. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",environment; Food; food decisions; food properties; food recommendation systems; health; health applications; personal factors; technology,Blood pressure; Food supply; Nutrition; Environment; Food consumption; Food decision; Food properties; Food recommendation system; Health application; Healthy foods; Personal factor; Technological innovation; Technology; Article; cultural factor; decision making; environmental factor; food composition; food intake; health behavior; health survey; healthy diet; human; lifestyle; nutrition; priority journal; sensation; social network; social support; systematic review; technology; Recommender systems

Helical Tomotherapy-based megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) imaging during the Tomotherapy treatment can be applied to monitor the successive variations in the parotid glands. While manual segmentation is time consuming, laborious, and subjective, automatic segmentation is quite challenging due to the complicated anatomical environment of head and neck as well as noises in MVCT images. In this article, we propose a localization-refinement scheme to segment the parotid gland in MVCT. After data pre-processing we use mask region convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) in the localization stage after data pre-processing, and design a modified U-Net in the following fine segmentation stage. To the best of our knowledge, this study is a pioneering work of deep learning on MVCT segmentation. Comprehensive experiments based on different data distribution of head and neck MVCTs and different segmentation models have demonstrated the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, effectiveness, flexibility, and practicability.

Emotion Recognition Robust to Indoor Environmental Distortions and Non-targeted Emotions Using Out-of-distribution Detection,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126810618&doi=10.1145%2f3492300&partnerID=40&md5=243f573bc91a9dbd5a95cff66c99afea,"The rapid development of machine learning on acoustic signal processing has resulted in many solutions for detecting emotions from speech. Early works were developed for clean and acted speech and for a fixed set of emotions. Importantly, the datasets and solutions assumed that a person only exhibited one of these emotions. More recent work has continually been adding realism to emotion detection by considering issues such as reverberation, de-amplification, and background noise, but often considering one dataset at a time, and also assuming all emotions are accounted for in the model. We significantly improve realistic considerations for emotion detection by (i) more comprehensively assessing different situations by combining the five common publicly available datasets as one and enhancing the new dataset with data augmentation that considers reverberation and de-amplification, (ii) incorporating 11 typical home noises into the acoustics, and (iii) considering that in real situations a person may be exhibiting many emotions that are not currently of interest and they should not have to fit into a pre-fixed category nor be improperly labeled. Our novel solution combines CNN with out-of-data distribution detection. Our solution increases the situations where emotions can be effectively detected and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",convolutional neural networks; distance; emotion detection; noise; out-of-distribution detection; reverberation; Synthetic datasets,Acoustic noise; Convolutional neural networks; Emotion Recognition; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Convolutional neural network; Deamplification; Distance; Emotion detection; Emotion recognition; Machine-learning; Noise; Non-targeted; Out-of-distribution detection; Synthetic datasets; acoustics; Article; classifier; convolutional neural network; emotion; feature selection; indoor environment; machine learning; noise; priority journal; Reverberation

While ML approaches provide promising results with regard to their classification performance, most share a central limitation, their black-box character. This article investigates the usefulness of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to increase transparency in automated clinical gait classification based on time series. For this purpose, predictions of state-of-the-art classification methods are explained with a XAI method called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Our main contribution is an approach that explains class-specific characteristics learned by ML models that are trained for gait classification. We investigate several gait classification tasks and employ different classification methods, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-layer Perceptron. We propose to evaluate the obtained explanations with two complementary approaches: a statistical analysis of the underlying data using Statistical Parametric Mapping and a qualitative evaluation by two clinical experts. A gait dataset comprising ground reaction force measurements from 132 patients with different lower-body gait disorders and 62 healthy controls is utilized. Our experiments show that explanations obtained by LRP exhibit promising statistical properties concerning inter-class discriminativity and are also in line with clinically relevant biomechanical gait characteristics. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",clinical gait analysis; convolutional neural networks; Explainable artificial intelligence; ground reaction forces; human gait classification; layer-wise relevance propagation; statistical parametric mapping,Backpropagation; Biophysics; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Mapping; Multilayer neural networks; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Clinical gait analyse; Convolutional neural network; Explainable artificial intelligence; Gait classification; Ground reaction forces; Human gait; Human gait classification; Layer-wise; Layer-wise relevance propagation; Statistical parametric mapping; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; biomechanics; classification; controlled study; convolutional neural network; female; gait; gait disorder; ground reaction force; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; multilayer perceptron; priority journal; qualitative analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; support vector machine; Gait analysis

We justify our approach based on prior work giving a theoretical model of how to re-use hold-out data. We compare the two approaches in the context of identifying a cohort of EHRs and examine their strengths and weaknesses through a case study arising from an optometric research problem. We conclude that both approaches are complementary, and we recommend that they both be employed in conjunction to address the problem of cohort identification in health research. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",asymptomatic patients; Electronic health records; inclusion and exclusion protocol; patient eye care; record annotation; routine eye examinations; subpopulation discovery; vision research,Computer vision; Health care; Medical informatics; Asymptomatic patients; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Eye care; Health records; Inclusion and exclusion protocol; Inclusion and exclusions; Patient eye care; Record annotation; Routine eye examination; Subpopulation discovery; Vision research; active learning; Article; automatic query expansion; case study; classifier; cohort analysis; comparative study; computer analysis; conceptual framework; data accuracy; deep learning; electronic health record; eye examination; human; information retrieval; iterative query refinement; language; machine learning; medical research; medical terminology; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; statistics; support vector machine; theoretical model; Medical computing

Along with ECG, mCardia also records active and passive contextual data, including patient-reported symptoms and physical activity. This contextual data can provide a more accurate understanding of what happens before, during, and after an arrhythmia event, thereby providing additional information in the diagnosis of arrhythmia. By using a plugin-based architecture for ECG and contextual sensing, mCardia is device-agnostic and can integrate with various wireless ECG devices and supports cross-platform deployment. We deployed the mCardia system in a feasibility study involving 24 patients who used the system over a two-week period. During the study, we observed high patient acceptance and compliance with a satisfactory yield of collected ECG and contextual data. The results demonstrate the high usability and feasibility of mCardia for longitudinal ambulatory monitoring under free-living conditions. The article also reports from two clinical cases, which demonstrate how a cardiologist can utilize the collected contextual data to improve the accuracy of arrhythmia analysis.

A Minimalist Method Toward Severity Assessment and Progression Monitoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on the Edge,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126758254&doi=10.1145%2f3479432&partnerID=40&md5=b1986c132612f178adee56cdb4e7fa67,"Artificial Intelligence-enabled applications on edge devices have the potential to revolutionize disease detection and monitoring in future smart health (sHealth) systems. In this study, we investigated a minimalist approach for the severity classification, severity estimation, and progression monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a home environment using wearables. We used the recursive feature elimination technique to select the best feature set of 70 features from a total of 200 features extracted from polysomnogram. We used a multi-layer perceptron model to investigate the performance of OSA severity classification with all the ranked features to a subset of features available from either Electroencephalography or Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and time duration of SpO2 level. The results indicate that using only computationally inexpensive features from HRV and SpO2, an area under the curve of 0.91 and an accuracy of 83.97% can be achieved for the severity classification of OSA. For estimation of the apnea-hypopnea index, the accuracy of RMSE = 4.6 and R-squared value = 0.71 have been achieved in the test set using only ranked HRV and SpO2 features. The Wilcoxon-signed-rank test indicates a significant change (p < 0.05) in the selected feature values for a progression in the disease over 2.5 years.

Embedding Temporal Convolutional Networks for Energy-efficient PPG-based Heart Rate Monitoring,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126789258&doi=10.1145%2f3487910&partnerID=40&md5=420c1a96d4799f1071ffbe6060d3eaeb,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors allow for non-invasive and comfortable heart rate (HR) monitoring, suitable for compact wrist-worn devices. Unfortunately, motion artifacts (MAs) severely impact the monitoring accuracy, causing high variability in the skin-to-sensor interface. Several data fusion techniques have been introduced to cope with this problem, based on combining PPG signals with inertial sensor data. Until now, both commercial and reasearch solutions are computationally efficient but not very robust, or strongly dependent on hand-tuned parameters, which leads to poor generalization performance. In this work, we tackle these limitations by proposing a computationally lightweight yet robust deep learning-based approach for PPG-based HR estimation. Specifically, we derive a diverse set of Temporal Convolutional Networks for HR estimation, leveraging Neural Architecture Search. Moreover, we also introduce ActPPG, an adaptive algorithm that selects among multiple HR estimators depending on the amount of MAs, to improve energy efficiency. We validate our approaches on two benchmark datasets, achieving as low as 3.84 beats per minute of Mean Absolute Error on PPG-Dalia, which outperforms the previous state of the art. Moreover, we deploy our models on a low-power commercial microcontroller (STM32L4), obtaining a rich set of Pareto optimal solutions in the complexity vs. accuracy space. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",deep learning; heart rate monitoring; Medical IoT; Temporal convolutional networks; wearable devices,Adaptive algorithms; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data fusion; Energy efficiency; Heart; Internet of things; Pareto principle; Patient monitoring; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Embeddings; Heart-rate; Heart-rate monitoring; Medical IoT; Motion artifact; Rate estimation; Temporal convolutional network; Wearable devices; algorithm; Article; benchmarking; convolutional neural network; deep learning; detection algorithm; energy consumption; Fourier transform; heart rate; human; light absorption; mean absolute error; measurement accuracy; neural architecture search; photoelectric plethysmography; prediction; priority journal; random forest; temporal convolutional network; validation study; Deep learning
Non-invasive Techniques for Monitoring Different Aspects of Sleep: A comprehensive review,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126795254&doi=10.1145%2f3491245&partnerID=40&md5=0c1a19738614af81ed5a2e0420d69fbb,"Quality sleep is very important for a healthy life. Nowadays, many people around the world are not getting enough sleep, which has negative impacts on their lifestyles. Studies are being conducted for sleep monitoring and better understanding sleep behaviors. The gold standard method for sleep analysis is polysomnography conducted in a clinical environment, but this method is both expensive and complex for long-term use. With the advancements in the field of sensors and the introduction of off-the-shelf technologies, unobtrusive solutions are becoming common as alternatives for in-home sleep monitoring. Various solutions have been proposed using both wearable and non-wearable methods, which are cheap and easy to use for in-home sleep monitoring. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the latest research works (2015 and after) conducted in various categories of sleep monitoring, including sleep stage classification, sleep posture recognition, sleep disorders detection, and vital signs monitoring. We review the latest research efforts using the non-invasive approach and cover both wearable and non-wearable methods. We discuss the design approaches and key attributes of the work presented and provide an extensive analysis based on ten key factors, with the goal to give a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and trends in all four categories of sleep monitoring. We also collect publicly available datasets for different categories of sleep monitoring. We finally discuss several open issues and future research directions in the area of sleep monitoring. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",sleep disorders; Sleep monitoring; sleep postures; sleep stages; vital signs,Patient monitoring; Wearable technology; Gold standards; Non-wearables; Noninvasive technique; Sleep analysis; Sleep behavior; Sleep disorders; Sleep monitoring; Sleep posture; Sleep stage; Vital sign; actimetry; Article; ballistocardiography; body position; human; non invasive measurement; polysomnography; priority journal; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep pattern; sleep stage; vital sign; Sleep research

Typical interactions require applying comparative data analysis to huge repositories of genomic information for building new knowledge, taking advantage of the latest findings in applied genomics for healthcare. Powerful technology for data extraction and analysis is available, but broad use of the technology is hampered by the complexity of accessing such methods and tools.This work presents GeCoAgent, a big-data service for clinicians and biologists. GeCoAgent uses a dialogic interface, animated by a chatbot, for supporting the end-users' interaction with computational tools accompanied by multi-modal support. While the dialogue progresses, the user is accompanied in extracting the relevant data from repositories and then performing data analysis, which often requires the use of statistical methods or machine learning. Results are returned using simple representations (spreadsheets and graphics), while at the end of a session the dialogue is summarized in textual format.

Glaucoma Assessment from Fundus Images with Fundus to OCT Feature Space Mapping,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125751834&doi=10.1145%2f3470979&partnerID=40&md5=dc5217144675ad17061a057c56411168,"Early detection and treatment of glaucoma is of interest as it is a chronic eye disease leading to an irreversible loss of vision. Existing automated systems rely largely on fundus images for assessment of glaucoma due to their fast acquisition and cost-effectiveness. Optical Coherence Tomographic (OCT) images provide vital and unambiguous information about nerve fiber loss and optic cup morphology, which are essential for disease assessment. However, the high cost of OCT is a deterrent for deployment in screening at large scale. In this article, we present a novel CAD solution wherein both OCT and fundus modality images are leveraged to learn a model that can perform a mapping of fundus to OCT feature space. We show how this model can be subsequently used to detect glaucoma given an image from only one modality (fundus). The proposed model has been validated extensively on four public andtwo private datasets. It attained an AUC/Sensitivity value of 0.9429/0.9044 on a diverse set of 568 images, which is superior to the figures obtained by a model that is trained only on fundus features. Cross-validation was also done on nearly 1,600 images drawn from a private (OD-centric) and a public (macula-centric) dataset and the proposed model was found to outperform the state-of-the-art method by 8% (public) to 18% (private). Thus, we conclude that fundus to OCT feature space mapping is an attractive option for glaucoma detection. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",deep learning; fundus; GAN; Glaucoma assessment; optical coherence tomography,Automation; Computer aided design; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Mapping; Ophthalmology; Deep learning; Eye disease; Feature space; Fundus; Fundus image; GAN; Glaucoma assessment; Irreversible loss; Space-mapping; Tomographic; Article; classifier; computer aided design; controlled study; cross validation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; eye fundus; glaucoma; Hough transform; human; major clinical study; noise; ophthalmoscopy; priority journal; retinal pigment epithelium; sensitivity and specificity; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; Optical tomography
Attention-based Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction and Phrase Graph for COVID-19 Medical Literature Retrieval,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125719616&doi=10.1145%2f3473939&partnerID=40&md5=52e474cd4be9c8353140340069ad2f99,"Searching, reading, and finding information from the massive medical text collections are challenging. A typical biomedical search engine is not feasible to navigate each article to find critical information or keyphrases. Moreover, few tools provide a visualization of the relevant phrases to the query. However, there is a need to extract the keyphrases from each document for indexing and efficient search. The transformer-based neural networks-BERT has been used for various natural language processing tasks. The built-in self-attention mechanism can capture the associations between words and phrases in a sentence. This research investigates whether the self-attentions can be utilized to extract keyphrases from a document in an unsupervised manner and identify relevancy between phrases to construct a query relevancy phrase graph to visualize the search corpus phrases on their relevancy and importance. The comparison with six baseline methods shows that the self-attention-based unsupervised keyphrase extraction works well on a medical literature dataset. This unsupervised keyphrase extraction model can also be applied to other text data. The query relevancy graph model is applied to the COVID-19 literature dataset and to demonstrate that the attention-based phrase graph can successfully identify the medical phrases relevant to the query terms. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Our health records are a significant part of this data, which is pivotal for healthcare providers and can be utilized in our well-being. The clinical note in electronic health records is one such category that collects a patient's complete medical information during different timesteps of patient care available in the form of free-texts. Thus, these unstructured textual notes contain events from a patient's admission to discharge, which can prove to be significant for future medical decisions. However, since these texts also contain sensitive information about the patient and the attending medical professionals, such notes cannot be shared publicly. This privacy issue has thwarted timely discoveries on this plethora of untapped information. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate synthetic medical texts from a private or sanitized (de-identified) clinical text corpus and analyze their utility rigorously in different metrics and levels.

In this article, we propose a methodology to support a detailed analysis of the therapeutic experience in patients affected by a specific disease, as it emerges from health forums. As a use case to test the proposed methodology, we analyze the experience of patients affected by hypothyroidism and their reactions to standard therapies. Our approach is based on a data extraction and filtering pipeline, a novel topic detection model named Generative Text Compression with Agglomerative Clustering Summarization (GTCACS), and an in-depth data analytic process. We advance the state of the art on automated detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) since, rather than simply detecting and classifying positive or negative reactions to a therapy, we are capable of providing a fine characterization of patients along different dimensions, such as co-morbidities, symptoms, and emotional states. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",adverse drug reactions; generative adversarial networks; hypothyroid patients; meta-learning; Personalized health care; social analytics,Diseases; Patient treatment; Social networking (online); levothyroxine; Adverse drug reactions; Clinical practices; Disease treatment; Health condition; Hypothyroid patient; Metalearning; Personalized healthcare; Quality of life; Social analytic; Social media analytics; adverse drug reaction; agglomerative hierarchical clustering; algorithm; Article; comorbidity; computer analysis; denoising autoencoder; dimensionality reduction; disease classification; emotion; energy based generative adversarial network; generative adversarial network; generative text compression with agglomerative clustering summarization; hierarchical clustering; human; hypothyroidism; internal validity; latent dirichlet allocation; machine learning; non-negative matrix factorization; personalized medicine; priority journal; social media; social media analysis; social network; symptom; thyroid nodule; Generative adversarial networks
Adaptively Weighted Top-N Recommendation for Organ Matching,2022,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125730935&doi=10.1145%2f3469657&partnerID=40&md5=667549ec5dda8ee661403cd5d4ecaec3,"Reducing the shortage of organ donations to meet the demands of patients on the waiting list has being a major challenge in organ transplantation. Because of the shortage, organ matching decision is the most critical decision to assign the limited viable organs to the most ""suitable""patients. Currently, organ matching decisions are only made by matching scores calculated via scoring models, which are built by the first principles. However, these models may disagree with the actual post-transplantation matching performance (e.g., patient's post-transplant quality of life (QoL) or graft failure measurements). In this paper, we formulate the organ matching decision-making as a top-N recommendation problem and propose an Adaptively Weighted Top-N Recommendation (AWTR) method. AWTR improves performance of the current scoring models by using limited actual matching performance in historical datasets as well as the collected covariates from organ donors and patients. AWTR sacrifices the overall recommendation accuracy by emphasizing the recommendation and ranking accuracy for top-N matched patients. The proposed method is validated in a simulation study, where KAS [60] is used to simulate the organ-patient recommendation response. The results show that our proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art top-N recommendation benchmark methods. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Learning to rank; matrix completion; organ matching; organ transplantation; top-N recommendation,First principles; Matching performance; Matching score; Matchings; Matrix completion; Organ donations; Organ matching; Scoring models; Top-N recommendation; Waiting lists; adaptively weighted top n recommendation; Article; clinical decision making; deep learning; human; machine learning; medical informatics; organ donor; organ matching; priority journal; quality of life; simulation; Decision making

These systems process the input sentence by sentence. This approach prevents the systems from capturing dependencies over sentence boundaries and makes accurate sentence boundary detection a prerequisite. Since sentence boundary detection can be problematic especially in clinical reports, where dependencies and co-references across sentence boundaries are abundant, these systems have clear limitations. In this study, we built a new system on the framework of one of the current state-of-the-art de-identification systems, NeuroNER, to overcome these limitations. This new system incorporates context embeddings through forward and backward-grams without using sentence boundaries. Our context-enhanced de-identification (CEDI) system captures dependencies over sentence boundaries and bypasses the sentence boundary detection problem altogether. We enhanced this system with deep affix features and an attention mechanism to capture the pertinent parts of the input. The CEDI system outperforms NeuroNER on the 2006 i2b2 de-identification challenge dataset, the 2014 i2b2 shared task de-identification dataset, and the 2016 CEGS N-GRID de-identification dataset (). All datasets comprise narrative clinical reports in English but contain different note types varying from discharge summaries to psychiatric notes.

However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition.

Standardization and interpretation of such reports is crucial for clinical use of CCTA. Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) has been proposed to achieve such standardization by implementing a strict template-based report writing and assignment of a score between 0 and 5 indicating the severity of coronary artery lesions. Even after its introduction, free-form unstructured report writing remains popular among radiologists. In this work, we present our attempts at bridging the gap between structured and unstructured reporting by natural language processing. We present machine learning models that while being trained only on structured reports, can predict CAD-RADS scores by analysis of free-text of unstructured radiology reports. The best model achieves 98% accuracy on structured reports and 92% 1-margin accuracy (difference of 1 in the predicted and the actual scores) for free-form unstructured reports.

However, manual methods can be laborious and subject to a high degree of human variability. In this work, we developed various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to segment Stanford type B aortic dissections (TBADs), characterized by a tear in the descending aortic wall creating a normal channel of blood flow called a true lumen and a pathologic channel within the wall called a false lumen. We introduced several variations to the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) U-Net, where small stacks of slices were inputted into the networks instead of individual slices or whole geometries. We compared these variations with a variety of CNN segmentation architectures and found that stacking the input data slices in the upward direction with 2D U-Net improved segmentation accuracy, as measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DC) and point-by-point average distance (AVD), by more than . Our optimal architecture produced DC scores of 0.94, 0.88, and 0.90 and AVD values of 0.074, 0.22, and 0.11 in the whole aorta, true lumen, and false lumen, respectively.

In this article, we propose a full automated method able to classify the audio file of the subjects according to the progress level of the pathology. In particular, we trained a specific type of artificial neural network, called autoencoder, using the visual representation of the audio signal of the subjects, that is, the spectrogram. Moreover, we used a data augmentation approach to overcome the problem of the large amount of annotated data usually required during the training phase, which represents one of the most major obstacles in deep learning. We evaluated the proposed method using a dataset of 288 audio files from 96 subjects: 48 healthy controls and 48 cognitively impaired participants. The proposed method obtained good classification results compared to the state-of-the-art neuropsychological screening tests and, with an accuracy of 90.57%, outperformed the methods based on manual transcription and annotation of speech. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",classification; Dementia; mild cognitive impairment; neural networks; speech data augmentation,Classification (of information); Controlled drug delivery; Deep learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Speech; Audio files; Automatic speech; Cognitive impairment; Data augmentation; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; Neural-networks; Speech data; Speech data augmentation; World Health Organization; adult; aged; Article; artificial neural network; autoanalysis; autoencoder; Bayesian learning; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; dementia; female; human; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; multilayer perceptron; neuropsychological assessment; priority journal; random forest; recurrent neural network; short term memory; simultaneous masking; speech analysis; support vector machine; Neural networks
Analyzing Head Pose in Remotely Collected Videos of People with Parkinson's Disease,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125701696&doi=10.1145%2f3459669&partnerID=40&md5=5bd054400475f000f54627a9008ee0e7,"We developed an intelligent web interface that guides users to perform several Parkinson's disease (PD) motion assessment tests in front of their webcam. After gathering data from 329 participants (N = 199 with PD, N = 130 without PD), we developed a methodology for measuring head motion randomness based on the frequency distribution of the motion. We found PD is associated with significantly higher randomness in side-to-side head motion as measured by the variance and number of large frequency components compared to the age-matched non-PD control group (p = 0.001, d = 0.13). Additionally, in participants taking levodopa (N = 151), the most common drug to treat Parkinson's, the degree of random side-to-side head motion was found to follow an exponential-decay activity model following the time of the last dose taken (r = -0.404, p = 6e-5). A logistic regression model for classifying PD vs. non-PD groups identified that higher frequency components are more associated with PD. Our findings could potentially be useful toward objectively quantifying differences in head motions that may be due to either PD or PD medications. © 2021 ACM.",frequency analysis; head pose; Parkinson's disease,Controlled drug delivery; Drug dosage; Random processes; levodopa; Frequency Analysis; Frequency components; Frequency distributions; Head motion; Head pose; Intelligent web; Measuring heads; Parkinson's disease; Web interface; WebCams; aged; Article; computer vision; controlled study; disease classification; drug dose regimen; dyskinesia; feature extraction; female; frequency analysis; head movement; human; major clinical study; male; motion; Parkinson disease; priority journal; variance; videorecording; Neurodegenerative diseases
Novel Reconfigurable Hardware Systems for Tumor Growth Prediction,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125709600&doi=10.1145%2f3454126&partnerID=40&md5=6652a0ea04cace9493afa6f71d3283fe,"An emerging trend in biomedical systems research is the development of models that take full advantage of the increasing available computational power to manage and analyze new biological data as well as to model complex biological processes. Such biomedical models require significant computational resources, since they process and analyze large amounts of data, such as medical image sequences. We present a family of advanced computational models for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution of glioma and their novel implementation in state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Glioma is a rapidly evolving type of brain cancer, well known for its aggressive and diffusive behavior. The developed system simulates the glioma tumor growth in the brain tissue, which consists of different anatomic structures, by utilizing MRI slices. The presented models have been proved highly accurate in predicting the growth of the tumor, whereas the developed innovative hardware system, when implemented on a low-end, low-cost FPGA, is up to 85% faster than a high-end server consisting of 20 physical cores (and 40 virtual ones) and more than 28× more energy-efficient than it; the energy efficiency grows up to 50× and the speedup up to 14× if the presented designs are implemented in a high-end FPGA. Moreover, the proposed reconfigurable system, when implemented in a large FPGA, is significantly faster than a high-end GPU (i.e., from 80% and up to 250% faster), for the majority of the models, while it is also significantly better (i.e., from 80% to over 1,600%) in terms of power efficiency, for all the implemented models. © 2021 ACM.",FPGA acceleration; Glioma tumor; high level synthesis; tumor evolution simulation,Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Forecasting; High level synthesis; Information management; Medical imaging; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Biomedical systems; Computational power; Emerging trends; FPGA acceleration; Glioma tumor; Hardware system; High-level synthesis; Systems research; Tumor evolution simulation; Tumor growth; arm; Article; brain tissue; computer model; devices; disease simulation; glioma; human; medical informatics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; priority journal; software; tumor growth; tumor model; Tumors
Attention-Based Deep Recurrent Model for Survival Prediction,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125733486&doi=10.1145%2f3466782&partnerID=40&md5=857dcdf9ec7a6694ddd12a769b1f226b,"Survival analysis exhibits profound effects on health service management. Traditional approaches for survival analysis have a pre-assumption on the time-to-event probability distribution and seldom consider sequential visits of patients on medical facilities. Although recent studies leverage the merits of deep learning techniques to capture non-linear features and long-term dependencies within multiple visits for survival analysis, the lack of interpretability prevents deep learning models from being applied to clinical practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel attention-based deep recurrent model, named AttenSurv, for clinical survival analysis. Specifically, a global attention mechanism is proposed to extract essential/critical risk factors for interpretability improvement. Thereafter, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory is employed to capture the long-term dependency on data from a series of visits of patients. To further improve both the prediction performance and the interpretability of the proposed model, we propose another model, named GNNAttenSurv, by incorporating a graph neural network into AttenSurv, to extract the latent correlations between risk factors. We validated our solution on three public follow-up datasets and two electronic health record datasets. The results demonstrated that our proposed models yielded consistent improvement compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on survival analysis. © 2021 ACM.",deep learning; global attention mechanism; graph neural network; risk factor identification; Survival analysis,Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Risk assessment; angiotensin receptor antagonist; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; vasodilator agent; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Global attention mechanism; Graph neural networks; Interpretability; Long-term dependencies; Recurrent models; Risk factor identification; Risk factors; Survival analysis; algorithm; Article; attention; computer analysis; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep neural network; electronic health record; follow up; human; long short term memory network; medical informatics; multilayer perceptron; patient coding; prediction; priority journal; risk factor; survival analysis; survival prediction; Probability distributions
Benefits of Using Activity Recommender Technology for Self-management of Depressive Symptoms,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125729346&doi=10.1145%2f3462212&partnerID=40&md5=3d5b4aa84693a409985fc07ac33cac59,"Behavioral Activation (BA)therapy has shown to be effective in treating depression. Recommending healthy activities is a core principle in Behavioral Activation (BA), which is typically done by the therapist. However, most BA smartphone applications do not recommend specific activities. This article reports quantitative results from an 8-week feasibility study of a previously presented smartphone-based BA recommender system. The system supports the planning and enacting of pleasurable activities and promotes activation of diverse activity types. Enrollment included 43 clinically depressed patients who installed the system on their phone and initiated activity scheduling. Twenty-nine patients used the system daily for more than a week.These patients presented a significant reduction in depressive symptoms during the study period. They displayed a more personalized usage approach and created recurring health goals comprising of their own customized activities. Furthermore, they took inspiration within various types of activities, thereby displaying more activity diversity. This study suggests that enacting a diverse mixture of activities that promote good sleep, personal hygiene, exercise, social contact, and leisure time can be essential in managing depressive symptoms. A smartphone-based activity recommender system can help patients achieve this. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Activity; behavioral activation; depression; depressive symptoms; diversity; personalization; quantitative; smartphone; well-being,Recommender systems; Smartphones; Activity; Behavioral activation; Depression; Depressive symptom; Diversity; Personalizations; Quantitative; Self management; Smart phones; Well being; adult; Article; behavior; clinical article; clinical outcome; cognitive behavioral therapy; daily life activity; data processing; depression; exercise; feasibility study; female; health care; human; leisure; male; medical informatics; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; personal hygiene; priority journal; reminder system; self care; sleep; social behavior; Chemical activation
Predicting the Evolution of Pain Relief,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125726113&doi=10.1145%2f3466781&partnerID=40&md5=eac98a318b796348bc10d0bd07eaa811,"Modeling from data usually has two distinct facets: building sound explanatory models or creating powerful predictive models for a system or phenomenon. Most of recent literature does not exploit the relationship between explanation and prediction while learning models from data. Recent algorithms are not taking advantage of the fact that many phenomena are actually defined by diverse sub-populations and local structures, and thus there are many possible predictive models providing contrasting interpretations or competing explanations for the same phenomenon. In this article, we propose to explore a complementary link between explanation and prediction. Our main intuition is that models having their decisions explained by the same factors are likely to perform better predictions for data points within the same local structures. We evaluate our methodology to model the evolution of pain relief in patients suffering from chronic pain under usual guideline-based treatment. The ensembles generated using our framework are compared with all-in-one approaches of robust algorithms to high-dimensional data, such as Random Forests and XGBoost. Chronic pain can be primary or secondary to diseases. Its symptomatology can be classified as nociceptive, nociplastic, or neuropathic, and is generally associated with many different causal structures, challenging typical modeling methodologies. Our data includes 631 patients receiving pain treatment. We considered 338 features providing information about pain sensation, socioeconomic status, and prescribed treatments. Our goal is to predict, using data from the first consultation only, if the patient will be successful in treatment for chronic pain relief. As a result of this work, we were able to build ensembles that are able to consistently improve performance by up to 33% when compared to models trained using all the available features. We also obtained relevant gains in interpretability, with resulting ensembles using only 15% of the total number of features. We show we can effectively generate ensembles from competing explanations, promoting diversity in ensemble learning and leading to significant gains in accuracy by enforcing a stable scenario in which models that are dissimilar in terms of their predictions are also dissimilar in terms of their explanation factors. © 2021 ACM.",backbone structure learning; diversity; Explanatory modeling; prediction-explanation stability; predictive modeling,Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Backbone structure learning; Backbone structures; Chronic pain; Diversity; Explanatory modeling; Local structure; Pain relief; Prediction-explanation stability; Predictive models; Structure-learning; adult; algorithm; analgesia; Article; chronic pain; clinical decision support system; computer analysis; consultation; feature selection; feature selection algorithm; female; human; information; learning; learning algorithm; male; medical informatics; methodology; neuropathic pain; nociception; nociceptive pain; prediction; predictive model; priority journal; random forest; social status; symptomatology; Forecasting
Designing Robust Models for Behaviour Prediction Using Sparse Data from Mobile Sensing,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123434169&doi=10.1145%2f3458753&partnerID=40&md5=686ea1ae64a988990ca8b0aa897d0a60,"Understanding in which circumstances office workers take rest breaks is important for delivering effective mobile notifications and make inferences about their daily lifestyle, e.g., whether they are active and/or have a sedentary life. Previous studies designed for office workers show the effectiveness of rest breaks for preventing work-related conditions. In this article, we propose a hybrid personalised model involving a kernel density estimation model and a generalised linear mixed model to model office workers' available moments for rest breaks during working hours. We adopt the experience-based sampling method through which we collected office workers' responses regarding their availability through a mobile application with contextual information extracted by means of the mobile phone sensors. The experiment lasted 10 workdays and involved 19 office workers with a total of 528 responses. Our results show that time, location, ringer mode, and activity are effective features for predicting office workers' availability. Our method can address sparse sample issues for building individual predictive behavioural models based on limited and unbalanced data. In particular, the proposed method can be considered as a potential solution to the ""cold-start problem,""i.e., the negative impact of the lack of individual data when a new application is installed. © 2021 ACM.",cold-start problem; hybrid model; Personalised modelling; rest break prediction,Office buildings; Behavior prediction; Cold start problems; Hybrid model; Mobile sensing; Office workers; Personalized model; Rest break prediction; Robust modeling; Sparse data; Work-related; adult; Article; behavior; computer analysis; female; human; information; kernel method; male; office worker; physical activity; prediction; priority journal; questionnaire; rest; sampling; statistical model; wellbeing; work experience; working time; workplace; Forecasting

We develop a compartmentalized power-law model, with power-law connections between the vulnerable and the general population, considering these connections as well as the connections among the vulnerable as parameters that we vary in our tests. We use the model to study a number of vaccination strategies under two hypotheses: first, we assume a limited availability of vaccine but an infinite vaccination capacity, so all the available doses can be administered in a short time (negligible with respect to the evolution of the epidemic). Then, we assume a limited vaccination capacity, so the doses are administered in a time non-negligible with respect to the evolution of the epidemic. We develop optimal strategies for the various social parameters, where a strategy consists of (1) the fraction of vaccine that is administered to the vulnerable population and (2) the criterion that is used to administer it to the general population. In the case of a limited vaccination capacity, the fraction (1) is a function of time, and we study how to optimize it to obtain a maximal reduction in the number of fatalities. © 2021 ACM.",COVID-19; epidemics spread; random graphs; social networks; vaccination,Epidemiology; Social networking (online); Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Epidemic spread; General population; Power law model; Power-law; Random graphs; Social network; Social relations; Vaccination; Vaccination strategy; Vulnerable groups; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; epidemiological model; fatality; human; priority journal; social connectedness; social interaction; social network; social parameters; social structure; vaccination; vulnerable population; COVID-19

However, lack of Human Factors considerations and early design research has often limited their successful adoption. To complement previous technically focused work, we studied adoption opportunities of a future DST built on a predictive model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. Our aim is two-fold: exploring adoption opportunities for DSTs in AD clinical care, and testing a novel combination of methods to support this process. We focused on understanding current clinical needs and practices, and the potential for such a tool to be integrated into the setting, prior to its development. Our user-centred approach was based on field observations and semi-structured interviews, analysed through workflow analysis, user profiles, and a design-reality gap model. The first two are common practice, whilst the latter provided added value in highlighting specific adoption needs. We identified the likely early adopters of the tool as being both psychiatrists and neurologists based in research-oriented clinical settings. We defined ten key requirements for the translation and adoption of DSTs for AD around IT, user, and contextual factors. Future works can use and build on these requirements to stand a greater chance to get adopted in the clinical setting. © 2021 ACM.",design-reality gap; Diffusion of innovation; healthcare; technology adoption; user-centred design,Behavioral research; Clinical research; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Health care; Neurodegenerative diseases; User profile; Alzheimers disease; Barriers for adoptions; Clinical settings; Decision supports; Design-reality gap; Diffusion of innovations; Healthcare; Reality gaps; Support tool; Technology adoption; Alzheimer disease; Article; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; diffusion of innovation; health care; human; medical informatics; neurologist; predictive model; priority journal; psychiatrist; semi structured interview; user-centered design; workflow; User centered design

We prepended five different knowledge contexts -entity types, questions, definitions, and examples -to the input text and trained and tested BERT-based neural models on such input sequences from a combined dataset of the 18 different datasets. This novel formulation of the task (a) improved named entity recognition and illustrated the impact of different knowledge contexts, (b) reduced system confusion by limiting prediction to a single entity-class for each input token (i.e., B, I, O only) compared to multiple entity-classes in traditional NER (i.e., Bentity1, Bentity2, Ientity1, I, O), (c) made detection of nested entities easier, and (d) enabled the models to jointly learn NER-specific features from a large number of datasets. We performed extensive experiments of this KGQA formulation on the biomedical datasets, and through the experiments, we showed when knowledge improved named entity recognition. We analyzed the effect of the task formulation, the impact of the different knowledge contexts, the multi-task aspect of the generic format, and the generalization ability of KGQA. We also probed the model to better understand the key contributors for these improvements. © 2021 ACM.",BERT-CNN; BIO tagging; biomedical; multitask training; Named entity recognition; NER; question answering; text tagging; transfer learning,C (programming language); Character recognition; Convolutional neural networks; Natural language processing systems; BERT-CNN; BIO tagging; Biomedical; Knowledge context; Multitask training; Named entity recognition; Question Answering; Text tagging; Transfer learning; Article; bioinformatics; computer analysis; feature extraction; human; information system; knowledge; multiclass classification; natural language processing; prediction; priority journal; recurrent neural network; task performance; transfer of learning; Large dataset

Early Detection of Health Changes in the Elderly Using In-Home Multi-Sensor Data Streams,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125698776&doi=10.1145%2f3448671&partnerID=40&md5=767e9ac051197f1d80fbed2bffdfe99f,"The rapid aging of the population worldwide requires increased attention from healthcare providers and the entire society. For the elderly to live independently, many health issues related to old age, such as frailty and risk of falling, need increased attention and monitoring. When monitoring daily routines for older adults, it is desirable to detect the early signs of health changes before serious health events, such as hospitalizations, happen so that timely and adequate preventive care may be provided. By deploying multi-sensor systems in homes of the elderly, we can track trajectories of daily behaviors in a feature space defined using the sensor data. In this article, we investigate a methodology for tracking the evolution of the behavior trajectories over long periods (years) using high-dimensional streaming clustering and provide very early indicators of changes in health. If we assume that habitual behaviors correspond to clusters in feature space and diseases produce a change in behavior, albeit not highly specific, tracking trajectory deviations can provide hints of early illness. Retrospectively, we visualize the streaming clustering results and track how the behavior clusters evolve in feature space with the help of two dimension-reduction algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. Moreover, our tracking algorithm in the original high-dimensional feature space generates early health warning alerts if a negative trend is detected in the behavior trajectory. We validated our algorithm on synthetic data and tested it on a pilot dataset of four TigerPlace residents monitored with a collection of motion, bed, and depth sensors over 10 years. We used the TigerPlace electronic health records to understand the residents' behavior patterns and to evaluate the health warnings generated by our algorithm. The results obtained on the TigerPlace dataset show that most of the warnings produced by our algorithm can be linked to health events documented in the electronic health records, providing strong support for a prospective deployment of the approach.  © 2021 ACM.",Early illness; Eldercare; Sensor networks; Streaming clustering,Clustering algorithms; Diseases; Health risks; Principal component analysis; Stochastic systems; Trajectories; Clusterings; Data stream; Early illness; Eldercare; Electronic health; Feature space; Health records; Multi-sensor data; Sensors network; Streaming clustering; aged; Article; behavior; clustering algorithm; controlled study; daily life activity; data collection method; electronic health record; feature extraction; health status; human; pilot study; priority journal; Sensor networks

However, existing techniques for autonomous diagnosis do not surpass a well-trained radiologist. Therefore, to reduce the number of mammograms that require examination by a radiologist, subject to preserving the diagnostic accuracy observed in current clinical practice, we develop Man and Machine Mammography Oracle (MAMMO) - a clinical decision support system capable of determining whether its predicted diagnoses require further radiologist examination. We first introduce a novel multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using multi-task learning (MTL) to diagnose mammograms and predict the radiological assessments known to be associated with cancer. MTL improves diagnostic performance and triage efficiency while providing an additional layer of model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel triage network that takes as input the radiological assessment and diagnostic predictions of the multi-view CNN and determines whether the radiologist or CNN will most likely provide the correct diagnosis. Results obtained on a dataset of over 7,000 patients show that MAMMO reduced the number of diagnostic mammograms requiring radiologist reading by 42.8% while improving the overall diagnostic accuracy in comparison to readings done by radiologists alone.  © 2021 ACM.",Classification; Computer vision; Diagnosis; Neural networks; Radiology,Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision support systems; Linearization; Mammography; X ray screens; 'current; Autonomous diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Diagnostic accuracy; Mammographic images; Multi tasks; Multi-views; Multitask learning; Neural-networks; Radiological assessment; adult; Article; breast cancer; breast density; breast imaging reporting and data system; cancer screening; classifier; clinical decision support system; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; digital breast tomosynthesis; human; machine learning; major clinical study; mammography; middle aged; patient triage; prediction; priority journal; radiologist; two-dimensional imaging; Computer vision

However, these systems are complex in software and hardware, and optimizing between security, privacy, and treatment is crucial for healthcare systems because any security or privacy violation can lead to severe effects on patients' treatments and overall health conditions. Indeed, the healthcare domain is increasingly facing security challenges and threats due to numerous design flaws and the lack of proper security measures in healthcare devices and applications. In this article, we explore various security and privacy threats to healthcare systems and discuss the consequences of these threats.

These images are then analyzed using computer vision methods to estimate energy and nutrition content of the foods. Food image segmentation, which determines the regions in an image where foods are located, plays an important role in this process. Current methods are data dependent and thus cannot generalize well for different food types. To address this problem, we propose a class-agnostic food image segmentation method. Our method uses a pair of eating scene images, one before starting eating and one after eating is completed. Using information from both the before and after eating images, we can segment food images by finding the salient missing objects without any prior information about the food class. We model a paradigm of top-down saliency that guides the attention of the human visual system based on a task to find the salient missing objects in a pair of images. Our method is validated on food images collected from a dietary study that showed promising results.  © 2021 ACM.",Food segmentation; Image-based dietary assessment,Image enhancement; Nutrition; 'current; Dietary assessments; Energy; Food image; Food segmentation; Image-based; Image-based dietary assessment; Images segmentations; Smart phones; Wearable devices; Article; convolutional neural network; eating; feature extraction; human; image registration; image segmentation; priority journal; visual attention; Image segmentation
A Fast ECG Diagnosis by Using Non-Uniform Spectral Analysis and the Artificial Neural Network,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125710860&doi=10.1145%2f3453174&partnerID=40&md5=310e2e4dd668bbc8ab1ab1322246d063,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been proven as an efficient diagnostic tool to monitor the electrical activity of the heart and has become a widely used clinical approach to diagnose heart diseases. In a practical way, the ECG signal can be decomposed into P, Q, R, S, and T waves. Based on the information of the features in these waves, such as the amplitude and the interval between each wave, many types of heart diseases can be detected by using the neural network (NN)-based ECG analysis approach. However, because of a large amount of computing to preprocess the raw ECG signal, it is time consuming to analyze the ECG signal in the time domain. In addition, the non-linear ECG signal analysis worsens the difficulty to diagnose the ECG signal. To solve the problem, we propose a fast ECG diagnosis approach based on spectral analysis and the artificial neural network. Compared with the conventional time-domain approaches, the proposed approach analyzes the ECG signal only in the frequency domain. However, because most of the noises in the raw ECG signal belong to high-frequency signals, it is necessary to acquire more features in the low-frequency spectrum and fewer features in the high-frequency spectrum. Hence, a non-uniform feature extraction approach is proposed in this article. According to less data preprocessing in the frequency domain than the one in the time domain, the proposed approach not only reduces the total diagnosis latency but also reduces the computing power consumption of the ECG diagnosis. To verify the proposed approach, the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is involved in this work. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce ECG diagnosis latency by 47% to 52% compared with conventional ECG analysis methods under similar diagnostic accuracy of heart diseases. In addition, because of less data preprocessing, the proposed approach can achieve lower area overhead by 22% to 29% and lower computing power consumption by 29% to 34% compared with the related works, which is proper for applying this approach to portable medical devices.  © 2021 ACM.",ECG; FFT; Frequency domain; Neural network; Non-uniform feature extraction,Biomedical signal processing; Cardiology; Computing power; Diseases; Electric power utilization; Extraction; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Neural networks; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Time domain analysis; Data preprocessing; Electrocardiogram analysis; Electrocardiogram signal; Features extraction; Frequency domains; Heart disease; Neural-networks; Non-uniform; Non-uniform feature extraction; Time domain; Article; artificial neural network; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electrocardiography; feature extraction; heart arrhythmia; heart left bundle branch block; heart right bundle branch block; heart ventricle extrasystole; human; P wave; priority journal; Q wave; R wave; RR interval; signal detection; spectroscopy; T wave; Electrocardiograms
Chronic Pain Protective Behavior Detection with Deep Learning,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108895727&doi=10.1145%2f3449068&partnerID=40&md5=13181fd4ac3fb4a88cdb31e67db4a599,"In chronic pain rehabilitation, physiotherapists adapt physical activity to patients' performance based on their expression of protective behavior, gradually exposing them to feared but harmless and essential everyday activities. As rehabilitation moves outside the clinic, technology should automatically detect such behavior to provide similar support. Previous works have shown the feasibility of automatic protective behavior detection (PBD) within a specific activity. In this article, we investigate the use of deep learning for PBD across activity types, using wearable motion capture and surface electromyography data collected from healthy participants and people with chronic pain. We approach the problem by continuously detecting protective behavior within an activity rather than estimating its overall presence. The best performance reaches mean F1 score of 0.82 with leave-one-subject-out cross validation. When protective behavior is modeled per activity type, performance achieves a mean F1 score of 0.77 for bend-down, 0.81 for one-leg-stand, 0.72 for sit-to-stand, 0.83 for stand-to-sit, and 0.67 for reach-forward. This performance reaches excellent level of agreement with the average experts' rating performance suggesting potential for personalized chronic pain management at home. We analyze various parameters characterizing our approach to understand how the results could generalize to other PBD datasets and different levels of ground truth granularity.  © 2021 ACM.",Affective computing; Body movement; Chronic pain; Deep learning; Protective behavior,Deep learning; Affective Computing; Behavior detection; Body movements; Chronic pain; Deep learning; F1 scores; Performance; Performance based; Physical activity; Protective behavior; Article; behavior; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; cross validation; deep learning; human; human activities; priority journal; recurrent neural network; scoring system; surface electromyography; Patient rehabilitation
Sensor-Based Estimation of Dim Light Melatonin Onset Using Features of Two Time Scales,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108276431&doi=10.1145%2f3447516&partnerID=40&md5=d147d6d2a2f4efc36f7349c2cd9719c2,"Circadian rhythms influence multiple essential biological activities, including sleep, performance, and mood. The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is the gold standard for measuring human circadian phase (i.e., timing). The collection of DLMO is expensive and time consuming since multiple saliva or blood samples are required overnight in special conditions, and the samples must then be assayed for melatonin. Recently, several computational approaches have been designed for estimating DLMO. These methods collect daily sampled data (e.g., sleep onset/offset times) or frequently sampled data (e.g., light exposure/skin temperature/physical activity collected every minute) to train learning models for estimating DLMO. One limitation of these studies is that they only leverage one time-scale data. We propose a two-step framework for estimating DLMO using data from both time scales. The first step summarizes data from before the current day, whereas the second step combines this summary with frequently sampled data of the current day. We evaluate three moving average models that input sleep timing data as the first step and use recurrent neural network models as the second step. The results using data from 207 undergraduates show that our two-step model with two time-scale features has statistically significantly lower root-mean-square errors than models that use either daily sampled data or frequently sampled data.  © 2021 ACM.",Circadian rhythm; Dim light melatonin onset; Machine learning; Sensor data,Hormones; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Sleep research; Time measurement; melatonin; 'current; Circadian rhythms; Dim light; Dim light melatonin onset; Machine-learning; Performance; Sampled data; Sensors data; Time-scales; Two time scale; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; feature selection; human; light; model; priority journal; recurrent neural network; root mean squared error; sleep parameters; sleep time; stage 1 sleep; Mean square error

However, the privacy implications of this data, particularly genomics data, have surfaced recently as the collection, dissemination, and analysis of human genomics data is highly sensitive. There have been multiple privacy attacks relying on the uniqueness of the human genome that reveals a participant or a certain group's presence in a dataset. Therefore, the current data sharing policies have ruled out any public dissemination and adopted precautionary measures prior to genomics data release, which hinders timely scientific innovation. In this article, we investigate an approach that only releases the statistics from genomic data rather than the whole dataset and propose a generalized Differentially Private mechanism for Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). Our method provides a quantifiable privacy guarantee that adds noise to the intermediate outputs but ensures satisfactory accuracy of the private results. Furthermore, the proposed method offers multiple adjustable parameters that the data owners can set based on the optimal privacy requirements. These variables are presented as equalizers that balance between the privacy and utility of the GWAS. The method also incorporates Online Bin Packing technique [1], which further bounds the privacy loss linearly, growing according to the number of open bins and scales with the incoming queries. Finally, we implemented and benchmarked our approach using seven different GWAS studies to test the performance of the proposed methods. The experimental results demonstrate that for 1,000 arbitrary online queries, our algorithms are more than 80% accurate with reasonable privacy loss and exceed the state-of-The-Art approaches on multiple studies (i.e., EigenStrat, LMM, TDT). © 2021 ACM.",Differentially private gwas; Genomics data privacy; Online algorithm for privacy,Bioinformatics; Sensitive data; Differentially private gwas; Digitisation; Genome-wide association studies; Genomic data; Genomic data privacy; Healthcare record; Large volumes; On-line algorithms; Online algorithm for privacy; Scientific data; adult; algorithm; Article; benchmarking; budget; case control study; cochran armitage test for trend; controlled study; data accuracy; data privacy; eigenstrat; female; Fisher exact test; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic privacy; genome analysis; genome-wide association study; genomics; hardy weinberg equilibrium; human; linear mixed model; male; middle aged; preliminary data; priority journal; statistical analysis; transmission disequilibrium test; Genes
Attention-gated graph convolutions for extracting drug interaction information from drug labels,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125720451&doi=10.1145%2f3423209&partnerID=40&md5=c90425d8802ccdb904ff36e858cba595,"Preventable adverse events as a result of medical errors present a growing concern in the healthcare system. As drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may lead to preventable adverse events, being able to extract DDIs from drug labels into a machine-processable form is an important step toward effective dissemination of drug safety information. Herein, we tackle the problem of jointly extracting mentions of drugs and their interactions, including interaction outcome, from drug labels. Our deep learning approach entails composing various intermediate representations, including graph-based context derived using graph convolutions (GCs) with a novel attention-based gating mechanism (holistically called GCA), which are combined in meaningful ways to predict on all subtasks jointly. Our model is trained and evaluated on the 2018 TAC DDI corpus. Our GCA model in conjunction with transfer learning performs at 39.20% F1 and 26.09% F1 on entity recognition (ER) and relation extraction (RE), respectively, on the first official test set and at 45.30% F1 and 27.87% F1 on ER and RE, respectively, on the second official test set.

Existing approaches, however, face challenges regarding privacy and security. This literature review aims to provide an overview of privacy and security challenges and requirements proposed by papers discussing e-consent implementations, as well as the manner in which state-of-The-Art solutions address them. We conducted a systematic literature search using ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed Central. We included papers providing comprehensive discussions of one or more technical aspects of e-consent systems. Thirty-one papers met our inclusion criteria. Two distinct topics were identified, the first being discussions of e-consent representations and the second being implementations of e-consent in data sharing systems. The main challenge for e-consent representations is gathering the requirements for a ""valid""consent. For the implementation papers, many provided some requirements but none provided a comprehensive overview. Blockchain is identified as a solution to transparency and trust issues in traditional client-server systems, but several challenges hinder it from being applied in practice. E-consent has the potential to grant data subjects control over their data. However, there is no agreed-upon set of security and privacy requirements that must be addressed by an e-consent platform.

Data-driven context detection leveraging passively sensed nearables for recognizing complex activities of daily living,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125727261&doi=10.1145%2f3428664&partnerID=40&md5=a15200b7b72ae31d0f58502c30139061,"Wearable systems have unlocked new sensing paradigms in various applications such as human activity recognition, which can enhance effectiveness of mobile health applications. Current systems using wearables are not capable of understanding their surroundings, which limits their sensing capabilities. For instance, distinguishing certain activities such as attending a meeting or class, which have similar motion patterns but happen in different contexts, is challenging by merely using wearable motion sensors. This article focuses on understanding user's surroundings, i.e., environmental context, to enhance capability of wearables, with focus on detecting complex activities of daily living (ADL). We develop a methodology to automatically detect the context using passively observable information broadcasted by devices in users' locale. This system does not require specific infrastructure or additional hardware. We develop a pattern extraction algorithm and probabilistic mapping between the context and activities to reduce the set of probable outcomes. The proposed system contains a general ADL classifier working with motion sensors, learns personalized context, and uses that to reduce the search space of activities to those that occur within a certain context. We collected real-world data of complex ADLs and by narrowing the search space with context, we improve average F1-score from 0.72 to 0.80. © 2021 ACM.",Activity recognition; Bluetooth low energy; Context detection; Context-Aware; Nearables; Wearables,Pattern recognition; Activities of Daily Living; Activity recognition; Bluetooth low energy; Complex activity; Context detection; Context-Aware; Lower energies; Motion sensors; Nearables; Wearables; Article; bluetooth low energy; classifier; clustering algorithm; comprehension; daily life activity; data collection method; feature extraction; feature extraction algorithm; feature learning (machine learning); human; intermethod comparison; measurement accuracy; outcome assessment; pattern recognition; priority journal; unsupervised machine learning; validation study; wireless communication; work environment; Wearable sensors

This provides a unique opportunity for researchers and health practitioners to proactively identify linguistic markers or patterns that correlate with mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or suicide behaviour. This survey describes and reviews the approaches that have been proposed for mental state assessment and identification of disorders using online digital records. The presented studies are organised according to the assessment technology and the feature extraction process conducted. We also present a series of studies which explore different aspects of the language and behaviour of individuals suffering from mental disorders, and discuss various aspects related to the development of experimental frameworks. Furthermore, ethical considerations regarding the treatment of individuals' data are outlined.

Enabling cost-effective population health monitoring by exploiting spatiotemporal correlation,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104495933&doi=10.1145%2f3428665&partnerID=40&md5=f476847adbad16e9ec0817d8f1c15163,"Because of its important role in health policy-shaping, population health monitoring (PHM) is considered a fundamental block for public health services. However, traditional public health data collection approaches, such as clinic-visit-based data integration or health surveys, could be very costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, this article proposes a cost-effective approach called Compressive Population Health (CPH), where a subset of a given area is selected in terms of regions within the area for data collection in the traditional way, while leveraging inherent spatial correlations of neighboring regions to perform data inference for the rest of the area. By alternating selected regions longitudinally, this approach can validate and correct previously assessed spatial correlations. To verify whether the idea of CPH is feasible, we conduct an in-depth study based on spatiotemporal morbidity rates of chronic diseases in more than 500 regions around London for over 10 years. We introduce our CPH approach and present three extensive analytical studies. The first confirms that significant spatiotemporal correlations do exist. In the second study, by deploying multiple state-of-The-Art data recovery algorithms, we verify that these spatiotemporal correlations can be leveraged to do data inference accurately using only a small number of samples. Finally, we compare different methods for region selection for traditional data collection and show how such methods can further reduce the overall cost while maintaining high PHM quality. © 2021 ACM.",Compressive sensing; Data analysis; Population health; Spatiotemporal correlation,Compressed sensing; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Data acquisition; Data integration; Diseases; Inference engines; Public health; Surveys; Compressive sensing; Cost effective; Data collection; Health data; Health monitoring; Health policy; Population health; Public health services; Spatial correlations; Spatiotemporal correlation; algorithm; Article; asthma; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; compressive population health; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; data collection method; dementia; depression; diabetes mellitus; dynamic time warping; empiricism; England; epilepsy; heart failure; higher order tensor decomposition; human; hypertension; intermethod comparison; ischemic heart disease; item based collaborative filtering; learning disorder; longitudinal study; malignant neoplasm; medical informatics; mental health; monitoring; morbidity; non-negative matrix factorization; obesity; palliative therapy; peripheral arterial disease; population health; population health management; population health monitoring; population recovery; priority journal; public health; signal processing; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; transient ischemic attack; user based collaborative filtering; Population statistics

To diagnose sleep apnea, sleep data are collected with either polysomnography or polygraphy and scored by a sleep expert. We investigate in this work the use of supervised machine learning to automate the analysis of polygraphy data from the A3 study containing more than 7,400 hours of sleep monitoring data from 579 patients. We conduct a systematic comparative study of classification performance and resource use with different combinations of 27 classifiers and four sleep signals.

The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2020 ACM.",Activity recognition; IoT healthcare; privacy,Consumer products; Health care; Health risks; Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Privacy-preserving techniques; Activity recognition; Healthcare monitoring; Healthcare sectors; Human activities; IoT healthcare; Personal health care; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Re identifications; User activity; Article; biometry; data privacy; feature extraction; feature ranking; feature selection; human; image segmentation; internet of things; learning algorithm; machine learning; priority journal; signal processing; Frequency domain analysis

Deep Learning networks generally require large datasets for training. In some health care applications, such as the real-time smartwatch-based fall detection, there are no publicly available, large, annotated datasets that can be used for training, due to the nature of the problem (i.e., a fall is not a common event). We conducted a series of offline experiments using two different datasets of simulated falls for training various ensemble models. Our offline experimental results show that an ensemble of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, combined by the stacking ensemble technique, outperforms a single RNN model trained on the same data samples. Nonetheless, fall detection models trained on simulated falls and activities of daily living performed by test subjects in a controlled environment, suffer from low precision due to high false-positive rates. In this work, through a set of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the low precision can be mitigated via the collection of false-positive feedback by the end-users.

Short- and long-term care for these disorders is often determined in short-term settings. However, these decisions are made with minimal longitudinal and long-term data. To overcome this bias towards data from acute care settings, improved longitudinal monitoring for cardiovascular patients is needed. Longitudinal monitoring provides a more comprehensive picture of patient health, allowing for informed decision making. This work surveys sensing and machine learning in the field of remote health monitoring for cardiovascular disorders. We highlight three needs in the design of new smart health technologies: (1) need for sensing technologies that track longitudinal trends of the cardiovascular disorder despite infrequent, noisy, or missing data measurements; (2) need for new analytic techniques designed in a longitudinal, continual fashion to aid in the development of new risk prediction techniques and in tracking disease progression; and (3) need for personalized and interpretable machine learning techniques, allowing for advancements in clinical decision making. We highlight these needs based upon the current state of the art in smart health technologies and analytics. We then discuss opportunities in addressing these needs for development of smart health technologies for the field of cardiovascular disorders and care. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk factors; longitudinal monitoring; patient analytics; sensors; smart health,Decision making; Engineering education; Health; Health risks; Machine learning; Monitoring; Acute cares; Cardio-vascular risk factors; Cardiovascular disease; Health technology; Long term care; Longitudinal monitoring; Patient analytic; Patient health; Risk factors; Smart health; blood flow; blood pressure; body position; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk factor; diet; electrocardiography; fluid retention; glucose intolerance; human; machine learning; medical technology; physical activity; priority journal; Review; Surveys

Perception Clusters: Automated Mood Recognition Using a Novel Cluster-Driven Modelling System,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125704880&doi=10.1145%2f3422819&partnerID=40&md5=48e30095c9cdeab267bb745e73620271,"Automated mood recognition has been studied in recent times with great emphasis on stress in particular. Other affective states are also of great importance, as studying them can help in understanding human behaviours in more detail. Most of the studies conducted in the realisation of an automated system that is capable of recognising human moods have established that mood is personal - that is, mood perception differs amongst individuals. Previous machine learning - based frameworks confirm this hypothesis, with personalised models almost always outperforming the generalised methods. In this article, we propose a novel system for grouping individuals in what we refer to as ""perception clusters""based on their physiological signals. We evaluate perception clusters with a trial of nine users in a work environment, recording physiological and activity data for at least 10 days. Our results reveal no significant difference in performance with respect to a personalised approach and that our method performs equally better against traditional generalised methods. Such an approach significantly reduces computational requirements that are otherwise necessary for personalised approaches requiring individual models developed separately for each user. Further, perception clusters manifest a direction towards semi-supervised affective modelling in which individual perceptions are inferred from the data. © 2020 ACM.",Affective computing; emotions; mood; pervasive computing; stress; wearable sensing,Automation; Behavioral research; Physiology; Affective Computing; Affective state; Automated systems; Emotion; Generalized method; Human behaviors; Machine-learning; Modelling systems; Mood; Wearable sensing; Article; automation; controlled study; feature extraction; feature selection; human; machine learning; mood; perception; priority journal; recognition; work environment; Ubiquitous computing
Creating and Evaluating Chatbots as Eligibility Assistants for Clinical Trials,2021,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117396778&doi=10.1145%2f3403575&partnerID=40&md5=d69906eb30d82e190dfa6f5d65b740b0,"Clinical trials are important tools to improve knowledge about the effectiveness of new treatments for all diseases, including cancers. However, studies show that fewer than 5% of cancer patients are enrolled in any type of research study or clinical trial. Although there is a wide variety of reasons for the low participation rate, we address this issue by designing a chatbot to help users determine their eligibility via interactive, two-way communication. The chatbot is supported by a user-centered classifier that uses an active deep learning approach to separate complex eligibility criteria into questions that can be easily answered by users and information that requires verification by their doctors. We collected all the available clinical trial eligibility criteria from the National Cancer Institute's website to evaluate the chatbot and the classifier. Experimental results show that the active deep learning classifier outperforms the baseline k-nearest neighbor method. In addition, an in-person experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot. The results indicate that the participants who used the chatbot achieved better understanding about eligibility than those who used only the website. Furthermore, interfaces with chatbots were rated significantly better in terms of perceived usability, interactivity, and dialogue. © 2020 ACM.",active learning; Chatbots; clinical trials; convolution neural networks; eligibility criteria,Classification (of information); Clinical research; Deep learning; Diseases; Medical applications; Nearest neighbor search; Active Learning; Cancer patients; Chatbots; Clinical trial; Convolution neural network; Eligibility criterion; Participation rate; Research studies; Two way communications; User-centred; Article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; deep learning; eligibility; eligibility criteria; health care; human; k nearest neighbor; national health organization; priority journal; usability; user-centered design; Websites

The literature on polyp detection shows widely varying miss rates among clinicians, with averages ranging around 22% - 27%. While recent work has considered the use of AI support systems for polyp detection, how to visualise and integrate these systems into clinical practice is an open question. In this work, we explore the design of visual markers as used in an AI support system for colonoscopy. Supported by the gastroenterologists in our team, we designed seven unique visual markers and rendered them on real-life patient video footage. Through an online survey targeting relevant clinical staff (N = 36), we evaluated these designs and obtained initial insights and understanding into the way in which clinical staff envision AI to integrate in their daily work-environment.

In this chapter, we propose a new framework for skill assessment that generalizes across application domains and can be deployed for near-real-time applications. It is based on the notion of repeatability of activities defining skill. The analysis is based on two subsequent classification steps that analyze (1) movements or activities and (2) their qualities, that is, the actual skills of a human performing them. The first classifier is trained in either a supervised or unsupervised manner and provides confidence scores, which are then used for assessing skills. We evaluate the proposed method in two scenarios: gymnastics and surgical skill training of medical students. We demonstrate both the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the generalized assessment method, especially compared to previous work. © 2020 ACM.",Activity recognition; machine learning for sports and health analytics; skill assessment,Pattern recognition; Quality control; Sports; Students; Activity recognition; Applications domains; Confidence score; Human activity recognition; Machine learning for sport and health analytic; Machine-learning; Medical training; Near-real time; Real-time application; Skill assessment; adolescent; adult; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; gymnastics; health care; human; male; medical education; medical student; priority journal; skill; sport; surgical training; wellbeing; Machine learning

However, the design, development, and deployment of mHealth applications is challenging in many ways. To address these challenges, several generic mobile sensing frameworks have been researched in the past decade. Such frameworks assist developers and researchers in reducing the complexity, time, and cost required to build and deploy health-sensing applications. The main goal of this article is to provide the reader with an overview of the state-of-the-art of health-focused generic mobile and wearable sensing frameworks. This review gives a detailed analysis of functional and non-functional features of existing frameworks, the health studies they were used in, and the stakeholders they support. Additionally, we also analyze the historical evolution, uptake, and maintenance after the initial release. Based on this analysis, we suggest new features and opportunities for future generic mHealth sensing frameworks. © 2020 Owner/Author.",mHealth frameworks; mHealth sensing; mobile sensing; mobile sensing frameworks; wearable sensing,Behavioral research; Wearable sensors; Health sensing; Health-study; Mobile health application; Mobile health framework; Mobile health sensing; Mobile sensing; Mobile sensing framework; Study and applications; Wearable sensing; cloud; data analysis; data processing; data quality assessment; ecological momentary assessment; feature extraction; human; information storage; medical informatics; priority journal; Review; systematic review; mHealth
Physiotherapy over a distance: The use of wearable technology for video consultations in hospital settings,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101731106&doi=10.1145%2f3383305&partnerID=40&md5=e8a683496f5a1b49a7f3f7ed20d79a58,"Wearable technologies offer potential in supporting assessment of lower limb movements in video consultations, which otherwise are challenging to assess. Yet there remains a limited understanding of how such technologies can be used to improve video consultations in a hospital setting and how they contribute to the clinician-patient interactions over a distance. In this article, we report on the findings of the field evaluation of a wearable technology - SoPhy. SoPhy consists of a pair of sensor embedded socks that capture the lower limb movements of a patient and a web-interface to visualise these movements for the remote physiotherapist. Our study demonstrates that SoPhy helped the physiotherapist in identifying the subtle differences in patients' movements across all six phases of a consultation. SoPhy increased the confidence of the physiotherapist and guided more accurate assessment of the patients. SoPhy visualisation enhanced the overall clinician-patient communication and offered a better understanding of the therapy goals to the patients. Using the characteristics of the visualisations, patients were able to plan specific goals. We discuss how SoPhy helped in addressing challenges in video consultations experienced by a physiotherapist, and beyond that, how it enabled collective reflection between therapist and patient.  © 2020 ACM.",clinical efficacy; Physiotherapy; video conferencing; Video consultation; wearable technology,Hospitals; Patient treatment; Physical therapy; Video conferencing; Visualization; Clinical efficacy; Field evaluation; Hospital settings; Limb movements; Lower limb; Patient interaction; Patient movement; Video consultation; Video-conferencing; Web interface; adult; arm movement; Article; autism; body regions; body weight; case report; chronic pain; clinical article; complex regional pain syndrome; consultation; exercise; female; follow up; human; learning disorder; lower limb; personal experience; physical examination; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; priority journal; video consultation; videoconferencing; videorecording; visual feedback; Wearable technology

Within Computer Science and Engineering, research investigates how to track PA of older adults for various purposes. We present a systematic review of 204 papers and discuss wearable tracking systems according to their purpose, technological context, and target audience, as well as design and evaluation processes with particular attention to the meaningful involvement of older adults. Our results show that most systems focus on supervising older adults in the context of disease and frailty management. Only few systems focus on supporting older adults by promoting rehabilitation and respecting agency of older adults via self-monitoring PA, or encouraging PA to maintain healthy levels of activity. Moreover, systems are often narrowly limited to walking, although older adults may enjoy a broader range of activities. Likewise, the involvement of older adults in design processes is scarce, and their experience with a given technology is rarely considered relevant for evaluation. In sum, we contribute an overview of wearable technology for tracking older adults' PA, contextualize our findings within recommendations provided by Sports and Rehabilitation Science, and illustrate opportunities for future work.  © 2020 ACM.",activity tracking; Older adults; physical activity; wearables,Wearable computers; Activity tracking; Computer science and engineerings; Older adults; Physical activity; Quality of life; System focus; Systematic Review; Target audience; Tracking system; Wearables; aged; Article; frailty; human; human computer interaction; personal experience; physical activity; priority journal; rehabilitation care; rehabilitation medicine; self monitoring; systematic review; user-centered design; walking; Tracking (position)

Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) is a promising medium to motivate users through engaging virtual environments. Currently, modern iVR lacks a comparative analysis between research and consumer-grade systems for exercise and health. This article examines two such iVR mediums: the Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) and the head-mounted display (HMD). Specifically, we compare the room-scale Mechdyne CAVE and HTC Vive Pro HMD with a custom in-house exercise game that was designed such that user experiences were as consistent as possible between both systems. To ensure that our findings are generalizable for users of varying abilities, we recruited 40 participants with and without cognitive disabilities with regard to the fact that iVR environments and games can differ in their cognitive challenge between users. Our results show that across all abilities, the HMD excelled in in-game performance, biofeedback response, and player engagement.

The impact of walking and resting on wrist motion for automated detection of meals,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100330901&doi=10.1145%2f3407623&partnerID=40&md5=6812a9fb5c2ef2d2a6af7207ddcb819e,"This article considers detecting eating in free-living humans by tracking wrist motion. We are specifically interested in the effect of secondary activities that people conduct while simultaneously eating, such as walking, watching television, or working. These secondary activities cause wrist motions that obfuscate those associated with eating, increasing the difficulty of detecting periods of eating. We collected a large dataset of 4,680 hours of wrist motion from 351 participants during free living. Participants reported secondary activities in 72% of meals. Analysis of wrist motion data revealed that the wrist was resting 12.8% of the time during self-reported meals compared to only 6.8% of the time in a cafeteria dataset, whereas walking motion was found 5.5% of the time during meals in free living compared to 0% in a cafeteria. Augmenting an eating detection classifier to include walking and resting detection improved accuracy from 74% to 77% on our free-living dataset (t[353] = 7.86, p < 0.001). Although eating detection could be improved using more sophisticated machine learning methods or sensor modalities, all approaches would be affected by secondary activities, as they affect the labeling of data itself. Our work suggests that future work should collect detailed ground truth on secondary activities being conducted during eating, as these activities could hold insights into when an eating activity starts or stops in the absence of video-based ground truth.  © 2020 ACM.",Automated dietary monitoring; eating detecting; gesture recognition; m-health; obesity; resting detection; walking detection; wearables,Classification (of information); Learning systems; mHealth; Motion analysis; Wearable sensors; Automated dietary monitoring; Eating detecting; Free livings; Gestures recognition; Ground truth; Obesity; Resting detection; Walking detection; Wearables; Wrist motions; adult; Article; automation; classifier; eating; female; human; machine learning; male; meal; motion; normal human; physical activity; priority journal; resting; secondary analysis; self report; television viewing; videorecording; walking; work; wrist; Large dataset
EmotionSense: An adaptive emotion recognition system based on wearable smart devices,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125705339&doi=10.1145%2f3384394&partnerID=40&md5=4b28577af61e9962036db19afc98d3dd,"With the recent surge of smart wearable devices, it is possible to obtain the physiological and behavioral data of human beings in a more convenient and non-invasive manner. Based on such data, researchers have developed a variety of systems or applications to recognize and understand human behaviors, including both physical activities (e.g., gestures) and mental states (e.g., emotions). Specifically, it has been proved that different emotions can cause different changes in physiological parameters. However, other factors, such as activities, may also impact one's physiological parameters. To accurately recognize emotions, we need not only explore the physiological data but also the behavioral data. To this end, we propose an adaptive emotion recognition system by exploring a sensor-enriched wearable smart watch. First, an activity identification method is developed to distinguish different activity scenes (e.g., sitting, walking, and running) by using the accelerometer sensor. Based on the identified activity scenes, an adaptive emotion recognition method is proposed by leveraging multi-mode sensory data (including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature). Specifically, we extract fine-grained features to characterize different emotions. Finally, the adaptive user emotion recognition model is constructed and verified by experiments. An accuracy of 74.3% for 30 participants demonstrates that the proposed system can recognize human emotions effectively.  © 2020 ACM.",activity identification; Emotion recognition; multi-mode signals; scene-adaptive; wearable devices,Behavioral research; Physiological models; Physiology; Speech recognition; Wearable sensors; Activity identification; Behavioral data; Emotion recognition; Mode signals; Multi-mode signal; Multimodes; Physiological data; Recognition systems; Scene adaptive; Wearable devices; adaptive behavior; adult; aged; Article; electrodermal response; emotion; female; human; male; normal human; photoelectric plethysmography; priority journal; recognition; running; sitting; skin temperature; standing; walking; Emotion Recognition
MSIMPAD: Efficient and robust mining of successive similar patterns of multiple lengths in time series,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123948291&doi=10.1145%2f3396250&partnerID=40&md5=aa24ada87ba7eddec4e0099892ebe4eb,"A successive similar pattern (SSP) is a series of similar sequences that occur consecutively at non-regular intervals in time series. Mining SSPs could provide valuable information without a priori knowledge, which is crucial in many applications ranging from health monitoring to activity recognition. However, most existing work is computationally expensive, focuses only on periodic patterns occurring in regular time intervals, and is unable to recognize patterns containing multiple periods. Here we investigate a more general problem of finding similar patterns occurring successively, in which the similarity between patterns is measured by the z-normalized Euclidean distance. We propose a linear time, robust method, called Multiple-length Successive sIMilar PAtterns Detector (mSIMPAD), that mines SSPs of multiple lengths, making no assumptions regarding periodicity. We apply our method on the detection of repetitive movement using a wearable inertial measurement unit. The experiments were conducted on three public datasets, two of which contain simple walking and idle data, whereas the third is more complex and contains multiple activities. mSIMPAD achieved F-score improvements of 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively, over the simple and complex datasets compared to the state-of-the-art walking detector. In addition, mSIMPAD is scalable and applicable to real-time applications since it operates in linear time complexity.  © 2020 ACM.",matrix profile; periodicity detection; repetitive movement detection; Successive similar pattern,Pattern recognition; matrix; Matrix profile; Movement detection; Pattern detectors; Periodicity detection; Repetitive movement detection; Similar pattern; Simple++; Successive similar pattern; Times series; algorithm; Article; comparative study; cycling; data mining; exercise; Fourier transform; heart ventricle contraction; human; image processing; nordic walking; periodicity; priority journal; running; time series analysis; walking; Time series

Such data has plenty of potential for entirely new types of software applications, as well as for improving old applications, particularly in the domain of smart healthcare. However, utilizing this data, especially when it is continuously generated by sensors and other devices, with the current approaches is complex - data is often using proprietary formats and storage, and mixing and matching data of different origin is not easy. Furthermore, many of the systems are such that they should stimulate interactions with humans, which further complicates the systems. In this article, we introduce the Human Data Model - a new tool and a programming model for programmers and end users with scripting skills that help combine data from various sources, perform computations, and develop and schedule computer-human interactions. Written in JavaScript, the software implementing the model can be run on almost any computer either inside the browser or using Node.js. Its source code can be freely downloaded from GitHub, and the implementation can be used with the existing IoT platforms. As a whole, the work is inspired by several interviews with professionals, and an online survey among healthcare and education professionals, where the results show that the interviewed subjects almost entirely lack ideas on how to benefit the ever-increasing amount of data measured of the humans. We believe that this is because of the missing support for programming models for accessing and handling the data, which can be satisfied with the Human Data Model.  © 2020 ACM.",data management; data mashups; Human Data Model; Internet of Things; IoT; Mobile computing; pervasive computing; programmable world; ubiquitous computing; wearable computers,Application programs; Computer programming; Data handling; Digital storage; Health care; Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Ubiquitous computing; Wearable computers; Data mashups; Human data; Human data model; IoT; Mashups; Mobile-computing; Model improving; Programmability; Programmable world; Programming models; Article; assisted living facility; blood pressure; body temperature; body weight; cloud computing; comparative study; controlled study; deep learning; electroencephalogram; electromyogram; follow up; heart rate; human; logging; perception; priority journal; recording; sleep quality; urban area; vocational education; wellbeing; Information management
Target-Focused Feature Selection Using Uncertainty Measurements in Healthcare Data,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107763619&doi=10.1145%2f3383685&partnerID=40&md5=97fed8db87c2d1ba1243fdae8717deb0,"Healthcare big data remains under-utilized due to various incompatibility issues between the domains of data analytics and healthcare. The lack of generalizable iterative feature acquisition methods under budget and machine learning models that allow reasoning with a model's uncertainty are two examples. Meanwhile, a boost to the available data is currently under way with the rapid growth in the Internet of Things applications and personalized healthcare. For the healthcare domain to be able to adopt models that take advantage of this big data, machine learning models should be coupled with more informative, germane feature acquisition methods, consequently adding robustness to the model's results. We introduce an approach to feature selection that is based on Bayesian learning, allowing us to report the level of uncertainty in the model, combined with false-positive and false-negative rates. In addition, measuring target-specific uncertainty lifts the restriction on feature selection being target agnostic, allowing for feature acquisition based on a target of focus. We show that acquiring features for a specific target is at least as good as deep learning feature selection methods and common linear feature selection approaches for small non-sparse datasets, and surpasses these when faced with real-world data that is larger in scale and sparseness. © 2020 ACM.",Bayesian learning; health informatics; healthcare big data; Healthcare feature selection; machine learning; machine learning for health,Big data; Budget control; Data Analytics; Deep learning; Feature Selection; Health care; Learning systems; Medical informatics; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian learning; Feature acquisition; Features selection; Health informatics; Healthcare big data; Healthcare feature selection; Machine learning for health; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Article; Bayesian learning; deep learning; feature selection; health care; health data; human; internet of things; machine learning; medical informatics; priority journal; uncertainty; Iterative methods
Conformance Checking Methodology across Discharge Summaries and Standard Treatment Guidelines,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125752380&doi=10.1145%2f3377328&partnerID=40&md5=9c49f5cbfd4386ad003022cbacb321d3,"Conformance checking of treatment plans in discharge summary data would facilitate the development of clinical decision support system, treatment plan quality assurance, and new treatment plan discovery. Conformance checking requires extraction of medical entities and relationships among them to form a computable representation of the treatment plan present in the discharge summary. We propose a workflow representation of patient's discharge summary that is referred to as workflow instance. We employ a multi-layer perceptron neural network to extract relationships between medical entities to construct the workflow instance. The aim of this work is to check the conformance of the workflow instance against standard treatment plan. Standard treatment plans are extracted from the treatment guidelines provided on healthcare websites such as WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and Johns Hopkins. For each disease, these guidelines are curated, aggregated, and represented as a workflow specification. We commend multiple measures to compute the conformance of workflow instance with workflow specification. We validate our conformance checking methodology using discharge summary data of three diseases, namely colon cancer, coronary artery disease, and brain tumor, collected from THYME corpus and MIMIC III clinical database.

Effective solutions are needed to provide contact-free, easy deployment, low-cost, and long-term vital sign monitoring. In this article, we present PhaseBeat to exploit channel state information, in particular, phase difference data to monitor breathing and heart rates with commodity WiFi devices. We provide a rigorous analysis of channel state information phase difference with respect to its stability and periodicity. Based on the analysis, we design and implement the PhaseBeat system with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and conduct an extensive experimental study to validate its performance.

Augmenting DL with Adversarial Training for Robust Prediction of Epilepsy Seizures,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102032048&doi=10.1145%2f3386580&partnerID=40&md5=0d7235a90a6925bd8536b3ca0e4b0ca1,"Epilepsy is a chronic medical condition that involves abnormal brain activity causing patients to lose control of awareness or motor activity. As a result, detection of pre-ictal states, before the onset of a seizure, can be lifesaving. The problem is challenging because it is difficult to discern between electroencephalogram signals in pre-ictal states versus signals in normal inter-ictal states. There are three key challenges that have not been addressed previously: (1) the inconsistent performance of prediction models across patients, (2) the lack of perfect prediction to protect patients from any episode, and (3) the limited amount of pre-ictal labeled data for advancing machine learning methods. This article addresses these limitations through a novel approach that uses adversarial examples with optimized tuning of a combined convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit. Compared to the state of the art, the results showed an improvement of 3x in model robustness as measured in reduced variations and superior accuracy of the area under the curve, with an average increase of 6.7%. The proposed method also exhibited superior performance with other advances in the field of machine learning and customized for epilepsy prediction including data augmentation with Gaussian noise and multitask learning. © 2020 ACM.",adversarial examples; Deep learning; electroencephalogram; epileptic seizure prediction; multitask learning,Brain; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Neurology; Recurrent neural networks; Adversarial example; Brain activity; Deep learning; Electroencephalogram signals; Epileptic seizure prediction; Medical conditions; Motor activity; Multitask learning; Performance; Robust predictions; Article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data processing; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; epileptic patient; machine learning; prediction; predictive model; priority journal; Electroencephalography

During these, an abundance of information is often displayed on monitors placed in positions that are uncomfortable for the operator to view. In this article, we address these issues with the concept and prototype of a customized flexible display that is placed on the patient's body to provide the essential information at just the right location. We present an empirical evaluation comparing the flexible display against a control condition using a standard interventional monitor setup and an additional condition that combines both. Our results show that the flexible display significantly reduces task load while improving overall usability. Furthermore, we found indications that the flexible display reduces task completion time while also observing a negative effect on accuracy, which needs to be balanced carefully. © 2020 Owner/Author.",electroluminescence; Intra-operative information; needle-based intervention; task load,Flexible displays; Medical imaging; Navigation systems; 'current; Condition; Intra-operative; Intra-operative information; Medical navigations; Needle-based intervention; On-body; Systems support; Task load; Thin-films; Article; clinical evaluation; computer assisted surgery; data processing; health care; human; medical information system; priority journal; visual feedback; Needles
An Extensive Study on Cross-Dataset Bias and Evaluation Metrics Interpretation for Machine Learning Applied to Gastrointestinal Tract Abnormality Classification,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091133847&doi=10.1145%2f3386295&partnerID=40&md5=8acfe7f39ccf2359f0745d7600967843,"Precise and efficient automated identification of gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases can help doctors treat more patients and improve the rate of disease detection and identification. Currently, automatic analysis of diseases in the GI tract is a hot topic in both computer science and medical-related journals. Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete or simply wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets, and cross-dataset evaluations are rarely performed. A clear understanding of evaluation metrics and machine learning models with cross datasets is crucial to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Toward this goal, we present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models using global features and deep neural networks that can classify 16 different key types of GI tract conditions, including pathological findings, anatomical landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal findings from images captured by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we introduce performance hexagons using six performance metrics, such as recall, precision, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient to demonstrate how to determine the real capabilities of models rather than evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset evaluations using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset evaluations, we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable model that could be used across different hospitals. Our experiments clearly show that more sophisticated performance metrics and evaluation methods need to be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations of the splits of the same dataset - that is, the performance metrics should always be interpreted together rather than relying on a single metric. © 2020 ACM.",computer-aided diagnosis; cross-dataset evaluations; CVC-12K; CVC-356; CVC-612; deep learning; gastrointestinal tract diseases; global features; Kvasir; Medical; multi-class classification; Nerthus; polyp classification,Computer aided diagnosis; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Quality control; Statistical tests; Cross-dataset evaluation; CVC-12k; CVC-356; CVC-612; Deep learning; Gastrointestinal tract; Gastrointestinal tract disease; Global feature; Kvasir; Medical; Multi-class classification; Nerthus; Polyp classification; anatomic landmark; Article; classifier; controlled study; correlation coefficient; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; esophagitis; evaluation study; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal polyposis; gastrointestinal tract examination; human; machine learning; major clinical study; medical information; metric system; priority journal; selection bias; ulcerative colitis; Classification (of information)

Inspired by the enormous potential of IoT technology, this research provides a framework for an IoT-based smart toilet system, which enables home-based determination of Urinary Infection (UI) efficaciously. The overall system comprises a four-layered architecture for monitoring and predicting infection in urine. The layers include the Urine Acquisition, Urine Analyzation, Temporal Extraction, and Temporal Prediction layers, which enable an individual to monitor his or her health on daily basis and predict UI so that precautionary measures can be taken at early stages. Moreover, probabilistic quantification of urine infection in the form of Degree of Infectiousness (DoI) and Infection Index Value (IIV) were performed for infection prediction based on a temporal Artificial Neural Network. In addition, the presence of UI is displayed to the user based on a Self-Organized Mapping technique. For validation purposes, numerous experimental simulations were performed on four individuals for 60 days. Results were compared with different state-of-the-art techniques for measuring the overall efficiency of the proposed system. © 2020 ACM.",Internet of Things; smart toilet system; SOM visualization; temporal prediction,Forecasting; Health care; Neural networks; Health care application; Healthcare industry; Home-based; Internet of things technologies; Layered architecture; Precautionary measures; Probabilistic quantification; Smart toilet system; SOM visualization; Temporal prediction; Article; artificial neural network; clinical assessment; health care; home care; human; internet of things; priority journal; self concept; toileting; urinary tract infection; Internet of things
Continuous Detection of Physiological Stress with Commodity Hardware,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089762071&doi=10.1145%2f3361562&partnerID=40&md5=c1a61e814e44f847ca6fbdac5ea36b9f,"Timely detection of an individual's stress level has the potential to improve stress management, thereby reducing the risk of adverse health consequences that may arise due to mismanagement of stress. Recent advances in wearable sensing have resulted in multiple approaches to detect and monitor stress with varying levels of accuracy. The most accurate methods, however, rely on clinical-grade sensors to measure physiological signals; they are often bulky, custom made, and expensive, hence limiting their adoption by researchers and the general public. In this article, we explore the viability of commercially available off-the-shelf sensors for stress monitoring. The idea is to be able to use cheap, nonclinical sensors to capture physiological signals and make inferences about the wearer's stress level based on that data. We describe a system involving a popular off-the-shelf heart rate monitor, the Polar H7; we evaluated our system with 26 participants in both a controlled lab setting with three well-validated stress-inducing stimuli and in free-living field conditions. Our analysis shows that using the off-the-shelf sensor alone, we were able to detect stressful events with an F1-score of up to 0.87 in the lab and 0.66 in the field, on par with clinical-grade sensors. © 2020 ACM.",commodity wearables; mental health; mobile health (mHealth); Stress detection,Health risks; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Wearable sensors; Commodity hardware; Commodity wearables; Continuous detections; Mental health; Mobile health; Physiological signals; Physiological stress; Stress detection; Stress levels; Stress management; adult; Article; data processing; detection algorithm; ecological momentary assessment; electrodermal response; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; male; mental stress; physical activity; physiological stress; priority journal; RR interval; self report; skin conductance; young adult; mHealth

Once the catheter has entered the skull, its tip cannot be seen. The neurosurgeon has to imagine its location inside the cranium and direct it toward the ventricle using only anatomic landmarks. The EVD catheter is thin and thus hard to track using infra-red depth sensors. Traditional optical tracking using fiducial or other markers inevitably changes the shape or weight of the medical instrument. We present an augmented reality system that depicts the catheter for EVD and a new technique to precisely track the catheter inside the skull. Our technique uses a new linear marker detection method that requires minimal changes to the catheter and is well suited for tracking other thin medical devices that require high-precision tracking. © 2020 ACM.",5DoF tracking; assisted surgery; Augmented reality; catheter placement; external ventricular drain,Catheters; Cerebrospinal fluid; 5dof tracking; Assisted surgeries; Catheter placement; Depth sensors; External ventricular drain; High-precision; Infra red; Intracranial pressure; Medical procedures; Optical tracking; Article; augmented reality; brain; eye tracking; human; image processing; image segmentation; imaging algorithm; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; priority journal; ventriculostomy; Augmented reality
Context-Aware Sensing via Dynamic Programming for Edge-Assisted Wearable Systems,2020,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125719090&doi=10.1145%2f3351286&partnerID=40&md5=3a3b5db8483daa307628f2030d1c724f,"Healthcare applications supported by the Internet of Things enable personalized monitoring of a patient in everyday settings. Such applications often consist of battery-powered sensors coupled to smart gateways at the edge layer. Smart gateways offer several local computing and storage services (e.g., data aggregation, compression, local decision making), and also provide an opportunity for implementing local closed-loop optimization of different parameters of the sensor layer, particularly energy consumption. To implement efficient optimization methods, information regarding the context and state of patients need to be considered to find opportunities to adjust energy to demanded accuracy. Edge-assisted optimization can manage energy consumption of the sensor layer but may also adversely affect the quality of sensed data, which could compromise the reliable detection of health deterioration risk factors. In this article, we propose two approaches: myopic and Markov decision processes (MDPs) - to consider both energy constraints and risk factor requirements for achieving a twofold goal: energy savings while satisfying accuracy requirements of abnormality detection in a patient's vital signs. Vital signs, including heart rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation, are extracted from a photoplethysmogram signal and errors of extracted features are compared to a ground truth that is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. We control the sensor's sensing energy to minimize the power consumption while meeting a desired level of satisfactory detection performance. We present experimental results on realistic case studies using a reconfigurable photoplethysmogram sensor in an IoT system, and show that compared to nonadaptive methods, myopic reduces an average of 16.9% in sensing energy consumption with the maximum probability of abnormality misdetection on the order of 0.17 in a 24-hour health monitoring system. In addition, over 4 weeks of monitoring, we demonstrate that our MDP policy can extend the battery life on average of more than 2x while fulfilling the same average probability of misdetection compared to the myopic method. We illustrate results comparing myopic, MDP, and nonadaptive methods to monitor 14 subjects over 1 month. © 2020 ACM.",abnormality detection; context awareness; edge-assisted control; edge/fog computing; energy efficiency; Health monitoring; Internet of Things; wearable electronics,Behavioral research; Decision making; Deterioration; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Green computing; Health risks; Markov processes; Sensor nodes; Wearable sensors; Abnormality detection; Context- awareness; Edge-assisted control; Edge/fog computing; Energy; Energy-consumption; Health monitoring; Markov Decision Processes; Risk factors; Sensor layers; Article; energy conservation; energy consumption; feature extraction; female; human; human experiment; internet of things; kernel method; Markov decision process; myopic method; normal human; patient monitoring; pregnant woman; priority journal; statistical model; vital sign; Internet of things

These studies were based on self-identification of illness and were limited in that diagnostic information could not be shared with screened individuals. Here I report on two studies that overcome these limitations. Advertisements were displayed on the Bing and Google ads systems to people who sought to self-diagnose one of three types of cancer. People who clicked on these ads were provided with clinically verified questionnaires and the outcomes of these questionnaires. A classifier trained to predict suspected cancer, inferred from questionnaire responses, from past Bing queries reached an area under the curve of 0.64. People who received information that their symptoms were consistent with suspected cancer increased searches for healthcare utilization. In a second study, questionnaire responses provided to the conversion optimization mechanism of the Google advertisement system enabled it to learn to identify people who were likely to have suspected cancer. Following a training period of approximately 10 days, 11% of people selected for showing of targeted campaign ads were found to have suspected cancer. These results demonstrate the utility of using modern advertising systems to identify people who are likely suffering from serious medical conditions. © 2020 ACM.",Cancer diagnosis; search advertising,Diagnosis; Diseases; Marketing; Surveys; Advertising systems; Advertizing; Areas under the curves; Cancer diagnosis; Diagnostics informations; Google+; Healthcare utilization; Internet advertizing; Search advertizing; Self-diagnose; access to information; advertising; Article; breast cancer; cancer screening; classifier; colon cancer; health care utilization; human; Internet; lung cancer; malignant neoplasm; medical informatics; prediction error; predictive value; priority journal; public health campaign; questionnaire; search engine; Search engines

We developed and piloted a data collection system in a clinical study that involved 25 heart failure patients recently discharged. The results demonstrated the feasibility of continuously monitoring outpatients using wristbands. We observed high levels of patient compliance in wearing the wristbands regularly and satisfactory yield, latency, and reliability of data collection from the wristbands to a cloud-based database. Finally, we explored a set of machine learning models to predict deterioration based on the Fitbit data. Through fivefold cross-validation, K nearest neighbor achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8667 for identifying patients at risk of deterioration using the data collected from the beginning of the monitoring. Machine learning models based on multimodal data (step, sleep, and heart rate) significantly outperformed the traditional clinical approach based on LACE index.

In this article, we consider how to integrate sparsely sampled longitudinal data, missing measurements informative of the underlying health status, and static information to estimate (dynamically, as new information becomes available) personalized survival distributions. We achieve this by developing a nonparametric probabilistic model that generates survival trajectories, and corresponding uncertainty estimates, from an ensemble of Bayesian trees in which time is incorporated explicitly to learn variable interactions over time, without needing to specify the longitudinal process beforehand. As such, the changing influence on survival of variables over time is inferred from the data directly, which we analyze with post-processing statistics derived from our model. © 2020 ACM.",Bayesian nonparametrics; survival analysis,Medical computing; penicillamine; Bayesian nonparametrics; Data missing; Flexible model; Information contents; Learn+; Longitudinal data; Medical data; Medical record; Patient history; Survival analysis; aortic valve replacement; Article; computer analysis; electronic medical record; event free survival; follow up; health status; human; liver failure; machine learning; mathematical model; medical informatics; patient information; performance indicator; primary biliary cirrhosis; priority journal; recurrent neural network; survival analysis; survival prediction; survival rate; survival time; Uncertainty analysis

Recent systems leverage advanced deep learning techniques and electronic health records to provide a more timely and precise result. Many of these techniques have been developed with a common focus on predicting upcoming medical events. However, although the prediction results from these approaches are promising, their value is limited by their lack of interpretability. To address this challenge, we introduce CarePre, an intelligent clinical decision assistance system. The system extends a state-of-the-art deep learning model to predict upcoming diagnosis events for a focal patient based on his or her historical medical records. The system includes an interactive framework together with intuitive visualizations designed to support diagnosis, treatment outcome analysis, and the interpretation of the analysis results.

Rich multi-modal datasets from mobile sensors and advances in machine learning are today enabling new kinds of associations to be made between combinations of behaviors objectively assessed from daily life and self-reported levels of stress, mood, and health. In this article, we present a framework to (1) map multi-modal messy data collected in the ""wild""to meaningful feature representations of health-related behaviors, (2) uncover latent patterns comprising combinations of behaviors that best predict health and well-being, and (3) use these learned patterns to make evidence-based recommendations that may improve health and well-being. We show how to use supervised latent Dirichlet allocation to model the observed behaviors, and we apply variational inference to uncover the latent patterns. Implementing and evaluating the model on 5,397 days of data from a group of 244 college students, we find that these latent patterns are indeed predictive of daily self-reported levels of stressed-calm, sad-happy, and sick-healthy states. We investigate the patterns of modifiable behaviors present on different days and uncover several ways in which they relate to stress, mood, and health.

In the subset of user studies, we find that patients and the general public express concerns about privacy and security with technologies like electronic health records (EHRs). Furthermore, our analysis shows that healthcare professionals often have low awareness of risks related to data security. Additionally, our analysis revealed that most research focuses narrowly on large hospitals, neglecting private practices and the unique challenges they face. We conclude by identifying research gaps and providing potential solutions to enable robust data security for sensitive patient data.

Loss Relaxation Strategy for Noisy Facial Video-based Automatic Depression Recognition,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191662788&doi=10.1145%2f3648696&partnerID=40&md5=0bfd77e1ac7b48d2fac2485083cd7f1e,"Automatic depression analysis has been widely investigated on face videos that have been carefully collected and annotated in lab conditions. However, videos collected under real-world conditions may suffer from various types of noise due to challenging data acquisition conditions and lack of annotators. Although deep learning (DL) models frequently show excellent depression analysis performances on datasets collected in controlled lab conditions, such noise may degrade their generalization abilities for real-world depression analysis tasks. In this article, we uncovered that noisy facial data and annotations consistently change the distribution of training losses for facial depression DL models; i.e., noisy data-label pairs cause larger loss values compared to clean data-label pairs. Since different loss functions could be applied depending on the employed model and task, we propose a generic loss function relaxation strategy that can jointly reduce the negative impact of various noisy data and annotation problems occurring in both classification and regression loss functions for face video-based depression analysis, where the parameters of the proposed strategy can be automatically adapted during depression model training. The experimental results on 25 different artificially created noisy depression conditions (i.e., five noise types with five different noise levels) show that our loss relaxation strategy can clearly enhance both classification and regression loss functions, enabling the generation of superior face video-based depression analysis models under almost all noisy conditions. Our approach is robust to its main variable settings and can adaptively and automatically obtain its parameters during training. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Depression classification; depression severity estimation; facial video analysis; loss relaxation strategy; noisy data and annotation,Deep learning; Face recognition; Condition; Depression classification; Depression severity estimation; Facial video analyse; Loss functions; Loss relaxation strategy; Noisy data; Noisy data and annotation; Relaxation strategies; Video analysis; algorithm; analytic method; analytical parameters; Article; automatic depression recognition; Beck Depression Inventory; classification algorithm; comparative study; computer analysis; depression; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; disease severity; human; loss relaxation strategy; noise; noisy facial video; videorecording; Data acquisition
Walking Wizard - A Truly Wearable EEG Headset for Everyday Use,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191652878&doi=10.1145%2f3648106&partnerID=40&md5=ff3482a89cb8e9685fca7a729992a253,"Electroencephalography (EEG) provides an opportunity to gain insights to electrocortical activity without the need for invasive technology. While increasingly used in various application areas, EEG headsets tend to be suited only to a laboratory environment due to the long preparation time to don the headset and the need for users to remain stationary. We present our design of a dry, dual-electrodes flexible PCB assembly that realizes accurate sensing in the face of practical motion artifacts. Using it, we present WalkingWizard, our prototype dry-electrode EEG baseball cap that can be used under motion in everyday scenarios. We first evaluated its hardware performance by comparing its electrode-scalp impedance and ability to capture alpha rhythm against both wet EEG and commercially available dry EEG headsets. We then tested WalkingWizard using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) experiments, achieving high classification accuracy of 87% for walking speeds up to 5.0 km/h, beating state-of-the-art. Expanding on WalkingWizard, we integrated all necessary electronic components into a flexible PCB assembly - realizing WalkingWizard Integrated, in a truly wearable form-factor. Utilizing WalkingWizard Integrated, we demonstrated several applications as proof-of-concept: classification of SSVEP in VR environment while walking, real-time acquisition of emotional state of users while moving around the neighbourhood, and understanding the effect of guided meditation for relaxation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",brain-computer interface (BCI); dry-contact electrode; Mobile electroencephalogram (EEG); SSVEP; wearable sensors,Brain computer interface; Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Interactive computer graphics; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; sodium chloride; 'Dry' [; Brain-computer interface; Contact electrodes; Dry contact; Dry-contact electrode; Electrocortical activity; Gain insight; Mobile electroencephalogram; PCB assembly; Steady-state visual evoked potentials; adult; Article; biocompatibility; biomedical engineering; cycling; deep learning; electroencephalogram; female; gold standard; head movement; health care; human; impedance; locomotion; major clinical study; male; motion; noise reduction; proof of concept; steady state; visual evoked potential; walking speed; Electroencephalography
Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Electronic Health Records with Graph Kernel Infomax,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191791468&doi=10.1145%2f3648695&partnerID=40&md5=385316144c8c1910dbb5b473abcd7d1e,"Learning Electronic Health Records (EHRs) representation is a preeminent yet under-discovered research topic. It benefits various clinical decision support applications, e.g., medication outcome prediction or patient similarity search. Current approaches focus on task-specific label supervision on vectorized sequential EHR, which is not applicable to large-scale unsupervised scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning has shown great success in self-supervised representation learning problems. However, complex temporality often degrades the performance. We propose Graph Kernel Infomax, a self-supervised graph kernel learning approach on the graphical representation of EHR, to overcome the previous problems. Unlike the state-of-the-art, we do not change the graph structure to construct augmented views. Instead, we use Kernel Subspace Augmentation to embed nodes into two geometrically different manifold views. The entire framework is trained by contrasting nodes and graph representations on those two manifold views through the commonly used contrastive objectives. Empirically, using publicly available benchmark EHR datasets, our approach yields performance on clinical downstream tasks that exceeds the state-of-the-art. Theoretically, the variation in distance metrics naturally creates different views as data augmentation without changing graph structures. Practically, our method is non-ad hoc and confirms superior performance on commonly used graph benchmark datasets. Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

GPU Acceleration of a Conjugate Exponential Model for Cancer Tissue Heterogeneity,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191856742&doi=10.1145%2f3643710&partnerID=40&md5=d964a7c2ab270be07866270df35e4e4a,"Heterogeneity in the cell population of cancer tissues poses many challenges in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Studying the heterogeneity in cell populations from gene expression measurement data in the context of cancer research is a problem of paramount importance. In addition, reducing the computation time of the algorithms that deal with high volumes of data has its obvious merits. Parallelizable models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are typically slow. This article presents a novel, computationally efficient, and parallelizable model to analyze heterogeneity in cancer tissues using GPUs. Because our model is parallelizable, the input data size does not affect the computation time much, provided the hardware resources are not exhausted. Our model uses qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) gene expression measurements to study heterogeneity in cancer tissue. We compute the cell proportion breakup by accelerating variational methods on a GPU. We test this model on synthetic and real-world gene expression data collected from fibroblasts and compare the performance of our algorithm with those of Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation maximization. Our new model is computationally less complex and faster than existing Bayesian models for estimating cancer tissue heterogeneity. Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

Interpretable Trend Analysis Neural Networks for Longitudinal Data Analysis,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191786017&doi=10.1145%2f3648105&partnerID=40&md5=8a7e71eaed88afb5ff8e6dc5f8837835,"Cohort study is one of the most commonly used study methods in medical and public health researches, which result in longitudinal data. Conventional statistical models and machine learning methods are not capable of modeling the evolution trend of the variables in longitudinal data. In this article, we propose a Trend Analysis Neural Networks (TANN), which models the evolution trend of the variables by adaptive feature learning. TANN was tested on dataset of Kaiuan research. The task was to predict occurrence of cardiovascular events within 2 and 5 years, with three repeated medical examinations during 2008 and 2013. For 2-year prediction, The AUC of the TANN is 0.7378, which is a significant improvement than that of conventional methods, while that of TRNS, RNN, DNN, GBDT, RF, and LR are 0.7222, 0.7034, 0.7054, 0.7136, 0.7160, and 0.7024, respectively. For 5-year prediction, TANN also shows improvement. The experimental results show that the proposed TANN achieves better prediction performance on cardiovascular events prediction than conventional models. Furthermore, by analyzing the weights of TANN, we could find out important trends of the indicators, which are ignored by conventional machine learning models. The trend discovery mechanism interprets the model well. TANN is an appropriate balance between high performance and interpretability. Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

To address the challenges of limited and hard-to-annotate medical data, we introduce multi-modality data augmentation (MDA) and cross-modality group convolution (CGC). In the pre-training phase, we leverage Simple Siamese networks to maximize the similarity between two augmented MR images from a patient, without a handcrafted pretext task. Our approach also combines 3D and 2D group convolution with a channel shuffle operation to efficiently incorporate different modalities of image features. Evaluation on liver MR images from a well-known hospital in Taiwan demonstrates a significant improvement over previous methods.

Time series data from multiple modalities such as physiological and motion sensor data have proven to be integral for measuring and quantifying emotions. Monitoring emotional trajectories over long periods of time inherits some critical limitations in relation to the size of the training data. This shortcoming may hinder the development of reliable and accurate machine learning models. To address this problem, this article proposes a framework to tackle the limitation in performing emotional state recognition: (1) encoding time series data into coloured images; (2) leveraging pre-trained object recognition models to apply a Transfer Learning (TL) approach using the images from step 1; (3) utilising a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion classification from physiological data; (4) concatenating the pre-trained TL model with the 1D CNN. We demonstrate that model performance when inferring real-worldwellbeing rated on a 5-point Likert scale can be enhanced using our framework, resulting in up to 98.5% accuracy, outperforming a conventional CNN by 4.5%. Subject-independent models using the same approach resulted in an average of 72.3% accuracy (SD 0.038).

A Comprehensive Picture of Factors Affecting UserWillingness to Use Mobile Health Applications,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183321426&doi=10.1145%2f3626962&partnerID=40&md5=8441556f10689ce8f9aa7a0b105145bf,"Mobile health (mHealth) applications have become increasingly valuable in preventive healthcare and in reducing the burden on healthcare organizations. The aim of this article is to investigate the factors that influence user acceptance of mHealth apps and identify the underlying structure that shapes users' behavioral intention. An online study that employed factorial survey design with vignettes was conducted, and a total of 1,669 participants from eight countries across four continents were included in the study. Structural equation modeling was employed to quantitatively assess how various factors collectively contribute to users' willingness to use mHealth apps. The results indicate that users' digital literacy has the strongest impact on their willingness to use them, followed by their online habit of sharing personal information. Users' concerns about personal privacy only had a weak impact. Furthermore, users' demographic background, such as their country of residence, age, ethnicity, and education, has a significant moderating effect. Our findings have implications for app designers, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers. Efforts are needed to regulate data collection and sharing and promote digital literacy among the general population to facilitate the widespread adoption of mHealth apps.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Inter-Beat Interval Estimation with Tiramisu Model: A Novel Approach with Reduced Error,2024,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183327641&doi=10.1145%2f3616020&partnerID=40&md5=a21187d2344a4604116f42e1d98a32bf,"Inter-beat interval (IBI) measurement enables estimation of heart-tare variability (HRV) which, in turn, can provide early indication of potential cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, extracting IBIs from noisy signals is challenging since the morphology of the signal gets distorted in the presence of noise. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of a person in heavy motion is highly corrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is inaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system development, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have become an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from conventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in signal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to accuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning approach leveraging tiramisu autoencoder model to suppress motion-artifact noise and make the R-peaks of the ECG signal prominent even in the presence of high-intensity motion. After denoising, IBIs are estimated more accurately expediting diagnosis tasks. Results illustrate that our method enables IBI estimation from noisy ECG signals with SNR up to -30 dB with average root mean square error (RMSE) of 13 milliseconds for estimated IBIs. At this noise level, our error percentage remains below 8% and outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This paper addressed this need and provided a systematic review of smart insole-based systems in the recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The review followed the PRISMA guidelines, assessing the sensing elements used, the participants involved, the activities recognised, and the algorithms employed. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of using smart insoles for recognising ADLs, showing their high performance in recognising ambulation and physical activities involving the lower body, ranging from 70% to 99.8% of Accuracy, with 13 studies over 95%. The preferred solutions have been those including machine learning. A lack of existing publicly available datasets has been identified, and the majority of the studies were conducted in controlled environments. Furthermore, no studies assessed the impact of different sampling frequencies during data collection, and a trade-off between comfort and performance has been identified between the solutions. In conclusion, real-life applications were investigated showing the benefits of smart insoles over other solutions and placing more emphasis on the capabilities of smart insoles.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",human activity recognition; machine learning; smart insoles; Systematic review,Economic and social effects; Pattern recognition; Activities of Daily Living; Activity recognition; Daily living activities; Human activity recognition; Machine-learning; Performance; Sensing elements; Smart insole; Systematic Review; Well being; algorithm; article; comfort; daily life activity; human; information processing; machine learning; mobilization; physical activity; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; systematic review; Machine learning

In ELM, the hidden node parameters are generated at random, and the output weights are computed analytically. However, even with a large number of hidden nodes, feature learning using ELM may not be efficient for natural signals due to its shallow architecture. Due to noisy signals of the smartphone sensors and high dimensional data, substantial feature engineering is required to obtain discriminant features and address the ""curse-of-dimensionality"". In traditional ML approaches, dimensionality reduction and classification are two separate and independent tasks, increasing the system's computational complexity. This research proposes a new ELM-based ensemble learning framework for human activity recognition to overcome this problem. The proposed architecture consists of two key parts: (1) Self-taught dimensionality reduction followed by classification. (2) they are bridged by ""Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transformation""(SRHT). Two different HAR datasets are used to establish the feasibility of the proposed framework.

A Deep Learning-based PPG Quality Assessment Approach for Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178036218&doi=10.1145%2f3616019&partnerID=40&md5=cda800e961329c738c45fef5890a2517,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical method to acquire various vital signs, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The PPG method is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. Unfortunately, such artifacts are inevitable in ubiquitous health monitoring, as the users are involved in various activities in their daily routines. Such low-quality PPG signals negatively impact the accuracy of the extracted health parameters, leading to inaccurate decision-making. PPG-based health monitoring necessitates a quality assessment approach to determine the signal quality according to the accuracy of the health parameters. Different studies have thus far introduced PPG signal quality assessment methods, exploiting various indicators and machine learning algorithms. These methods differentiate reliable and unreliable signals, considering morphological features of the PPG signal and focusing on the cardiac cycles. Therefore, they can be utilized for HR detection applications. However, they do not apply to HRV, as only having an acceptable shape is insufficient, and other signal factors may also affect the accuracy. In this article, we propose a deep learning-based PPG quality assessment method for HR and various HRV parameters. We employ one customized one-dimensional (1D) and three 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train models for each parameter. Reliability of each of these parameters will be evaluated against the corresponding electrocardiogram signal, using 210 hours of data collected from a home-based health monitoring application. Our results show that the proposed 1D CNN method outperforms the other 2D CNN approaches. Our 1D CNN model obtains the accuracy of 95.63%, 96.71%, 91.42%, 94.01%, and 94.81% for the HR, average of normal to normal interbeat (NN) intervals, root mean square of successive NN interval differences, standard deviation of NN intervals, and ratio of absolute power in low frequency to absolute power in high frequency ratios, respectively. Moreover, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms. We compare our best models for HR-HRV health parameters with six different state-of-the-art PPG signal quality assessment methods. Our results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the other methods. We also provide the open source model implemented in Python for the community to be integrated into their solutions.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; health monitoring; heart rate variability; Internet of Things; photoplethysmogram; signal quality assessment; wearable electronics,Biomedical signal processing; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Electrocardiography; Heart; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Photoplethysmography; Wearable technology; Assessment approaches; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Health monitoring; Health parameters; Heart rate variability; Heart-rate; Photoplethysmogram; Quality assessment; Signal quality assessment; adult; Article; case study; convolutional neural network; data collection method; deep learning; electrocardiogram; feature extraction; frequency; heart rate; heart rate measurement; heart rate variability; home monitoring; human; intermethod comparison; internet of things; long short term memory network; measurement accuracy; motivation; normal human; photoelectric plethysmography; physical activity; QRS complex; quality control; reliability; residual neural network; root mean squared error; RR interval; signal processing; standard; Internet of things
Improving Causal Bayesian Networks Using Expertise in Authoritative Medical Ontologies,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178044429&doi=10.1145%2f3604561&partnerID=40&md5=f20e9e6d7ee9590adc506c0d6ff0ab33,"Discovering causal relationships among symptoms is a topical issue in the analysis of observational patient datasets. A Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is a popular analytical framework for causal inference. While there are many methods and algorithms capable of learning a Bayesian network, they are reliant on the complexity and thoroughness of the algorithm and do not consider prior expertise from authoritative sources. This article proposes a novel method of extracting prior causal knowledge contained in Authoritative Medical Ontologies (AMOs) and using this prior knowledge to orient arcs in a CBN learned from observational patient data. Since AMOs are robust biomedical ontologies containing the collective knowledge of the experts who created them, utilizing the ordering information contained within them produces improved CBNs that provide additional insight into the disease domain.To demonstrate our method, we obtained prior causal ordering information among symptoms from three AMOs: (1) the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA), (2) the International Classification of Diseases Version 10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), and (3) Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). The prior ontological knowledge from these three AMOs is then used to orient arcs in a series of CBNs learned from the National Institutes of Mental Health study on Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR∗D) patient dataset using the Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) algorithm. Six distinct CBNs are generated using MMHC: an unmodified baseline model using only the algorithm, three CBNs oriented with ordered-variable pairs from MedDRA, ICD-10-CM, and SNOMED CT, and two more with ordered pairs from a combination of these AMOs. The resulting CBNs modified using ordered-variable pairs significantly change the structure of the network. The agreement between the Modified networks and the Baseline ranges from 50% to 90%. A modified network using ordering information from all ontologies obtained an agreement of 50% (10 out of 20 arcs exist in both the Baseline and Modified models) while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. This indicates that the Modified CBN reflects the causal claims in the AMOs and agrees with both the AMOs and the observational STAR∗D dataset. Furthermore, the Modified models discovered new potentially causal relationships among symptoms in the model, while eliminating weaker edges in a qualitative analysis of the significance of these relationships in existing epidemiological research.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Clinical Phenotyping with an Outcomes-driven Mixture of Experts for Patient Matching and Risk Estimation,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178031293&doi=10.1145%2f3616021&partnerID=40&md5=67a30a4b176fddf28bec7c32e5451fcb,"Observational medical data present unique opportunities for analysis of medical outcomes and treatment decision making. However, because these datasets do not contain the strict pairing of randomized control trials, matching techniques are to draw comparisons among patients. A key limitation to such techniques is verification that the variables used to model treatment decision making are also relevant in identifying the risk of major adverse events. This article explores a deep mixture of experts approach to jointly learn how to match patients and model the risk of major adverse events in patients. Although trained with information regarding treatment and outcomes, after training, the proposed model is decomposable into a network that clusters patients into phenotypes from information available before treatment. This model is validated on a dataset of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. The mixture of experts approach can predict the outcome of mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 ± 0.01 while jointly discovering five potential phenotypes of interest. The technique and interpretation allow for identifying clinically relevant phenotypes that may be used both for outcomes modeling as well as potentially evaluating individualized treatment effects.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Cardiology; cardiovascular outcomes; machine learning; medical information systems; mixture of experts,Bioinformatics; Information use; Machine learning; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Patient treatment; Risk perception; Adverse events; Cardiovascular outcome; Machine-learning; Matchings; Medical data; Mixture of experts; Phenotyping; Randomized control trials; Risk estimation; Treatment decision makings; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; cardiogenic shock; clinical feature; clinical outcome; false negative result; false positive result; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mixture of experts; mortality rate; randomized controlled trial; Cardiology
Quality-Guaranteed and Cost-Effective Population Health Profiling: A Deep Active Learning Approach,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178057405&doi=10.1145%2f3617179&partnerID=40&md5=fd61ec42d4ef394d603342488d5cac3b,"Reliability and cost are two primary considerations for profiling population-scale prevalence (PPP) of multiple non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In this paper, we exploit intra-disease and inter-disease correlation in different traditionally-sensed-areas (TS-A) to reduce the number of profiling tasks required without compromising data reliability. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called Compressive Population Health TS-A Selection (CPH-TS), which blends the state-of-the-art profile inference, data augmentation and active learning in a unified deep learning framework. It can actively select the minimum number of TS-A regions for profiling task allocation in each profiling cycle, while deducing the missing data on the unprofiled regions with a probabilistic guarantee of reliability. We evaluate our approach on real-world prevalence datasets of London, which shows the effectiveness of CPH-TS. In general, CPH-TS assigned 11.1-27.3% fewer tasks than baselines, assigning tasks to only 34.7% of the sub-regions while the profiling error was below 5% for 95% of the cycles.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

SCouT: Synthetic Counterfactuals via Spatiotemporal Transformers for Actionable Healthcare,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178037800&doi=10.1145%2f3617180&partnerID=40&md5=7b812468b0cc974508ff90c7beda6737,"The synthetic control method has pioneered a class of powerful data-driven techniques to estimate the counterfactual reality of a unit from donor units. At its core, the technique involves a linear model fitted on the pre-intervention period that combines donor outcomes to yield the counterfactual. However, linearly combining spatial information at each time instance using time-agnostic weights fails to capture important inter-unit and intra-unit temporal contexts and complex nonlinear dynamics of real data. We instead propose an approach to use local spatiotemporal information before the onset of the intervention as a promising way to estimate the counterfactual sequence. To this end, we suggest a Transformer model that leverages particular positional embeddings, a modified decoder attention mask, and a novel pre-training task to perform spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence modeling. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the efficacy of our method in the typical small donor pool setting and its robustness against noise. We also generate actionable healthcare insights at the population and patient levels by simulating a state-wide public health policy to evaluate its effectiveness, an in silico trial for asthma medications to support randomized controlled trials, and a medical intervention for patients with Friedreich's ataxia to improve clinical decision making and promote personalized therapy (code is available at https://github.com/JHA-Lab/scout).  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Ophthalmologists use it during eye examinations to screen, diagnose, and monitor the progress of retinal diseases or conditions such as diabetes, age-marked degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and many more ocular ailments. Developments in ocular optical systems, image acquisition, processing, and management techniques over the past few years have contributed to the use of fundus images to monitor eye conditions and other related health complications.This review summarizes the various state-of-the-art technologies related to the fundus imaging device, analysis techniques, and their potential applications for ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, AMD, cataracts, and ROP. We also present potential opportunities for fundus imaging-based affordable, noninvasive devices for scanning, monitoring, and predicting ocular health conditions and providing other physiological information, for example, heart rate (HR), blood components, pulse rate, heart rate variability (HRV), retinal blood perfusion, and more.

However, there is scarce evidence of such technological interventions' effectiveness, and there are no standardized methods to evaluate their impact on people's physical activity and health. This work aims to help ST practitioners and researchers by empowering them with systematic guidelines and a framework for designing and evaluating technological interventions to facilitate health behavior change and user engagement, focusing on increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentariness. To this end, we conduct a literature review of 129 papers between 2008 and 2022, which identifies the core ST design principles and their efficacy, as well as the most comprehensive list to date of user engagement evaluation metrics for ST. Based on the review's findings, we propose PAST SELF, a framework to guide the design and evaluation of ST technology that has potential applications in industrial and scientific settings. Finally, to facilitate researchers and practitioners, we complement this article with an open corpus and an online, adaptive exploration tool for the PAST SELF data.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Data-driven Energy-efficient Adaptive Sampling Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171746581&doi=10.1145%2f3598301&partnerID=40&md5=ac8d3e83c1e296c7592366a9ce1ab78b,"This article presents a resource-efficient adaptive sampling methodology for classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into different heart rhythms. We present our methodology in two folds: (i) the design of a novel real-time adaptive neural network architecture capable of classifying ECG signals with different sampling rates and (ii) a runtime implementation of sampling rate control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By using essential morphological details contained in the heartbeat waveform, the DRL agent can control the sampling rate and effectively reduce energy consumption at runtime. To evaluate our adaptive classifier, we use the MIT-BIH database and the recommendation of the AAMI to train the classifiers. The classifier is designed to recognize three major types of arrhythmias, which are supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB), ventricular ectopic beats (VEB), and normal beats (N). The performance of the arrhythmia classification reaches an accuracy of 97.2% for SVEB and 97.6% for VEB beats. Moreover, the designed system is 7.3× more energy-efficient compared to the baseline architecture, where the adaptive sampling rate is not utilized. The proposed methodology can provide reliable and accurate real-time ECG signal analysis with performances comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Given its time-efficient, low-complexity, and low-memory-usage characteristics, the proposed methodology is also suitable for practical ECG applications, in our case for arrhythmia classification, using resource-constrained devices, especially wearable healthcare devices and implanted medical devices.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Adaptive sampling; energy-efficient; heart rate; real-time; wearable devices,Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diseases; Electrocardiograms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Signal sampling; Wearable technology; Adaptive sampling; Ectopic beats; Electrocardiogram signal; Energy efficient; Heart-rate; Real- time; Reinforcement learnings; Runtimes; Sampling rates; Wearable devices; Article; classification algorithm; classifier; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; detection algorithm; dimensionality reduction; electrocardiogram; energy conservation; energy consumption; false negative result; false positive result; Fourier transform; heart arrhythmia; heart beat; heart rhythm; heart ventricle extrasystole; image processing; image segmentation; intermethod comparison; machine learning; Markov decision process; measurement accuracy; predictive value; Q learning; reinforcement learning (machine learning); sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; supraventricular premature beat; waveform; wavelet transform; Reinforcement learning

Generalizable and automatic DN identification for such edge cases is even more challenging in the presence of unexpected ABP waveform deformations that happen due to internal and external noise sources or pathological conditions that cause hemodynamic instability. We propose a physics-aware approach, named Physiowise (PW), that first employs a cardiovascular model to augment the original ABP waveform and reduce unexpected deformations, then apply a set of predefined rules on the augmented signal to find DN locations. We have tested the proposed method on in-vivo data gathered from 14 pigs under hemorrhage and sepsis study. Our result indicates 52% overall mean error improvement with 16% higher detection accuracy within the lowest permitted error range of 30 ms. An additional hybrid methodology is also proposed to allow combining augmentation with any application-specific user-defined rule set.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

For the individual, T2D is a complex, multi-dimensional, and long-Term challenge to manage, and it is challenging to establish and maintain good communication between the patient and healthcare professionals. This article presents DiaFocus, which is a mobile health sensing application for long-Term ambulatory management of T2D. DiaFocus supports an adaptive collection of physiological, behavioral, and contextual data in combination with ecological assessments of psycho-social factors. This data is used for improving patient-clinician communication during consultations. DiaFocus is built using a generic data collection framework for mobile and wearable sensing and is highly extensible and customizable. We deployed DiaFocus in a 6-week feasibility study involving 12 patients with T2D. The patients found the DiaFocus approach and system useful and usable for diabetes management. Most patients would use such a system, if available as part of their treatment. Analysis of the collected data shows that mobile sensing is feasible for longitudinal ambulatory assessment of T2D, and helped identify the most appropriate target users being early diagnosed and technically literate T2D patients.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Machine-aided PPG Signal Quality Assessment (SQA) for Multi-mode Physiological Signal Monitoring,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162155021&doi=10.1145%2f3587256&partnerID=40&md5=671b633b95bdd67c3fafe26cb5420e79,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for recording human vital signs. PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%). The proposed method enhances accuracy in monitoring physiological signals and thus is suitable for healthcare applications.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

TS-GAN: Time-series GAN for Sensor-based Health Data Augmentation,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162106151&doi=10.1145%2f3583593&partnerID=40&md5=9ca18de748b24143d69d9a4c86201bc7,"Deep learning has achieved significant success on intelligent medical treatments, such as automatic diagnosis and analysis of medical data. To train an automatic diagnosis system with high accuracy and strong robustness in healthcare, sufficient training data are required when using deep learning-based methods. However, given that the data collected by sensors that are embedded in medical or mobile devices are inadequate, it is challenging to train an effective and efficient classification model with state-of-The-Art performance. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose TS-GAN, a Time-series GAN architecture based on long short-Term memory (LSTM) networks for sensor-based health data augmentation, thereby improving the performance of deep learning-based classification models. TS-GAN aims to learn a generative model that creates time-series data with the same space and time dependence as the real data. Specifically, we design an LSTM-based generator for creating realistic data and an LSTM-based discriminator for determining how similar the generated data are to real data. In particular, we design a sequential-squeeze-And-excitation module in the LSTM-based discriminator to better understand space dependence of real data, and apply the gradient penalty originated from Wasserstein GANs in the training process to stabilize the optimization. We conduct comparative experiments to evaluate the performance of TS-GAN with TimeGAN, C-RNN-GAN and Conditional Wasserstein GANs through discriminator loss, maximum mean discrepancy, visualization methods and classification accuracy on health datasets of ECG_200, NonInvasiveFatalECG_Thorax1, and mHealth, respectively. The experimental results show that TS-GAN exceeds other state-of-The-Art time-series GANs in almost all the evaluation metrics, and the classifier trained on synthetic datasets generated by TS-GAN achieves the highest classification accuracy of 97.50% on ECG_200, 94.12% on NonInvasiveFatalECG_Thorax1, and 98.12% on mHealth, respectively.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Measuring the sensation of pain and the effect of a treatment has always been a challenge for healthcare. Here, we study how the movement data, collected while using a virtual reality (VR) program, could be used as an objective measurement in patients with CLBP. A specific data collection method based on VR was developed and used with CLBP patients and healthy volunteers. We demonstrate that the movement data in VR can be used to classify individuals in these two groups with a high accuracy by using logistic regression. The most discriminative features are the duration of the movements and the total variation of movement velocity. Furthermore, we show that hidden Markov models can divide movement data into meaningful segments, which creates possibilities for defining even more detailed features, with potential to improve accuracy, when larger datasets become available in the future.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Chronic low back pain; digital biomarker; digital therapeutics; gesture recognition; hidden Markov models; movement data; time series segmentation; virtual reality,Gesture recognition; Virtual reality; Chronic low back pain; Digital biomarker; Digital therapeutic; Gestures recognition; Hidden-Markov models; Movement behaviour; Movement datum; Musculoskeletal problems; Objective measurement; Time-series segmentation; adult; Article; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; feature selection; female; gesture; hidden Markov model; human; logistic regression analysis; low back pain; male; movement (physiology); quantitative analysis; retrospective study; time series analysis; virtual reality; Hidden Markov models

The problem is challenged further in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we have access to labeled samples in the source domain but desire selecting an ITE model that achieves good performance on a target domain where only unlabeled samples are available. Existing selection techniques for UDA are designed for predictive models and are sub-optimal for causal inference because they (1) do not account for the missing counterfactuals and (2) only examine the discriminative density ratios between the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the model's predictions in the target domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains to introduce a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE models under UDA. We propose selecting models whose predictions of the effects of interventions satisfy invariant causal structures in the target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more robust to covariate shifts on a variety of datasets, including estimating the effect of ventilation in COVID-19 patients.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Due to the high-cost nature of traditional population-wise health-data collection methods, a class of sparse-sampling-completion algorithms are proposed to exploit the spatio-temporal correlation buried under the observed examples. However, for the population health data, a huge challenge for the state-of-the-art completion methods is the unstationary environment. Specifically, the underlying temporal correlation of the population health data are evolving from year to year. To this end, we propose a GAN-based year-by-year completion framework: uncertainty-aware augmented generative adversarial imputation nets (UAA-GAIN), to address the problem of unstationary environment. To further restrain the error accumulation, we develop a stronger generator as well as a stronger discriminator in the min-max equilibrium. A by-product of the augmented GAIN model allows weighting the difficulty of examples. Inspired by the idea of curriculum learning, a better training schedule is implemented in the proposed framework. We evaluate the proposed method on three real-world chronic disease datasets and the results show that UAA-GAIN outperforms other baseline methods in various settings.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesPopulation health; curriculum learning; generative adversarial network; missing data recovery,Generative adversarial networks; Population statistics; Additional key word and phrasespopulation health; Curriculum learning; Fundamental component; Health data; Health monitoring; Imputation methods; Key words; Missing data recoveries; Population health; Uncertainty; Article; chronic disease; curriculum; human; information processing; intermethod comparison; national health service; population health; Curricula

This suggests that the rich potential of detailed activity tracker data is largely under-exploited and that deeper analyses may help better understand such relationships. This is particularly true in children and adolescents who are distinct and engage more in bursts of PA. This article presents ABIPA, a machine learning-based methodology that integrates various aspects of accelerometer-based PA data into weight status prediction for adolescents. We propose a method to derive features regarding the structure of different PA time series using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The ARIMA-based PA features are combined with other individual attributes to predict weight status and the importance of these features is further unveiled. We apply ABIPA to a dataset about young adolescents (N = 206) containing, for each participant, a 7-day continuous accelerometer dataset (60 Hz, GENEActiv tracker from ActivInsights) and a range of their socio-demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle information. The results indicate that our method provides a practical approach for integrating accelerometer-based PA patterns into weight status prediction and paves the way for validating their importance in understanding obesity factors.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Methods for Analyzing Medical-Order Sequence Variants in Sequential Pattern Mining for Electronic Medical Record Systems,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152903513&doi=10.1145%2f3561825&partnerID=40&md5=e1c34f5d6baabec0859a6613cbf824ab,"Electronic medical record systems have been adopted by many large hospitals worldwide, enabling the recorded data to be analyzed by various computer-based techniques to gain a better understanding of hospital-based disease treatments. Among such techniques, sequential pattern mining, already widely used for data mining and knowledge discovery in other application domains, has shown great potential for discovering frequent patterns in sequences of disease treatments. However, studies have yet to evaluate the use of medical-order sequence variants, where a ""frequent pattern""can include some limited variations to the pattern, or have considered the factors that lead to these variants. Such a study would be meaningful for medical tasks such as improving the quality of a particular treatment method, comparing treatments with multiple hospitals, recommending the best-suited treatment for each patient, and optimizing the running costs in hospitals. This article proposes methods for evaluating medical-order sequence variants and understanding variant factors based on a statistical approach. We consider the safety and efficiency of sequences and related information about the variants, such as gender, age, and test results from hospitals. Our proposal has been demonstrated as effective by experimentally evaluating an electronic medical record system's real dataset and obtaining feedback from medical workers. The experimental results indicate that the medical treatment history and specimen test results after hospitalization are significant in identifying the factors that lead to variants.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesSequential pattern mining; electronic medical record system; sequence pattern variant,Data mining; Diseases; Medical computing; Patient treatment; antibiotic agent; blood substitute; cefazolin; laxative; Additional key word and phrasessequential pattern mining; Disease treatment; Electronic medical record system; Key words; Large hospitals; Pattern mining; Sequence pattern variant; Sequence patterns; Sequence variants; Sequential-pattern mining; adult; age; anamnesis; Article; artificial intelligence; bladder tumor; controlled study; data mining; drug cost; electronic medical record system; female; hospital; hospitalization; human; knowledge discovery; leukocyte count; male; medical information system; medical order; multivariate analysis; nonhodgkin lymphoma; patient care; platelet count; transurethral resection of the bladder; Hospitals
Transfer Learning for Human Activity Recognition Using Representational Analysis of Neural Networks,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149699788&doi=10.1145%2f3563948&partnerID=40&md5=2f40836f1ff4008b53ed3c67632741b8,"Human activity recognition (HAR) has increased in recent years due to its applications in mobile health monitoring, activity recognition, and patient rehabilitation. The typical approach is training a HAR classifier offline with known users and then using the same classifier for new users. However, the accuracy for new users can be low with this approach if their activity patterns are different than those in the training data. At the same time, training from scratch for new users is not feasible for mobile applications due to the high computational cost and training time. To address this issue, we propose a HAR transfer learning framework with two components. First, a representational analysis reveals common features that can transfer across users and user-specific features that need to be customized. Using this insight, we transfer the reusable portion of the offline classifier to new users and fine-tune only the rest. Our experiments with five datasets show up to 43% accuracy improvement and 66% training time reduction when compared to the baseline without using transfer learning. Furthermore, measurements on the hardware platform reveal that the power and energy consumption decreased by 43% and 68%, respectively, while achieving the same or higher accuracy as training from scratch. Our code is released for reproducibility.1  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesTransfer learning; human activity recognition; representational analysis,Energy utilization; Patient rehabilitation; Additional key word and phrasestransfer learning; Human activity recognition; ITS applications; Key words; Mobile health monitoring; Neural-networks; Offline; Representational analyse; Training time; Transfer learning; Article; computer vision; controlled study; convolutional neural network; correlation analysis; electrocardiogram; energy consumption; Fourier transform; human; k nearest neighbor; reproducibility; support vector machine; transfer of learning; Pattern recognition

This article presents our system SpiroMask that retrofits a microphone in consumer-grade masks (N95 and cloth masks) for continuous lung health monitoring. We evaluate our approach on 48 participants (including 14 with lung health issues) and find that we can estimate parameters such as lung volume and respiration rate within the approved error range by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).

Inferring Activity Patterns from Sparse Step Counts Data with Recurrent Neural Networks,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152889974&doi=10.1145%2f3560468&partnerID=40&md5=3ce0cc7ee92998b4e65aa4316905f001,"As an accurate measurement of physical activity, step counts data can be collected expediently by smartphones and wearable devices. Complete and high time-resolution step counts data record the time and intensity of individuals' physical activity in a day, and can be used to mine activity habits or to recommend customized workout plans. However, sparse step counts data are common in practice due to hardware and software limitations. Understanding the value of sparse step counts data can contribute to its application in healthcare, and also can help us design cost-effective hardware and software. In this article, we aim to infer activity patterns from sparse step counts data. We design a deep learning model based on recurrent neural networks, namely MLP-GRU, which considers bidirectional short-term dependency and long-term regularity of sparse step counts data, and implements data-driven imputation and classification. We also develop an interpretable and elastic method to obtain sparse step counts data labeled with multi-granular activity patterns to train MLP-GRU. Evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that MLP-GRU outperforms other strong baseline methods. The results also show that activity patterns can be inferred from extremely sparse step counts data with high accuracy, provided that proper granularity is used for data of different sparsity.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",activity patterns; Additional Key Words and PhrasesSparse step counts data; Recurrent Neural Networks; sparsity,Application programs; Computer hardware; Recurrent neural networks; Accurate measurement; Activity patterns; Additional key word and phrasessparse step count data; Count datum; Hardware and software; Inferring activities; Key words; Measurements of; Physical activity; Sparsity; adult; Article; classification algorithm; data processing; electronic health record; female; human; information processing; male; multilayer perceptron; physical activity; random forest; recurrent neural network; step count; support vector machine; time series analysis; Cost effectiveness
Security and Usability of a Personalized User Authentication Paradigm: Insights from a Longitudinal Study with Three Healthcare Organizations,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150980656&doi=10.1145%2f3564610&partnerID=40&md5=7c59873a38e02fcb94032a7115a9fa09,"This article proposes a user-adaptable and personalized authentication paradigm for healthcare organizations, which anticipates to seamlessly reflect patients' episodic and autobiographical memories to graphical and textual passwords aiming to improve the security strength of user-selected passwords and provide a positive user experience. We report on a longitudinal study that spanned over 3 years in which three public European healthcare organizations participated to design and evaluate the aforementioned paradigm. Three studies were conducted (n = 169) with different stakeholders: (1) a verification study aiming to identify existing authentication practices of the three healthcare organizations with diverse stakeholders (n = 9), (2) a patient-centric feasibility study during which users interacted with the proposed authentication system (n = 68), and (3) a human guessing attack study focusing on vulnerabilities among people sharing common experiences within location-aware images used for graphical passwords (n = 92). Results revealed that the suggested paradigm scored high with regard to users' likeability, perceived security, usability, and trust, but more importantly it assists the creation of more secure passwords. On the downside, the suggested paradigm introduces password guessing vulnerabilities by individuals sharing common experiences with the end users. Findings are expected to scaffold the design of more patient-centric knowledge-based authentication mechanisms within today's dynamic computation realms.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesKnowledge-based user authentication; feasibility user study; graphical passwords; human guessing attack study; security; usability,Knowledge based systems; Scaffolds; User interfaces; Additional key word and phrasesknowledge-based user authentication; Feasibility user study; Graphical password; Guessing attacks; Human guessing attack study; Key words; Security; Usability; User authentication; User study; adult; article; feasibility study; female; health care organization; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; security; trust; usability; vulnerability; Authentication
An Accurate Non-accelerometer-based PPG Motion Artifact Removal Technique using CycleGAN,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152900039&doi=10.1145%2f3563949&partnerID=40&md5=817eb329ea8a6704e73977263a26b18b,"A photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical technique widely used in the healthcare domain to extract valuable health-related information, e.g., heart rate variability, blood pressure, and respiration rate. PPG signals can easily be collected continuously and remotely using portable wearable devices. However, these measuring devices are vulnerable to motion artifacts caused by daily life activities. The most common ways to eliminate motion artifacts use extra accelerometer sensors, which suffer from two limitations: (i) high power consumption, and (ii) the need to integrate an accelerometer sensor in a wearable device (which is not required in certain wearables). This paper proposes a low-power non-accelerometer-based PPG motion artifacts removal method outperforming the accuracy of the existing methods. We use Cycle Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct clean PPG signals from noisy PPG signals. Our novel machine-learning-based technique achieves 9.5 times improvement in motion artifact removal compared to the state-of-the-art without using extra sensors such as an accelerometer, which leads to 45% improvement in energy efficiency.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesMachine learning; cycle GAN; deep generative models; motion artifacts removal; noise removal; PPG signals,Blood pressure; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Photoplethysmography; Wearable sensors; Additional key word and phrasesmachine learning; Artifact removal; Cycle GAN; Deep generative model; Generative model; Key words; Motion artifact; Motion artifact removal; Noises removal; Photoplethysmography signal; Article; artifact; cycle generative adversarial network; intermethod comparison; machine learning; motion; photoelectric plethysmography; signal noise ratio; Accelerometers
Synthetic Behavior Sequence Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks,2023,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152915326&doi=10.1145%2f3563950&partnerID=40&md5=040142086e32ddcfbd6d55099eb7b83f,"Due to the increase in life expectancy in advanced societies leading to an increase in population age, data-driven systems are receiving more attention to support the older people by monitoring their health. Intelligent sensor networks provide the ability to monitor their activities without interfering with routine life. Data collected from smart homes can be used in a variety of data-driven analyses, including behavior prediction. Due to privacy concerns and the cost and time required to collect data, synthetic data generation methods have been considered seriously by the research community. In this article, we introduce a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm, namely, BehavGAN, that applies GAN to the problem of behavior sequence generation. This is achieved by learning the features of a target dataset and utilizing a new application for GANs in the simulation of older people's behaviors. We also propose an effective reward function for GAN back-propagation by incorporating n-gram-based similarity measures in the reinforcement mechanism. We evaluate our proposed algorithm by generating a dataset of human behavior sequences. Our results show that BehavGAN is more effective in generating behavior sequences compared to MLE, LeakGAN, and the original SeqGAN algorithms in terms of both similarity and diversity of generated data. Our proposed algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when it comes to generating behavior sequences consisting of limited-space sequence tokens.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesBehavior sequence generation; BLEU score; Generative Adversarial Networks; reinforcement learning; SeqGAN; synthetic data,Automation; Behavioral research; Intelligent buildings; Population statistics; Reinforcement learning; Sensor networks; Additional key word and phrasesbehavior sequence generation; Behavior sequences; BLEU score; Key words; Life expectancies; Older People; Reinforcement learnings; SeqGAN; Sequence generation; Synthetic data; algorithm; Article; back propagation; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; generative adversarial network; health behavior; hidden Markov model; human; long short term memory network; machine learning; maximum likelihood method; medical information system; Monte Carlo method; natural language processing; sensitive personal information; Generative adversarial networks

Despite this increasing interest, there are very few studies on how the capability for faster strategic decision-making is developed, and whether and when one can learn to speed up strategy implementation. Drawing on organizational learning theory, behavioral theory, and an analysis of a sample of more than 2,064 divestitures, we examine how organizational slack, deal complexity and prior failure experience affect the hypothesized baseline relationship between divestiture experience and the speed of divestiture completion.",,Behavioral theory; Completion time; Organizational learning; Organizational slack; Speed up; Strategic decision making; Strategy implementations

Moreover, most teachers have a lot of and limited tasks, and most office staff are responsible for paper documents which can be easily lost and the right time of making an appointment between teachers and students is also limited. Aims: The purposes of this research were 1) to design the recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering, 2) to develop the recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering, and 3) to assess the competency of recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering. Findings: The results of the research revealed that the research instrument used was the model of assessment system. The sample group of subjects was the students of King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok with simple random sampling. The data was analyzed by simple statistics: percentage and standard deviation (S.D.). Conclusion: This research could be concluded that the success found that 1) the participants of the recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering were divided into three groups: students, teachers and office staff, 2) the recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering consisted of four development phases: planning, analysis, design, implementation, and 3) the overall efficiency of the recommendation system of student registration with collaborative filtering was at a high level (x- = 4.51) and the standard deviation (S.D.) was of 0.61. This showed that the performance of the recommendation system was efficient. Practical Implications: The students had the guideline for course enrolment through the smart registration system and the system could enhance the student's learning outcomes. The teachers could reduce the procedures and time of consultation or finding some more information to enhance the students' learning efficiency. Originality/Value: This research studied the recommendation system of student registration with the data of the students' learning outcomes by implementing the theory of data recommendation and the collaborative filtering to recommend and predict the students' learning outcomes. © 2021.

This study was conducted in Grobogan Regency, a district in Central Java, the Indonesian soybean production centre. Four hundred soybean farmers were selected for interview. The data observed are in the form of farm characteristic, capital, and production cost. Stochastic frontier production is used to analyse the technical efficiency of using production factors on soybean production income. This is considered the main culprit of the very low productivity of soybean. Further, the inefficiency model shows that no significant factor affecting efficiency. This is understandable since the production system is in the irrational stage. The main factor that is possible to influence such a condition is the level of education. On average, the level of farmers' education is just elementary school and junior high school. This condition leads to failure in adopting technology in the soybean farming system as farmers might misunderstand the advanced technology. The stochastic efficiency results indicate that this variable does not affect efficiency. Technical efficiency in soybean cultivation in Indonesia is very low. A comprehensive improvement strategy must be carried out for improvement to increase production to reduce dependence on imports. © 2021.

It is established that autonomous functions of marketing and logistics are being transformed into the integrated function of marketing logistics which should be considered as a factor of strategic development of business structures. Since marketing logistics has a coordinating aspect in relation to all actions that are in any way connected to serving customers, the implementation of marketing logistic principles into the business practice and the formation of the system presupposes the existence of an extensive digital system without which a business cannot be managed efficiently. It is determined that measuring the results of logistic management is a prerequisite for achieving the goals of the logistical system as feedback is necessary for efficient management. It is proven that an efficient logistical system can create positive support for a business structure in the attraction and implementation of the most productive distribution channels and the choice of the most efficient suppliers. It is established that if the manufacturer cannot supply the required product on time, in the requested amount and of proper quality, then the members of the distribution channels can cease the relationship with the manufacturer or stop the active promotion of the manufacturer's products. © 2021.

However, generic and reliable mechanisms for evaluating CLOs remain as challenges. The purpose of this project is to accurately evaluate the efficacy of the learning and teaching techniques through analyzing CLOs performance by using an advanced analytical model (i.e., Rasch model) in the context of engineering and business education. An association pattern between the students and the overall achieved CLO performance will be produced by this model. The sample in this project will be conducted on students who are enrolled in some nominated engineering and business courses over one academic year at Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia. This sample will consider several types of assessments, such as direct assessments (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects, and examination) and indirect assessments (e.g., surveys). The current research illustrates that the Rasch Model for measurement is able to categorize grades in accordance with course expectations and standards in a more accurate manner, thus differentiating students by their extent of educational knowledge. The results from this project will guide the educator to track and monitor the CLOs’ performance, which is identified in every course to estimate the students’ knowledge, skills, and competence levels, which will be collected from the predefined sample by the end of each semester.

One of the sectors that is given the least research attention from the aspect of strategic management is the co-operative sector. For a developing country like Malaysia, the co-operative sector is the third most important sector after the public and private sectors, which has become more significant in the country’s economic and social aspects. Unfortunately, cooperatives have been seen struggling to maintain their performance in today’s competitive business atmosphere. Despite some researchers have proven that strategic management practices have resulted in increased performance, yet there has been relatively little study of this evidence in small organizations like cooperatives. Thus, a series of three case studies were performed to establish the effect of strategic management practices on the performance of cooperatives. From the findings, three propositions (strategy formulation, strategy implementation, evaluation and control) based on the strategic management practices were confirmed to be affecting the performance of cooperatives in Malaysia.

With the introduction of worldwide lockdowns, consumer spending, workforce management and supply chains have been some of the areas most affected. These unexpected challenges force businesses to re-evaluate their strategies moving forward to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic and adapt to the slowly evolving market conditions worldwide. The paper studies the effects of the pandemic on the UAE business environment and society through analyzing the employment growth rates of different sectors in the UAE for the first quarter of 2020 and compared it with their rates pre-pandemic (2010-2019). It was found that all sectors in the UAE suffered from negative growth, concluding that the pandemic has had a clear adverse economic effect on industries in the UAE. However, the uncertainty the pandemic has created has lead businesses to strategize for survival and, in doing so, focus more on organizational resilience and risk management. To steer clear from vulnerability and risk of business failure, an “entrepreneurial hustle” is needed to provide businesses with a competitive advantage in the post-pandemic era. This paper concludes with a hopeful observation that while many sectors in the UAE suffered economically, the UAE government's hands on initiatives to save businesses across the country has left many sectors on a stronger footing to withstand the after-effects post-pandemic era may throw their way. As result, this paper recommends economic diversification in the UAE to help transition its economy to a more sustainable path. © 2021.

Actually, fishery activities provide significant support regarding food nutrition and security as well as alleviating poverty and maintaining sustainable livelihoods of the people. However, their contributions are undervalued in the global and national scale by scholars. This study assessed the impact of climate change on SSFs from the vulnerability perspective, using two livelihood vulnerability indices. Firstly, using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), and second, using IPCC Vulnerability Framework Approach (LVI-IPCC framework). The main objectives of this study were to assess the vulnerability status of SSFs communities due to the impact of climate change. To achieve the objective, data on SSF communities in three sub-districts were randomly selected. They were fishers from Chatmohor, Gurudaspur and Tarash. A total of 352 SSF households were interviewed. Overall, the results of LVI and LVI-IPCC did not change the ranking of vulnerability status as both cases the households of Tarash were found to be most vulnerable than that of Chatmohor and Gurudaspur. Moreover, this study also found that SSFs were surrounded by various problems including insufficiency in food, lack of access to cash, chronic diseases, unsafe drinking water, unemployment, lack of physical assets, lack of availability of early warning systems (EWS), and low involvement in social networking. Finally, to improve the quality of the SSF livelihoods, some changes in food policy, health facilities, informal credits access, trainings, establishing efficient EWS should be provided by the policy makers. © 2021.

The result from the findings show that there is a positive relationship between dominating style and quality of work (P=0.001). The research concludes that dominating conflict management style has a positive effect on the quality of work and that human relations theory should be imperative to managers so that they will be able to consider the issues of their workers’ wellbeing as well as how they perform in certain circumstances. The research also mentions that conflicts should be partly embraced since conflicts creates a positive drive for organizational performance dependent on how the conflict is managed. The research recommends that management should develop diverse but appropriate styles to manage conflicts as they arise before escalating to unmanageable level; management should be flexible in the adoption of styles of conflict management. The circumstances of each organization and the relationship subsisting between the parties must be allowed to determine the choice of conflict management style; conflict in whatever level should not be ignored but should be effectively managed for better quality of work and organizational performance and that workers at all levels should be trained and given the right behavioural orientation as to reduce the occurrence of conflict. © 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

To achieve its aim, the study draws on the theoretical lenses of the cultural and social role theories, and extant literature. It utilizes experiences within the continent to exemplify the topic. The study found that while women in some countries in Africa have been vocal and instrumental in the resolution of conflicts and wars, they are still neglected and marginalized in efforts to find lasting solutions to conflicts and wars. Furthermore, and relatedly, it showed that the low representation and participation of women in peacebuilding in the continent is due to the harmful cultural norms particularly, masculine and power distance values which discourage women from playing active roles and having their voices heard in peacebuilding processes. However, the evidence suggests that cultural factors tend to be considered as trivial in promoting sustainable peacebuilding because peace research and practices often ignore the role of traditions and values among parties to a conflict although cultural differences have the tendency to reinforce or delegitimize peacebuilding. Thus, to ensure sustainable peacebuilding, it is important to create equal avenues for full and adequate representation and participation of women through the institutionalization of gender inclusive composition of peacebuilding teams and empowerment of women against limiting influences of societal culture. This is because evidence indicates that when women are afforded the necessary recognition with relatively higher status in societies, it increases the prospects for sustainable and gender inclusive peacebuilding. By this, the study makes theoretical and practical contributions by integrating and applying the Hofstede’ national cultural theory and social role theory to highlight and enhance understanding of the mechanisms through which cultural values can affect women’s participation in peacebuilding and post-conflict construction in warring countries. © 2021.

Women participation in leadership is increasingly becoming topical, not just for sustainable development but also given their opportunities for empowerment, expression, agency and emancipation. It appears that women in management are negatively affected by the context of socio-cultural tradition in their operations, and that to succeed they need to overcome barriers of patriarchy. The study explored ways of how this can be done in the business sector and move beyond the glass ceiling. Qualitative research was employed in the form of document analysis whereby documents were interpreted to give meaning and voice around women leadership particularly in the private sector in Zimbabwe. Factors historically affecting women leadership and how they deal with challenges of inequality, patriarchy and discrimination are complex manifesting in different levels of culture, social and institutional, personal identity (macro, meso and micro levels). Women need a paradigm shift that strikes a balance between their managerial business roles and their domestic commitments to effectively break the ‘glass-ceiling.’ There is very little known in this area except for the public sector whose statistics are not publicly available.

While the concept of strategic agility has been gaining momentum among various key scholars, there is an outstanding gap in the literature regarding the way that critical factors among different theoretical views and disciplines can be codified and connected to provide a holistic model that enables organizations to cultivate strategic agility capabilities. Specifically, several studies that emphasize on strategic agility, identify critical factors in a single theoretical perspective, and yet the literature and empirical studies lack a holistic approach that integrates all the factors in order to provide a comprehensive overview to the field. Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper follows a narrative literature review and focuses on two main streams. Firstly, it defines the nature, and the main capabilities of strategic agility, and secondly discusses the main critical factors that facilitate strategic agility as those emerge from various theoretical perspectives. Findings/Results: The literature review indicates that strategic agility is characterized by three meta-capabilities, namely, strategic sensitivity, leadership unity, and resource fluidity and those capabilities enable organizations to participate in high-velocity competitive environments, while facing fast-paced changes in different directions. Paradox theory, ambidexterity and strategic change are found to be crucial for achieving strategic agility, where factors related to knowledge management, information technology, leadership, and human resources management specifically are identified as equally important. Originality/Value: The overall aim of the research is to bridge the gap in the literature by providing a holistic investigation towards strategic agility, as the title clearly suggests. This paper serves as a conceptual foundation based on which empirical studies can examine the integration of those factors and their intra/inter relations that enable the cultivation of the meta-capabilities of strategic agility. © 2021.

A study is essential to integrate key research findings on DCs to leverage DCs for crises effectively. However, the existing research appears to be in an embryonic phase as studies based on narrow search criteria reviewed DCs, and their findings are contextualized, fragmented, and thus not generalizable to crises. Hence, we systematically review and synthesize DC literature to date in context to crises using adapted review methodology guidelines of Tranfield.

It was not before approximately 12 or 13 years that Pakistan's commission for Higher Education (HEC) recognized the relevance with the increasing footprints worldwide and found its inclusion in higher education. Economists see entrepreneurship as a mixture of ingenuity and risk-taking. Substantial growth levels and opportunities provided to all segments of the population and the deprived are reached when such behavior flourishes. In Pakistan, the invasive role of the government in the economy seriously limits competition and risk-taking. When business wins were defined by security and promotion measures, the enterprise was transferred to pursuing government funds from those early days of organizing. The national economic policy also proposes to promote growth through a market-oriented approach in which the government regulates international trade through substantial neglect.

The socio-economic environment in the African continent, as well as, the South African society is challenged by numerous factors that are causing stagnation and lack of improvement/development from a lot of efforts and resources that are engaged to promote organisational, institutional and socio-economic transformation process. Therefore, in most cases, the political, economic and social components of the PESTIE factors are amongst the major variables that promote or affect organisational, institutional and socio-economic transformation process in Africa, including South Africa. But, specifically, understanding the role of capacity development programmes on human capital capacity development in the petroleum industry was the focus of this study in order to promoting sustainable socio-economic transformation in South Africa. Mostly, the main problem or phenomenon examined in this study involved “the critical issue of technical skills shortages” or “scarcity of technical skills”, which is affecting currently the petroleum industry development and consequently, the socio-economic transformation process in South Africa. In addition, the deficit of positive human capital capacity and skills waste were also explored as the critical factors obstructing the attempt to organisational/institutional and socio-economic transformation in South Africa. Therefore, the triangulation methods facilitated the gathering of quantitative and qualitative data from petroleum companies, members of the South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA). The results of this study indicated that (84.2%) capacity development programmes best practice in the petroleum industry can facilitate competitive advantages, increased productivity and performance, as well as opportunities for community lifestyle change; and that 77.6% of respondents attested that capacity development could promote socio-economic transformation by addressing the issue of skills development within sectors such as energy, trade, health, education, industries, politics, housing, agriculture, transportation, communal services, and tourism and recreational improvements, etc. Accordingly, this paper alert the South African community in general and particularly, major stakeholders involved in the petroleum industry about the necessity to addressing capacity development programmes as a key socio-economic factor amongst others, that could alleviate issues such as technical skills shortages, skills waste and the deficit of positive human capital capacity development in the public and private sectors. Thus, in this paper, the best practice of capacity development programmes in the South African petroleum industry was addressed as the locomotive of human capital capacity development in the workplace and as the engine of socio-economic transformation in the country. © 2021.

The higher the Team's trust in the organization, the better the Team's success at work. The chief has therefore a significant part to play in inspiring the workers to work. Building faith also requires time at work, since the followers believe behavior and not phrases. Some of the most successful methods to inspire workers and teams in the workforce are leading by example. In the office, the chief does not challenge his supporters to perform a job that he himself does not. For starters, if the leader wants to hold his followers at night, he needs to do so. The leader will then prove his colleagues that he is equivalent to his supporters at work, so that morale is improved and the workplace efficiency improves. To avoid complications and unforeseen challenges in the workforce, specific functions and obligations should be established and described.

They require the provision of this steel in different specified sizes and lengths according to the construction design. The cutting processes incur significant trim loss which is considered as waste, one of the losses that increase the cost of the project. Therefore, the “TLP is one of the most challenging issues in the context of optimisation research. The aim is to determine the optimal cutting pattern of items of various lengths from a stock of standard size material to meet the customers” needs, such that the wastage due to trim loss is minimised. In this research a mathematical model and procedure has been developed to arrange cut plans with the minimum loss to address the TLP. The integer linear programming technique is applied to generate the optimal stock procurement plan and the cutting plan for each alternative layout arrangement for a particular structural component. The programme and the approach have been evaluated using data from ten multi-storey buildings constructed in recent years in Bahrain. The results clearly show that the proposed methodology and the developed programme are capable of producing solutions in terms of reducing wastage and lowering total cost, due to the identification of the optimal cutting layout.

Design/methodology/aroach - A search for specific criteria and boolean algorithms is carried out in Web of Science and Scopus on “Marketing digital” [AND] “Fashion”, once the results are obtained, a selection of the most cited is made, and critical and analytical reading is carried out. Findings - The relationship between digital marketing and fashion companies is reviewed from a perspective of economic growth and, more specifically, from the industrial sector’s communication and marketing described above. However, the review clarifies that using social networks as virtual channels in managing reputation and engagement is not sufficiently addressed. In this sense, in a pandemic environment such as the one currently experienced, luxury fashion companies have assumed and understood the role of digital channels in building image, reputation, and desire to purchase by consumers in an environment that allows them to generate know the trends of stakeholders. Originality/value - Reviewing the evolution of digital tools in luxury fashionto build trendsbecomes essential with the increased use of social networks. There is little research with a targeted aroach to the evolution of digital marketing in luxury fashion. For this reason, the study attempts to compile the theoretical and reflective discussion in this regard, contributing to the understanding of consumer behavior in the digital environment today.

The two concepts are important areas in financial management for firms to achieve high value and growth rate. This paper examines the impact of ownership and board structures on the capital structure of firms listed on the stock exchanges of selected sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2010 to 20019. The study analyses whether ownership and board structure plays any significant role in the capital structure of the firm. The result of the panel data regression analysis reveals that concentrated ownership structure negatively impacts on debt ratio in sub-Saharan African firms. The study shows that managerial ownership and board structure explains the capital structure of firms in sub-Saharan Africa. The study demonstrates evidence of a significant negative influence of managerial shareholding and CEO's tenure on the debt ratio of listed firms in sub-Sahara Africa. The result of the study suggests that the outside directors and board size positively influence the debt ratio of listed firms in sub-Sahara African countries. Given the results of this study, it is imperative for stakeholders in the region to continually improve the ownership and board structures of the firm to avoid the negative effect of debt on performance and the value of shareholders' wealth. © 2021.

It is an essential feature that continues over the lifespan of the employee, beginning from the understanding of the person's way of life. For, e.g., the start of this cycle is seen by a child who experiences different occupations of individuals, including physicians, carpenters, and firefighters. The time remains when people continue to explore their occupations and pick the work they are doing. Developing a profession at this stage does not end. If you have chosen a profession, you have to practice and train correctly, apply for a job to be hired to step into your jobs eventually. Most individuals prefer to shift their employers at least once or twice throughout their working lives. It is important to remember that, for most individuals, job growth takes place free from other people's involvement. There is also no apparent starting age. Some people can begin their career choices very early in life, while others do not address this problem until they find themselves in need of more capital. Although many workers go individually down this route, nearly all will reap huge benefits from the skilled advice of their career. Advice from a mentor or job coach or more classes in a school that encourages professional growth will benefit further. Such form of engagement will start early in primary school and will proceed until adulthood. Many people know that they seek practical guidance while confronting challenges or making choices regarding their jobs, e.g. whether they choose to get another position or whether they choose to adjust their professions. © 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The political, economic and social factors of the PESTIE environment were examined to addressing and identifying barriers affecting the best practice of capacity development programmes in the South African petroleum industry. The heart of the phenomenon challenging the South African petroleum industry is that the petroleum industry is experiencing a critical deficit of technical skilled employees in areas that include Electrician; Boiler maker; Mechanical engineer; Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHE&Q) practitioner; Programme or Project Manager; Mechanical Fitter; Electrical Engineer; Retail Pharmacist and Chemist, etc. These technical skills are not sufficiently developed, as there are still critical issues aligned to technical skills shortages, as well as a strong demand of these categories of technical skills in the South African petroleum industry. Furthermore, in general, organisations whether in the public or private sectors of the national economy are also challenged by the deficit of positive human capital capacity and skills waste, which are obstructing the attempt to organisational/institutional vision, mission, goals and objectives achievement. In other words, the lack of capacity development best practice in the petroleum industry, associated with the aforementioned challenges are preventing organisations members of the South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA) to gain competitive advantages, to improve productivity, performance and contribute to socio-economic transformation process in the country. The triangulation methods facilitated the gathering of quantitative and qualitative data from four petroleum organisations, which were part of the investigations in order to identify the challenges affecting the best practice of capacity development programmes in the South African petroleum industry. Results revealed that challenges impacting negatively the petroleum industry are related to the political, economic and social factors. For example, respondents revealed that the lack of policies best practice (83.4%),the lack of capacity development programmes best practice (90.5%) and the lack of fully addressing and supporting capacity development programmes as a tool that can stimulate human capital capacity development in the workplace (91.7%) are amongst the key barriers affecting technical skills development in the petroleum industry.

One of such cases is the ban of involvement of public known person into the advertising activities of healthcare products in Czech Republic. Due to the fact, that Czech Republic is EU member state as well as serious opinion maker of Slovak legislatives, the impact of this regulation is international. Thus, the aim of the paper is to analyze possible scenario of transmitting Czech scenario into the Slovak legal and market reality. Similarly, on the research provided in specific Slovak national psychographic environment where similar legislative change is only matter of future, relevant conclusions applicable also in Czech environment can be stated. The reason lies in psychographic similarity of Hofstede's national profiles and common socio-political history of Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. Such an approach could be considered as cross-cultural research realized via methods of statistical hypotheses testing and internal consistency analysis of contingency table. The data were obtained by own questionnaire survey realized on the sample of 500 respondents during second quarter of year 2021. It has been found out that: 1) in healthcare sector, significant majority of consumers recognize only branded products; 2) the attention paid by consumers to the advertisements of healthcare products is growing with increasing range of disability of consumers; 3) majority of consumers react positively on the reference given by social group authority on the healthcare product and 4) the dominant category of recommending authority are doctors and erudite professionals who are in personal contact with patients. © 2021,Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

To generate impact in an enterprise, we should define organizational change as an economic, financial, cultural, human or technical shift. To stimulate corporate growth, we can also view organizational change as several theories, values, strategies and techniques which aim to change the workplace. Although the concepts accessible for characterizing organizational transition are heterogeneous, we may describe them broadly as a mechanism initiated by an organization to satisfy a resolute need for growth. Personnel engagement in decision-making not only builds confidence but also helps to deter negative and harmful attitudes and behavior. The research implemented a mixed approach methodology throughout distributing a questionnaire over 400 respondents and maintaining 370 answers, and the throughout conducting in-depth interviews in Small Medium Enterprises in Lebanon. The results revealed that change management tends to affect job satisfaction in a positive way but this change should be managed effectively and efficiently.

However, in the post-pandemic world, decision-makers and top managers should by no means rush towards the adoption of telecommuting and the other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), without measuring employees’ attitudes and without providing them with necessary support in-order to avoid side effects of Technostress. This paper presents an approach for Technostress Management that is capable of customizing the Coping Strategies (CSs) for every specific organization towards enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies to handle this phenomenon. However, the rapid change and evolution of technologies push employees to continuously update their knowledge and learn new skills, which over time become a burden on their shoulders. This burden leads to the occurrence of a different type of stress called Technostress (TS). Health Care professionals deal with this type of stress by using some strategies called CSs.

Brand activism as a development accelerate of the CSR concept moves from “greenwashing” to “walk the talk” regarding sustainability and social responsibility. Knowing that only experiential and reputational trusts are manageable, H2H Management includes Customer Experience Management (CXM) and reputation management and integrates both parts into one Trust Model. CXM uses the 5 A model walking along the customer journey in order to design and manage the experience at each and every touch point along this journey from a customer's point of view.

The CBBE approach, which is widely used today, is further developed based on the findings of Design Thinking, Service-Dominant Logic, and digitization in order to serve as an anchor of trust for people and communities. Brand meaning has to stick to a human problem and has to be co-created. Companies have to be aware of their limited options to determine the brand identity using the O-Zone concept.

For this, calculations were performed to build the Markowitz investment portfolio, a portfolio based on a probabilistic binary choice model, and a portfolio using the adaptation mechanism under the conditions of the fractal market hypothesis, and a comparative analysis of the obtained calculations was performed. In this work, the authors were able to confirm that the fractal market hypothesis more accurately and correctly describes the processes occurring in financial markets than the effective market hypothesis. To obtain the most optimal and high-quality assessment of the results of the securities portfolio formation, control samples were used. Using the control sample makes it possible to evaluate the predictive properties of the constructed models, to analyze their suitability for applied work on the basis of the data taken, which are unknown at the time the model was formed. The results of a computational experiment demonstrate that the classic Markowitz portfolio in terms of total profitability is significantly inferior to the algorithm portfolio proposed by the authors.

The authors examined the legal framework for the concept of liabilities, and also analyzed the possibility of accounting for valuation activities (and other analytical procedures) of informal liabilities, i.e., liabilities that do not have all the formal qualifications of the liabilities. As part of informal liabilities, hidden, imaginary and probabilistic liabilities, as well as economic analogues of liabilities, are considered. As a result of the analysis in this article, it is proved that there are liabilities that are not reflected in accounting, but ultimately affect the value of the company. Such liabilities cannot be entered into accounting and reflected in the accounting (financial) statements, as they do not meet the qualification requirements, at the same time, liabilities that are unreasonably reflected there due to an error or due to loss of liabilities may be reflected in accounting their qualifications.

From our reference base, most of the previous findings focused on measuring the collaboration situation in the whole chain, from upstream to downstream, however, we suppose that the collaboration nature differs among upstream and downstream region.

For many decades, there has been doubt, ambiguity, uncertainty and no accuracy or transparency concerning the real physical/chemical characteristics of crude oil produced in the DRC. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the characteristics of crude oils produced in other world regions to understand and classify the value of the DRC’s produced crude oil, by means of reference to the international standard that define the Gravity (°API) and Sulphur (Wt. %) of crude oil, whether it is light or heavy crude oil. It attempts to bring more evidence of crude oils characteristics that relate to crude oil produced in the DRC since 1973. The objective consists of categorising crude oil produced in the Kongo Central province of the DRC, to determine whether it has been Light Sweet, Light Sour, Medium-Medium Sour, Medium Sour, Heavy Sweet or Heavy Sour. This clarification is very critical in imperative to dissipate the cloud of misinformation and misperception of the property range of crude oil that has been produced consecutively by several multinational oil companies in the DRC since many decades. The PESTIE model or framework was applied to understand the mysterious and ambiguous barriers affecting the entire petroleum industry development in the DRC. A mixed methods approach was useful to gather different views, opinions and perceptions from qualified stakeholders involved in the DRC’s petroleum industry. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were proficient in revealing often multifaceted of the real value of the DRC’s crude oil. The results of this study revealed that the situation of misperception and confusion overshadowing crude oil specifications in the DRC are caused by a complex situation of the business environment uncertainties and instabilities, as well as the vulnerability of the political and socio-economic environments instituted by the colonial economic model (heritage and culture of exploitation and production of natural mineral resources) imposed by a complex system of the global business environment. Results also claimed that much confusion or uncertainties are from opinions, which are lacking accurate information regarding the correct statistical properties of crude oil produced in the country, as well as from the political interferences, frauds, and corruptions, which have been fuelling or influencing opinions about the mass or natural property range of the DRC’s produced crude oil. One of the approaches suggested in solving various challenges affecting the DRC’s petroleum industry consist of applying the best-practice of the rule of law; the review, monitoring and re-evaluation of policies, regulations, programmes, and strategic plans; transparency system and ensuring the business environment stability in the country. Managing accurately oil and gas activities in the country could be the outcome of less political interference in several socio-economic activities.

The availability of natural resources, artificially created tourist (recreational) resources, objects of historical and cultural heritage form the basis of a tourist product and contribute to the development of tourist activity in a particular region. Tourism resources serve as the foundation and contribute to the socio-economic development of both tourism activities and the region in general. Azerbaijan has great potential for the development of tourism since our republic has vast and incredible natural resources as well as historical and cultural heritage. Nevertheless, unfortunately, for today, there are still no tangible results in Azerbaijan on issues regarding the potential of tourism resources. A harmonized, systematic classification and list of tourist resources were not approved. Their qualitative and quantitative features have not been standardized. Moreover, some of the unique tourism resources available in the areas of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are virtually excluded from the tourism complex of Azerbaijan. In this regard, the methods and conditions for assessing certain types of tourism resources that determine the tourism and recreation potential of the territories of Azerbaijan have been analyzed. © 2021","Economic Assessment; Republic of Azerbaijan; Socio-Economic Development; Tourism; Tourist Resources",""

The study utilized both insider-researcher and cooperative inquiry while collecting multiple diverse perspectives with an online pre-test survey, in-depth interviews, an online focus group, meeting facilitation and participant observation. Four action research cycles were used to gain collective input to expose how the role of culture impacted participant’s personal biases, stereotypes, and judgments that potentially contributed to barriers of diverse communication. The collective data informed the implementation of actionable strategies to confront barriers such as language, lack of trust, conflict, and unacknowledged schemas that disrupt multicultural communication. This study validates the importance of individual acknowledgment of how culture influences their schema before diverse communication can be improved for collaboration to occur. The key findings further indicate how it was possible to change existing beliefs, stereotypes, and biases by first acknowledging what they are within a trusting environment. A focus on the individual’s unique schema overcame the complexities of the stakeholders’ multiple cultural identities to realize collaborative action. Actionable knowledge generated by collective stakeholders’ perspectives, was used to create a new European business initiative. Sustainable change occurred by placing the impact of culture at the heart of inquiry when conducting a diverse stakeholder analysis, combined with a collective leadership approach. In conclusion, culture impacted the stakeholders’ perception of reality, making change more effective at an individual level first, to confront the barriers of diverse communication in this European enforcement network. © 2021","",""

Investors will respond to this phenomenon by issuing capital (capital outflow) and investing (capital inflow), which causes the presumption of inflating the price of the asset value of the shares (asset bubbles). This study aims to detect the presence of an asset bubble and to determine the effect of macroeconomic fundamentals on the asset bubble during the global financial crisis in Indonesia. To detect an asset bubble, it can be done by comparing the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The fundamental influence of macroeconomics on asset bubbles is studied using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results of this study found that in Indonesia there was a small asset bubble from September to December 2010. In the short term, interest rates have a significant positive effect on the asset bubble, while in the long run all fundamental variables of exchange rates and interest rates have a positive effect, while inflation has a significant negative effect. Efforts to overcome this phenomenon can be controlled by reducing interest rates in the short term, while in the long run, increasing inflation and exchange rate depreciation can be controlled by decreasing the exchange rate. © 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The results of study revealed that creative accounting in its various forms, whether it complied with accounting standards or not, affects the quality of the accounting information. In addition, the most used practice of creative accounting is controlling the construction or reduction of the provisions and reserves such as the provision of bad debts to increase or decrease expenses and revenues. Meanwhile, gaining tax benefits is the most important motive for creative accounting practices. Also, the study revealed that the most important mean for limiting creative accounting practices was activating the role of auditing profession and related regulatory legislation governing their work in order to enhance their independence and professional competence. Finally, and based on these findings, the study provided a number of recommendations that would hopefully assist legislators, auditors and accountants in curbing creative accounting practices and improving the quality of accounting information in the Jordanian business environment © 2021.

The criticism of the two mentioned projects is made from the standpoint of the theory of conceptual transduction, headed by the principle of theoretical representation, according to which all scientific positions are presentations of scientific theories. It turns out that, contrary to the supporters of the ontological project, there is no need to isolate ontology from scientific theory, and it is present in the theory as a doctrine of subjects. The most meaningful characteristic of individuals and social groups is contained, again, not in the ontological project, but the theory of conceptual transduction. Individuals represent individual theories, and social groups represent group theories. Consideration of group theories from the standpoint of the individual should be complemented by an analysis of individual theories from the standpoint of groups. Accordingly, mutual complementarity also takes place in the case of a combination of methodological individualism and methodological institutionalism. Thus, the genuine foundations of the social sciences are the principle of theoretical representation and the methodology of conceptual transductions. The developed conception is used to characterize the nature of social psychology and social pedagogy. In the first case, an interdisciplinary connection of a certain scientific theory with sociology and psychology is realized, in the second with sociology and pedagogy. © 2021.

In particular, an algorithm and evaluation toolkit have been developed, which includes the calculation of the integrated index of agricultural competitiveness based on the generalization of six partial indices: the level of economic development of the industry, the efficiency of management of the production process, profitability, financial stability and solvency, business activity in the industry, efficiency of sales management and goods promotion on the markets, participation in foreign economic activity. Based on the developed methodology, an estimation of the competitiveness of Ukraine’s agriculture for 2013-2017 was carried out. The obtained results showed that the positive dynamics of the index integrated of agricultural competitiveness first of all was determined by indicators of profitability, production process management, financial stability and solvency. A downward factor was the low rate of Ukrainian agriculture’s participation in foreign economic activity, namely, the growth of imports and insignificant volumes of foreign investment. The versatility of an integrated index of competitiveness allows to make a comparative assessment of the industries competitiveness level within the national economy and to determine to what extent some of them are capable of becoming the locomotive of the Ukrainian economy in international markets. This creates the possibility of developing an effective economic policy to support the most competitive industries based on a rational allocation of public funds, and to form a long-term competitive policy of the state at the sectoral level.

All the existing cost accounting approaches rely on allocating costs of labour and overheads across business-units or product-lines or individual products. The practice of allocating indirect cost is rarely precise, and therefore opens up the possibility of distorted information being placed to managerial decision-makers leading to wrong decisions. Throughput accounting, which is a result of Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints, offers a simple and viable alternative to the distortions created by cost accounting approaches. Throughput accounting suggests a paradigm shift in analysing contribution of product-mix and business units by changing focus of managers from emphasizing on managing cost-per-unit to managing throughputs.

This article explores the importance and viability of SDG 17, “Partnering for the Goals” through the analysis of one marine conservation case study. More specifically the applicability of SDG 17 was analyzed so as to assess the viability of SDG 14, “Life under Water”. This case study evaluated a marine conservation case study based in Normandie (France) that deals with the conservation of bottlenose dolphins. It presents a very interesting stakeholder situation, where we see that there are conflicting interests among governmental authorities, conservation organizations, recreational and commercial fishermen, among others. A case study approach was undertaken for the data collection using desk-based research and semi-structured interviews. The interview process was performed between October 2019 and March 2020. In total, 19 different stakeholders were interviewed. For the data analyses, a stakeholder register, PI Matrices and a stakeholder map were used, and to complement the latter narratives were developed. It was found that most project stakeholders seem to be in favour of the Normand-Breton bottlenose dolphin conservation project, however the recreational and professional fishermen as well as the promoters of renewable energy projects did not appear to support it. Stakeholder engagement analyses are especially useful in the application of SDG at the project level. However, in some instances such as in the case study analysed, many obstacles may be encountered in the process of creating these global alliances and partnerships. Although this case study is specifically applicable to a marine conservation context, it may be extrapolated and applied to any other SDG context. © 2021. Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The research background is in the fact that digitalization does not change the essence of capitalist relations in society, but technological changes dictate the need to clarify the digitalization impact as a new factor in economic theories, as well as to consider the competition between two new models of capitalism -centralized (platform) and distributed ones, which makes it possible to correctly provide an economic picture of the digitalization effects. If the first model tends to continue the development of the vertical integration concept (including data), then the second is more attractive for horizontal integration. It is substantiated that the productive forces in a digital society should include not only material but also information factors, and the newly created information and communication means of production associated with them. The research results include both an assessment of the shared economy impact and a new balance of competition and coordination in the markets.

It is based mainly on the principle that people will consume fewer services, with regards to transportation, rent, et al. Instead, they will replace for more consumption the services at home, such as online courses, delivery services, etc. Modern retail chains, with proper management, are distinguished by fairly good reliability due to the digital logistics approach being considered in the article.Тhe sharing economy, based on the Collaborative Economy about distributing, sharing and reusing excess capacities in goods and services, now is changed by platforms that connect people who need a service with people who can provide it. The article will contribute to identifying the situation of a business regarding the field of the Sharing Economy, and the dissemination of information about what opportunities and threats currently exist in it.

It is established that the system of state financial control should meet the requirements of economic efficiency, that is, control costs should not exceed forecast losses when no control measures are taken. This requirement also implies the need to optimize the organizational structure of state financial control, that is, identify and simplify superfluous elements, the perfect combination of centralized and decentralized management in the structure of bodies. It is proven that the efficiency of the state financial control system is associated primarily with whether control activities are regulated, that is, all elements of a control organization cannot operate smoothly without regulations and without applying standard solutions in certain situations. That is why one must establish procedures that determine the nature, scale, frequency and timing of control procedures. It is determined that a joint system of state financial control is a complex multilevel system formed with some subsystems, each of which has a particular structure and development logic. Therefore, an important requirement for a common system is the need to control bodies based on smooth cooperation and coordination of all efforts for financial control in the context of digitalization.

Legal exhaustiveness refers to possible inclusion of essential legal principles in solving legal related issues of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, a number of studies have been conducted from different perspectives in addressing the ongoing challenge of COVID-19 in various parts of the world including Saudi Arabia. However, little connection is made in harmonizing conventional legal principles with Islamic legal system in order to address the problem of COVID-19 in the country. This paper primarily aims at utilizing legal exhaustiveness by exploring legal principles that can be instrumental in solving the challenges of COVID-19. In so doing, systematic literature review (SLR) is used as methodology of the paper whereby five themes were generated which were subsequently presented as results of the study. The results indicated that, the Saudi Arabian government has cancelled mass gatherings such as Umrah as part of measures to curtail further transmission of COVID-19. It is reiterated that, the Sharī’ah legal system of Saudi Arabia can be harmonized with legal doctrines of force majeure, impossibility & frustration and impracticality) that are found in English law commonly in practice in England and USA which are similar to Sharīʻah doctrines of Quwa Qahira, Al-Zourouf Al-Tari’a and Istilaha. The result further showed that, the doctrine of impossibility is more appropriate and relevant in addressing the problem of COVID-19 in the context of Saudi Arabia as compared to the principle of frustration due to the fact that, COVID-19 hinders the performance of contractual activities by the parties that are involved in the socio-economic contract in the country. The implication of this paper is that, it provides substantial shape to employment and commercial laws in Saudi Arabia especially by providing safety to the employees in order to avoid unnecessary loose of job as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore suggested that, the government of Saudi Arabia should use the expertise of legal team in the country by utilizing the identified variables explored in this paper. Additionally, the conceptual framework investigated in this study can be empirically investigated by further studies. Lastly, the limitation of the paper is lack of accessibility to some studies on various variables that are explored in this study.

Major emphasis is called by the coronavirus outbreak to the necessity to extend CSR to public administration. Such necessity is relevant because I consider the public health care system as part of public administration. This might be true not only for health care provided through public employees, but also for health care provided by contracted services, according to a New Public Management approach to public services. I concentrate on the health care system and will however devote some paragraphs to other public organizational systems that have been engaged by the virus crisis. CSR has traditionally been applied to private businesses, according to the United Nations Global Compact. This is what I call Mainstream CSR. My theory of Reformulated CSR argues CSR should be extended to all organizations, private and public. Mainstream CSR identifies special and ad hoc CSR programs that ought to be put forth by private businesses. Reformulated CSR tries to identify CSR in the ordinary way of carrying out the core business of all organizations. Thus public organizations should report about their own performance in their core businesses. Performance reporting is ordinarily done in some Anglo-Saxon countries, but it is seldom done in other countries of the world where the CSR movement also tries to be influential. © Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

Literature on international trade acknowledges the paramount role that FDI plays in fostering economic development and growth via integrating economies around the globe. Studies, such as OECD in 2014; UNCTAD in 2019, have shown that FDI acts as a catalyst for technological change, competition and expansion. These studies have also suggested that FDI is attracted to countries that exhibit good governance, low uncertainty and macroeconomic stability. The literature on monetary policy on the other hand argues that inflation targeting (IT) – a monetary policy framework– mitigates uncertainty, enhances governance and brings macroeconomic stability to the adopting countries. Hence, it would seem that the IT-adoption should enable the adopting countries attract the largest FDI inflows. To verify this conjecture, this study performs a comparative analysis between the IT-adopting countries and the nonadopters in attracting FDI. Using a panel of OECD and middle-income countries (MICs), the study employs the matching-estimation methodology, often used in assessing a treatment effect by comparing the before-and-after effects, such as a medical treatment at the micro-level, or a policy implementation at the macro-level. This comparison is two-staged: at first, the author estimates the FDI flows into OECD countries and MICs before and after the adoption of IT. At the second stage, the author then compares the difference between the FDI inflows among the IT-adopting countries and those who did not adopt IT. The empirical findings exhibit an interesting but contradicting pattern: when it comes to the OECD countries, the results show that the ITadopters do better than the non-adopters in attracting the FDI inflows. According to these findings, the IT-adopting OECD countries have enjoyed a significant increase in the FDI inflows by about 3 ½ to 4 ½ percentage points compared to the non-IT OECD countries. For the middle-income countries, however, the IT-adoption appears to have an adverse effect on FDI inflows: a significant reduction in the FDI inflows is witnessed among the ITadopters compared to their counterparts: The MICs that adopted inflation targeting have suffered a significant reduction in the FDI inflows by about 2 to 3 percentage points as compared to the non-IT adopting MICs. The author also performed numerous robustness checks to verify the empirical findings. The study’s results seem to be robust to the post-estimation sensitivity tests recommended for such empirical analysis, including the Rosenbaum sensitivity test. © 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The districts, and cities of West Sumatra are not yet fully integrated with each other, there are seven districts, and cities which are categorized as neighbourless for all groups of economic variables, physical, and social variable groups. The group of economic variables that most significantly affect the reduction of inequality, such as the number of MSME businesses, and investment in the form of gross fixed capital formation, these seven regions have no spatial integrated with their neighbouring areas. Spatial autocorrelation in each variable used for analysis shows that autocorrelation clustering only occurs in nine districts, meaning that spatial autocorrelation has not fully occurred in districts, and cities in West Sumatra, the implication is that spatial interactions between these areas are in economic, physical development. Regional, and social, it has not happened, and has not been able to encourage the creation of agglomeration. The strategy for managing development inequality during the Covid-19 pandemic is a high priority starting with improving the health of mothers and children, increasing the transportation of people, and goods between regions, increasing the ratio of road length to area, increasing agglomeration between regions, and increasing the role and, participation of women in development to support increased life expectancy. If this can be done, it will be followed effectively by an increase in MSME business, and investment, which in turn can lead to an increase in the skills of the productive age population. © 2020.

"Organisational citizenship behaviour and its influence on manufacturing firms survival in Nigeria: A systematic review","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088971848&partnerID=40&md5=bac17d575e04e6b53ef1375e242c2585","Objective: The importance of firm survival in a highly competitive business environment cannot be over emphasized. Organisational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB) is however considered to be one of the fundamental behavioural initiatives that can help firms achieve sustainable survival in the midst of economic turbulence as organisations now depend on their employees for success. Recent studies on the sustainability of firms shows that many Nigerian manufacturing firms are into extinction and few operate at a sustainable level as a result of the operating environment of business occasioned by global capitalism which has been unpredictable, complex and competitive. The main objective of this study is to explore extant studies on OCB and its influence on firm survival specifically in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. Methods: In order to fill this lacuna, this study explored reputable data bases of both empirical and non-empirical extant studies on OCB between 2009 and 2019. Studies were selected from business, management, Industrial/organisational psychology and human resource data bases. OCB was observed to have many dimensions which are overlapping and were re-categorized based on their objectives and characteristics. Results: OCB dimensions identified have significant effect on positive behavioural outcomes. It is therefore recommended that organisations should challenge their employees by providing them with positive work climate that will foster extra role behaviour in order to ensure organisational survival. Also, a proposed study model integrating the dimensions of OCB was developed which is expected to serve as hypothetical basis for future research and practice. More so, some theoretical frameworks were linked to OCB and positive employee behavioural outcomes that can foster firm survival. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.","Employee compliance; Employee loyalty; Firm survival; Individual initiative; OCB; Sportsmanship",""

Despite this requirement, companies still exercise discretion about what to disclose, and this gives rise to variation in quality of integrated reports released by these companies. Given the relevance of quality integrated reports to providers of capitals and the associated economic benefits, empirical study of this nature becomes necessary to establish this link in the South African context. The paper examines the value relevance of integrated reporting quality (IRQ) of South African listed firms. Specifically, if any difference exists in the value of firms with high IRQ and those with low IRQ. Integrated reporting <IR> began in South Africa, and the country has equally contributed significantly to its development worldwide.

The current study focuses on this neglected sector in the assessment of the effect of corporate governance on performance of commercial banks in a turbulent economic and political environment. The results from the investigation indicate that the rights of shareholders, transparency and disclosure and board operation enhance performance and eventually improve shareholders’ value. The results of the research give a strong support to the idea that good governance framework is crucial in the financial sector as it positively influences firm performance. The desktop study also reveals that during times of high political volatility, the board of directors could try to make profit maximization the main goal in order to drive the bank towards making profits as the chances of making losses will be very high. This comes from the fact that the board is expected to manage all the bank's forms of risks, through both the risk management committee and the audit committee.

Strategy is summed up in objectives. The thesis that strategy is meaningless because it is relative has been present. Even if the strategy was relative, it may have been merely to focus on the details of the strategy. It may be unreasonable to consider the strategy meaningless simply because it is inconsistent and varying. What is most important in examining strategies is to consider what strategic objectives each company has. In the traditional analysis of strategy, classifying companies by focusing on their characteristics, and not on their business objectives, has been dominant. This causes a serious problem because it does not allow us to identify what is taking place with an overview of the strategies from the macroscopic perspective. In order to solve this problem, we selected companies for which we could obtain 2007 data from the book Mission, published about 10 years ago, which contains management philosophies and behavioral guidelines of 983 blue-chip companies in Japan, to compare them to their sales data of 2017. We analyzed the 724 companies for which the relevant data were obtainable. Of the strategic elements selected from the collection of business philosophies, we found that the most outstanding business objectives and strategic elements set forth by the high growth companies were (1) to challenge new markets and (2) to put the customer first. Although other previous studies considered important the customer satisfaction as the business objective, we did not find the companies with the emphasis on the customer satisfaction to have a high growth by two-group comparison. © 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

Literature on international trade acknowledges the paramount role that FDI plays in fostering economic development and growth via integrating economies around the globe. Studies, such as OECD in 2014; UNCTAD in 2019, have shown that FDI acts as a catalyst for technological change, competition and expansion. These studies have also suggested that FDI is attracted to countries that exhibit good governance, low uncertainty and macroeconomic stability. The literature on monetary policy on the other hand argues that inflation targeting (IT) – a monetary policy framework– mitigates uncertainty, enhances governance and brings macroeconomic stability to the adopting countries. Hence, it would seem that the IT-adoption should enable the adopting countries attract the largest FDI inflows. To verify this conjecture, this study performs a comparative analysis between the IT-adopting countries and the non-adopters in attracting FDI. Using a panel of OECD and middle-income countries (MICs), the study employs the matching-estimation methodology, often used in assessing a treatment effect by comparing the before-and-after effects, such as a medical treatment at the micro-level, or a policy implementation at the macro-level. This comparison is two-staged: at first, the author estimates the FDI flows into OECD countries and MICs before and after the adoption of IT. At the second stage, the author then compares the difference between the FDI inflows among the IT-adopting countries and those who did not adopt IT. The empirical findings exhibit an interesting but contradicting pattern: when it comes to the OECD countries, the results show that the IT-adopters do better than the non-adopters in attracting the FDI inflows. According to these findings, the IT-adopting OECD countries have enjoyed a significant increase in the FDI inflows by about 3 ½ to 4 ½ percentage points compared to the non-IT OECD countries. For the middle-income countries, however, the IT-adoption appears to have an adverse effect on FDI inflows: a significant reduction in the FDI inflows is witnessed among the IT-adopters compared to their counterparts: The MICs that adopted inflation targeting have suffered a significant reduction in the FDI inflows by about 2 to 3 percentage points as compared to the non-IT adopting MICs. The author also performed numerous robustness checks to verify the empirical findings. The study’s results seem to be robust to the post-estimation sensitivity tests recommended for such empirical analysis, including the Rosenbaum sensitivity test. © 2020, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

"BUILDING A MODEL FOR MANAGING THE MARKET VALUE OF AN INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE BASED ON REGULATING ITS INNOVATION ACTIVITY","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098488752&partnerID=40&md5=2b7e0780e4b3e8d0b3f046de118a28e4","The market value of an enterprise is one of the main performance indicators of any modern enterprise. Consequently, to ensure a continuous increase in the value of the enterprise, it is necessary to implement measures for its management. This study suggests that it is possible to predict and change the market value of an industrial enterprise based on regulating its innovation activity. For confirming the suggested thesis, it is proposed to construct a model of dependence of market value on the innovation activity of an enterprise by means of regression analysis tools. In such a context, it is necessary to consider innovative activity as a value which can be changed and controlled by the enterprise. The solution to the task set has conditioned development of the author’s method of calculating the integral indicator of innovative development of an economic agent, taking into consideration its functioning in the industrial sphere. The introduced integral indicator consists of coefficients that characterize the innovative potential of an enterprise, each of which can be adjusted to the current corporate strategy. In order to prevent distortion of data, the proposed method also includes the potential for assessing the impact of the innovation activity on economic value added, as a significant indicator referring to market value formation. Innovation activity of an industrial enterprise characterizes its competitive position in the market in a strategic range, which has a direct impact on the market value of the entity. In case of an insufficient level of the innovative development, the increase of market value is unlikely to be possible. The importance of the proposed model lies in creation of the author’s method to consider innovation activity dynamics for modeling processes by market value management. Testing the given model proves expediency of its use from the position of the economic analysis. So, in the course of the model consideration at an industrial enterprise, positive connection between the author’s integral indicator and the market value of the enterprise has been identified. In the future, it is planned to adapt the developed model to a specific innovation sector of the economy, taking into account macroeconomic aspects, such as the transition state of the Russian economy. © 2020 UKSS and NASS","Econometric Model; EVA; Innovation Activity; Innovation Management; Innovative Development; Market Value; Regression Analysis.; Value Management",""

Modern trends reinforce the importance of intensive means of achieving business efficiency that help to maximize performance and reduce costs with minimal capital investment. One such means is adoption of lean technologies. The advantages of lean manufacturing have been considered in detail by the economic community, but there are a number of challenges in the economic assessment of the results of investment projects associated with introduction and use of lean tools. In this study, the authors propose an original methodology for assessing the economic efficiency of investment projects involving implementation of lean production tools. To this end, it is necessary to analyze current research in this field, propose an instrumental approach to evaluating the economic efficiency of lean tools adoption, build an assessment algorithm, and test the method at an industrial enterprise. The study proposes to consider the quantitative and relative assessment of the economic efficiency of lean tools. Calculations are based on mathematical methods and achievements of investment analysis. The practical significance of this study consists in the development of the original methodology that makes it possible to assess the economic efficiency of using lean technologies to substantiate rationality of further development of an enterprise in this direction. Based on the developed methodology, it is possible to provide recommendations for optimizing business operations of an enterprise. To substantiate the feasibility of using the approach proposed by the authors, it was tested at an industrial enterprise operating in the North-West of the Russian Federation. It was established that the use of lean technologies in certain structural units of an enterprise increases economic efficiency, which makes it possible to substantiate the need for further implementation of these technologies in other units to strengthen strategic advantages. © 2020, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

However, there are obvious problems in this area that reflect the digitalization process.Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the problems of staffing for successful digital development at the global level and the level of one country Russia, assess the ability of these problems to influence the success of digital development itself and development in general.Results: The digitalization development is associated with advances in data processing and storage, as well as with the development of digital literacy of society as a whole. Moreover, the development of science is obviously more important. Since the end of the last century, there has been a significant, more than twofold increase in the number of students and researchers, however, this growth was mainly due to developing countries. In developed countries, the number of scientific publications has not grown so much since 2000, while growth in the current decade is slower than in the past. In general, the contribution of mathematical research and research in the field of directly computational mathematics and computer science since the beginning of the millennium increased by 1.5-2 times.

Due to the high risk of innovation activity, its capital intensity and intellectual demand, development and implementation of regulatory decisions in innovation activity management systems is carried out collegially (collectively). Studies have shown that the key problem in the technological process of making a collegial regulatory decision is choosing the best solution from a number of alternatives. Critical analysis of the known methods of collective streamlining of possible alternatives showed that each of these methods has certain disadvantages, but the way out is to apply a cumulative approach to generalizing the results of the analysis of existing alternatives.

Zimbabwe has been saddled with the challenges of fashioning an environment which is investor-friendly, hence the need for public entities to be exemplary in good corporate governance. Highly publicized scandals that have shaken state-owned enterprises have been ascribed to deficits in corporate governance this study employs a qualitative approach through a descriptive-document philosophical analysis to examine the challenges in Zimbabwe's strategic management for sustainable development. The corporate governance theories informing the study are the agency theory, stewardship theory, stakeholder theory and the transaction cost economics theory. The analysis is subdivided into themes which focus on the need for a human resources paradigm shift, management finesse and the continuum of culpability. The study reveals that the current corporate governance practice has not effectively improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the public entities. This is a result of corruption, inconsistencies, lack of commitment and absence of the rule of law and above all, excessive political interference. The study interrogates the ethical matters stemming out from such challenges to establish if the malpractices have been some form of complicity or an underestimation of the effect of good corporate governance in the public sector. Corruption has been institutionalized with cases of impunity on the rise. Issues of governance that countervail the sustainability and risk nexus are depicted. It is commendable that efforts are being made to entrench corporate governance in the public sector although positive results are yet to be realized. It is recommended that a rules-based approached should be adopted and that political interventions should be minimized.

The possible solution to catch backlog is engaging private sectors to involve in the public housing project under the scheme of public private partnership (PPP). Nevertheless, some risks may expose to private sectors and it will have an impact to investment rate The risk impact to the investment rate will be explored alongside the effect from capital structure and investment valuation. If capital structure, investment valuation and risk have simultaneously impact investment rate, the possible mitigation risk strategy must be designed in advance with the support from the government. Those parameters must be managed properly in order to attract public housing project under PPP scheme. The research has used multiple regression with time series from 2009 until 2018, 10 years data with all samples taken from companies that listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) under the industry of property and construction. The independent variables consist of debt, debt to equity ratio, stock issuance, retained earnings, sales, opex, capex, discounted cash flow, sales volatility, material price volatility and operational risk volatility with IRR and ROE as dependent variables. The risks is measured by the concept adopted from Value at Risk which heavily counts on volatility as a quantitative method. The measurement of risk variables in other research has commonly used tools like analytic hierarchy process (AHP) while this study used risk volatility measurement with Value at Risk (VaR) tools. The research framework also align with risk return theory that accommodates risk factors into investment rate model simultaneously with capital structure and invesment valuation The designed hypothesis was capital structure, investment valuation and risk impact investment rate for public housing simultaneously. The findings has showed that business risk negatively impact investment rate while most of capital structure variables as well as investment valuation positively impact investment rate. Those three main variables influence IRR almost 50 percent by adjusted R squared, higher than ROE, which is influenced by 31.5 % from variables of capital structure, investment valuation and risk. By the risk analysis based on multiple regressions, it can be concluded that sales volatility, as a business risk predictor must be prioritized rather than material price volatility and operational cost volatility. The companies must be managing debt not too over levered, securing sales and managing business risk by diversifying streams of revenues and involving government to support with incentives, support and subsidy to minimize business risk. All initiatives will be taken to meet the average required investment rate, i.e. target ROE by 10 % and IRR by 14% as found from historical data of 2009-2018. Time period for this research only captured 10 years data from 2009 to 2018. Different and longer time frame may change the research findings. The next study can capture data which showed financial crisis like during 1997-1998 or property bubble/sluggish period, seeing the impact of those event as a risk phenomenon and analyzing the impact to investment rate in public housing project by conducting event study. Other methodology like mixed-method research to explore qualitative aspect could also enrich the findings for research improvement in the future. The paper has a significant contribution to make a financial policy in PPP for Public Housing between government and private sectors, the target of ROE can be set by minimum 10 % with target IRR by 14%. Besides that private sectors can discuss with government for securing property sales by receiving government guarantee, diversifying revenue by doing mixed used buildings and asking Viability Gap Fund (VGF) if actual IRR and ROE is still below the target as a last resort. Those efforts can be taken as part of risk mitigation to reduce business risk volatility as measured by this study. © 2020, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

While women in Malaysia form 54.7 percent out of 15 million total labour forces in 2017, the overall percentage of women in the top management level is only 15.4 percent in third quarter 2018 of top 100 Public Listed companies. These women at the top management level are mainly in the accounting and legal professions. Their involvement in the logistics and transport service sector are relatively small. The industry carries over 90 percent of the world goods need to access the entire talent pool, regardless of gender. Malaysia by virtue of its extended jurisdiction of the Economic Exclusive Zone has a maritime area which is larger than its land mass. It is the 17th largest trading nation in the world. Hence this paper discusses on whether there is gender imbalance in the sector and the challenges faced by women in the management of the port sector of the maritime industry in Malaysia. Based on the returned structured questionnaires, 57 percent male and 43 percent female of the major port operators illustrate that women represent 14.5 percent in the management level. In terms of perception, both male and female management treat female staff equally (75 percent) and agree that gender diversity should exist (75 percent). However, interestingly, management still have preference for men for port management (49 percent). We suggest reasons for the need to rise and argue that port organizations can capture the symbols of progressive social change and modernity by appointment of women in key positions at the ports. Based on measures in financial performance, Catalyst (2011) study, with 3 or more women in the decision-making level, companies significantly outperformed in return on sales (ROS), return on invested capital (ROIC) and return on equity (ROE). The future in the logistics profession is crucial for a country's economic growth; and that professionals in the supply chain and logistics serve as the links connecting businesses, people and countries across the globe.

The reason for this is simple: strategies are unique ways of managing organisations at different managerial levels and, therefore, there are many distinctive types, and even schools, of strategies. But in-depth research into the subject literature leads to a provocative question: does a model for strategies exist? If so, what components are the building blocks of this model and what logic does it represent? The objective of this paper is to identify the components that constitute any type of strategy, whether these components are specified in the definitions of strategy, and whether these components are the sine qua none of any kind of strategy. A literature review of the definitions of strategy and the various strategic schools is conducted. For the purpose of a statistical analysis, the multiple correlation coefficients is used. In addition, complexity theory paradigms and a mutatis mutandis methodological approach are implemented in order to achieve the main goal. The study results reveal the constitutive components of any type of strategy. These components, which are ordered within a cause-effect hierarchy, compose a new design, with logic based on their cause-effect association, and are concatenated into a complex model for strategies.

A questionnaire was administered to three hundred and fifty-nine (359) employees between the ages of 19 and 59 years. Forty-two percent (42%) of the participants were males; fifty-six percent (56%) were females while the remaining two percent (2%) did not indicate their gender. Telecom staff accounted for 16% of the total sample, while teachers, health workers and bankers accounted for 28% each. Two hypotheses were raised and tested using t-test. The result revealed a significant difference between male and female perception of overall organisational justice and a significant difference in male and female perception of the dimensions of organisational justice: procedural justice and interactional justice. There was no significant difference in perception of distributive justice by male and female respondents. Consequently, findings from this study tend to suggest that gender has a significant effect on employees' perception of organisational justice, with male having better perception of justice than their female counterparts.

There is severe challenge of power irregularity over the years such that most industrial organizations and upper income family circles install exorbitant electricity generators set due to incessant power outage in the country. Methods/Materials: The study adopts a doctrinal legal research with library based legal research method with comparative legal approach. The study reveals that lack of coherent legal framework with incentives for utilization of renewable energy is the key factor causing slow utilization of renewable energy as alternative source of energy in Nigeria. Results: The country is yet to tap into the full benefits of renewable energies after privatization of its power sector inspite of the new global evolvement in energy sector and the growing demands for renewable energy sources, which is cheaper, environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuel and its allied products. Energy security has been a challenge to social economic development due to over dependency on fossil fuel despite the obvious indicators that fossil fuel will soon become an alternative forgone in the power sector as energy has evolved from meeting household needs and industrial demands to preserving energy sources for longevity and sustainability. This would apparently have some implications for Nigeria’s oil sector due to the current global dwindling in crude oil price. This development has led to the formulation of new energy policy around the world to serve as a vehicle for translating this to reality. The study evaluated resource curse and sustainable development theories due to their impacts on renewable energy in Nigeria’s power sector. The aim of the study is to end the concern for poor energy utilization to promote energy efficiency and sustainability.

This has ultimately led the fashion industry to become the second largest polluter in the world. The primary objective of this research paper is to comprehend how the media manoeuvres customers to indulge in fast fashion and how that in turn leads to uncertainty in the supply chain. To understand this, a maximum variation sampling method was adopted which consisted of customers, supply chain partners and marketers. In order to draw a parallel between the variables researched in the past and the present day scenario, an interview schedule was employed. Through the variables selected with the help of Dedoose, a model was created to identify the hurdles faced by suppliers as well as the customer in the fast fashion cycle. The results found that the power to break the fast fashion phenomenon lay in the hands of the media as it is through them that customers' perception can be altered.

However, technologies often replace human labor and lead to staff reduction, which has a negative social effect, especially in rural areas where there are rarely other alternatives for employment. Because of the unreliability of employment in agricultural enterprises, young potential workers are increasingly leaving rural areas to look for work in the urban, whereas for agricultural enterprises there is no alternative in the choice of workers. One of the peculiarities of the agricultural labor market is the fact that in this sector people with the lack of qualifications are involved in a larger measure. For this reason, it is difficult for them to find a new job after the loss of employment. For innovations to have a positive effect not only on enterprises but also on the country's economy as a whole, their implementation should be combined with the motivation of workers to obtain both vocational training and decent wages in the agricultural sector. It is necessary to make the sphere of agricultural activity attractive for potential young workers and reliable for those who are already involved in it.

This is due to the increase in the number of Universities around the world. As such, their engagement has been reported to be in a steadying decline as academics' mobility increases. This study examines remuneration as a determinant of Job-hopping intention and academics' teaching engagement of selected universities in Southwest, Nigeria. In assessing the subject matter, a survey research design was adopted. Six hundred and twenty (620) respondents were surveyed across the selected universities in Southwest Nigeria using a five-point Likert scale method. Stratified and simple random sampling techniques were used to select the respondents for this study. Five hundred and forty-five (545) copies of the questionnaire reflecting (87.9%) response rate were returned and used for this analysis. The Structural Equation Model (PLS) was used to measure the perceived influence of remuneration on academics' teaching engagement. Results confirmed the relationship between perceived remuneration and teaching engagement to be 0.696 and directly significant at 0.05. The results also show that 48.8% variance of teaching engagement is explained by a unit change in remuneration. To a very large extent, selected federal universities had the topmost path coefficient of ? = 0.347. To encourage academics' engagement, especially those in private universities, management should provide a competitive remuneration system, to include payment of allowances and fringe benefits to the level of satisfaction, so that when they compare their rewards to their colleagues in the similar institutions under the same job, they will be encouraged to stay with their institutions. The insights from this study would be of great benefit to the management and other stakeholders of universities, in order to develop an appropriate and equitable remuneration system that will enhance academics' teaching engagement.

Although several methods exist to measure a broad range of entrepreneurial intentions and entrepreneurial activities on the national and international level, it should be emphasized that evaluating the level of innovativeness (innovation degree of the product and/or innovation level of the management) is a research challenge tackled by public statistical services and private research institutions. Whereas the topic is relevant for research and practice, prior papers in the literature are limited. Therefore, there is a real need for examining startup ecosystems, which constitute the most dynamically changing legal entities, and have an increasing impact on the economy. Startup mentoring has received a special attention lately in developing countries, such as Ecuador, owing to continuously increasing governmental and private initiatives. In this study we analyze the innovative activity of enterprises enrolled in the Co-working StartUPS mentor program, in Ecuador. The concept of innovative performance introduced by Hagedoorn & Cloodt considers the number of patents awarded to companies. In present, the number of new products introduced to the local and international market is low (only 1.3% of local companies developing new products launch their manufactured goods on the market), and the number of patents owned by Ecuadorian microenterprises and startups is negligible. Therefore, we attempt to develop a new measure for assessing the innovative activity of local startups. For companies registered at the Co-working StartUPS mentor program we try to answer the question how innovative activity impacts the success of startups with constant monthly revenue. A straightforward critical success factor has been calculated by dividing the monthly revenue with the number of employees working at the startup. Next, the level of management's innovativeness and degree of product's innovativeness were determined. Finally, we calculated the total innovative activity using a self-developed index. In addition, we performed correlation analysis between the intellectual activity and the critical success factor. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","Co-working; Economic development; Innovative activity; Management; Startups",""

In contrast, from the marketer's perspective, mobile devices connote a ""brand-in-hand"" which offers an important opportunity for marketers to reach and retain particularly the young consumer regime. In recent years, bank marketers became optimistic about growing business opportunities in view of high adoption rates of mobile devices by youths that arguably has reached a peak of 80%. This paper argues that unless the remainder is examined, it is likely to increase and present marketing challenges to businesses. Using a purposive sampling technique, this paper explores drivers of resistance behaviour specifically to self-service retail banking innovations. A total of n=388 youths in Generation Z cohort participated in the study by completing a 50-items questionnaire designed in the dimensions of technological, social, psychological and economic dimensions. The cohort signifies a consumer segment comprising educated, technologically savvy, and have the propensity to influence other consumer segments. The results show that 78% of participants use self-service banking technologies with 22% not using them. This finding is significant in that it confirms the literature that adoption rate of self-service technologies in general has reached 80% whereas the remainder resisting their use. The age distribution shows that most participants are 17-19 years (59%) whereas those aged 20-22 years constitute 41%.

We have considered the Return on Equity (ROE) and leverage ratio as the proxy of dependent variable-corporate performance. Five dimensions of the CSR practices namely, environment, employee, social and community services, product and customer are considered as the proxy of independent variable - CSRD. To determine the CSRD practices of the listed company a three scale content analysis having fifty seven items has been used. To conduct the study, a sample of 196 Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) listed companies from seventeen industries has been scrutinized. In our study, we have found significant relationship between the proxy variables of corporate performances and key dimensions of the CSR practices. We have found that the listed companies disclose more information concerning to the employee related CSRD and less information on environment related CSRD.

Genetic testing (GT) is a type of medical test that looks for differences in the genetic makeup of individuals. The results of the test are useful with regard to informing people as to how to make decisions with regard to managing their healthcare. The successful implementation of the technology is heavily dependent on public support and acceptance, which translates into their intention to adopt the technology. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine stakeholders' intention and its associated predictors with regard to the adoption of GT in Malaysia. The final version of the validated questionnaire was developed and administered to a representative samples of the Malaysian population (n=421). Two stakeholder groups were considered in the form of representatives of local healthcare providers (n=221) and patients with genetic disease or their family members (n=200). The results of the study suggested that a high level of trust in key players, followed by the technology being highly accepted on religious grounds and their perception of the technology being highly beneficial, are factors with regard to supporting GT.

However, opinions vary widely regarding the factors that influence trade deficits, and studies that focus specifically on non-oil trade deficits are limited. This study was an investigation of relationships between Saudi Arabia's non-oil trade deficit and specific economic measures that were shown in previous research to be related to trade deficits in other countries. The researcher used Stock and Watson's Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) approach (1993) as an empirical method to estimate the critical parameters of the non-oil trade deficit in Saudi Arabia over a 25-year period (1998-2015). To meet the requirements of the DOLS application, a time series was used to analyze the data. This allowed the designation of the order of integration for each series, generating the data for review. The results of our assessment suggest that a unique theoretical sign can be expected for the individual variables. This confirms that statistically significant positive relationships exist between the non-oil trade deficit and (a) real income, (b) relative national prices to foreign prices, and (c) international reserves. In contrast, a negative and considerable correlation was found between the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and the non-oil trade deficit. Policymakers are currently challenged with controlling the domestic inflation rate, and the results of this study substantiate the positive relationship between Saudi Arabia's non-oil trade deficit and relative domestic to foreign prices. Therefore, the findings indicate that controlling domestic prices is an important element of managing the non-oil trade deficit. The negative relationship between the non-oil trade deficit and real effective exchange rate strongly suggests that policymakers should also support the real effective exchange rate. Saudi Arabia needs strategic plans and policies that promote the development of innovative and dynamic trade sectors that potentially accelerate economic diversification. Economic diversification is dependent on inventive processes that improve productivity, products that promote sustainable growth, new markets, and institutions that allow for more efficient production. Strategies should strive to encourage both vertical and horizontal diversification beyond oil production, which would further integrate non-oil trade into the global value chain and attract foreign direct investment to the non-oil sector. © 2019 Allied Academies.","Current account imbalances; DOLS estimation; Non-oil trade deficit; Saudi Arabia",""

This study develops an extended version of the widely used Hackman and Oldham's ""Job Diagnostic Survey"", identifying and aiming to bridge its theoretical gaps. The new, 135-item ""Modified Job Diagnostic Survey for Retention"" implements an integrated framework, with additional ""core job dimensions"", ""experienced psychological states"" and ""individual differences"", while incorporating a new scale on ""labor market conditions"", to assess the effect of ""personal/work outcomes"" on retention. Its psychometric properties are tested, using a sample of 630 respondents. Construct validity is evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with Promax rotation. Face validity is examined through reviews by a panel of experts. Reliability of the instrument is estimated with Cronbach's alpha coefficients. The significance of the new instrument is highlighted by filling the void in research involving redesigning jobs while taking into consideration, for the first time, the effect of labor market conditions on fresh graduates' affective and personal work outcomes. The construct validity shows that it has a five-factor structure where all items are reliable indicators of their corresponding factors. The reliability of the five scales is satisfactory, with acceptable values of Cronbach's alpha (ranging from 0.656 to 0.901). Thus, the new instrument is a strong, valid and reliable tool for studies on the retention of fresh graduates. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","Core job dimensions; Fresh graduates; Instrument reliability and validity; Job retention; Personal/work outcomes",""

This research paper measures the effect and relationship between capital structure, liquidity and growth in the Pakistan tobacco industry. It analyzes whether the capital structure affects corporate liquidity and growth within the firms. To that affect, four leverage ratios are used to define capital structure, four liquidity ratios are used to define liquidity and two marketability ratios with four profitability ratios are assumed for corporate growth. Leverages ratios provide a guideline to see the company's method of financing and its solvency, while the liquidity ratios measure the amount of liquid assets and whether these are enough to meet the current obligations. Similarly, the corporate growth is defined by considering market measures and profitability ratios. The purpose is to find out how firms' financing decisions affect the corporate liquidity and growth in tobacco industry. Secondary data of tobacco companies listed on Karachi stock exchange over the period of 2011-2016 is used. The regression test applied on calculated ratios demonstrated that leverage influences corporate liquidity and growth. It finds that tobacco companies are depending on debt financing and holding high proportion of short term debt.

The study aims to formulate themes and constructs emerging from literature to build a framework, which may lead to successful implementation of Blue Ocean Strategy. Design/Methodology/Approach: A qualitative, Grounded Theory (GT) research approach for literature review analysis was used to formulate themes and constructs, which may lead to successful implementation of BOS. Constant comparative methods were used to compare and contrast data over time and across informants and sources. The GT approach involved second-order analysis, which involved axial coding, synthesizing and clustering first-order codes into higher-order themes. Again, using constant comparative methods, comparing data over time and across codes, we condensed the data from literature into smaller units and further aggregated the 68 first-order and second order codes into 9 third order themes that were level specific. Findings: Our framework conceptualizes the application of three overall themes namely, innovative governance, integration of functional complexities and drivers of development in an organization to facilitate application of BOS. Nine major factors laid the basis of the framework. Thus, with the GT approach, these three (latent themes) emerged which were found to be imperative for a successful implementation of blue ocean strategy for any organization. Originality/Value: Blue Ocean Strategy (BOS) is widely popular and has made a strong mark in the business strategy and strategic management sphere. But, there has never been a study to understand and establish a model or framework from comprehensive analysis and synthesis of existing literature to discern the underlying paradigm for successful implementation of BOS.

This is explained by the existence of many formal accounting procedures and processes in limiting the level of accounting conservatism; (2) the design of inputs of accounting information systems has a positive impact on the level of accounting conservatism in commercial banks listed at Amman stock exchange. It is justified by the adoption of formal internal control system in linking the AISs of listed banks; (3) the design of processes of accounting information systems has a positive impact on the level of accounting conservatism in commercial banks listed at Amman stock exchange. The flexibility of the IFRS motivated management and accountants to practice the accounting conservatism; (4) The design of outputs of accounting information systems has a positive impact on the level of accounting conservatism in listed commercial banks. Several accounting adjustments at the end of the physical year were considered as an indication of the accounting conservatism level in listed banks; and (5) the bank's size has a negative impact on the level of the accounting conservatism, where the management of banks is controlled by formal processes and elements included in AISs, thus, an increase in the size of the bank led to a lower level of the accounting conservatism. The research recommended increase awareness on the importance of designing AISs in planning and decision-making processes. © 2019 Allied Academies.","Accounting conservatism; Designing accounting information systems; Jordanian commercial banks",""

Some of the components of the conceptual framework include after-sale services, e-marketing budget, tools for online marketing, e-promotions aimed at improving marketing performance and usefulness of marketing. Design: The researcher developed and tested four hypotheses related to different aspects of the e-market business model. Testing of measures' authenticity and hypothesis is usually essential. For accurate testing of both, confirmatory factor analysis and structured equations used respectively. Data collected from 110 general managers working in the marketing departments of small firms in Jordan. Findings: The study's findings indicated that the young population between the ages of 2-35 years has acknowledged and they usually embrace the use of digital marketing as a cheaper and efficient way of buying not only goods but also services. The aged are reluctant to adopt because they are not well conversant with online marketing whereas others do not trust online purchases. The research results have grave effects on not only the marketing strategies but also the development in the implementation of online marketing in small Jordanian businesses. In this modern era, the use of traditional marketing strategies is fading away with the penetration of online marketing in the social media platforms, emails, blogs, and general troubleshooting engines. Originality: There exist a gap in research in the Jordanian market where most researchers have explored less into the relationship of e-market to the market structure and the small market enterprises and the effects associated with the arising trends in the e-market. The research will also look into the correlation of these parameters to government support and policies. Thus, this research will prove to be instrumental in filling this gap as well as opening the stage for more research to been done on the same line. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","E-marketing strategic; E-promotion; Jordan; Marketing effectiveness; small business enterprises",""

Businesses in many countries have used diversification as the means to advance its economic progress. For Saudi Arabia to reach their vision by 2030, corporate diversification will be central to achieve a 'short-cut', if you will, in fulfilling its ambition. Researches in various disciplines are growing to propose creative solutions and approaches to achieve specific areas of the vision. However, the challenge should begin at solidifying corporate relationships that will soon connect various industries towards the common goals that have been presented before all stakeholders. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for corporate diversification, based on general business, industry environments and the firm's characteristics, and its effects on performance, to prepare firms to better understand its environments and characteristics in the context of developing countries in general and Saudi Arabia in particular. Data was collected from 62 managers representing their respective firms in Saudi Arabia's petrochemical, construction, banking and financial sectors, retail sectors, telecommunications and ICT, and the transportation sector. A combination of parametric and non-parametric tests was carried out using SPSS 22.0. The findings of this study suggest that the most used expansion strategy by far is internal capacity expansion. Additionally, businesses in Saudi Arabia mostly diversify by adding new products to their product line. Based on Resource- Based View (RBV), Skilled and competent technical staff, highly trained operatives, ability to access and retain highly qualified subcontractors and specialist labor factors were managed in most of the surveyed corporations. Further, almost all the surveyed corporations identified their strengths to be the skill and competency of their technical staff. Interestingly, however, communications and information technology were identified as the main weaknesses of these corporations. In the current state of things, a positive note is the indication that there have been improvements in the utilization of resources by these corporations, amongst some other benefits. However, the main barriers revealed the biggest concern being that there have been too many activities unrelated to the main business.

These threats have a potential effect on regional stability and security that will negatively affect the development of democracy which is still at its infancy. The threats are located in high levels of exclusion, inequality and political participation which is fairly weak. Manipulated electoral processes also compound peace and security threats by creating tense political environments. This is coupled with the notion that it is inconceivable to have socioeconomic development in the absence of peace and stability. Informed by the constructivist research paradigm, this study is directed at interrogating the nuts and bolts of managing peace and security mechanisms in the region and provide a strategic focus to help SADC states realise their full potential. The study is informed by the hermeneutic phenomenology together with the strategy theory in security and international relations studies using secondary data. The paper argues that, to address these concerns, it is the development of national and regional capacity for joint action and integration that will yield sustainable measures for mitigating instability and political insecurity. That regional security collaboration involves the requisite infrastructures which should be guaranteed by political obligations. Yet, the SADC Secretariat appears to be feeble to foster effective policy implementation. It is recommended that a common effective security framework be developed which improves collaborative international partnerships and a common foreign policy framework which enhances a collective engagement. With the proviso that, national sovereignty does not prevail over the interests of the region. Otherwise, the success of SADC's conflict management and resolution mechanisms will be forever in limbo. © 2019 Allied Academies.","Peace and security; SADC; Southern Africa; Strategy theory; Threats",""

It is worth noting that in European countries cluster policy is currently aimed not so much at the creation of new clusters as at the mobilization of available regional resources within clusters that are already in place. In addition to that, among the present-day trends is an increase in the share of small and medium-sized enterprises in clusters, which is determined by the special nature of these enterprises and the need for their integration with large companies and scientific centres. One is currently witnessing a trend whereby the focus of most cluster programs is on cluster development within highly specialized sectors of a region's economy as opposed to across all of its sectors indiscriminately. In a climate of the rapid development of cutting-edge information technology, there is taking place a transformation of both the very essence of innovative clusters and the way they associate with each other. One is witnessing the emergence of an increasingly great number of international clusters reaching beyond the region. Analysis of best practices helps determine some of the key areas for enhancing cluster policy. This is of significance for the Russian economy, with cluster development viewed as one of the priorities for Russia's economic policy today.

The term is very crucial in understanding certain challenges these environments facing and posing at an organizational level. However, the present research paper focused on Gender gap from the angle of Human Resource Environment. HR environment consisting of workforce or human capital is backbone for running any organization successfully. However, HR environment is clothed with certain external environmental barriers like legal, societal, economic, political, technological and cultural environments. Gender being comes under both internal and external environments. Organizations have to deal with this subject very carefully. At this juncture, from the context of organization, the subject of gender gap is to be verified from many folds. The current research paper is intended to address this phenomenon. Another observation from the literature is that organizations are focusing towards their major objective of wealth maximization. In fact, the major objective of Organizational Development (OD) is wealth maximization itself. In order to achieve this objective, organizations usually resorts to various techniques or interventions of Organizational Development in the form of strategies. The term gender generally is crucial, while assessing an organization's internal environment, especially human resource environment. The current research paper signifies the impact of Gender on Organizational Development. Though gender is a significant factor in deciding various facets of organizational development, organizations have to come up with strategies, especially on one of the important area like ""workforce composition"". Organizations are adopting different practices and policies to deal with the situation and the current research paper focusses on the dimension of workforce composition in different contexts.

It is based on content and text analysis informed by an interpretivism approach/constructivist concern as the philosophical assumption. Good governance is critical for political and developmental discourse for the Africa states. The African Union (AU) prescribes the adherence to the pursuit of this principle. Given the uneven historical and developmental backgrounds, governance is in deficit in most of the African countries hence the realisation of this goal demands formidable strategizing. Although several states are plodding their way toward establishing good governance, the threshold is yet to be crossed by many. Good governance is developmental, enables economic growth and the judicious use of available resources. Governance in disarray results in the deterioration of state relations, eventually leading to political instability. Towards reconstruction, the AU through the African Peer Review (APR) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) among others, should be seized with good governance practices on top of the development agenda. © 2018, Allied Academies.","African Union; Disarray; Good governance; NEPAD; Regional bodies",""

In the process of choosing the most optimal method of complex food security assessment, we proposed applying the technique developed by Olovyannikov (2009), which allows using the available statistical information in the process of food security research at the regional level. The definition of food safety criteria is proposed on the basis of the coefficients within four levels: high, acceptable, low and unacceptable. The approbation of the methodology of integrated assessment of regional food security proposed by Olovyannikov (2009) was conducted on the example of a region that has a low level of socio-economic development. This methodology can be applied to regions with different levels of development and available potential. In Russia, more than 70% of regions have a low level of socio-economic development and only 4-5 subjects have a high level of development and economic security. In the current circumstances, this weakens the economic security of not only the regions but also the state as a whole. The technique proposed by Olovyannikov (2009) allows determining the criteria, contributing to the weakening of economic security of the territories and, in accordance with this, to make the right strategic decisions to equalize the situation and strengthen the positions of the regions.

There is hardly any empirical investigation that integrated these three aspects in an effort to achieve sustainability. Thus, this research is expected to fill the gap by proposing a holistic approach for achieving IMFI sustainability. This study used survey method on 98 units of sharia cooperatives/Baitul Maal Wattamwil (BMTs) using a structured questionnaires based on Likert scale of 5 points. The previous holistic approach was developed based on the literature review and the responses of IMFI's experts. Partial least square path modeling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. The results show that financial, social and spiritual intermediation has a positively significant effect on IMFI's sustainability in Indonesia. These results also show that IMFI's sustainability problem can be overcome by applying holistic approach. The study is focused on Islamic Micro Finance Institution (IMFI). The future study is expected to observe the impact of this holistic approach on the lives of the poor and on the performance of micro-enterprises as beneficiaries of IMFI. This study is the first empirical one to examine the sustainability of IMFI using a holistic approach. It also provides new contribution to the IMFI's intermediary concept from the double bottom line-as known so far-has become a triple mission of IMFI. © 2018 Allied Academies.","Financial Intermediation; Holistic approach; Islamic microfinance; Social intermediation; Spiritual intermediation; Sustainability IMFI",""

The study focuses on the experiences of employees based within the leading concrete and cement producer 'Lafarge-Jordan'. Using a qualitative approach and the use of convenience sampling, a questionnaire was developed to gather the views of the company's employees on the perceived impact of TQM in their organization on its ability to meet different business challenges. 73 employees completed the survey. Partial Least Squares (PLS) were chosen using SmartPLS 3 software with a two-stage approach in measurement and structural model testing. The results showed that customer focus and senior management support are the two most important variables that enhance the ability to face different types of challenges. Integrative relationships with suppliers and continuous improvement were found also to have a significant impact on reducing quality costs to help overcome competition. Based on the previous literature and results, this research recommends the orientation towards greater employee involvement because they are the cornerstone to successful TQM; further, it is more advantageous to analyze both the soft and hard effects of TQM to overcome challenges. © 2019 Academy of Strategic Management Journal.","Lafarge-Jordan; Overcome challenges; Total Quality Management (TQM); TQM dimensions",""

We employed ARDL, VECM and granger causality to assess these relationships. The results show cointegrating relationships between FPI and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), FMD and real economic growth (RGDPG). The vector error correction model further confirmed the existence of long run relationships between the variables under observation. Short run causality was found to emanate from FPI, FDI and RGDPG to FMD. Granger-causality results confirmed that FMD causes both FPI and FDI, while FPI causes FDI. Moreover, jointly FDI, FMD and GDP growth collectively cause FPI. We however find no causality running from FPI, FDI and RGDPG to FMD, implying that financial market development in Mauritius is internally catalysed. Findings are consistent with underlying economic theories and earlier empirical studies. This paper contributes to the global debate of whether foreign investments drive financial market development in a developing country; or it is financial market development that drives foreign investment. A further significant contribution of this paper is that this study applied a PCA-constructed composite index to proxy financial market development in Mauritius.

Previous studies have pointed out that the social entrepreneurial tendency among HEI students remains at a moderate level. In addition, low awareness on social entrepreneurship, as well as limited access to human capital and financial resources (Malaysia Social Enterprise Blueprint, 2015-2018), are some of the factors which discourage students from carrying out social entrepreneurial activities. Hence, the objectives of this study are: i) to determine the level of strategic domains of social entrepreneurship namely entrepreneurial personality, human capital and social capital among HEIs students; and ii) to determine the differences in the domains of entrepreneurial personality, human capital and social capital based on students' duration of experience in social entrepreneurial activities at HEIs. The survey method was used on a total of 742 HEI students who were involved in social entrepreneurial activities. Proportionate stratified sampling was applied according to university category. The findings indicates that the level of social entrepreneurial personality and human capital was higher than social capital, based on students' experience in social entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, the results show that there is a significant difference between entrepreneurial personality, human capital and social capital according to the duration of students' experience in entrepreneurial activities. The longer the students were actively involved in social entrepreneurial activities (3 years and above), the more likely they are to possess the traits of entrepreneurial personality, human capital and social capital. The findings of this study have implications on the effective development of social entrepreneurship among HEI students and reinforces the usability of the Entrepreneurial Event Theory (Shapero, 1982). It also implies that the existing strategic domains of social entrepreneurship should be improved from time to time through various activities in order to progress towards new social innovations. © 2019 Allied Academies.","Entreprereneurial Personality; Experience; Higher Education Institution (HEI); Human Capital; Social Capital; Social Entrepreneurial Strategic; Student",""

The state is oriented to the needs and demands of citizens and also provides an opportunity to participate in public policy and to organize various state and municipal services. In the process of state and municipal service provision, the state pays attention to a feedback development with citizens and uses new ways of public service provision. The federal law No. 210 ""On the organization of state and municipal service provision"" issued on July 27, 2010, defines the principles and the procedure for state (municipal) services provision, the conditions and the procedure for their payment, the rights of the applicants and the responsibilities of government bodies. One of the most important trends in the development of public service provision system on the territory of Russian Federation is the concept of Multi-Functional Centers (hereinafter referred to as MFCs) to provide the services according to ""one window"" principle. In the city of Moscow, they created the public service portal ""Electronic Government"", which provides the electronic access to services. Using it, an applicant can file a request and other necessary documents, learn about the progress of public service provision and get its result and pay the state fee. The result of MFC organization is that the process of state and municipal service organization has become more accessible, convenient and much more comfortable, due to waiting time reduction because of an electronic queue appearance, the terms for the processing of documents, the schedule of the center work comfortable for applicants, moreover, the MFC guarantees the protection of legal rights and the interests of citizens and organizations. In recent years, the forms of MFC activities the work of which had shortcomings have undergone certain change. A large modernization of MFC activities is accompanied by efficiency increase during the provision of services, but it is necessary to take into account the population adaptation to such rapid reengineering. Nowadays, a low quality of state and municipal service provision on the basis of MFC remains one of the key problems, despite of the widespread practice of MFC creation and development on the territory of Russian Federation. Difficulties arise for citizens during their appeal for this or that service and in the organization of MFC work. Within the framework of state and municipal management effectiveness increase, one of the key tasks is to improve the quality of population life, as well as to reduce the existing administrative barriers in various areas of public relations, which significantly affects the quality of state and municipal services provided to individuals or legal entities. © 2018, Allied Academies.","Electronic Russia; Feedback; Internet resource; Multifunctional centers; My documents; One Window; Population; Public administration; State; State services",""

R-I reflects the on-the-spot way of 'thinking' more profoundly or in ways that open the world and guide managers in it. This means that innovation managers deploy R-I by their intuitive grasp and simultaneous reflection during the course of the situation which guides further action and modifies on-going practice. As a result, this enables good decisions to be made. It is proposed that the transmutation of 'reflection' and 'intuition' into R-I-K involves the three specific, interwoven and dialogical modes (abductive, deductive and inductive) of innovation management practice. The examples in this paper refer to the practice of being an innovation manager. Such a perspective will contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the complex knowing involved in (innovation) management and an alternative sharper focus is given on how reflection and intuition can sometimes operate simultaneously and intertwined. This is one step in enhancing our theoretical sensitivity towards how the interwoven aspects of R-I can improve managerial practice and knowing. Seeing R-I knowing as an intertwined and complex phenomenon has the potential to more fully reveal its manageability.","Abduction; Deduction; Induction; Intuition; Knowing; Reflection",""

The main objective of this study was to ascertain the extent to which work-life balance initiative predicts employee behavioral outcomes in some selected commercial banks in Nigeria. To achieve this, the study adopted a survey research design for an accurate investigation. Three hundred and thirty nine (339) respondents were surveyed across the top five (5) commercial banks with branches in Lagos State, Nigeria using stratified and simple random sampling techniques. Structural Equation Model (AMOS 22) was used for the analysis to find the resultant effects and the degree of relationship between the exogamous and endogamous variables. Results show that work leave arrangement, flexible work arrangement, employee time out, employee social support and dependent care initiative are predictors of employee behavioral outcomes such as job satisfaction, employees' intention and employees' engagement. The study emphasized the need for top management to review the appropriateness and relevance of work-life balance programmes, policies and activities that support and encourage employees as regards their personal and family life issues that are aimed towards inspiring acceptable workplace behavior. This study contributes to the exiting knowledge in the area of work-life balance and employee behavioral outcomes. The insights discovered from this study would help to facilitate management to develop work-life balance initiatives and standard institutional strategies that will propel appropriate and acceptable behavior in the world of work. This will also be useful for managers who wish to improve the well-being of their employees and organizational performance outcomes. © 2018, Allied Academies.","Dependent care initiative; Employee behavior; Employee social support; Employee time out; Flexible work arrangement; Work leave arrangement; Work-life balance",""

However, despite the fact, the actual production achieved by the automotive lubricant industry is still under 50% of the production capacity. In terms of market share, PT Pertamina Lubricant dominates market share of automotive lubricant in Indonesia with achievement of market share ranging from 49-51% while the rest of automotive lubricant companies only able to control market share with the percentage is far below 20%. Such condition shows the not yet optimum performance of automotive lubricant company in Indonesia. It was allegedly related to the weaknesses in the implementation of business strategy and weakness in the development of market orientation and development of company resources. The research was conducted through an explanatory survey method. Primary data were obtained based on the results of the census to 32 national automotive lubricant companies. The hypothesis was examined by using Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM). The results show that business strategy has greater influence than market orientation and company resources in improving company performance. Market orientation has a greater influence rather than company resources in formulating more precise business strategy. The results of this study have implications for national automotive lubricant companies that to improve the performance of the company, then business strategy needs to be formulated more precisely through the development of market orientation supported by the development of company resources. © 2002-2019 Allied Business Academies.","Business strategy; Company performance; Company resources; Market orientation",""

Initially, the authors believed that participant's traits such as age, education would have the major impact rather than position-based experience, industry, and different situations on the leadership styles expressed. However, a deeper analysis and study of the data gathered from various organizations, the results were surprisingly different. Aim: The analysis of the study revealed how the participant's position, qualifications, experienced and industry affected the leadership styles. Some very interesting questions and situations have been attempted to understand the leadership style in this report based on a standard leadership style survey. This paper aims to report the findings of an empirical study exploring the relationship between three prominent models of leadership styles using the independent variables. Further, a Neural Network analysis methods and identify the most prominent influencer of the choice probability of leadership style. The independent variable which relates to the demographic and work-related includes factor such as age, gender, level of education, industry type, levels of management, total work experience, experience in the organization. Methodology: The study is an empirical study based on leadership questionnaire survey using multivariate analysis followed by neural network estimation on the data collected from employees across various levels of management in the UAE. Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire developed and administered as a means of objective assessment of the leadership style of various managers across the UAE followed by the categorizing of scores to identify prominent/explicit styles and dormant styles that were then analyzed based on modeling. Findings: The results reveal that the spectrum of three leadership styles containing basic characteristics, such as the type of branches, the age, and educational level are inter-related with communication, commitment, satisfaction, and effectiveness. The authors conclude that the unique setting and context found in the public sector-very much defined by the UAE Constitution-leads to subtle, but very real and noteworthy differences. The current literature around the world show that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector based on the various analyses. However, our research analyses gives a different picture for the UAE. The results shows that in the UAE the public sector is more effective and efficient than the private sector because of the leadership styles followed in this sector. Research Limitations/Implications: Limitations include the self-report methodology that measures perceptual data with a series of questionnaire items. The survey responses that were complete for analysis were more skewed towards the public sector as the other sectors did not respond well.

Malaysian companies corporate social reporting increases over the years and happened to be the best in ASEAN countries. Corporate social responsibility in Malaysia was formally instituted by several companies in the 1970s. At the turn of the century, it expanded along lines similar to the CSR movements in other Asian countries (Ismail, Alias and Rasdi, 2015). These reports are important to other users (such as employees, consumers, community, government and NGOs), other than solely for financial analysts and fund managers (Zakimi and Atan, 2011). Still, the requirement of sustainability reporting by the BURSA listed companies being met poorly as the number of companies' publishing sustainability reports through web site is insignificant. The purpose of this research is to examine the sustainability report of the Malaysian business to know its quality of disclosure according to the internationally accepted guidelines. The result of this evaluation shows that very few of the excellent companies, according to a rewarding authority named Frost and Sullivan, publish sustainability reports and majority of the reports disclose their strategic philanthropy practices. The companies investigated in the research were awarded as the Malaysian best in the year 2015 as their delivery in the respective industries.

Therefore, this study investigates the mediating effect of employee creativity on the link between HPWS and SME performance in Nigeria. Using cross-sectional research approach, data were collected from a sample of 518 managers in Nigerian SME firms. Sample selection was based on stratified sampling technique, given that the population is large and resources (time and money) are not adequate for the researchers. The overall finding signifies partial mediating effect of employee performance on HPWS-performance link. This indicates that HPWS in Nigerian SMEs enhances performance. Yet, HPWS is not enough to stimulate high performance until it induces employee creativity which will in turn precipitate higher firm performance. Also, the finding shows that SMEs' success relies on the inputs of highly committed, well-motivated and qualified employees.

Using the epistemological review based on Kuhn models of scientific revolutions, this study proposes, through a systematic review in journals from 2006 until now, proper division and approach to use neuroscience within strategic management. The conclusion is that tools of neuroscience are promising in the strategic management, but there is still much misunderstanding about what would be neuroscientific research and behavioral research and the contribution to these new fields of studies on strategic management lies on a proposition to a better classification of them. As a novelty, we propose a discussion to define possible new epistemological paradigms which neuroscience brings to the field of study about strategic management. © 2018, Allied Academies.","Behavioral strategy; Cognitive neuroscience; Decision-Making; Epistemology; Systematic review",""

This paper examines the relationship between stock returns and corporate communication strategies in the 2001 Firestone tire recall crisis related to the Ford Explorer. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach, we classify quotes in published newspaper accounts using Image Restoration Theory (Benoit, 1995) and an accommodative-defensive dichotomy (Marcus & Goodman, 1991). We utilize a cross-sectional event study methodology to analyze the stock market impact of the strategies. Results indicate different communication patterns and illustrate a mixed stock price reaction to the product recall. Ford's image bolstering communication strategy was associated with a more positive stock market reaction, while Firestone tended toward accommodative strategies and struggled with a more negative reaction. Both companies lost significant value during the crisis period, but the results are suggestive that managers can help maintain shareholder value during future corporate crises by utilizing specific communication strategies.","",""

However, this development isn't an easy process, especially for new employees in the labor market. A new and highly efficient solution is an advisory process, widely known as mentoring. In mentoring, each employee develops a counseling relationship with a mentor, who usually has more experience than the employee and therefore undertakes to guide him in his professional career. This paper investigates career development issues through mentoring in the case of non-dependent work relation for the company LR Health & Beauty Systems. The purpose of this research is to explore whether mentoring contributes to employee's career development who are working on the network company LR Health & Beauty Systems. The research part of this study is based on a questionnaire, which was distributed to company's employees and is related to mentoring issues. It was proved that the most important factor for the successful implementation of a mentoring program is the same people that will implement it. Factor analysis was used to identify possible relations between some variables (relations) as the institution of mentoring, mentor's functions and procedures that were used in employees' career development.

Despite its value, only a few institutions that have tried with the approach have been successful. Improving auditor independence can help in the application of TQM principles. The study sought to establish the possible effects that the autonomy of the auditor can have on TQM. The objectives were: (i) to objectively assess the current state of auditor independence, and (ii) to analyze the relationship between total between auditor independence and TQM. Even though the relationship between the two elements has been suggested, the research toward this direction is limited. The study followed a comparative design in which the mean TQM indices were compared across two sets of firms. The first set comprised five companies from Forbes' list of the most trustworthy firms. The second set included corporations that had reported financial scams in recent years. The TQM indices were computed based on employee reviews collected from Glassdoor and Indeed as well as information on the companies' websites. In calculating the index, three aspects of quality, ethics, integrity, and trust were used. The stakeholder theory, which emphasizes the need for organizations to consider the interest of every stakeholder, was used as a guiding framework for the research. Regarding the first objective, despite the growing emphasis auditor independence, realizing its goals remain a challenge. The obstacles to achieving complete autonomy include the familiarity that may exist between auditors and their clients, the increase in the number of advisory services among accounting firms, management abdication, inconsistent report structures, and the self-inclination to soften disturbing reports. Concerning the second objective, the average TQM index for the first category of companies was 3.00 while the average for the second set was 3.004 indicating that companies that had better audit practices also had had higher TQM scores. The paired t-test showed that the difference in the means was significant (t = 4.003; p = 0.016).

The study employed cross-sectional research approach in which data were collected from a sample of 518 of SME managers in Nigeria. Partial Least Squares Method (PLS) algorithm and bootstrapping technique were used to test the study's hypotheses. The overall findings signified a positive effect of HPWS on SME performance and management philosophy was found to interact negatively with HPWS in enhancing performance. This result portrays presence of mismatch between SME managers' philosophies and organizational practices (HPWS).

The diffusion of innovations in an organization is provided by using three possible instruments: 1) the development of regulations, instructions, which oblige workers to participate in the implementation of innovations without the change of material and non-material motivation system; 2) the change of current material incentive system (wage organization); 3) the change of non-financial incentive system. We considered the use of the hierarchy analysis method (Saaty method) during the selection of possible innovation diffusion instruments in an organization. The most preferred tool is the use of organizational and administrative documents. The management develops regulations governing the staff conduct during the implementation of innovations. They are created for each organization department, for the categories of staff involved in the implementation of innovations.

Flexibility enables management of personnel, load of the used equipment, efficient application of the existing facilities (equipment, area). Flexibility of the production processes becomes even more possible and expressed if unified standardized operations exist. Application of this principle was demonstrated on the example, how the machine tool's lubricating-cooling fluid was changed in the production.

The authors attempt to analyze the changes in organizations of public service and to understand how the studied situation is comprehended by civil servants. In order to study the subject it was necessary to turn to the micro level to include in the focus of analysis the everyday practice of the organization's employees, their life experience and value orientation. To study doxa, or the existing value orientations of civil servants, a research was conducted using the questionnaire by M. Rokich system. According to the method of M. Rokich, two types of values were allocated: terminal and instrumental. Values were merged into a collective notion of doxa, which becomes a research tool of rooted samples of consciousness and behavior. The main research interest was caused by the differences in the groups of public servants according to the distribution of instrumental and terminal values. On the basis of this research the conclusion has been done about the exhibiting of heterodoxy, that is, a critical attitude to the existing doxa, about the degree of awareness by public officials of new values, new patterns of behavior, thinking and perception. The information, obtained by the authors in the study, shows that for the success of change management in organizations of the state service it is necessary to develop special methods of informing employees about the nature and inevitability of introduced innovations and their involvement in the change process, train and develop the younger generation of public servants, to take seriously additional vocational training and retraining.","Civil service; Doxa; Heterodoxy; Instrumental values; Organizational change management; Professionalism; Terminal values; Value orientations",""

The authors employ as their primary research method the expert evaluation method with a view to obtaining a coherent assessment of the effectiveness of the formation and implementation of the organizational-economic mechanism underlying the state's structural policy on import substitution. The experts engaged were evaluated via heuristic evaluation. The study's results have led to the conclusion that the following objectives ought to be regarded as the key strategic priorities for the state's policy on import substitution: reducing the share of imports to a specific scientifically substantiated level and enhancing its structure, minimizing the extent of monopolization and cultivating competition in the internal market, developing a well-balanced system of chain stores, and pursuing boosts in the government procurement of domestic goods and services.","Expert evaluation method; Import substituting products; Import substitution; Instruments for regulating import substitution; State's structural policy on import substitution",""

Small enterprises play the crucial role in technological changes as they are rich in sources of innovation, which will give an opportunity to use new technologies and business processes, as well as to increase labour productivity and improve the quality of products and services. The article presents a study of small innovative business in Russia, which shows that the level of its development is quite low and significantly inferior to advanced foreign countries. At the same time, the analysis of development prospects after the adoption of the innovative development strategy of Russia has revealed the positive dynamics of the innovation activities of small enterprises, especially in some federal districts, which demonstrates the relevance of its adoption. The article points out that the lack of innovation is caused not only due to the global and national crises in the economy, but also the absence of the Russian small business interest in the development and production of innovative goods. The authors conclude that it is necessary to identify the priority areas of science and technology at the federal level and at the territorial level it should be considered the competitive potentials of socio-economic development of a certain area.","Innovations; Small innovative business; Socioeconomic development; Technological innovations",""

According to the preliminary studies, the labor power employed in the forest sector and future green jobs in the regions have also declined, in particular due to the increase in the performance efficiency. The recession that began in 2008 also led to increased unemployment and economic ills in forest-dependent communities and areas. As for the regions of the temperate and boreal zones, according to the analysis, the value added indicators have not changed in the period of 2010-2015 (although exports increased by 10%), proportion of sector in total labor power (contribution to employment) declined by 0.2 percentage points (from 0.7 to 0.5%), while the percentage of forest sector in GDP decreased by 0.3 percentage points (from 1.1 to 0.8%). Three developed regions (North-Western, Siberian, and Far East regions) are still major producers and consumers of forest products. At that, they account for 23% of total employment, half of value added in the global forestry sector, and 60% of forest products exports that is mainly due to a high level of value added in the wood processing sector in these regions. However, the share of these three regions in the global value added indicators, employment, and trade in the last decade has steadily decreased due to various factors, including the recent economic downturn and financial crisis, increased competition in international markets and competition from other sectors. Developing regions and Eastern Europe began to play an increasingly important role in global forest products manufacturing and trade. In the period of 2010-2015 their share in total employment in the global forestry sector has increased from 58 to 68%, while the proportion in global value added indicator in the sector has grown from 28 to 47%. This is mainly due to the development of the wood processing industry.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Forest policy; Forest services; Green economy; Medical ecology; Monitoring; Payments for ecosystem services; Protective functions of forests; Recreation",""

The leading place among the information needed for the analysis is taken by accounting data and financial reports of the company to which, in turn, increased requirements are applied at the present stage of improvement accounts and records. However, the data of financial statements of Russian companies for a number of years, as a rule, are not comparable due to the frequent changes in accounting policy caused by changes in legislation, registration forms, as well as failing to take inflation into account. The main reasons for the low demand for accounting data for managerial purposes are that in most cases they were incomplete, and also financial statements were low reliable. We have selected two groups of respondents for their study the first of them consists of the heads of Russian companies reporting under RAS (Russian Accounting Standards), and the second of CEOs of the companies that prepare financial statements both under RAS and IFRS. Based on the survey, we found that the companies preparing the statements both in accordance with RAS and IFRS, have more accurate figures of financial statements than the companies that use RAS. We have found that financial statements data are more in demand to external users than the internal ones, and the reason for this is the lack for external users of other sources of information, while internal users use all possible sources of additional information about the property and financial condition of an enterprise.","Financial statements; IFRS; Information database; RAS; Reliability; Respondents; Transparency",""

Implementation of innovation in the economic activity of the enterprise is a complex process. Thus, effective innovation process conditions and factors, as well as mechanisms of its control need further investigation. METHODS The study is based on general research methods such as the analysis and synthesis, the deduction and induction, the interrelation between historical and logical, laws of dialectics, and the analysis of cause and effect relationship. Special methods include the institutional approach, methods of the theory of property rights and the theory of innovation. The study is based on the works of scholars such as J.A. Schumpeter, N.D. Kondratieff, D.C. North, R.H. Coase, D. Hahn, S.Y. Glaz'ev, D.S. Lvov, J.L. Abalkin, K.S. Mullakhmetov, S.P. Robbins, M. Coulter, R.L. Daft, V. Horvath, and others. RESULTS Conducted study revels beneficial effect of property rights exchange in the innovation process. Property rights act as a vital institution of increasing confidence and values in the innovation process. The identified main stages of the innovation process are considered in a following sequence: idea → intellectual property asset → intangible assets → shares. The exchange of proprietary rights allows determining the required ratio of economic resources and create behavior scenario of the innovation process participants. DISCUSSION Special attention is paid to the transitions from stage to stage in the innovation process, as well as improvement of control procedures at each stage. It is found that the main risks occur during the transition of the innovation process from one stage to another. These stages should be taken into account when exchanging and control of property rights. The authors distinguish between sales of knowledge and intellectual property management since property rights transformation in these two cases is different. FINAL REPORT The application of the institutional approach and the property rights theory to improve the effectiveness of the innovation process is a promising and relevant tool of economic activity of university and enterprise.","Control; Innovation; Innovation process; Institutions; Intangible assets; Property rights; Shares",""

The findings are illustrating the prevalent perception of volunteer work through the stereotypes of voluntary-compulsory forms of stimulating public activity. Most of the participants in an author-conducted survey listed the following reasons behind low levels of participation on the part of Russians in programs and movements of cultural volunteering: social apathy, lack of time, exorbitant requirements for volunteers and financial costs. The findings have revealed fragmentary interest in volunteer activity, which tends to fade away quickly due to being busy and overwork. Most youth are oriented toward volunteer activity that requires help in organizing mass major activities conducted by federal and regional authorities. The major issues in the development of cultural volunteering in Russia currently are: an information vacuum around volunteer activity at the local level, lack of social demand for volunteering and lack of readymade trilateral models for interaction among local authorities, state-funded organizations and volunteers. Respondents noted considerable gaps in the organization of volunteer work, lack of funding for cultural volunteering and lack of measures for popularizing it among youth. The primary objective behind the development of this kind of model for organizational interaction is boosting the professional level of volunteers, achieving synergetic effect from the participation of all interested parties in the interests of facilitating the social-economic development of a municipal unit, conserving cultural-historical heritage sites and enhancing the quality of the operation of sites within the cultural sphere. The benefits of employing this model include the possibility of properly preparing youth as potential volunteer movement participants, monitoring the needs of municipal units for volunteer help and making an effective use of and integrating scientific, educational and organizational-personnel resources. The model brings forward the following set of mechanisms for engaging youth in volunteer activity for the purposes of conserving Russia's cultural-historical heritage sites: coordinating the work of volunteers at the local level, providing information support for volunteer activity and training volunteers.

Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of manufacturing development in the framework of Industry 4.0 concept were identified on the basis of the SWOT-analysis, using statistical and publicly available data. As a result, development strategies of industrial production in Russia in the framework of concept Industry 4.0 have been proposed. These strategies are aimed at stimulating long-term investments, ensuring financial resources redistribution between the industries, as well as at establishing and influencing new leading markets for goods and services. Based on the results of SWOT-analysis, the most significant economic factors of industrial production development in Russia have been found out. The authors have noted increased productivity and profitability of production and the rise of collaboration effectiveness between the economic entities. Such factors as the need to develop a new type of intellectual value chain, production of individual and customized goods with reasonable prices and use of learning factories have specific meaning in the framework of this problem. These factors are also significant for European manufacturers. However, in the context of the Russian industrial policy within Industry 4.0, certain systemic economic factors that could have a negative impact on the development of priority sectors of industry have been identified.

This is why the demand for green products is increasing in the world. To satisfy this demand, organic agriculture is rapidly developing, which is a system of production that helps preserve the state of ecosystems, lands and people due to cessation of application of chemical plant protection agents and mineral fertilizers and replacement of these with biological and technological methods. This article reviews the essence, peculiarities, prerequisites, problems and benefits of organic agriculture. The analysis of the development of this sector of the agrarian economy in other countries has been carried out, in comparison with the trends taking place in Russia. The capacity of the market of organically produced products, as well as the production and consumption in various countries have been estimated: the largest amount of organic manufacturers are located in Asia due to less complex transition to this quality from the existing production manufacturing method; the leaders in organic production consumption are USA and European countries. The process of shaping of the state regulation of the development of organic agriculture in European countries has been studied, including the legal framework and a wide range of support measures. Russia is at the starting step of forming organic agriculture but has the potential capabilities in strengthening its positions in the international market of organically produced products have been substantiated, provided that the necessary legislative, institutional and financial conditions for that were created. The conceptual model of formation of organic agriculture in Russia has been developed and its core elements at the federal and regional levels have been defined, along with the necessary activities of organic producers and consumers.

The subject owes its relevance to the fact that traditional (classic) approaches to the strategic management of the operation and development of present-day enterprises within the high-tech sector are failing to align with the latest trends and cannot be used under conditions of non-linearity and stochastic changes within the framework of the current economic cycle and techno-economic paradigm. The inferences derived from this research study substantiate the advisability of using the methodological concept of foresighting for the purposes of strategic planning and managing the development of high-tech enterprises. Based on the findings of this study, the authors come to the following conclusions: foresighting is a relatively new tool for the strategic management of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises. That being said, considering that foresighting may involve the various public forces and employ the various channels for up-and-down communication between the entrepreneurial, scientific and public-governmental spheres, with decisions being focused on the long run, there is potential for a much wider scope of the search for and deployment of strategic benchmarks for the development of high-tech enterprises. The methodological concept of foresighting the innovation development of high-tech enterprises makes it possible to change the strategic adaptive approach to forecasting and planning their activity into the strategic constructive one. Sequential implementation of stages in foresighting makes it possible to determine the outline and alternative dimensions of the innovation development of high-tech enterprises through the use of special technology (horizon scanning and weak signal detection) and conduct the selection of promising projects, which, if implemented, will help achieve the goals set by the company.","Foresight project; Foresight research; Foresighting; High-tech enterprises; Innovation development; Roadmap; Strategic management; Strategy for innovation development; System of innovation management",""

The authors propose a methodology for assessing the viability of innovative startups, which, if implemented, may help new startups survive their first three years of business. The paper shares the findings of a study of the latest trends on startups both in Russia and overseas, analyzes the degree of activity with which startups are emerging, and explores specific characteristics of entrepreneurs developing their business from scratch, like gender and age. The authors analyze the specificity of Russian practice in terms of developing and implementing the fundamental idea of a startup and provide a rationale for the need to enhance the current legislative framework, which is inhibiting the development of this promising area. The paper also determines the major sources of funding for innovative startups in Russia and shares the findings of a comparative analysis of ratios in the volume of funds borrowed to implement startups. At present, there is a concern about the lack of proper mechanisms for assessing the viability of innovative startups, as well as about the ability to effectively attract outside funding. Among the novel and promising ways to attract investments to help implement startups in the Russian market is crowd-funding. Employing this tool is currently hampered by the lack of proper organizational and legislative regulations respecting this kind of activity. The development of startups in Russia may facilitate boosts in the population's economic activity levels and help create more jobs. It is to help this cause that the authors have developed a specific methodology for assessing the viability of innovative startups.","Development of new projects; Innovative product; Investments; Minimizing risk; Startups in Russia",""

It was found that it is quite difficult to establish a direct interaction between the transformations of complexes of social events and local social changes on a temporal scale.

A time series forecasting often uses simple econometric models. The trend and seasonal trend models are among the popular models for forecasting. In some cases researchers need to analyze vector time series. The traditional algorithms of estimating time series models may be associated with a sufficiently high computational complexity. We propose the applications of oblique discrete Walsh transform to the synthesis of estimation algorithms of polynomial trend models' parameters of time series. Algorithms evaluate polynomial models that not above the third degree in a non-orthogonal basis of discrete exponential functions and orthogonal basis of discrete Chebyshev polynomials. The advantage of these algorithms is the computational efficiency, which associated with a significant reduction of the multiplicative complexity of algorithms in comparing with direct estimation of polynomial trend models.","Discrete transforms; Oblique discrete walsh transformations; Parametric estimation; Polynomial trend models; Time series",""

PL providers, or they need to be called LBP providers (logistic barter providers) because it has to be a completely different, predominant view of logistic and logistic barter role in new economy. Logistics barter is a web, a spider - the LBP provider. Logistic barter operators (providers) must meet not only the requirements of logistics barter between manufacturers, but also respond to the new challenges of supply chains. LBP-provider may exceed the capacities of barter logistics standard requirements, because an operator is engaged not only in the replacement of monetary relations, but works in the field of supply chain improvement. We must understand that a new economy theory based on logistic barter requires a developed infrastructure, i.e., a super system of supply chain management based on LBP providers. Logistics is developing, and the possibilities of supply chain management may be completely different. In terms of prospects logistic barter may play its role in economy.","Added Value; Indifference Ratio; Indifference Threshold; LBP-Provider; Logistic Barter; Principle",""

It has been demonstrated that the most accurate valuation of the option and the entire project in general is provided by the trinomial model. Also this paper establishes a degree of influence between an inflation rate and a risk-free investment rate on the precision of estimated value of an Asian real option. It has been shown with an example that in the event of advancing by the inflation rate beyond profitability of risk-free investments, which is typical for Russia, an option valuation in a trinomial lattice will be lower than that in a binomial lattice. The result serves a useful purpose for analysts considering the fact that a trinomial model is a more accurate discrete model than a binomial model.","Asian Option; Binomial Model; Constant Volatility; Real Option Valuation; Trinomial Model; Upgrading Equipment",""

In this paper, we evaluate it in a historical perspective, and suggest that the new theories of the firm as a receptacle of knowledge emerged in the context of the intensified knowledge communication within organizations in the early 1990s, and organizational practices that appropriated public property through the regime of intellectual property rights. We contend that organizational theory and practice are both in a state of dynamic mutual interaction, with theory often playing a lagging role. In other words, organizational actions precede, and are retroactively described (and legitimized) by theoretical developments. We then we subject Knowledge-Based theories of the firm to scrutiny, and conclude that they resort to simplistic definitions of knowledge. Using information from other social sciences, we identify some of the facets of knowledge that need to be considered in order to make our theories more meaningful.","",""

Drawing upon institutional perspective and experiential learning perspective, this paper argues that IJVs provide high divestment flexibility when environmental uncertainty is high and legitimacy pressures are low. If normative and regulative legitimacy pressures are high, then IJVs may not provide high divestment flexibility even when the host country's economic environment is volatile. In a similar vein, even when prior Country-And partnerspecific experience reduces perceived uncertainty in the host country, increased legitimacy gained through prior experience increases the expected level of local legitimacy and embeddedness for foreign parent firms of IJVs. Therefore, reduced perceived uncertainty may not necessarily lead to greater IJV divestment flexibility in such an institutional environment.","",""

Yet while much research explores how firm performance, governance structures, and types of succession affect the appointment decision, we have less understanding of the influence of contextual factors such as external constituents. This paper is the first to explore how one key constituent -investment analysts -may shape the appointment decision, specifically through serving as an information intermediary for the board. Because CEO succession creates uncertainty regarding the firm's future leadership and its strategic direction, I propose that investment analysts, as knowledgeable experts who provide research coverage on the firm, provide the board with information that is likely to influence their selection of a new CEO. In addition, I argue that because analysts are recognized as having expertise regarding the future performance of the firm, the board is likely to select a CEO in order to appease these critical stakeholders. Using panel data on S & P 500 companies for the 2000-2005 periods, I find evidence that analyst recommendations convey information about a firm's top management and the appropriateness of its strategy that is reflected in the appointment decision. Specifically, I find that more negative analyst ratings lead to a higher probability that the board will appoint an outsider CEO and also make the board more likely to appoint a high status CEO.","",""

How well executives acquire human capital shows up ultimately in the firm's performance. In many cases, an employee who starts in a certain field progresses through that field until reaching senior management and eventually the CEO's position. The firm's performance rests on how well its chief executive acquired human capital across a variety of areas or how well the executive is at assessing and assembling a management team. A similar process happens in sports. In the world of football, coaches move up the ranks of coaching from position assistants to coordinators (where they are directly responsible for player performance and play calling) and finally to head coaches (where they usually play a tangential role in coaching and play calling). In most cases, coaches have played some college football. They usually stay with what they know: if they played on defense, they coach defense. Once they reach the position of head coach, the question becomes 'How well does a coach know the other side of the ball?' That is, if a coach has spent his entire career learning the defensive side of football, how well are they at assembling the coaching staff and recruiting players for the entire team, including the offensive side? This paper collects data on NCAA head football coaches for the 2013 season and looks at the relationship between the coach's specialty (say offense) and the success of each unit (offense and defense) and the team's success. The paper hypothesizes that coaches that have specialized in offense are significantly better at hiring offensive coordinators and players and less skilled at hiring competent defensive coaches and players. Results show support of the hypothesis. Using ordinal logistic regressions, it appears that an Offensive-Minded coach improves his team's performance in terms of offensive statistics which leads to a longer career in coaching. The results are less clear regarding an offensive coach's impact on his team's defense. The impact depends on the coach's success and longevity. From a management perspective, it would be important for universities and head coaches to foster an environment that allows assistant coaches to gain a broad knowledge base while moving up the ranks of coaching. Like a successful firm that offers strong management training opportunities, a university should have a better chance at attracting better assistant coaches by offering them the chance to prepare for a future head coach's position.","",""

Nevertheless, the capital market in Indonesia should bear the negative effects of the crisis, which can be seen from the fall of the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) to expel most foreign investment funds of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) to be converted into cash as attempt to reduce exposure to risky assets and anticipate the tendency of the tight global liquidity. The magnitude of the risk exposure faced during the global financial crisis also shows the volatility that can be said as the ""fear gauge"" or the size of investor's fear because the volatility shows the risks faced by investors in certain circumstances. Therefore, we need a model that can accurately measure the level of volatility to be able to anticipate the risks faced by investors in uncertain market conditions.

Conducting joint business following the example of the experience of Japanese firms which create the so-called ""keiretsu"": a group of companies working together, but without a formal partnership. Analysts argue that the concentration of production, capital, and modern technologies in a functionally-integrated conglomerates ""keiretsu"" helps to reduce costs by increasing productivity and achieving economies of scale; groups intensively compete in all areas that stimulates the desire to penetrate in new markets. 2. Creation of syndicates which is a form of alliance business related mainly with products sales. The main purpose of the syndicate is to expand and hold position in markets, adjust the volume of output within the syndicate and the price of external market outlets. As a rule, a syndicate organizes a single selling service to which the members of the syndicate must hand over at a predetermined price and quota their products for joint sales. In some cases management of the syndicate arrange the purchase of raw materials and other products for the members of the syndicate at the expense of incomes raised from the sale of their products. Creation of innovative logistics centers for agricultural products will: 1. contribute to addressing the issue of food sovereignty and the establishment of import-substituting production of agricultural products; 2. provide low-cost, environmentally friendly agricultural products of own production; 3. create more jobs; 4. collect additional tax revenues to the budget; 5. receive a powerful stimulus to revive and support domestic agricultural producers.","Inter-Organizational Logistics Organization; Logistics Center; Supply Chain Management",""

Increasingly the expectation is that business organizations do more than superficially engage with the concepts; they are expected to integrate them directly into their operations. These demands add to the dynamic complexity of issues facing today's business organization leaders, yet adaptation to these changing demands is critical for organizational survival. Through examining an 'open systems' organizational model, this paper provides an embedded notion of the business organization that understands the multifarious processes and relationships of corporate social and environmental responsibility not as independent entity's but as a complex and dynamic whole. We suggest that from understanding this embedded and integrated perspective a business leader will avoid the critical challenges in moving towards a strategic direction based on corporate environmental and social Responsibility-Organizational vulnerability, Entrenchment and the Silo Effect.","Business environment; Change management; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; Open systems",""

Russian banks tend to underestimate education funding potential as a possible way to receive alternative revenue by adding this programme to the product line. The demand for education services is not especially high, but it still exists and is expected to grow in the years to follow.

Real options - sometimes known as strategic options - are situations firms create that give them flexibility in that they have the possibility of pursuing a certain course of action but not the obligation of doing so. The concept of real options is similar to that of financial options, in that in both cases the firm has a right to act in a particular way, but is not required to do so. Despite findings that the use of real options can benefit firms, few managers actually employ this approach, in large part because they find the concept vague and difficult to apply. The present article seeks to narrow the gap between the theoretical benefits to managers and firms of employing real options, and their limited use in practice by viewing the Miles and Snow framework of organizational strategy through a real options lens.

This exploratory research investigates the roles, duties, responsibilities, and nature of the work performed by the CEO. Employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, this triangulated study combines a comprehensive review of the management literature, with semi structured interviews and a brief questionnaire to examine what CEOs actually do. Grounded in the strategic management objective of maximizing an organization's relative firm performance in an Ever-Increasing high velocity and hypercompetitive marketplace, results suggest that CEOs perform three fundamental and highly disparate functions: functional coordination, environmental scanning, and visionary leadership. A central challenge with these disparate responsibilities is each role requires a different set of skills and capabilities. To coordinate vastly disparate functional departments in an effort to achieve synergistic productivity, the CEO must be internally focused, maintain a coordination mindset, build and promote a culture of cooperation and open communication, and remain readily Available--Both physically and Cognitively--To engage and resolve emerging conflicts, disputes, and challenges. To effectively scan the marketplace for opportunity and threat signals, the CEO must be externally focused, engage and maintain a search mindset, process and evaluate vast amounts of information, and nurture and expand existing information networks. While the coordination function requires turning one's focus inward on the organization, and the scanning function requires an external focus, the visionary responsibility requires simultaneous internal and external foci. In addition, the visionary leader must apply a 'fit' analysis to identify relevant market factors, and then formulate appropriate strategic alternatives, while incorporating an intuitive crystal ball when determining the organization's strategic direction. This triangulated design and grounded theory approach (1) revealed the CEO roles of coordinator, environmental scanner, and visionary leader, (2) brought to light that chief executive officers have multiple highly evolved identities they maneuver between to navigate the disparate executive duties as members of Neo-Tribes, and (3) underscored and reinforced previously published findings regarding the disparate, chaotic, unplanned, Action-Oriented, fastpaced, and Broad-Scoped nature of executive work, characterized by a lack of routine, orderly activities, and instead dominated by unexpected and often urgent crises. What makes the CEO's job so difficult, beyond the broad and extensive knowledge and capabilities required of the position, is that the executive must perform their disparate duties simultaneously, and in circumstances characterized by uncertainty and endless interruption. CEOs and their organizational stakeholders benefit by embracing the 'multiple identities' framework to better understand the disparate nature of executive work. Armed with a renewed and deeper understanding, CEOs might consciously, and with less resistance, move between identities as needed. An improved understanding may also assist boards of directors in the CEO search and hiring process, as well as inform nascent CEOs considering a career as an executive officer. In addition, this understanding may advance business schools and management education at undergraduate, MBA, and executive levels.","",""

This concept includes the following areas: 1) a concept of management of financial flows, 2) a concept of management of investment flows and 3) a concept of management of investment financing risks. With a view to developing a general concept of integrated management of financial flows of an investing region, a separate new category of regional risks of financial flows has been conceived, which is an integrated index combining other regional risks, more specifically, the capital flow risk category. In the light of direct influence of market factors on management decision making by a Regional Government, this paper contains a developed concept of capital flow risk management in the region. The Regional Government, as the most informed investor, is suggested to carry out arbitrage operations both in the home market and in a market located outside the region. The obtained cash earnings must be firstly distributed in the form of additional investment resources on a competitive basis among enterprises strategically important for the region.

Introduction. The paper is relevant due to economic security level recession of the Russian economy in recent years. It is proposed to provide the interaction of socio-economic development indicators of the country and established control measures in the policy intended to improve the economic security of the country. It is proposed to use the institutional approach to solve the problem. 2. Methods. The main methodological basis of the paper is an institutional nature of economic relations that is expressed through an interrelated sequence of the following stages: institutions - motivation - control. In the paper, such research methods were used as the institutional approach, analysis and synthesis of historical data, the laws of dialectics, and a method of cause-effect relationships. 3. Results. This paper represents the author's recommendations for the transfer of external (negative) manifestations of control to internal (constructive) forces of cooperation. Control is disclosed as an institution necessary to provide economic security and as a condition for the effective implementation of the socio-economic strategy. The current economic security of the country is assessed on the basis of study of current macroeconomic indicators for the Russian Federation. Threats and causes of low economic security are formulated. The measures to address them are proposed. 4. Discussion. The institutional approach is known as one of the modern successful methods to describe economic relations. The problem of increasing the economic security is not solved. Increasing the effectiveness of the control measures to ensure the economic security using the institutional approach is necessary. The paper describes the theoretical and methodological basis for the study of the institutional mechanism (system of institutions) of economic security in order to increase the efficiency of monitoring the implementation of the system of institutions. A study of the properties and the nature of the institutions as recognized, purposeful and repetitive activity of economic agents aimed at the implementation and monitoring of the strategy to improve economic security is carried out. 5.

However leadership, one of the important ingredients for teams, organizations, and taskperforming processes, has been lacking in studies of temporal dynamics. This article attempts to focus on the mechanism of shared leadership in an attempt to integrate temporal dynamics and leadership. The concept of shared leadership was coined about one hundred years ago, but it was not until the 1990s that researchers began to direct their attention to it. Empirical studies that explored the relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness, and investigated the effectiveness of shared leadership utilized a theoretical approach. However, little is known about how members in a group share leadership roles or functions in the task completion process. Researchers in the field of shared leadership have struggled theoretically and empirically to address the dearth of studies related to the process of shared leadership. The results of extant research have shown that there are both facilitators and barriers that influence the process of shared leadership, and moreover the process of shared leadership changes because of the facilitators and barriers. Previous research has revealed factors influencing the process, but the existing research has directed little attention to the transition from a situation where group members share leadership to a situation where one person predominately exercises leadership in a group. Thus, research is needed to understand the mechanism of transition and factors related to it. The purpose of the study is to explore the factors that influence transitions where the distribution of shared leadership decreases. In order to achieve this, I draw on past literature in group development and shared leadership, and illustrate transition with an example. Moreover, advancing the research, the present study offers some insightful theoretical and practical implications. Especially, in regard to the theoretical implications, this article responds to calls for research to explore the relationship between temporal dynamics and leadership. In addition, with regard to the practical implications, the present study offers factors, that under some situations, promote the aforementioned transition. Furthermore, the study suggests practical implication for managers in charge of goal attainment in a limited period, and suggests ideas for future research on issues still needing to be tackled.","",""

For the planning of healthcare resources and decision making in health policy, comprehensive tools to evaluate the future demand for health services and expenditure in the healthcare sector are needed. A simulation model taking into account the demographic development to evaluate the future need for hip replacement was already published, but lacks of accounting for the increasing prevalence of obesity. Research goal: Based on literature review it can be seen that there is a link between obesity and the need for hip arthroplasty. The aim of the presented model is to evaluate the additional burden for the healthcare system in the domain of hip replacement, which is caused by obesity. Methods: Based on data from literature and Austria's national statistics service a system dynamics model was created, taking into account the influence of obesity on the frequency of indications for hip arthroplasty, the need for revision of implants and the length of stay in hospital. Findings and results: The results indicate a 77% increase in the total costs until 2050 solely due to the demographic change. This growth might be doubled by the boosted need for hip replacement through obesity. Therefore comprehensive countermeasures and preventive a c t i o n s to reduce obesity are needed. Through simulation of different scenarios of the BMI distribution within Austria's population the presented model offers a comprehensive view on the influence of obesity on the healthcare expenditure in the domain of hip implants. Thus it provides a basis for future decisions in health policy making.","",""

The research on synergy is often aimed at identification and at times quantification. Professional golf events provide an opportunity to study individual, dyad, and team performance, particularly as they relate to synergy. Performance data from six Ryder Cup team competitions between the USA and Europe were analyzed. A baseline of individual performance skill was established for each player. The skill level for both dyads and teams was then established. At the dyad level, if performance was equal to or greater than the skill of the individuals, synergy was present. The overall performance outcome was then calculated to determine whether dyads with synergy outperformed the others. The results showed that the number of dyads with synergy made no significant difference between the two groups. However, at the team level, a T-Test of the skill of all members of each team was calculated and compared to team performance. The T-Test demonstrated that the USA had significantly more individual skill and consistency than did Europe yet Europe earned 94 points compared to the USA's 74 over the 10 years of competition.

We analyzed 280 surveys from the Nashville MSA where nonprofits reported on their strategic response to the economic crisis. Survey items were used to calculate human resource capacity, levels of resource dependency, firm performance, and a visibility index. Findings indicated that nonprofits that had fewer funding sources were more likely to have a lower level of strategic response. However, a website presence and visibility of a board of directors were significantly related to a nonprofit reporting that its resources stayed the same or increased. Experience in the market and firm size did not appear to be significant predictors of the strategic response level. Implications of the findings for how nonprofits can position themselves with the best strategic responses during an economic crisis and recommendations for future research are discussed.","",""

Firms in the retail industry are categorized according to their high/low relative net operating income to sales and asset turnover ratios. Firms with high relative net operating income to sales and low relative asset turnover are assumed to be pursuing a differentiation strategy and those with high relative asset turnover and low relative net operating income to sales are assumed to be pursuing a cost leadership strategy. Return on net operating assets is utilized as a performance variable. Prior research suggests that a firm could, in theory, perform well following either strategy.

Macro factors, such as declines in corporate and leisure spending on travel, and industry-specific issues, such as poor fleet management, depressed prices in the used car market, and restricted new car allocations from auto manufacturers, have dealt car rental companies crippling blows. However, survival depends on the fittest---or in this case, the leanest. Like a phoenix emerging from the ashes, car rental companies reported record revenues in 2011. This paper will analyze from a financial perspective the leaner business model developed by the leasing and rental industry. Financial ratios for efficiency, profitability, solvency, and growth will be compared before and after implementation of the leaner business paradigm. Inferences drawn from this analytical review of the industry will focus on cost efficiencies, optimal fleet management, sustainable construction, political costs, and measuring the costs/benefits of going green. Actual data from a small car rental company will provide insights into the specific changes necessary to transition to a leaner operating model and a long-term sustainable business plan.","",""

However, it is important to know what conditions moderate this relationship. Using a sample of 166 Canadian companies (in a post-NAFTA environment), we find evidence to suggest that the risk propensity of the firm's top management team (TMT) plays a critical role in translating market orientation to improved performance. The moderating effect of the TMT's risk propensity varies across various environmental conditions such as market turbulence, competitive intensity, and technological turbulence. The implications of these findings are discussed.","",""

This paper is an extension of the authors' research over the past ten years concerning the content of United States mission statements compared with those of other countries around the world. Mission statement content was analyzed from two points of view. First, the stakeholders who the firm chose to include in the mission were studied. Second, the identified goals and objectives of the firm were analyzed. The first portion of this paper reviews the changes in United States mission statements over the last ten years. Significant trends are apparent in both identified stakeholders and goals and objectives, since mission statements must be constantly revised and improved over time as the firm and its environment change. The results of the 2011 mission statement review are compared with earlier studies by the authors in 2001, 2008 and 2010. This paper extends the authors' research by including mission statements from four non-English speaking countries. The largest twenty-five companies (as ranked by Forbes) in France, Germany, Japan, and China were compared to the largest firms in the United States. These 125 mission statements are included in the appendix of this paper. A comparison of these five countries' mission statements provided some interesting similarities and differences by country involving both the stakeholders and goals or objectives identified in the statements.

Organizational members might neither recognize the impact they have on others nor how to build their toolkit of inter-cultural competence. If the organizational goal of embedding an inclusive environment is at odds with the values, behaviors, and attitudes of its employees, then inclusion will not be fully achieved and organizational performance will be impacted. While it is imperative to understand diverse attitudes, the next step in organizational diversity competence is identification of skills gaps and remediation. To accomplish these organizational outcomes we propose the further development and validation of an instrument, the Inclusion Skills Measurement Profile (ISM) The instrument will provide organizations with the information necessary to move diversity to the next level. The instrument will identify diversity skills gaps, thus enabling individual, teams and organizations to enhance their competence in this area. The instrument will provide feedback in seven areas: diversity sensitivity, integrity with difference, interacting with difference, valuing difference, team inclusion, managing conflict over difference, and embedding inclusion. The seven categories are based on experience of experts, and grounded firmly in relevant theory.

I postulate that relative value of the resources held by the firms involved an alliance predicts the level of payments promised by funding firms (firms which provide money to develop prospective products) to the early stage technology ventures (young firms which uncover the new technology to be developed into a commercializable product). On the one hand, innovative ideas are potentially valuable resources for an early stage technology venture. Thus, a more valuable innovative idea should generate larger promised remuneration for early stage technology firms upon signing an alliance agreement. However, established firms hold valuable resources of its own and one would expect established firms to leverage those resouces in such a way as to minimize the amount of money it is willing to payout as part of the alliance contract. I examine the effects these two countervailing forces have on money promised to the early stage technology venture by the funding firm. Specifically, I believe the funding firm's various complementary resources negatively moderate the relationship between the value of the early stage venture's innovative idea and the remuneration promised the early stage venture in a collaborative agreement. I use a sample of biotech firms forming alliances with established pharmaceutical companies to test our hypotheses, and I find, as predicted, the value of the new venture's innovative ideas tends to increase the amount of money in the alliance contract. I also find support for my contention that the strength of the funding firm's complementary resources negatively moderates this relationship such that less money is offered the early stage venture when the funding firm holds more valuable complementary resources.","Alliance formation; Alliances; Funding innovation; Innovation",""

The results show that the CPS is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors and negatively linked to director stock ownership. We also examine if CPS increases company valuation by investors, as predicted by the tournament theory. Our results upheld this view, showing that there is a positive link between CPS and company market value as predicted by the tournament theory. Although the effect is significant at a threshold of 95%, CPS only explains a small percentage of the variance in company market value.","",""

Unfortunately, there are still few studies which highlight the impact of MCS on strategy based on interactive approach and process approach (Henri, 2006; Kober et al., 2007). Kober et al. (2007) found that MCS will shape company's strategy. Roberts (1990) also said that the use of interactive MCS (interactive control system) will facilitate the strategy formation process. Kober et al. (2007) and Roberts (1990) used case study qualitative method. Case study enables more detailed analyses of strategy formation process, in addition many authors encourage the use of case study (Dent, 1990). Generalization of this qualitative result, however, is still limited because of many specific organizational characteristic. Interactive control system and strategy will influence internal and external learning process. This study shows that control system not only help strategy formation but also improve the learning process in an organization, yet the knowledge of how strategy influence learning process is still limited (Mulcaster, 2009). This study aims to investigate the relationship between the use of MCS and strategy formation process which results in intended and emergent strategy. These two strategies are useful to improve learning. This study uses structural equation modeling as multivariate analysis. Samples used in this study are the upper and middle manager in manufacturing industries in Indonesia. The author uses AMOS 16 as the aid tool to overcome structural equation modelling (SEM) problem. The findings for this study are: interactive control system positively affects the intended and emergent strategy, interactive control system positively affects the internal and external learning; intended strategy and emergent strategy formed by interactive control system will positively affect internal and external learning.

During 2008, prominent financial firms like Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were forced to sell, while Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. In addition, other venerable firms like Citigroup and AIG found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy. Later in 2009, firms such as Toyota and BP found themselves in serious public relations and structural problems. The problems that engulfed these corporations were different from Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, WorldCom, and HealthSouth Corporation of early 2000s but the results were almost identical. Mainly, these organizations passed through severe crises from which some survived and others did not. The common denominator in all these crises was widespread perception by the stakeholders of deep mistrust in senior managers of these organizations. Mission and Vision statements provide identity and roadmap of future for a corporation. This paper analyzes whether Mission Statements (which include the Vision, Values, Principles, and Credo of a corporation) should be redrafted such that during times of crisis, it can be used as roadmap for successfully navigating the troubled waters faced by senior managers. This paper will analyze the problems faced by organizations due to lack of truthful communication with their stakeholders (mainly shareholders, media, and consumers), and provide some guidelines to redraft Mission Statements so that it becomes a guidance document during times of severe crisis.","",""

This analysis indicates pricing strategies vary by the experience of the seller, and that new market entrants were more likely to use the Internet not only as a sales channel but also as an information resource guiding pricing. Those practices more common among least experienced sellers were positively related to sales, suggesting there could be liabilities to experience for storefront book retailers who launch on-line businesses. The dominant logic, shared among experienced booksellers, limited the ability of more experienced firms to recognize, evaluate, and respond to fundamental changes in their competitive environment.","",""

Data collected from a sample of 122 full-time working employees across various U.S. based organizations is assessed. A multiple regression analysis is used to determine the direct impact of leader-member exchange dimensions on extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction, and a hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the moderating influence of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values. It is found that while LMX has a direct positive relationship with both facets of job satisfaction, LMX has a greater statistically significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction. The moderating analysis reveals that self-transcendence values significantly moderates the relationship between extrinsic work job satisfaction and LMX dimensions. These findings encourage managers to continue to develop the attributes of LMX, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction. The results also note the importance for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization.","Job satisfaction; Leader-member exchange; Work values",""

There are very few works done in this field of study using the risk-return approach despite the popularity of this dichotomy in the business world. This paper, therefore, applies various mean-risk models to the output decision making of a competitive firm facing uncertainty in the product price. The risk formulation used in this paper involves a pre-specified target level of profit, similar to those discussed in Fishburn (1977and 1984). Furthermore, the measure of risk-aversion used in this model indicates the relative weight given by the agent to the risk component of the mean-risk objective function. The results of various mean-risk models are compared to those in the corresponding expected utility literature, and significant differences are found in many cases. One important difference is that whenever expected utility results require decreasing absolute risk aversion as a sufficient condition, the corresponding sufficient condition in the risk-return model of this paper is given by the condition that marginal cost is at least as large as the sum of average cost and average target level of profit. The results of this paper, in our opinion, are intuitively more appealing compared to the relatively abstract concept of decreasing absolute risk aversion.","",""

Botswana (Debswana) has market share as a producer of diamond rough within the De Beers cartel. The challenges which Botswana faces to enhance its national competitiveness are explored, notably changes in cartel rules and domestic demands for development. Approach: A ""Double Diamond"" framework is developed to explore Botswana's competitiveness. This framework, unlike Porter's domestic single ""Diamond"", embraces both the impact of international and domestic determinants on national competitiveness. These determinants include factor, demand, firm strategy and rivalry, and supporting industries. Chance and government policy, as exogenous variables, are included. Findings: Debswana and the Botswana government have initiated changes in the country's national competitiveness strategy. These changes involve a shift from a volume producer of diamond rough to a ""straddler"" strategy. Through vertical integration, Botswana is in the process of moving up the value addition chain. Debswana will likely increase profitability by adding aggregation, cutting and polishing industries to its current production. Practical Implications: In the shorter term, vertical integration will assist Botswana in its pursuit of national development goals (human development, infrastructure construction, fight against HIV/AIDS, poverty alleviation). In the longer term, Botswana realizes its vulnerability based upon a diamond dependent economy. Economic diversification is essential for long term stability and growth. The dominant economy of neighboring South Africa has impeded Botswana's diversification efforts in manufacturing and financial services. Large coal reserves may offer Botswana diversification opportunities to export commodities and energy.","Botswana; De Beers cartel; Debswana; Diamond industry; National competitiveness",""

"Effect of job level on the performance of human capital attainment: An exploratory analysis","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78149383037&partnerID=40&md5=e7378174f9e7df6f1ce6ff3bc051ca33","Human capital is a significant factor in enhancing individuals' career success. Career performance disparities are primarily due to the differences in their human capitals. Thus, earnings variations between job levels are partly due to the differences in investments in human capital. However, the differential effect of human capital is disproportionate at different job levels. Overall, individuals at higher job levels enjoy greater rate of return on their human capital. Therefore, income disparities due to job levels may also be the result of differences in performance efficiency. Accordingly, this paper examines the deviation in performance efficiency attributable to job-level that go beyond basic human capital. Logistic regression analysis shows that there is a significant predictive power of job-level on the performance efficiency after controlling for gender, age, and education. Specifically, results indicate that individuals at executive level have higher likelihood to succeed than others. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the likelihood of an executive level individual to perform efficiently is twice as much as others. Findings from this study have important implications not only on the human capital investment, but also for business organizations' executive selection process.","",""
"Navigating corporate social responsibility components and strategic options: The IHR perspective","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880030328&partnerID=40&md5=b21b4d5bb1ee913dc2f033c0f079fb09","This study builds linkages between cross-cultural ethical issues and corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies from a context-focused approach, with special attention to hightech MNCs that have outsourced or expanded their business activities from advanced societies to emerging economies. The study deepens the existing conceptualizations of the CSR construct and demonstrates how rankings of the CSR components are not necessarily fixed but rather vary due to different cultural values, national wealth, institutional conditions, organizational factors, and public sensitivity toward economic, social and environmental concerns. The study draws attention to the decline of corporate altruism in economic hard times and highlights some main obstacles, such as costs, difficulty to track CSR investment or practices to actual returns, segregation between the generic CSR concept and firm-industry specific competitive contexts, lack of support from top management, and lack of strategic guidance regarding where and how to focus on a large scope of CSR issues. Findings suggest that the extent firms are willing to compromise short-term profit maximization for the larger good of society is likely to vary across borders and among firms of different nationalities. Cultural values and institutional conditions emerge to shape the managerial CSR values and priorities, thereby jointly influencing their strategic CSR decision-making. Cultural values, national wealth, organizational factors and the firm-industry specific legal, regulatory context also influence a firm's predisposition toward relatively short-term vis-à-vis long-term returns to its shareholders and managerial inclinations about their personal moral obligations to larger society. Based on existing literature, empirical findings and firm-industry specific cases, this study offers a cross-cultural framework of CSR strategic options that firms can assess, compose, and implement in the context of international human resource management (IHR). Since many of the CSR issues have a direct link to the human side of business, this study demonstrates that strategic IHR has a key role to play in helping the firm identify, prioritize, and achieve CSR goals, thereby improving the firm-industry specific social and environmental conditions domestically and across borders. This study highlights a knowledge gap between the HR professionals from advanced societies and their counterparts in emerging economies regarding how CSR is integrally related to sustainability,benefits to the larger society, and competitive advantage of the firm, which opens the door for a special role of MNCs' IHR functions in formulation, communication, training, integrating, monitoring, enforcement, and continuous improvement of an organization's CSR vision, moral standards and strategic commitment. IHR will thereby become well positioned as a potential unifier to coordinate these CSR efforts internally and externally. Suggestions for future research are discussed and practical implications of the CSR construct and strategic options are provided.","Corporate social responsibility components; Culture; Emerging economies; High-tech MNCs; International human resource management; Regulatory environment; Strategic options",""

We find this impact to be curvilinear with a diminishing marginal benefit to higher levels of R & D intensity. In addition, controlling for industry differences greatly improves the fit of this relationship. There are several different characteristics (firm size, growth rates, manufacturing versus non-manufacturing) that have a significant impact on the relationship between R & D intensity and Tobin's q. Lastly, the relationship between the level of R & D intensity and Tobin's q is much different than the relationship between the change in R & D intensity and Tobin's q. Changes in R & D intensity exhibit a negative relationship with changes in Tobin's q. Alternatively changes in R & D intensity towards the industry average are associated with positive changes in Tobin's q.","",""

Previous studies have reviewed mission statements from the largest corporations in countries including Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, China, Brazil, and India. This study considers United States' businesses only. The intent of the authors is to determine if the size of the company affects the content of the mission statement. The authors have conducted research on mission statements in 2001, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012 that has been published in various Allied Academies' journals. The majority of the articles have appeared in the Academy of Strategic Management Journal (ASMJ). The mission statement comparisons have emphasized two distinct areas, namely, the stakeholders mentioned in the mission statements and the named goals and objectives of the company. The stakeholders and goals/objectives emphasis is continued in this paper. The authors again used the Fortune 500 list to determine the largest firms in the United States. In this study, the largest 100 firms are compared with the last 100 companies in the Fortune 500 list (numbers 401-500). The authors hope to determine if size does affect the stakeholders and goals/objectives mentioned in the firm's mission statement. Stakeholders identified included communities, customers, employees, stockholders/stakeholders, and suppliers/partners. Identified goals and objectives included affordability of products or services, following core values, striving for diversity, maintaining efficient operations, concern for the environment, maintaining ethical operations, striving for global operations, maintaining innovation, maintaining a leadership position, an emphasis on profitability/profits, desire to produce a quality product or service that provided value to customers, producing a safe product, an emphasis on teamwork, and the desire to gain the trust of stakeholders.

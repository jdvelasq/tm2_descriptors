The important advantage SEM over regression is because SEM allows the researchers to incorporate measurement error. Such advantages of SEM are even more important for interaction terms. SEM offers also confirmatory factor analysis capabilities which can improve our models and understanding (Lebreton et al., 2009). Further it is also a recommended technique in for testing fit of causal models to the data (James et al., 2006). While researchers have acknowledged the advantages of SEM over regression, SEM procedures for interaction effects had been rather complex and inaccessible to most researchers. The goal of the current manuscript is to provide a single one step approach to combine moderation and mediation analysis and extend it into a SEM framework. We do so using the simple and accessible syntax using the Mplus software package (Muthén &Muthén, 1998-2010).",,Factor analysis; Causal model; Confirmatory factor analysis; Interaction effect; Interaction term; Mediation analysis; Statistical techniques; Structural equation modeling; Aluminum alloys

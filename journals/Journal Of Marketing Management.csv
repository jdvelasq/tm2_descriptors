A methodological innovation is presented in which rough set theory is employed to analyse single and combined effects of brand post characteristics on consumer engagement on the Sina Weibo platform. Diverse characteristic combinations are shown to affect consumer engagement at varying intensities. The method is complementary in confirming single and combined effects of post characteristics. The research strengthens the understanding of consumer engagement based on characteristic combination perspective and helps to provide more effective reference to formulate social media marketing strategies owing to being closer to the real-world situation faced by brands. © 2024 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand post; characteristic combination; consumer engagement; industry difference; relationship mode; Social media",""

In parallel, the government are encouraging companies to reduce the calorie content of food and banning promotions encouraging overconsumption. Public policy intervention ladder models are used with upstream social marketing to consider how these government actions might affect companies and consumers’ freedom of choice. A census of the calories of lunch meal deal items in five stores was conducted to determine the degree to which they met the 600 kcal recommendation. 23% of lunch meal deals exceeded the 600 kcal guideline, and on average contained 10% more calories. Actions to reduce calorie content and their impact on stakeholders’ freedom are considered. © 2023 The Author(s).

We examine whether consumers are also more likely to help when they perceive that the brand is a member, and therefore a co-owner, of the brand community. We find that perceptions of brand membership in the community increase the likelihood to help after a transgression via perceptions of the brand as a co-owner of the community and brand forgiveness. This suggests that brands perceived as members and co-owners of their communities benefit from protections derived from both ingroup favouritism and expectations of group reciprocity. These relationships are strengthened when the brand is perceived as an active community member through the visibility, but not necessarily the quality, of its interactions with the community. © 2023 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand communities; brand transgressions; helping behaviour; Psychological ownership; stewardship",""

When these genuine intentions are found to be false, or disconfirmed, firms will be worse off than if they had not signalled ‘genuine’ intent to begin with. Our results suggest that the expected CSR payoffs moderate the moderation of the indirect effect of CSR fraud perceptions on the purchase intention through ethical CSR beliefs by the CSR activity types, especially when the CSR actions are dominated by social activities with low expected firm benefits. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","corporate hypocrisy; CSR; ethics; fraud; inauthenticity; mediation",""

However, it is during crises that employee trust can be most threatened. Our study draws on social identity theory to understand the conditions under which trust is destroyed and possibly repaired after a corporate brand crisis. The results from two experimental studies suggest that corporate brand crises decrease employee trust due to the threat to their social image. However, appropriate mitigation strategies that restore employees’ social status can effectively repair their trust. This decline and repair dynamic is amplified among highly identified employees, suggesting that organisational identification has a bounce-back effect on this mechanism. © 2023 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Corporate brand crisis; corporate reputation; crisis mitigation strategies; organisational identification; organisational trust",""

We analyse distinct and interwoven chronos and kairos temporal strands experienced through the course of the vestaval ritual embedded within a brand community, in a plaiting process that ensures that contrasting temporalities co-exist, leaving the participant unmoored in time and resonant with deep personal significance of the moment.

Ernest Hemingway suggested that the primary virtue of a writer’s education ought to be the refinement of the students’ ability to detect crap.

The results show that SMIs find themselves in different roles depending on which stakeholders’ expectations they fulfil.

Consumers’ political orientations moderate the mediating effect of companies’ moral hypocrisy as, following exposure by an NGO, conservatives perceive the company issuing an apology to be more deceptive, which is not the case for liberals. Thus, this study expands upon the developing research stream related to the efficacy of apologies as strategic responses to preventable crises.

A quasi-experiment study was conducted through an online survey simulating the cancellation journey. Results show that cancel culture is triggered by ideological incompatibilities such as religion, racism, animal rights, LGBTQIA+ and environmental issues. After the scenario that simulated an ideological incompatibility related to racism, 178 respondents rated high levels of brand hate, negative WOM, brand avoidance, brand boycott, brand retaliation, and intention to cancel the brand. However, an ‘apology’ by the brand leads to brand forgiveness, a decrease in the intention to cancel the brand and an increase in purchase intention. © 2023 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","apology; Brand forgiveness; brand hate; cancel culture; ideological incompatibilities",""

This study explores the impact of negative publicity (i.e. publicly reported scandals) about charitable organisations on the contributions of regular donors and analyses the moderating role of email marketing communications as a key factor in counteracting the impact of negative publicity on donations. The results of analysing a sample of regular donors during the period 2013–2020 reveal that negative publicity about charities reduces the amount donated, and that this effect is stronger on the contributions of more frequent donors, who are potentially more sensitive to this publicity. This impact is softened by email marketing communications. The implications for the field of marketing management in charities are discussed. © 2023 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","donation frequency; email marketing communications; longitudinal data; Negative publicity; regular donors",""

Such exchanges can be framed in different ways: e.g. stuff sent for the purpose of earning media, or as compensation for a marketing service. Drawing on the notion of framing in Callonian economic sociology, the paper identifies three ‘framing practices’: (1) framing the sending of stuff to influencers in individual exchanges, (2) reframing exchanges to put them in new light, or (3) preframing how exchanges ought to be performed. In efforts to frame exchanges of stuff, their broader context, and how stuff should be taxed, influencers, marketing professionals and the Swedish Tax Agency contribute to shaping the market for influencer marketing. © 2023 The Author(s).

Using a strategy of inquiry regarding in-depth multiple case studies from different players of the toy industry, this paper highlights how to set marketing strategies that develop and communicate new offerings by promoting both Marketing and Social Value and fostering the social inclusion of children with a disability. The proposed model contributes to the emerging literature of Inclusive Marketing and will help marketers implement a socially inclusive approach. © 2024 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","case study; children; disability; Inclusive marketing; toys; value creation",""

Past research has extended our understanding of the challenges, objectives and motivations of sponsors however, less is known with respect to whether sponsor communication perpetuates a gender-based narrative. In addressing this research gap, this study examines women’s sport sponsor communication to understand how gender stereotyping manifests in messaging around sponsorship objectives and women’s sport/athletes. Findings show that sponsor communication of objectives mirrors the traditional social roles held by women (centred on a communal orientation), while agentic gender traits associated with masculinity emerge in communication around women’s sport/athletes. Our study highlights the importance of message framing in sponsor communication and the need for simultaneously embracing and valuing both feminine and masculine traits. This is an important step towards creating a balanced narrative around women athletes and women’s sport. © 2023 The Author(s).

Consequently, many advertisers are now weaving people with disabilities into brand narratives. These narratives often evoke feelings of pity or portray people with disabilities as inspiring, solely or in part on the basis of their disability. Meanwhile, social media has emerged as a vessel for social change. Through the netnographic study of twelve influencers with visible impairments, complex personhood is proposed as a social ontology by which disabled lives are acknowledged in less confined terms. Our findings illustrate how social media influencers with disabilities may draw on narratives based on empowerment, playfulness, resistance, and responsibility to present themselves as neither victims nor superhuman agents but as complex human beings. We thus bring forward a complex model in market-mediated representations of disability, beyond the misrepresentational narratives based on pity and ‘inspiration porn’. © 2022 The Author(s).

Grouping these barriers into three higher-order themes (crowd-, process- and context-related) creates a novel perspective that encompasses the empowerment-related concerns of heterogeneous crowds better than previous research.

However, the negative impact is reversed to a positive one when product attribute description is employed for utilitarian products but not for hedonic products. These results reveal that the effectiveness of product attribute description depends on the nature of the product and the campaign objectives.

We address this question by conducting a mixed-methods study in a professional sports social partnership context in Australia. First, a survey with 4,193 sport team fans–a key target audience for NPOs was conducted to understand the impact of contextual factors (i.e. NPO reputation and perceived fit) on the consumer behaviour process, including donation, volunteer, and advocacy intentions for NPOs involved in a social partnership. Following the confirmation of favourable NPO outcomes, interviews with 11 NPO managers were conducted to explore the business practice inputs of their social partnerships. Interviews showed social partnerships were characterised by a power imbalance in favour of the sports organisation leading to a lack of co-creation of value. Further, despite an expressed intention to formalise the partnerships, formality waned as the partnership moved through the different partnership stages. Results across the two studies demonstrate the need for a more deliberate and strategic approach to social partnerships.

However, less scholarly attention has been given to the broader ontological implications of Belk’s later arguments that his original distinction between a core and extended self should be abandoned. In this comment, I first highlight how Belk’s original formulation marked a contested transition from a dualistic view of consumers as possessing a core self that remains distinct from the socio-material world to a dialectical understanding of consumer selves as emerging from a centre-to-periphery network of relations. His ensuing update implicitly denotes another ontological shift towards an even more de-centred view of the ‘extended self’. However, Belk’s reformulation of the extended self in the digital age lacked a culturally established, alternative praxeomorphic model needed to fully disentangle the extended self from the ‘heavy’ ontology of the core self. Contemporary socio-technical innovations are beginning to offer a praxeomorphic means to ontologically re-vision consumers as distributed networks whose life narratives function as ledgers of their assembled experiences. As an emerging praxeomorphic future shaped by the mass diffusion of AI technologies is rapidly taking shape, I suggest that ‘consumer research’, as we currently understand it, may soon be radically transformed. © 2024 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","actor network theory; consumer culture theory (CCT); Extended self; heavy and light capitalism; ontology",""

Seven in-depth interviews with ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), who represent the world’s economic elite, and ten in-depth interviews with managers of top luxury brands reveal important features of the elite luxury experience. Not only do UHNWIs seek extraordinary, exclusive, and bespoke luxury experiences, but they are also driven by status affirmation, feelings of entitlement, and the need for distinction. They also experience a privacy paradox, with a preference for ‘selective publicity’. Our findings demonstrate UHNWIs’ strong disengagement from others–even other UHNWIs–facilitatedby elite luxury experiences. This study is the first to shed light on the idiosyncrasies of the elite luxury experience by combining data from UHNWIs and managers who facilitate luxury experiences. The study offers implications for managing luxury experiences directed at UHNWIs. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Bourdieu; elite; Luxury experience; privacy; social capital; ultra-high-net-worth individuals",""

To illustrate how collage can support a critically engaged academic practice, we present an on-going collaboration between the authors that explores consumer culture in a conflict setting. We show that when taken on as a comprehensive, reflexive approach to consumer research, collage-making facilitates an exploration of research contexts in a more affective, interactive, contextualised, and embodied manner.

Using consumers’ pupil size as a biological indicator of their cognitive process during decision-making, we empirically examine how varied assortment levels affect consumers’ product preferences through their cognitive responses. Our results show that a larger assortment size prompts consumers’ pupils to constrict, indicating a lower level of cognitive workload. Consumers’ pupil size moves in the same direction with the price levels of the chosen option and the opposite direction with the familiarity of the chosen option. The mediation test demonstrates that the relationship between the assortment levels and product preference is statistically mediated by consumers’ pupillary response during decision-making. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","assortment; cognitive process; product preference; product presentation; Pupillary response",""

The ART industry was able to expand with impunity for decades by downplaying and silencing patient-consumers’ damaged corporealities and trauma. Moreover, stigma and suffering associated with failed procedures stopped most former patient-consumers from organising for greater consumer protections and industry reforms.

Three experiments involving 815 participants were run to assess reference group and message framing types as moderators of advertising appeal influence. Results indicate a significant interactive effect between reference group and advertising appeal on sustainable food consumption practices. For descriptive appeals, membership groups were the most effective for promoting sustainable food consumption; for injunctive and benefit appeals, aspirational groups were the most effective. Interaction between advertising appeal and message framing also exerted a significant effect on sustainable food consumption behaviours, with descriptive and benefit appeals the most effective when used with positive message framing, and injunctive appeals the most effective when used with negative message framing. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Advertising appeal; message framing; reference group; surplus food; sustainable consumption behaviours",""

We also advocate a multiple perspectives approach, whereby there are no absolutes but rather contexts, thus nudging students to move beyond a micro-managerial mindset, and problematising many of the assumptions embedded in marketing.

In addition to the condition of purchase goal, consumers’ confidence in their judgement of the brand’s position acts as an additional contingency factor in the relationship between differentiation and purchase.

Neo-animist theory suggests new perspectives towards a more sustainable eco-economy of persons. Neo-animism foregrounds an alternative subjectivity to that inscribed in the modern social imaginary. Neo-animism is defined by the relationality of persons, the contingent extension of the principle of sociality to other living beings, and the recognition that all living beings are in communicative relations with significant others. Further, in a neo-animism framework resources circulate through transitive value co-creation processes, gifting, reciprocal exchange, and predation. Neo-animism provides an alternative to the dominant social exchange paradigm in marketing and addresses the challenges to sustainability identified in marketing and consumer research. © 2021 The Author(s).

Weak governance somewhat offsets these effects. Moreover, we find that the impact of EBC on brand equity is partially mediated through the firmʻs strategic emphasis.

However, the deficit-framing of people experiencing vulnerability is problematic. We propose that the alternate strengths-based approach will improve social marketing success and illustrate this with data from a project aimed at widening participation in tertiary education. Using data from interviews and co-design workshops with 87 school students and recent school leavers, we offer a new evidence-based definition of customer/consumer vulnerability that is strengths-based. We also present a five-step, evidence-based process for how social marketers can use a strengths-based approach (SA) to elicit deep insights (I) from the tacit knowledge of customers/consumers experiencing vulnerability (V). We term this process SAIV and demonstrate the value of tacit knowledge in intervention innovation and how a strengths-based approach can draw out tacit knowledge. We encourage social marketers to adopt a strengths-based approach, definition of vulnerability and process to enhance intervention efficacy. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","co-design; critical social marketing; education; social marketing; Vulnerability",""

These are the metaphors of: the container, the omnipresent danger, and battle and journey. Our discussion unravels the processes of the de/re-stabilisation of the (risky) body-in-transition, as well as the reconfiguration of individuals’ rights and duties in the market for prevention to become a good genetic citizen. Moving beyond a discussion of ‘consumer sovereignty’, we contribute to developing a contextually nuanced understanding of the complex relations between the lived experiences of ‘losing control’ and the consumption of prevention. © 2021 The Author(s).

Through situating the audience, Slam poetry offers a resonant method to harness critical reflexivity away from the traditional conventions of academic expression. Extending extant research on the role of poetry, the paper argues that the efficacy of Slam poetry through meaningful, accessible dialogue rooted in the vernacular becomes an important dialogical encounter for individuals to understand other subject positions.

Facilitating this emergence is particularly crucial for businesses operating in countries or regions in which large segments of the consumer population live at the bottom of the pyramid (BoP). But how can a brand community be generated in a BoP context? And how can organisations mobilise people living at the BoP to participate in creating and maintaining a brand community? To respond to these questions, we study the case of a Cameroonian music platform created in 2015 that was quickly able to mobilise Cameroonian music fans to spread its reputation by word of mouth and to produce content. Our case study shows that to create a brand community, startups should follow three precise steps. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand community; Cameroon; music; online communities; volunteering",""

Older individuals seek to distance themselves from stereotypical social images of old age, placing themselves in a liminal state of being ‘not too old but no longer young’.

Regulative forces have emerged requiring gender training while normative expectations regarding toxic masculinity (for instance, mansplaining and manspreading) have shifted.

However, the best ways to measure consumers’ perceptions of the quality of traceability information remains uninvestigated. This paper explores the perceived quality of traceability information through the available literature on perceived information quality, principal-agency theory, and cue utilisation theory. Specifically, we examine how traceability information influences purchase intentions of organic foods. We conducted an online survey and collected 361 valid samples from organic milk consumers in China. Our structural equation modelling analysis led to the following key findings: first, the perceived quality of traceability information positively influences purchase intention towards organic food; second, perceived uncertainty partially mediates the main effect; and, finally, the importance of product information positively moderates the relationship between perceived uncertainty and purchase intention. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Internet of things; organic food; perceived quality of traceability information; perceived uncertainty; purchase intentions",""

Building on an overarching framework that integrates both the power distance belief (PDB) literature and the social attitude functions theory, this research proposes that low- (vs. high-) PDB consumers tend to hold a value-expressive (vs. social-adjustive) attitude towards luxury consumption, which in turn leads them to prefer inconspicuous over conspicuous luxury brands. Both a field survey in China and an experiment in the United States showed convergent support for the hypotheses.

It first recalls how storytelling is considered an important instrument for cultural brand strategy management. The main theoretical grounds for the effectiveness of brand storytelling (narrative transportation and archetypal psychology) are then presented. Since archetypes are considered central in brand narrative strategy, this research is based mainly on Woodside’s archetype-brand-consumer model. For a functional product (mineral water) and a symbolic product (perfume), the authors designed four storytelling scenarios for a fictitious brand ABC, taking four main archetypal categories as defined in the relevant literature. In two online experiments, consumers were randomly shown one of the four brand stories or one traditional promotional scenario. The scenarios were presented in the form of a series of commented drawings. After viewing the brand stories, the participants were asked to estimate some consumer value measurements. The experiment demonstrates that–for both functional and symbolic products–the use of archetypes can produce positive impacts on brand value, mainly on quality and emotional dimensions. Different archetypes elicit specific feelings towards brands and the narrative persuasion system seems to operate differently according to product type. © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","archetypes; Brand storytelling; consumer brand perceptions; consumer value; experimental study; narrative transportation",""

This resulting typology serves as an important analytical tool for understanding the variety of ways in which companies engage in the second-hand economy.

Results showed that perceived trustworthiness in the CDC positively affected, while perceived trustworthiness in the then President, Donald Trump, negatively affected, attitudes towards social distancing. Information overload had a negative effect. Health beliefs positively affect attitudes towards social distancing.

A lack of senior women hinders advertising’s ability to reflect diversity in society, leading some to question whether the industry is now fit for purpose. Why do so few women reach creative leadership? Previous literature found women engage in lower levels of impression management (IM). However, our findings suggest that female creatives are actively employing IM behaviours. Drawing on twenty-five interviews with female creative directors, we find women are ‘faking’ behaviours to both fit in and stand out within the strongly gendered environment of advertising. Yet, these coping strategies can cause internal conflict, driving some women to leave, or become disillusioned. We provide managerial implications to suggest how advertising agencies, clients and female creatives can work together to facilitate the retention and progression of more women within creative departments, and increase their influence over the ads that get made. © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Advertising industry; Impression management; women",""

The media construction of French Muslim identity and its resulting Islamophobia have created an ‘imaginary Islam’ steeped in negativism and racialised stigma, according to some scholars, to which our surveyed influencers respond, manipulating Orientalist tropes to foster ambiguities about religion, sexuality, and race. In drawing attention to dynamic, consumption-based intersections of modest fashion marketing, ‘erasure,’ and processes of meaning-making, we argue that hijabi French Muslim fashion bloggers are increasingly positioning themselves as ‘cyberarbiters’ of social transformation and shifting attitudes about the intersections of Islam, the body, and female sexuality. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","digital Islam; Islam and sexuality; Islamic markets; modest fashion; Technocultural discourse analysis",""

The results demonstrate a U-shaped relationship between trust and opportunism; however, monitoring moderates the relationship such that at high levels of trust, opportunism is practically non-existent.

In contrast with the general belief that key influencers always generate positive buzz, the findings show that they can adversely affect future review valence. Specifically, reviewers with many connections on Yelp can reduce the positivity of reviews of the same business in the next period.

While the extant research focused on consumer motivation and intention to shop via live streaming, little is known from the seller’s perspective. Indeed, the potential advantages of live streaming commerce are accessible to everyone, but sellers experience different levels of success with this medium. Using a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach, this study analyses Facebook data of live streaming sellers to assess the nature and extent of engagement metrics, and delineate the dynamic, interactive live streaming sales process. We identify four sales approaches and twelve strategies adopted in acquiring and retaining customers.

In consequence, this research examines the features of a brand heritage experience through extended case studies in two brand museums with narratives of 47 visitors. By unpacking a brand heritage experience, the study highlights its acceptance by a majority of visitors as a real heritage experience since they give scientific, authentic and aesthetic values to the industrial and commercial features of the brand.

The results indicate that a parasocial relationship with the influencer builds the perceived credibility of the influencer, while comments by other audience members moderate the effect. Influencer credibility positively affects brand trust and purchase intention. The findings enhance the understanding of the role of an active audience in influencer marketing. © 2020, © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand trust; credibility; Influencer marketing; parasocial relationship; social media influencers",""

To address this challenge, scholars and managers call for the use of gamification. However, despite gamification’s growing use in online communities, insight into its effect on member experience and behaviours remain limited. We hypothesise that gamification affects member-perceived distributive and procedural justice. In experimental studies, we assess the impact of in-gamification perceived justice on member contributions. We find that while high in-gamification perceived procedural justice acts as a necessary prerequisite for member contributions, high distributive justice can reduce game-related uncertainty, thereby rendering gamified practices less fun, particularly for low-engaged community members that tend to value rewards. We add to the literature by (a) pinpointing the core role of perceived justice in the persistence of online communities, and (b) unveiling that high distributive justice can lead gamification to backfire in online communities by affecting member experience and contributions. © 2020, © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer engagement; experience; Gamification; justice; online community",""

Through two studies, we investigate how owned social media content is associated with commercial performance and moderated by community size. We find that commercial performance is positively associated with posts showcasing the superior value of a product or brand and with posts that have an intention to sell. In addition, in large online communities, posts intended to create social interactions among marketers and users are not associated with commercial performance. However, in mid-sized communities, posts with the same intentions increase commercial performance. We theorise that the presence of internet trolls and a lower sense of group loyalty may explain the absence of these associations in large online communities. Finally, we identify four dimensions of content that were fairly consistent across studies.

The Ouroboros strategy is a nuanced strategy where the pattern of internationalisation is circular, the objectives include market expansion and cultural goals, the target markets are both foreign and domestic consumers, and where internationalisation occurs in the growth and mature stages of bands’ life cycles. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","arts and heritage marketing; cultural products; Internationalisation; Japan; market entry",""

We describe three modes of ‘secretive’ relations: between the brand and customers who know the brand secret (insiders), between the brand and customers from whom the secret is hidden (outsiders), and between insiders and outsiders. The effects of secrecy in marketing extend along with these three modes. First, secrecy creates value for insiders by reinforcing their connection to the brand. Second, it provokes outsiders’ curiosity, especially when the secret is related to a prominent brand. Finally, secrecy establishes insiders as an aspirational reference group for outsiders. © 2020, © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","curiosity; reference group; secrecy; Secrets; self-brand connection; uncertainty",""

However, in business relationships, value can be both co-created and co-destructed, but what happens to value appropriation when value is co-destructed? Previous studies have focused on what causes value co-destruction, rather than its effects. The question posed is relevant because some actors experience higher diminutions in value appropriation, generating perceptions of inequities, dissatisfaction, and tensions. By analysing data from 39 qualitative interviews with companies that have experienced value co-destruction, this paper attempts to identify the reasons for the unbalanced relationship between value co-destruction and value appropriation. Two higher-level dimensions–awareness of value and awareness of context–are identified and used to generate four clusters of reasons for disproportionate value co-destruction effects. The paper also pinpoints specific actions for managing unfairness from value co-destruction. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","business relationships; unfairness; value appropriation; Value co-creation; value co-destruction",""

Through the analysis of personal testimonies and photography, this research seeks to understand how people incorporate fashion objects into their life narratives and family histories.

At present, there is little empirical evidence of customer satisfaction with digital assistants. PLS-SEM was used to analyse 244 survey responses to examine this research gap. The results confirmed that expectations and confirmation of expectations have a positive and significant relationship on customer satisfaction with digital assistants.

While few studies have applied the SNM across media, no study has addressed the limitation of the SNM, that is, the implied assumption of audience homogeneity. Given that audiences do differ by age within any medium, and across media, there is a need to incorporate audience heterogeneity into the method.

SEC is conceptualised as a second-order construct consisting of cognitive, hedonic, social/personal, and pragmatic/economic first-order dimensions. Results show that the technological environmental cues of the smart servicescape (S) collectively influence smart experience co-creation (O), and this co-created experience eventually influences consumers’ service brand equity and word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions (R).

Instead, we argue that what is taking place is an implicit adherence to a contemporary form of age-old Christian dogma. As a radical conjecture, we thus propose that an identification of certain similarities between Christian dogma and the grounds for various posthumanist frameworks suggest that posthuman thought may well herald the global dissemination of a far more elusive, authoritarian, and hegemonic system than that which posthumanists typically claim to have abandoned.

We draw on qualitative narrative interviews with 16 United Kingdom and Australian ECRs in marketing to demonstrate how symbolic violence is produced and reproduced through institutions, ideology, language and discourse, and social relations. We find that while ECRs are not entirely subjugated by symbolic violence in the neoliberal University–with some participants displaying critically reflexive awareness and resistance, we also find that they can be complicit and serve to reproduce the system through seeking to learn and play the game of academia, rather than change it. We argue that symbolic violence offers a framework to help conceptualise the neoliberal University. Further, we submit that instrumental advice to marketing ECRs on how to navigate a life in academia is not enough and that critical reflexivity, resistance, and social action to oppose symbolic violence and the ideology of the neoliberal University is required to achieve emancipation. © 2020, © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Early Career Researchers (ECRs); marketing academics; neoliberal University; power; Symbolic violence",""

The strength of a Black consumer’s ethnic identity accentuated this and other aspects of service quality expectations. These findings could assist Black-owned businesses in the management of the anticipated and desired experience of their patrons. Implications and directions for further research are discussed. © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","ethnic identity; marketplace diversity; minority-owned business; service expectations; Shared racial identity; social identity theory",""

Previous studies have analysed the impact of some advertising decisions on investors, namely, the advertising expenditure level and messages. However, previous research has ignored what happens with other advertising decisions, such as media mix. The present study examines the differential effects of media on investors’ response to advertising, that is, whether advertising expenditure and brand messages equally increase firm value when delivered through different media. Our results indicate that the effect of advertising expenditure depends on which media companies use. We also find that brand messages increase firm value only when broadcast through some specific media. © 2020, © 2020 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","accountability; Advertising; customer orientation; effectiveness; firm value; Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC); metrics; performance",""

The results for brand familiarity and product characteristics are more nuanced; the effects are greater for unfamiliar brands, and also for familiar brands that are utilitarian. These findings are encouraging for digital advertisers who may feel released from the imperative to design attention-grabbing advertisements.

Today our societies are based on both markets and democracy, but those institutions tend to be mutually contradictory. When marketing tends to replace politics and to almost religiously convert citizens into consumers it is social cohesion that is at stake. This paper aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of social/historical trends. As it highlights the importance of ideas (representations and motivations) and their links with changing institutions, it might help researchers and marketers to a broader understanding of their role and towards a more conscious social behaviour. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","market; marketing; normalisation; Social change; social cohesion; violence",""

Leveraging theorising regarding the psychological need to perceive the world as orderly and non-random, we posit that products imbued with religious/spiritual significance help manage concerns about randomness and uncontrollability (e.g. when a product is unreliable or exposes the consumer to random uncontrollable processes). When randomness concerns were salient, religious consumers showed increased desire to attach religious significance to secular objects (e.g. having item blessed, physically attaching a religious symbol). For spiritual consumers, spiritual products (vs. non-spiritual physically equivalent products) were seen as having (i) non-material efficacy (i.e. efficacy not bound to the purely material world) and (ii) unfalsifiable efficacy (i.e. efficacy that is immune to contrary evidence). Evidence is found across a variety of religious and spiritual contexts. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Control; religion; religious symbols; rituals; threat",""

At the same time, consumer researchers have long suggested that brands and commodities can act as a source of community and ethics. In recent years a number of communitarian productive networks have emerged in sectors like food, software, fashion, design and social enterprise. Such communities of commons-based peer production have transformed the role of consumer communities by making communitarian relations count also in the material production of goods and services. In this paper we examine the ‘neorural’ communitarian networks located in Southern Italy. We suggest that the creation of community around high quality, ‘authentic’ agricultural produce serves a dual role. On the one hand such communities singularise agricultural products and enable them to acquire market value as goods. At the same time, communities provide space for a new politics of things oriented towards pragmatic social transformation and the creation of ontological security in a world understood to be highly contingent. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","alternative food; Brand community; collaborative economy; consumer politics; Italy; neo-artisan",""

To do so, we draw on theories of religious capital, foregrounding the flexibility of this resource in enabling multifarious religious consumption.

Further, this research focuses on specific reactions beyond simply ‘attitude towards advertisement’; precisely, an overall ‘evaluation of advertisement’, the ‘ability to generate curiosity’ about the brand, and the ‘degree of likeability of advertisementʼ are compared. It was found that lesbians’ responses to targeted print advertisements were significantly influenced by whether they self-identify with gay males under the holistic banner of ‘gay’.

Perceived brand liquidification, discussed through the marketplace mythologies of corporate greed and the opportunistic consumer, perceived brand de-contagion and patriotism/nationalism, leads to sentiments of exclusion and a longing for re-solidification.

This study challenges the assumption that consumption of taboo discourses leads to active identity modification or public defiance. Instead, in-depth interviews and online ethnography reveal that consumption of soap operas that challenge local religious and gender norms provide a liminal space for discussing taboo topics. Firstly, the findings indicate that talking about taboo topics seen in soap operas enables consumers to speak about what they expect gender and religious norms to be. Secondly, consumers get their mediated understandings of what religion is through soap operas.

Frameworks for operationalising consumer anticipation in practical contexts are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Consumer anticipation; consumption evaluation; delayed consumption; satisfaction",""

We found that the word ‘value’ is recursively linked to 13 different ‘meanings’ indicating a variety of understandings of the term ‘value’. Furthermore, the findings support service-dominant logic where customers integrate their own resources (skills and knowledge) in the value co-creation process. Future research has to be aware of the different meanings, which are associated with value. Marketing managers need to understand, on the one hand, that value has a different meaning to their customer and on the other hand, what value means to their specific target groups. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Customer value; eigenforms; meaning; recursive operations; second order cybernetics; system theory; value",""

However, CSR exposes a company to potential damage when a critical event, such as a crisis, disconfirms the CSR of a corporate reputation. The present article introduces to the crisis management literature the notion of consumer-perceived incongruence (CPI) between corporate reputation and crises. Our first experimental study demonstrates that a high CPI–compared to a low CPI–worsens consumer responses in terms of attitude towards the corporation (ATC), word of mouth (WOM) and purchase intention (PI). The second study shows that these effects are mediated by the perception of a state of discomfort on the part of the consumer. The third study suggests that, in cases of high CPI, the corporate crisis response strategy of apology outperforms that of compensation in reducing the negative effects of discomfort on consumer responses. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","apology; compensation; consumer behaviour; corporate reputation; crisis management; CSR; incongruence",""

We proposed and empirically tested an integrated model that included three stages: brand and label equity; transfer mechanisms; and product evaluation. We first selected an organic label and product brands and then tested our hypotheses with a sample of French consumers. The results confirm the positive influence of brand and label equity on transfer mechanisms (brand/label perceived fit and ease of transfer) and, in turn, illustrate how ease of transfer influences the overall product evaluation. A surprising result is that brand/label perceived fit does not directly affect the overall product evaluation; rather, it only influences brand/label ease of transfer. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand equity; ease of transfer; ingredient branding; Organic food; overall evaluation; perceived fit",""

Emojis have become quintessential elements of social media communication; yet, their role in supporting persuasion attempts has not been systematically analysed. Drawing on general rhetoric literature, this paper dissects, portrays and labels social media influencers’ persuasive attempts to initiate engagement through emojis. The focus on influencers is justified because of their dual roles as marketers and active social media users. 600 Weibo posts by the top 200 Weibo influencers were collected to develop a taxonomy of emoji-based verbal moves aimed at encouraging responses in followers. The resulting taxonomy demonstrates that emoji use by social media influencers is complex and strategic and serves multiple persuasive and communicative purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","emoji; influencer; Marketing rhetoric; social media; social media marketing; taxonomy",""

Expanding upon and synthesising earlier work and conceptualisations, we develop and propose a comprehensive conceptual framework for brand love that is innovative for the following reasons. In particular, our model takes a developmental rather than a snapshot approach to capture brand love trajectories as a function of their onset and evolution; incorporates key frameworks and as such builds on interpersonal, parasocial and experiential theories; and acknowledges the important role of brand hate.

The political and military elements have been examined but comparatively little attention has been paid to the ability of IS to commandeer the AQ narrative by appropriating and extending key themes and using them via social media to market itself as a choice for disaffected youth. It is suggested that IS has done this by making skilful use of rhetoric to position its brand and facilitate recruitment. To illustrate this, eight major themes of jihadi social media communications are identified and then analysed.

Few studies have explored how UGC shapes these consumer responses. In the context of the UK food retail industry, this study explored what makes UGC more or less believed than company-generated CSR communication on social media. Through qualitative inquiry, the study identified that unique characteristics of social media, such as system-generated cues, lead UGC to be more believed than company-generated content, shaping perceived legitimacy.

We argue that corporate reputation plays a more expansive role, proposing that consumers will be less price-sensitive to offerings endorsed by companies with good reputations and that it moderates the marginal utility of product features with high clarity. We also propose that an individual’s knowledge of a company increases the likelihood its products will be purchased. Using a choice model incorporating an individual SEM-based reputation measure, we find support for these hypothesised effects in the context of television choices.

Prior research, through the lens of service-dominant logic, has conceptualised fans as active, commanding and critical influencers, revealing complex, multifaceted and developing co-creative relationships, but invariably only with their teams, clubs and online communities, limiting what is currently known about fans, sponsors and co-creation. Given this gap, the current study seeks to explore the perceptions and antecedents of this relationship across European football leagues with an emphasis on understanding perspectives on user generated advertising, developing social media content, creating brand culture and new product/services development for sponsoring brands. Exploratory in outlook, the paper adopts a social constructionist position, utilising 296 participants, from 9 leagues and incorporating 59 clubs. The study reveals the dynamic nature of the fan/co-creation relationship, with data indicating that fanatical and regular fans view co-creation as a cynical, intrusive and disruptive process, while casual fans seem more willing to engage, albeit episodically and driven by the anomalous emotions of guilt and superstition. The paper uncovers behaviours that offer insight for both brand managers and clubs into the reality of fan engagement in the context of co-creation.

The results indicate that all except the active presence dimension of social media implementation are positively related to social media performance. The results further indicate that social media performance is positively related to marketing performance. The study contributes to the literature by offering a novel conceptualisation and empirical validation of the social media implementation construct. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","marketing performance; social media implementation; Social media marketing; social media performance; social media strategy",""

Inspired by nomadism, it explores the relationships among consumption community, the collective movement of people, and current and potential future spaces. Applying process data analysis to data from an extended netnography, the study reveals space as a recursive object that can both change and be changed by the community.

In response, many proponents of culturalist paradigms have adopted the vernacular of ‘thick data’ to defend their vulnerable position in the marketing research field. However, thick data proselytising fails to challenge several outmoded ontological assumptions that are manifest in the big data myth and it situates socio-cultural modes of marketing thought in a counterproductive technocratic discourse. In building this argument, I first discuss the relevant historical continuities and discontinuities that have shaped the big data myth and the thick data opportunism. Next, I argue that culturally oriented marketing researchers should promote a different ontological frame— the analytics of marketplace assemblages—to address how big data, or more accurately its socio-technical infrastructure, produces new kinds of emergent and hybrid market structures, modes of social aggregation, consumption practices, and prosumptive capacities. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Big data; consumer culture theory; ethnography",""

The framework shows that consumer involvement with branded apps underpins two sets of consumer perceptions of the benefits that the app offers, which reflect the different motives for engaging with the app, as consumers experience them. These perceptions include the utilitarian motives of security, usefulness and ease of use; and the hedonic motives of interpersonal utility, attachment (with the device) and entertainment. This range of motives leads to the willingness to pay for the app and the willingness to recommend it. This research contributes to marketing theory by clarifying specific details of the psychological process through which it is possible to motivate consumer engagement with branded apps - i.e. by means of binding involvement, perceptions of how apps’ benefits meet individual needs and two key outcomes. The findings also yield managerial relevance. Above all, the outcomes of this research suggest that, by involving and motivating consumers through the improvement of the benefits that a branded app offers, it is possible to increase the app’s revenues and to encourage word-of-mouth, creating value for app providers and consumers. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer engagement; consumer involvement; Mobile applications; motivation; willingness to pay; word-of-mouth",""

We do so in an effort to further advance the extant understanding of desire in consumer research. Specifically, informed by Lacanian psychoanalytic thought and sharing much affinity with Foucault’s central argument in The History of Sexuality, we consider how the institution of religion functions as a disciplining force by which to mediate the (potential) conflict between human desire and the social order. For the purposes of this article, we focus our analytical gaze on how consumption practices have the disciplinary effect of regulating desire. That is to say, we illuminate how religion (and religious ideology) dictates certain consumption practices, which ultimately perform to ensure that the pursuit of desire does not contravene the pre-existing social order that structures society and organises social relating. To animate our theoretical claims, we draw on a qualitative study of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic sub-culture originating in South Asia. This article builds on extant sociological and anthropological studies that have captured the nexus between religion and the workings of the marketplace. However, unlike past studies, the question posited at the crux of this article concerns desire and, particularly, how desire becomes subjected to the discourses pertaining to religiously prescribed consumption practices. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Al-Ghazali; Desire; Islam; morality; seduction; Tablighi Jamaat",""

Combining philosophical, historical, economic and fictional resources, the paper first produces a synthetic account of what murketing is. Blurring calculated dishonesty with impassioned sincerity, murketing operationalises a double-truth dialectic which treats consumers as both subjects and objects within the process of their own persuasion. In order to indicate how murketing works, the paper then considers recent examples from murketing practice where allusions are made which are both cynical and gnostic, both conceited and intimate, and both earnest and ironic.

When studying the consumption of religion and spirituality, how does a researcher mitigate a potential secularist worldview to consider consumers’ alternative metaphysical assumptions? And when these alternative worldviews posit divine and occult forces, how should the researcher study and theorise these forces? Based on our research of Pentecostalism in Ghana, we offer four suggestions. First, we demonstrate the importance of delineating the socio-historical context of our informants’ worldview. Second, we encourage exploring the potential of indigenous methods that may be more culturally sensitive; in this case, we show how religious testimony offers new insights as a way of knowing that is consistent with our informants’ worldview. Third, we advocate theorising within the frame of the indigenous metaphysical worldviews, such as understanding the religious testimonies as affective performances. Finally, we reflect on the benefits of moving beyond reflexivity to paths of action that seek rapprochement among differing worldviews. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Pentecostal Christianity; reflexivity; spirits; spiritual warfare; testimony",""

I suggest that this analytical separation allows us to see that on the one hand capitalist violence is intensifying and with it processes of exploitation, class bifurcation, downward mobility and environmental, political and social degradation. On the other hand, however, capitalism appears to be ossifying as it loses its ability to self-reproduce. The violent act of (periodically) destroying its own creation to make room for new production and formation is becoming stifled and nothing appears capable of blowing up the dead weight of capital that is suffocating living labour. Drawing on the work of David Graeber and Mariana Mazzucato I propose that, paradoxically, it is the logic of the market that causes the stifling of real innovation and thus capitalism’s ability to reproduce.

Engagement with nostalgia-evoking social media content fulfils the need for ontological security by reintegrating memories of the past into an ongoing, self-affirming narrative or ‘life story’, while the digital archiving of photos and videos offers the possibility of ‘digital immortality’ for a virtual self that can be projected into the future. © 2019, © 2019 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","life stories; memory bias; modernity; nostalgia; Ontological security; social media",""

In-depth interviews with young adults revealed three driving mechanisms (1) expected health service quality, (2) self-stigma and (3) perceived severity, and two contingency variables of (1) media exposure and (2) past behaviour.

Drawing on the concepts of the marketing device and qualification, it shows how Oatly–a Swedish company making oat-based products–enrols three sets of marketing devices, i.e. digital media, packaging and stores, to simultaneously ‘alternativise’ and ‘convenienise’ its range of vegan products. The result is the material and discursive construction of a range of vegan products that is qualified as different enough from conventional dairy products to be an attractive alternative, but similar enough to fit into existing practices of shopping for food, cooking and eating. By qualifying products along multiple registers, Oatly constructs ‘plastic’ products, which can be consumed, for various reasons, by various groups of consumers thus enacting a multi-niche market for its products. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","alternative; food substitutes; market devices; qualification; sustainability; Vegan consumption",""

Understanding how the learning process works enables a brand firm to identify a customer’s latent needs. Prior studies have primarily focused on effectively positioning brand knowledge in the minds of customers, but that linear learning process does not apply to the interactive and proactive social media setting. Based on the uses and gratifications perspective, this study proposes a customer-learning model and analyses 373 online questionnaires using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The empirical results confirm that learning motivation and collaborative learning are two core components of customer learning that have positive influences on satisfaction, which in turn has a positive influence on customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) and loyalty. In addition, learning motivation is the driver of collaborative learning. Finally, CEBs also have a positive influence on loyalty. This study also concludes that the social network brand community is an informative customer-learning platform that is characterised by interactivity, collaborative learning and co-creation.

Analysis focuses on the assemblage of actors, the breaking of matters of fact and shaping and communication of concerns, and at actions. Contrary to many approaches to the alternative, focus is paid to overlap between systems, knowledge and actors and simultaneous development of two products.

This study addresses this gap and extends previous research by examining factors that influence consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce in four countries: Chile, Spain, South Africa and Australia. Specifically, this study develops and tests a model of consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce through brands’ Facebook pages incorporating personal variables (involvement in brands’ products and services, satisfaction with brands’ Facebook page), trust variables (message credibility of Facebook posts, trust in firms’ Facebook) and social variables (peer communication, social media dependency, online social interaction propensity) on predicting intentions to purchase products and services through brands’ Facebook pages if s-commerce was available to them. The findings show that the main drivers of s-commerce engagement are message credibility, trust in the brands’ Facebook, involvement, peer communication and online social interaction propensity, as influencers of consumer satisfaction with brands’ Facebook and social media dependency, which in turn drive intentions to engage in s-commerce. Contributing to theory and practice, these relationships are discussed for the four countries involved in the study. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer behaviour; Facebook; s-commerce; Social commerce; social media",""

The findings show that young British South Asian adults exhibit attributes of both of their ancestral and host cultures. Their dual cultural identity is constituted due to four major reasons: consonances with ancestral culture, situational constraints, contextual requirements and conveniences. This quadripartite perspective informs a non-context-specific theoretical model of acculturation.

Borrowing ideas and methods from other disciplines, often with adaptations, while clearly valuable, also brings a significant risk of ‘getting it wrong’. Problems arise when researchers do not follow best practices carefully developed in the originating discipline. To maintain competitive advantage, marketing researchers often ‘black box’ the details of how they apply those procedures of method design and analysis. This lack of transparency provides little evidence that best practices are followed. This, in turn, raises questions about the validity and reliability of the resulting insights and their implications. To illustrate this issue, we examine two domains where there is strong evidence to suggest that current practices are not best (or even good) practices–implicit association testing and neuroscience. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Cognitive science; consumer cognition; implicit association testing; marketing; marketing research; neuromarketing",""

TIWIS illustrates that students’ engagement with social media platforms such as Facebook is dynamic in nature. It comprises behavioural expressions (manifestations and actions such as likes and shares as well as opinion comments) and individuals’ experiences (subjective in nature stories and comments of personal experiences and views).

These are used to discuss consumers’ accounts of marketing collected through 78 personal interviews in which participants were asked to describe marketing and provide examples of their experiences with marketing as they defined it. Through this, the study uncovers various forms of consumer resistance, which can often go unnoticed. These are conceptualised through the notion of everyday resistance to marketing and are used to challenge existing marketing theory and develop paths for future research. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer culture; Consumer resistance; critical marketing; empowerment; power relations",""

To address this omission, we introduce internal brand orientation as a new construct that provides a measurable and more succinct picture of internal branding. Following the literature in measurement theory, we report a series of complementary studies and develop a scale which comprises two dimensions: top management brand commitment and shared brand values. The new scale demonstrates strong psychometric evidence of reliability and validity, facilitating future research in the area.

Building on embodied cognition theory and metaphor theory, we argue that sadness is grounded in bodily sensation of heaviness, which has important sensory marketing implications for engaging consumer senses to affect consumer decision-making and attitude formation processes. We found support for this metaphorical link between heaviness and sadness across six studies. We showed that carrying a heavy bag saddened individuals and increased the valuation of a teddy bear. Intention to donate to a charity supporting endangered tigers increased when burdened participants watched a sad video about these animals. Conversely, sadness induced physical heaviness and increased preference for an easy-to-maintain sofa. Further, sad individuals disliked an advertisement for a sports drink that figured energy-consuming actions. Our findings inform sensory marketing practice about embedding the bodily sensation of heaviness to induce sadness in marketing communication. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","customer experience; Embodied cognition; heavy; metaphor; sadness; sensory marketing",""

A watershed moment was when the American Broadcasting Corporation aired its ‘Deep Dive’ documentary on IDEO in 1999. The programme’s implication that design was ideal for innovation, that it could be applied to anything and the sometimes evangelical tide of design thinking literature that followed created a tectonic pull within business practice and education. I argue that this was due in part to a ‘Candy Man’ effect, where executives longing for easy, sure-fired innovation saw ABC’s sunny depiction of design, read the popular press articles and books on design thinking and swarmed in–often with unrealistic expectations and subsequent disappointment.

The mixed-methods approach combines real purchasing data with in-depth qualitative data to generate insights with a high external validity. In the first section of the study, quantitative analysis is applied to actual purchasing behaviour (n = 10,772,477) to identify market trends. Three main groupings, along with specific heuristic cues, are established. In the second step, a qualitative study (n = 21) provides deeper insights into consumers’ motives and decision-making processes. By synthesising the quantitative and qualitative research findings, a segmentation approach is developed. Relevant motives and values, and corresponding specific heuristic cues are identified for each consumer segment. Analysis suggests that consumers are motivated by self-interest and environmental motives, and that they use simple heuristic cues to make quick and satisfying purchasing decisions. Both retailers and manufacturers can leverage these insights to seize the opportunities of the developing market for sustainable personal care products. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","heuristics; motive; segmentation; Sustainability; sustainable consumption; values",""

Social media engagement approached in this study is a three-dimensional construct composed of affective, cognitive and behavioural dimensions. Surveying more than 48 Facebook pages, spanning nine product categories and 448 consumers, the results show that product involvement, attitude towards the community and online interaction propensity all impact social media engagement. The study also reveals that high social media engagement increases brand relationships significantly, particularly affecting brand trust, commitment and loyalty. Additionally, community engagement appears as a precursor of brand engagement. These findings provide insight into antecedents and outcomes of engagement for academic research and bring value to online brand and community management. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand relationship; consumer engagement; online community; Social media",""

Such marketplaces should be studied in their own right, and not as a means to a preconceived end, whether it be for outside companies or government policy and so forth. We study subsistence marketplaces inside-out rather than outside-in–beginning at the micro level and being bottom-up in deriving implications for many sectors of society.

The building of partnerships between destination management organisations and host communities could enable authentic collaboration in the design and development of heritage tourism. The purpose of this paper is to highlight and explore the challenges and opportunities of facilitating community engagement in heritage destination management. Through examining an approach adopted in York, this paper explores the extent to which participation in tourism planning and development allows community members to take ownership of their heritage and result in more positive community attitudes towards tourism.

Throughout the course of a brand’s lifetime, its authenticity is maintained by employing different strategies that emphasise various interrelated dimensions of genuineness. Early projections of authenticity are centred on a germination strategy, where an emphasis on craftsmanship develops a sense of sincerity and integrity. As the brand grows through a prolific product extension strategy, its authenticity is cultivated through quality commitment, resulting in stylistic consistency. As the brand reaches maturity it returns to its roots, emphasising craftsmanship and leading to brand integrity. Following the analysis, the theoretical and managerial implications are presented. © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand authenticity; brand history; branding strategy; heritage; luxury",""

However, the way an iconic brand comes to be de-iconicised and how managers can shield brands from this risk is still under-researched. The aim of this paper is to contribute to knowledge regarding iconic brands by following the life of one iconic brand at national level, examining its history and its impact from the point of view of cultural performance. Our research contributes to the field of cultural branding through a genealogical study of how a brand becomes a national icon before becoming de-iconicised as circumstances change. Our research identifies five types of brand episode that can lead to de-iconisation. Our research therefore adds new developments to iconic brand theory.

Three cautionary lessons are put forward. First, the goal of producing myriad consumer alternatives is significantly hampered by the competing, and often contradictory demands of market forces. Second, the discourse of food alternatives uses a ‘win-win’ logic suggesting that consumer sacrifice or change is unnecessary; the challenge of reshaping, and even downgrading consumer expectations is a necessary, but tremendous challenge facing consumer projects for ecological and social change. Third, the search for eco-social alternatives cannot simply make consumers feel good about their purchases, but must address the material realities and limitations of niche markets, and the need for structural reform to the food system. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Alternative food; consumers; food; markets and market limitations; meat; organics; shopping for change",""

The findings show that although there is generally no personal relationship between consumers and celebrities, consumers tend to bond with celebrities in para-social relationships. Many consumers see these relationships as similar to how they connect with friends thus leading them to show forgiveness tendencies towards a celebrity comparable to forgiving friends.

Based on direct observations of six brand fan pages on Facebook, we offer a first conceptualisation of corporate conflict management strategies. Our results reveal five main conflict management strategies: non-engaging, censoring, bolstering, informing and pacifying. By drawing on existing suggestions from the marketing literature, we provide managerial implications and suggest avenues for future research. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand community; Conflict resolution; consumer aggression; corporate governance; social media",""

This article first shows that previous efforts to study compulsive buying and materialism have been limited in part because they have relied on single perspectives and inadequate methods. Second, it suggests that research in this area could be advanced by adopting emergent approaches and methods that have been used in social and behavioural sciences to study the onset and development of maladaptive behavioural patterns. Third, the article presents the multi-theoretical life course research paradigm that has been widely adopted in numerous disciplines as an approach to the study of various forms of maladaptive behaviour. Fourth, it illustrates how this approach could be employed to study the onset and development of materialism and compulsive buying. Finally, drawing from this paradigm, the article offers new insights in the form of propositions and conceptual directions to help researchers improve their efforts in studying materialism and compulsive buying as well as other forms of the dark side of consumer behaviour. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","compulsive buying; dark side; life course; maladaptive behaviours; Materialism; research directions",""

Those involved in sponsorship commonly try to limit it by restricting ambusher activity in event contexts. We introduce theoretical ideas around distinctiveness to explain that sponsors may actually fare better in terms of awareness outcomes when ambushers are present in the event context, if they strategically use ambusher presence to highlight their own distinctive sponsor status. Across two experiments we show that sponsor distinctiveness can be achieved by communicating sponsorship exclusivity in ambusher presence, and by facilitating juxtaposition of sponsor and ambusher messages. Results include increased recall to sponsor cues, and reduced recall to ambusher cues. The findings suggest ambusher restrictions may sometimes be counter-productive. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Ambush marketing; brand juxtaposition; distinctiveness; memory; sponsorship",""

The authors present the results of an extensive, in-depth qualitative case-study analysis pertaining to the media industry. The authors find that crowdsourced customer participation is not consistently superior in enabling firms to discover how to serve their customers better. Instead, the results unearth a catalogue of seven interrelated value determinants that show where the boundaries of both crowdsourcing and traditional customer participation in innovation lie.

Although prior research acknowledges the importance of design innovation for product and organisational performance, studies on how to manage design innovation are relatively scarce. The present study attempts to fill this gap by investigating design innovation and its management in terms of the degree of exploration and exploitation activities and designers’ decision freedom when developing new offerings. We collected data on projects in which external design consultancies were actively involved during the development process (n = 83). For each project, we surveyed both the external senior designer and the project manager at the client’s side. Our results suggest that exploration activities enhance design innovativeness, and that design innovativeness results in better market performance. Furthermore, we find that exploitation activities moderate the relation between design innovativeness and process performance: when exploitation activities are high (low), design innovativeness results in better (worse) process performance. In addition, we find that when designers have decision freedom, the positive relation between exploration activities and design innovativeness is enhanced. However, our data also suggest that design innovativeness has a negative (positive) influence on market performance when designers have high (low) levels of decision freedom. © 2016 The Author(s).

If consultants’ pervasive impact on the contemporary place branding practice cannot be ignored, their fixed representation as powerful agents of top-down policies might limit more holistic accounts of consultancy practice. Indeed, consultants can find themselves mediating between bottom-up and top-down approaches to place branding. Thus, they can decide to promote more inclusive activities that give voice to local communities, while simultaneously addressing the needs of urban elites that are likely to pay the consultancy bill. Liminality is suggested as an appropriate idea to challenge role fixity and appreciate the ambiguity of place branding consultancy. The study reports self-reflective accounts from a case study on Rio de Janeiro, where the first author was involved in a three-year activity of working with stakeholders to stimulate a more inclusive public debate on city-brand management. Charting, snowballing, coopting consultants, informal advising, feeding and scientific arming are the six types of consulting practices of stakeholder engagement that the study identifies in order to offering a more nuanced representation of place brand consulting. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consultants; Place branding; practitioners; Rio de Janeiro; scholars; stakeholder engagement",""

In addition, expanding upon the theory of need satisfaction, the current paper introduces a novel conceptual distinction between compensation and compromise.

Drawing upon the concept of hyperdiegesis, we consider potentially ‘projective’ forms of narrative transportation in binge-watching; heterochronic breaks from normal patterns of time; and post-object behaviours. In doing so, we outline how forms of escapism traditionally considered passive may under certain conditions represent much richer and more complex enterprises than previously imagined. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Binge watching; consumer culture; consumer experience; ethnography; hyperdiegesis; theory",""

Green demarketing refers to a strategy whereby a brand encourages consumers to buy less at the category level through purchase of the company’s brand for the sake of the environment. Two studies show that consumer motive attributions and attitudes may depend on the brand’s perceived fit with sustainable business practices. Specifically, results show that the brand’s environmental reputation is the strongest predictor of consumers’ responses towards a green demarketing campaign, with effects persisting above and beyond the influences of the brand’s length of commitment to environmental protection and consumers’ brand habits.

In particular, contests in which consumers create user-generated content (UGC) offer the potential of actively engaging consumers with a brand and thereby directly affecting consumer purchases. This research demonstrates that prompting consumers to create UGC that engages consumers in actively thinking about or elaborating on a personal goal that is relevant to a brand does affect actual buying decisions. It shows that the impact of this engagement via content elaboration is not accounted for by mere participation in the social media activity or rewards offered to participants. The research adds to the growing literature on the importance of consumer engagement and validates the link between engagement and actual purchase behaviours. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","customer experience; elaboration likelihood model; engagement; social media; User-generated content",""

The paper is based on an 8-month ethnography at the Bridgewater Hall concert venue in Manchester. Our emergent findings illustrate how classical music tastes are influenced via the spatial meanings of the concert hall. These meanings include various physical, historical and sociocultural aspects that are revealed in the context of the Bridgewater Hall. Our study contributes to various streams of consumer culture theory research and opens up avenues for future research on the interrelationships of space and place with taste. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Classical music; concert halls; consumer culture theory; experiential consumption; place; taste",""

Founded in ideas from regulatory engagement theory, this study examines regulatory fit as a key driver of CBE and brand value experience. Regulatory fit theory assumes that promotion orientation, focusing on attaining a desired end state, fits with eager and active customer strategies while prevention orientation, focusing on avoiding an undesired end state, fits with vigilant and watchful customer strategies. This experimental study of a Nordic insurance firm’s Facebook brand activities (n = 429) identified positive regulatory fit, non-fit and simple effects on psychologically anchored (emotional, cognitive and intentional) and behavioural (‘likes’, comments) CBE dimensions. Consistent with regulatory fit theory, the study found that a prevention-oriented brand activity best evoked positive cognitive CBE among customers applying vigilant strategies. Opposing existing theory, promotion-oriented brand activity best evoked positive emotional CBE regardless of customer strategy and a prevention-oriented brand activity best evoked positive intentional CBE among those applying eager strategies, The findings contribute to a better understanding the multidimensionality of CBE and the role of fit in regulatory engagement theory. The findings are also of direct relevance to how service firms should engage their customers, and show that service providers can benefit from the use of prevention-oriented activities in social media if such activities are in accordance with their brand values. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand value experience; Customer brand engagement; field experiment; regulatory engagement theory; regulatory fit theory",""

Consumers, in carnival spirit, augment marketer-facilitated mimetic (moderate, controlled) forms of experience with non-mimetic (dangerous, uncontrolled) consumption rituals, enacted in pursuit of contemporary excitement. Consumers serendipitously hijack the facilitating brand’s ideology resulting in the promotion of marketplace tensions. This study contributes to marketing and consumer culture theory by extending current experiential marketing frameworks via the introduction of the branded carnival, a non-mimetic communal brand-centric phenomenon; showing how non-mimetic excitement emerges in marketplace contexts; highlighting the implications for experiential and brand community marketers; and positioning the branded carnival within a broader cultural gravitation towards non-mimetic behaviour opposing marketplace ideology.

Yet few within entitled sectors of the global economy have had much to do with people living in poverty, except for occasional and indirect contact. Even basic ideas about poverty lack clarity; for example, what is the line between poor and not poor both within and among countries? Is it only about income or do other resources matter or act as substitutes for money when impoverished consumers engage their markets?

In studying object–person relations, prior scholars have given priority to materialising the ‘object’, paying less attention to the material aspects of the ‘person’. To redress this gap, we draw on recent feminist materialist and affective turns and conceptualise the object–person relation as inherently gendered, embodied and affective. We develop this conceptualisation by analysing the way in which the gendered body interacts with the bed – a domestic material object that is fruitful for a gender analysis. As a result, we offer an extended view of the gendered body that interacts with the material world: one that is biological and cultural, sleeping and waking, and has the capacity to affect and be affected. Our study thereby contributes to gender studies in marketing and consumer research by taking a step forward in materialising both the object and the body. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","affects; beds; body; feminist theory; gender; home; material culture",""

Thirty-three semi-directive in-depth interviews were conducted at Cézanne’s studio at the end of attendees’ visits. Content analysis led to identifying key themes that describe how imagination at work during the visit creates an authentic experience. More specifically, results show that material dimensions (e.g. the studio setting, familiar objects, and guides) mixed with immaterial dimensions (e.g. Cézanne’s aura, stories, and atmosphere) facilitate consumers’ imagination through immersion, embodiment, and narrative transportation.

Second, combining qualitative and quantitative insights, this research reveals a series of specific functional and experiential TCCE touchpoints, which underpin the consumer internal response (motivation to visit) and outward behaviour (desire to stay and revisit intentions) in the town centre. In addition to enhancing town centre and customer experience knowledge, these findings offer important new insights to those managing town centres and seeking to retain customer loyalty in the high street.

WHS management highlights a context where sites rely on numerous interests uniting through goodwill. This is intensified by the multiple-ownership patterns which characterise many WHSs, necessitating a need for collective action. This study aims to explore how managers attempt to manage stakeholders and generate involvement and support. This study adopts a multiple case study approach, exploring three United Kingdom WHSs. Data were collected through interviews, documentation and physical artefacts. The analysis found that through representation, raising awareness and support, managers were able to generate stakeholder patronage. However, this required managers to look beyond informative engagement toward participatory means. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of the facilitators, time and money in successful stakeholder engagement. Lastly, conclusions, limitations and future research are offered. Underpinned by stakeholder theory, this paper contributes to the understanding of stakeholder engagement within WHS management and adds to limited empirical studies on multiple sites. This investigation found that engagement is constrained by managers’ limited time and resources. Furthermore, participatory engagement is essential in fostering stakeholders’ responsibility for site management and developing relationships with managers. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","stakeholder engagement; stakeholders; World Heritage; World Heritage Site management",""

This is especially necessary as P2P exchanges enact a different type of reciprocity from that of ‘business-to-consumers’. Thus, exploring P2P exchanges allows a better understanding of the drivers of commitment and the relationship of commitment with reciprocity. This qualitative and exploratory study examines the case of timebanks (TBs). Drawing from 40 in-depth interviews with TB managers and users along with participant observation, this study finds that commitment is a complex and multidimensional construct that may vary drastically depending on the distinct foci of commitment, the dual roles that users perform (as providers or as recipients), the type of exchange system and the notion of reciprocity underlying the exchange system. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","commitment; foci of commitment; generalised reciprocity; Peer-to-peer exchanges; reciprocity; timebanks",""

Although a number of these theorisations have been recognised and adopted in marketing and consumer research, the significance of feminism in knowledge construction has largely remained what we would call ‘unfinished’. Based on a critical reframing of gender research in marketing and consumer research, in dialogue with feminist theory, this article offers theoretical and practical suggestions for how to reinvigorate these research efforts. The analysis highlights dominant theorisations of gender, relating to gender as variable, difference and role; as fundamental difference and structuring; and as cultural and identity constructions. This reframing emphasises various neglected or ‘missing feminisms’, including queer theory; critical race, intersectional and transnational feminisms; material-discursive feminism; and critical studies on men and masculinities. A more detailed discussion of the latter, as a relatively new, growing and politically contentious area, is further developed to highlight more specifically which feminist and gender theories are mainly in use in marketing and consumer research and which are little or not used. In the light of this, it is argued that marketing and related disciplines have thus far largely neglected several key contemporary gender and feminist theorisations, particularly those that centre on gender power relations. The potential impact of these theoretical frames on transdisciplinary studies in marketing and consumer research and research agenda(s) is discussed. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer research; critical studies on men and masculinities; feminism; gender; marketing",""

The mid or liminal phase of transition is particularly ripe for consumer researchers. Transformative services research (TSR) considers that services may deliver objective well-being outcomes (e.g. consumer health). This article extends TSR into liminality and considers that services may also encompass hedonic (mood, satisfaction and happiness) and eudaimonic (mastery, autonomy, positive relations and self-acceptance) dimensions. The article unpacks women’s service experiences to enrich and expand understanding of positive and negative consumption meanings. It identifies that unanticipated outcomes emerge as a feature of transformative services. It demonstrates that services situates new mothers at the centre of a multiplicity of consumption. This may both overwhelm and act as transitional resource developing mothers as postmodern bricoleurs. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","bricolage; liminality; motherhood; services; Transformation",""

This empirical study applies the theoretical lens of social stress to explore gendered aspects of poverty, consumption and marketplace activity. It demonstrates that for women in poverty, consumer stress is a relational issue, involving marketplace and interpersonal (dis)connections. In particular, it surfaces the hidden, often, nuanced power relations that place additional strain on women with limited finances, as they oscillate between marketplace and intra-household pressures. By applying social stress theory, the study offers a new way of thinking about the unequal social relations and associated consumption strains bound up with the disadvantaged position of an intersectional group of women experiencing poverty. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumption; gender; inequalities; intersectional; poverty; stress",""

A single case study methodology involving an ‘upstream’ firm considering whether to manufacture products with environmental attributes was consequently used to test three previously unexamined assumptions associated with the upstream/downstream metaphor, a metaphorical distinction that continues to have sway within the social marketing discipline. Contrary to these assumptions, the flows of behavioural influence between ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ actors were found to be bidirectional (rather than unidirectional), interactive (rather than independent), and distinctive (rather than non-distinctive). These findings suggest the need for alternative models that can better reflect the complex, multidirectional relationships responsible for the emergence of many social issues. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","employee; environment; firm; Social marketing; upstream",""

Rev Billy’s radical critique of the worship of markets and money complements his creation of a vibrant Earth-loving community. The case is reviewed in light of Nietzsche’s vision of ‘the madman in the marketplace’. The analysis suggests that the dream of an infinitely expanding world market is a fantasy of omnipotence that acts as maladaptive defence against feelings of powerlessness. This fantasy of market omnipotence is in practice endangering human existence.

Taxonomic models, and those favouring a ‘state’- or ‘class’-based approach have been replaced by those attempting to tackle both individual and structural antecedents. However, these are still overly individualistic and fail to progress from an artificial view that these dimensions work separately and independently. In contrast, the new sociology of childhood conceptualises childhood as a hybridised, fluid combination of structure and agency. This paper introduces this approach, new to the consumer vulnerability field, and proposes that it has considerable implications for the way that children’s consumer vulnerability is theorised and researched, and for the formulation of policy. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","children; marketing; new sociology of childhood; policy; Vulnerable consumers",""

A conceptual framework was developed that synthesises both customer lifetime value and customer relationship management from a customer equity management (CEM) perspective. The framework was used to empirically examine how four CE strategies, together with a firm’s use of the two types of customer data (aggregated and disaggregated), impact on CEM outcomes. Data were collected from 114 hotel managers in Australia and analysed through a decision tree methodology. The results show that hotels are utilising their CE strategies for acquisition purposes more than retention purposes (customer asset management), which overall appears to satisfice more than maximise their hotel’s capacity in achieving effective CE outcomes.

Building on the previous literature, we propose the customer engagement ecosystem, a conceptual model that encompasses brand actions, other actors, customer brand experience, shopping behaviours, brand consumption and brand-dialogue behaviours. The model posits that interactions between these elements are non-linear and reactive; meaning that each action causes a reaction of not only the intended recipient of the message, but the whole ecosystem. Hence, the model reflects the interconnected character of today’s marketing environment. It also recognises the growing importance of empowered consumers by distinguishing different forms of brand dialogue behaviours, which describe customers’ non-purchase focused behaviours. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand; brand dialogue behaviours; Customer engagement; customer experiences; engagement ecosystem; non-purchase behaviours",""

First, there is the question of behavioural change to address difficult social problems. This embraces the development of co-ordinated multi-domain approaches for large scale social transformation. Second, there is the concept of exchange, the defining characteristic of social marketing yet problematic and the least researched of its benchmark criteria. Recognising the centrality of exchange, we address the broadening social marketing discourse, suggesting a focus beyond restricted to complex exchanges. This paper presents the insights from the application of Interactive Management, a system-based methodology, embracing a systemic change and a complex exchange agenda. Our case study finds the contexts for restricted and complex exchanges through barriers as well as structural and influence maps. Understanding complex exchanges closes the gap between the theoretical and practical debates surrounding contemporary social marketing and the role and function of exchange theory. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","contexts; exchange theory; interactive management; Social marketing",""

The recent literature has given increasing attention to how consumers value OSC. However, extant research is characterised by a scarcity of understanding the effects of brand identity and individual differences on consumer responses to OSC. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating role of trust and the moderating role of need for uniqueness on the effects of brand identity prestige and brand identity similarity on consumer perceived usefulness of OSC. A field survey, through mall intercept, was conducted to test this conceptual framework. Our findings advance this field by finding that, not only the brand identity and consumer need for uniqueness but also the interaction between them may affect consumers’ evaluation of OSC. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand identity; need for uniqueness; online self-customisation; perceived usefulness; structural equation modelling; trust",""

We also gained insights into how visitors responded to these strategies. Our findings suggest that the two museums employ different strategies to co-produce the consumption experience and that their strategies were linked to the nature of authenticity that is apparent in the museums. Strategies included explicitly controlling the visitor experience through empowering visitors to design their own visitor experience. The success of these strategies relied on the two museums recognising the situational variables of the context of consumption and adopting appropriate strategies that enabled them and the visitors to leverage the value of the visitor experience. The findings from this study suggest that further research should be undertaken on how authenticity might be integrated into a service-dominant logic paradigm and service strategies aimed at enhancing the co-creation of value. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","authenticity; Co-production; museum; value",""

It argues that facets of ideologies of ethical and sustainable consumption are inscribed within this discourse, authorising identity work and furnishing everyday provisioning routines with significance and urgency; and that related social practices that are marked for ‘greening’ diligence or negligence are not merely situated and productive, but transformative of mothering identities, roles and norms. We report the findings of a study of a group of professional working mothers as they negotiate competing and conflictual spaces of doing ‘green’ mothering. This opens an analytical window on the diversity of signifying practices that characterise how informants play with boundaries and ambiguity in creative ways, using images of responsible consumption and sustainable living to negotiate appeals to social well-being while authorising claims to ‘greening’ competence. Our interviews capture discursive events that rearticulate social messages, mixing them with brand appeals and media content that situate the invention of ‘new’ mothering with regard to flows of ‘greening’ discourse. Inventive appeals and related subject positions speak of a repertoire of strategic messaging practices, themselves consistent with a heightened reflexivity shaping content and presentation through practices we understand as modes of neutralisation – forms of self-governance and accountability that seek to generate resources of resilience that help reinforce green mothering identity claims made to self and others. Through socialising ‘sustainability’ in this way, we contribute to our understanding of the social surrogacy of brands and its problematics. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","branding; ethical and sustainable consumption; everyday practice; Green mothering; neutralisation",""

However, the study of brand preference has been limited to traditional marketing focusing on functional attributes to maximise utility. But now the shift to experiential marketing broadens the role of the brand from a bundle of attributes to experiences. Technological advancements have helped to increase the similarities between brand attributes and product commoditisation. Consequently, consumers cannot shape their preferences among brands using rational attributes only. They seek out brands that create experiences; that intrigue them in a sensorial, emotional and creative way. This study seeks to develop a model that provides an understanding of how brand knowledge and brand experience determine brand preference and to investigate its impact on brand repurchase intention. Accordingly, exploratory focus group discussions are employed followed by a survey of mobile phone users in Egypt. The findings provide insights into the relative importance of consumer perceptions on different brand knowledge factors in shaping brand preferences. It also demonstrates the significance of consumers’ experiential responses towards brands in developing their brand preferences that in turn influence brand repurchase intention. The model therefore offers managers a new perspective for building strong brands able to gain consumer preferences. © 2016 The Author(s).

Positive relationships of patronage towards both formats in all cities and the significant difference in why respondents patronise them suggest a partly complementary existence of the two types of agglomeration. We explain this apparent complementarity through the theory of adaptive resilience that has seen evolved agglomeration formats develop to provide a differentiated offer and consumer attraction compared with enclosed malls. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","adaptive resilience; resources; retail and service network; retail patronage; Shopping centre; town centres",""

Using primary data from 328 effective responses gathered from small business entrepreneurs, the study finds that market orientation improves the financial performance of a small firm only if it is implemented through brand orientation and eventually translated into brand performance.

First, the study will bring new insights regarding personality traits as an antecedent of OCE and, second, customer-perceived value emerges as a novel consequence of OCE. Understanding what personality traits drive customers to engage online and what value they perceive to receive in this digital age can help managers to better segment and evaluate their customers’ online engagement.

We therefore consider how prominent DVG ownership configurations may shape the way in which possession is assembled, potentially reducing consumers’ scope of action relative to DVGs and leaving possession susceptible to disruption. Conversely, we acknowledge ways in which consumers’ continued attempts at possession may impinge upon the agency of ownership mechanisms within the market.

Through 14 active interviews with British singles, we demonstrate how our participants negotiate their marginal status vis-à-vis the marketplace and the broader society that continue to uphold heterosexual partnership as a normative form of intimacy. Our data uncovers persistent and powerful gender stereotypes of how singles ought to organise their lives and conform both to social, as well as market-driven pressures.

This neglect of people’s action and interaction in exhibitions is somewhat surprising considering that it is in exhibitions where museums are in direct contact with their audience. This article begins with a review of the emergence of video-based research in the social sciences before turning to the use of video for the study of visitor behaviour in exhibitions. It contributes to recent debates on experiential and sensory marketing by examining three video-recorded fragments of interactions at exhibits in museums. The analysis of the fragments suggests that people’s experience of exhibits arises in social interaction with others. The article ends with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological contribution of video-based research in museums and of implications of such research for those involved in the management and design of museums and other experiential environments. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Arts marketing; consumer experience; experiential marketing; multimodality; multisensory environment; social interaction; video",""

A generalised finding from its use is that brands share their buyers with other brands approximately in-line with the size of those other brands. The approach is widely used by analysts and managers. One important use of the method is to identify partitions – brands that share buyers at a higher than expected rate. Partitions may form among competitor brands, but also among ‘same name’ or sub-brands that share a parent name (e.g. Coke, Diet Coke). A partition among same-name brands means they are cannibalising each other. Whether one’s focus is on cannibalisation within a portfolio, identifying close competitors, or to generally understand market structure, duplication analysis can provide insights. However, there are two potential confounds to its use: family buying and buying multiple brands on the same occasion. This study tests if these two factors confound the use of purchase duplications, using data from 12 grocery categories. The principal finding is that the identification of partitions is robust to these confounds. The study finds partitions among same-name brands are common and are also not due to these confounds. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand portfolio; Brand-switching; cannibalisation; market structure; partitions; purchase duplication; sub-brands",""

These variables are examined both individually and simultaneously to demonstrate the direct effect of each on BCC and how their inter-relationships contribute to BCC. In doing so, a two-step empirical analysis is conducted. First, two multinomial logit models provide an own- and a cross-price response matrix for a chosen set of competitive brands. Secondly, BCC is regressed against the variables of market share, intrinsic preferences, and price sensitivity using an interaction effects regression model. The results of the analysis show that market share is not the only way to increase BCC; in particular, consumer preferences, and especially pricing decisions, are shown to play a key role in developing a strong brand. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","competitive clout; intrinsic preferences; Market share; pricing decisions",""

Hence, it is important to systematically understand how specific elements of social media, signifying and representing behavioural manifestations of brand engagement, relate to other online activities. We study how three types of brand engagement on social media – affiliation, conversation and responsiveness – influence search engine advertising effectiveness, including click-through rate and conversion rate. Specifically, we find that affiliation, conversation and responsiveness increase click-through rate and conversion rate. Moreover, brand engagement on social media strengthens the relationships between advertisement rank and search engine advertising effectiveness. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","advertisement rank; advertising effectiveness; Brand engagement on social media; search engine advertising; social media",""

Dysfunctional forms of IoT have been neglected as an area of research, so identifying the different types of IoT providers’ dark-side behaviours will assist in the development of an integrated approach to the IoT that will help to overcome or mitigate these dark-side behaviours. Based on an extensive literature review, supplemented by expert insights drawn from the authors’ study of the IoT, a framework is developed that classifies the varying IoT dark-side behaviour types. The framework reveals eight forms of dark-side behaviour that are grouped into four broad categories. This classification illustrates how different types of dark-side behaviours are linked to key strategic IoT processes and also outlines how these dark-side practices may be addressed by adopting a more strategic and integrity-oriented approach. We conclude that with the adoption of a more holistic approach to the IoT, dark-side behaviours can be addressed and move in the direction of more effective marketing practices. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Internet of things; IoT dark side; IoT integrity; IoT network; IoT relationship",""

On the one side, incorporating artistic elements in store atmospherics constitutes an innovative way for retailers to differentiate their shopping experience. Such a hybrid retail strategy seeks to offer maximised hedonic gratification to store visitors, while adding symbolic value to the commercial offering. Store traffic and sales are thus stimulated. Incorporating artistic elements is also a magic way to conceal the store’s transactional purpose; through this association with the art world, the store is viewed as less mercantile. However, there is a risk that consumers will view the store as a ‘museum’ and visit without purchasing. Therefore we conduce a conceptual investigation of that experiential strategy in order to assess its effects on retailer’s commercial and marketing performance. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","art; hybrid retail strategy; retail performance; Shopping experience; store artification; store museumification",""

It provides a socio-historical perspective on fatherhood that reveals a discursive shift from the father as patriarchal family provider/protector to a more ambiguous and less obvious presence in the magazine advertisements. Our findings suggest that family-related advertising in women’s magazines does little to challenge the traditional models of paternal masculinity.

In this study, configuration theory is used to show that different market access configurations are viable simultaneously and that young musicians differ significantly in how they generate revenues. Using data on the media and sales performance of 338 young musicians in the Netherlands, we show that there is an ‘Emerging Star’ group (7–13% of artists depending on regional scope) and that record labels play an important role in this configuration providing broad media access on all platforms, both old and new. Digital age ‘Independents’ (14% of young artists), mostly without a record label, seem to benefit from the use of social media while exploiting synergies around live music. All artists in the remaining groups ‘Question Marks’ and ‘Hobbyists’ experience low to very low performance on all platforms. This study shows that configuration theory can provide detailed insight into viable and unviablemarketing strategies. In particular, it shows that the globally decliningmusic CD platform can still be very important for specific artists that exploit synergies between live performances, on-site CD sales and social media fan relationship management. The implications for marketing theory and young music artists are discussed. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Configuration theory; Digital age; E-commerce; Illegal downloading; Music artist",""

This paper seeks to identify the implementation challenges and evaluate alternative organisational orientations that may provide solutions. We aimed to reconcile theory with current practice by integrating the extant literature with data from three focus groups involving 27 senior marketing executives. The managerial discussions identified additional challenges to those previously discussed in the literature, which appear to result from SM’s unique characteristics. These include: interactivity, the integration of communication into distribution channels, collaborative media and information collection. Using both broad orientation models (market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation) and a specific digital orientation (e-marketing orientation), guidelines and research propositions for effective implementation are put forward. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","e-marketing orientation; entrepreneurial orientation; implementation; market orientation; social media",""

The research questions are thus the following: what is the impact of culture on the consumer relationship with brands considered as nostalgic? In which cases are these relationships positive, and in which cases are they negative? To answer these questions, a longitudinal data collection was conducted, consisting of interviewing the same sample of respondents three times, at more or less one-year intervals. The results were analysed taking into account three dimensions of culture: time, place and social aspects. In the time-based approach, brands are associated with traditional celebrations and rites of passage. Thus, they give rise to ‘traditional purchase’ and consumer loyalty. In the place-based approach, brands evoke original authenticity and myths. They offer protection to reduce perceived risks and therefore facilitate consumers’ trust. In the social approach, brands are associated with symbolic icons and attract communities of fans. Finally, this article shows that culture involves sweeter rather than bitter nostalgic brand relationships. This article brings to light four cases when the consumer cultural environment may induce a rejection of the nostalgic brand: (1) the ‘corrupted’ brand; (2) the ‘immoral’ brand; (3) the ‘precarious’ brand; and (4) the ‘stereotypical’ brand. It shows that only one case – the ‘corrupted’ brand – may be particularly prejudicial due to its unwelcome role in History. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Bittersweet memories; Brands considered as nostalgic; Collective memory; Culture; Longitudinal approach; Nostalgia",""

We focus on four main themes – social exclusion, vulnerability, pleasure and contentment – that capture some of the associations that contemporary understandings have made with poverty. For each theme, we consider the portrayals of poverty from the perspective of key agents (such as marketers, media, politicians) and then relate this to more emic representations of poverty by drawing on a range of contemporary poverty alleviating projects from around the world. We conclude with a set of guidelines for relevant stakeholders to bear in mind when elaborating their representations of poverty. These guidelines may act as a platform to transform marginalising representations of poverty into more empowering representations. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer culture; poverty; representation; transformative consumer research",""

Branding in SMEs is a growing area of academic interest, although the majority of studies have been based in the manufacturing sector. This study seeks to develop a framework of the characteristics, processes and dynamics of SME retailers. A qualitative research study was carried out with SME owner managers (OMs) over a period of 15 months. The findings extend the understanding of branding in SMEs in a number of ways. Firstly, it is found that SME retailers take a cautious approach to brand management, seeking to build loyalty, networks and relationships. Secondly, the holistic nature of SME retail branding presents a challenge to OMs who are resource-constrained. Thirdly, the soft, colloquial and intuitive approaches to brand equity appraisal are evident. Brand marketing is focused on word of mouth, which has implications for how OMs operationalise the brand around store experiences. Finally, the influence of the OM on branding decisions is clear. The key findings are discussed in relation to the retail context of the study, the centricity of the OMs in SME branding and entrepreneurial brand management. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Owner manager; Retail branding; SME brand management; SME marketing",""

Employing a recent scale of consumer’s ‘felt responsibility’ for sustainable consumption, we begin with the results of an empirical study intended to determine how CRSC relates to the established sustainable consumption attitude–behaviour gap. Guided by the insight gained from these results, we proceed with exploring a broader, multidimensional conceptualisation of CRSC by synthesising research from a variety of domains and perspectives. Our hope is that this exploration will inspire additional dialogue about the nature of CRSC, as well as enable development of a more refined scale to enable subsequent research. We believe that this, in turn, will promote future research and inform practice as our collective understanding of this important consumer construct continues to evolve. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer responsibility; responsibility; sustainability; sustainable consumption",""

It examines the organisation of sales interaction by pursuing the question of how and when market participants, vendors and customers alike, embed offers and requests for price information within their interaction. The analysis suggests that pricing is deployed as a technique to manage the ‘floor’ and the interaction at the stall. For example, offers for items are being tailored to customers’ display of interest and commitment to particular items, and requests for price information are deployed in ways that challenge anticipated offers, that is, offers that are about to be made by a vendor.

It was found that the customer and salesperson take on very distinct roles in the co-creative interaction, which is driven by characteristics previously unidentified in the context of value co-creation, such as a commitment to achieving common goals, establishing equitable dialogue and sharing interests. Examination of the value dimensions co-created found that reciprocal value realisation is not limited to business-to-business (B2B) contexts, as the involved parties create mutual episode value in discrete transactions, and mutual episode and relationship value in relational exchanges. © 2014, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","buyer–seller interaction; customer value; qualitative exploratory research; relationship marketing; value co-creation",""

Despite the fact that flying can be more damaging than any other activity that an individual can undertake, many otherwise green consumers still choose to fly, offering an opportunity to elicit narratives about the differences between their attitudes and behaviours. Qualitative interview data were gathered from self-selected green consumers and set within a cognitive dissonance analytical framework. Four strategies were uncovered: not changing travel behaviour (but offering justifications related to travel product, travel context or personal identity); reducing or restricting flights; changing other behaviours to compensate for flying; and stopping flying. This analysis furthers research on green consumer rationales for (un)sustainable behaviours and suggests several avenues for sustainable marketing management. © 2015 The Author(s).

This sacrifice is done out of necessity, reinforcing traditional gender inequalities in the home. However, there is also evidence that women take pride in their coping, developing new competencies and maintaining control over meal provision and thus the wider patterning of family life.

Although renting is becoming increasingly popular, little is known about the phenomenon as practised between peers. P2P renting is a form of non-ownership access that enables renters to temporarily access goods, but also provides those that rent the ability to temporarily dispose of their possessions. Theoretically driven thematic analysis identifies that P2P renting is characterised as a self-service exchange with extensive co-creation and a balanced market-mediated exchange involving short-term intermittent transactions driven by a desire for community, inspired by political consumerism. However, fear of negative reciprocity, the high-involvement nature of the transaction, limited access to products and the inflexible nature of P2P rental sites impede the practice. Having a better understanding of current attitudes towards P2P renting may help with the design of future online P2P systems. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","collaborative consumption; peer-to-peer renting; temporary acquisition; temporary disposition",""

A framework is proposed that offers researchers an approach for applying concepts related to family risk to various consumption-related problems and issues. This framework constitutes a starting point that can be developed and expanded to facilitate a deeper understanding of the internal and external forces that influence families and their well-being, and the role consumption plays therein.

This framework integrates the study of how emotional appeals are communicated with how they are experienced during decision-making; complementing current theorising by offering a framework for experimental testing of the delayed, longitudinal effects of social marketing campaigns.

However, our premise is that this assumption is often misguided. We argue that celebrities who court scandal sometimes find that the media coverage it precipitates – especially when the spun narrative is compelling – can significantly increase their brand value. To support our assertion, we begin by reviewing the literature on celebrity scandal. Following this, we illustrate how the creation of a scandalous narrative can fuel a celebrity career. To do so, we investigate the colourful career of the comedian-cum-revolutionary, Russell Brand. We conclude that, when combined, the 3Cs of his scandalous narrative – crafting, capering and commodifying – present, in combination, a viable means of gaining entry into the upper echelons of celebritydom. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand; celebrity; narrative; scandal",""

In this conceptual paper we demonstrate the rise of inconspicuous consumption via a wide-ranging synthesis of the literature. We attribute this rise to the signalling ability of traditional luxury goods being diluted, a preference for not standing out as ostentatious during times of economic hardship, and an increased desire for sophistication and subtlety in design in order to further distinguish oneself for a narrow group of peers. We decouple the constructs of luxury and conspicuousness, which allows us to reconceptualise the signalling quality of brands and the construct of luxury. This also has implications for understanding consumer behaviour practices such as counterfeiting and suggests that consumption trends in emerging markets may take a different path from the past. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","branding; conspicuous consumption; inconspicuous consumption; luxury",""

Results also show that consumer forgiveness mediates the effect of brand transgression severity, firm response, and consumer awareness on repurchase intentions.

Their commentary claims that power-base studies (1) suffer from ‘weak results’ and lack ‘psychometrically sound’ measures, (2) provide an inadequate ‘categorising [of] power sources’, (3) suffer from a ‘questionable’ use of an interpersonal theory of power in ‘inter-organisational or B2B situations’, (4) suffer from a ‘misreporting’ of the original French and Raven article and (5) are deficient because they ground channels research on a 1959 theory article that was, itself, ‘much less rigorous in its arguments than would be expected’, with ‘uneven support’ from the article’s citations. The five criticisms of the power-base approach seem to imply that, throughout the four-plus decades of power-base research, marketing’s scholarship has been misguided.

This article aims at questioning this bias by studying the linguistic and practical circumstances under which marketing knowledge and discourse can become performative. It proposes to do so through a detailed study of Myriam, a highly famous French teaser advertisement where a pretty young woman in a bikini standing on a beach promises: ‘On September 2, I remove the top’, and then, on September 2, now topless, declares: ‘On September 4, I remove the bottom’. The careful analysis of this case shows that the performativity of marketing concepts and messages rests on a prodigious combination of words and objects, co-creation schemes and curiosity. © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","advertising; marketing; performation; performativity; promises; teasing",""

Using the soft-laddering interviewing technique, we initially explore FQ attributes. Subsequently, we design and conduct two surveys to test the FQ measure. The final scale contains 18 items in four dimensions: transparency, associations, moderations and process. The FQ scale demonstrates good psychometric properties, passing all reliability and validity tests. The scale extends existing research on fairness and provides a new conceptualisation of FQ. Marketers are encouraged to manage their FQ systematically to stimulate social and ethical behaviour. We present theoretical and managerial implications, with future research directions. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","conceptual framework; ethics; fairness; metric; quality; scale development",""

In fact, marketing has been deeply implicated in the constitution of celebrity since the dawn of Western consumer culture in the early part of the twentieth century. In the era of media convergence, there is a pressing need for researchers in marketing to re-evaluate the meta-assumptions around celebrity and its relation to marketing in the light of marketing’s culturally constitutive role. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","branding; celebrity; convergence; endorsement; social media",""

Market-generated materials covering Bowie’s fifty year career were analysed using structuration theory. Our findings indicate that Bowie’s control of his human brand was increasingly determined by differing agents within the market. We conclude that a celebrity’s human brand is as much a creation of the market, as it is the celebrity’s. Yet unlike the celebrity, their character’s ongoing popularity reflects not only a moment in time but also an ability to adapt to differing times. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","branding; celebrity; David Bowie; human branding; structuration",""

However, jointly pursuing an internal and external customer focus has been argued to be both synergistic and contradictory. Using cluster analysis, this paper develops a typology on the basis of employees’ perceptions of their organisation’s joint pursuit of internal and external customer orientation. This allows an examination of the joint implications of these strategic postures on organisational processes, including information generation, information dissemination, training, communication and human resource practices. The results suggest that employees have the most positive perceptions of organisational processes when they perceive the organisation pursues a strong internal orientation, followed by those organisations that are jointly strong on internal and external customer orientation. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","cluster analysis; external customer orientation; internal customer orientation; internal marketing; typology",""

A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight generation and use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed.

However, the extant literature is almost exclusively focused on differences between cultures at each end of the diversity spectrum (most commonly East vs. West). Contemporary researchers have observed that existing studies fail to acknowledge the substantially greater levels of intra-cluster variation that exist. A cultural cluster is a group of countries that reflect values, attitudes and beliefs stemming from a common cultural ancestry. This seems surprising given the anecdotal evidence and stereotypes that are portrayed in popular culture, media and art. One area where intra-cluster variation may be evident is consumer complaint behaviour and in particular within the Anglo-cultural cluster in countries. A cultural cluster is a group of countries that reflect values, attitudes and beliefs stemming from a common cultural ancestry. The aim of this study is therefore to explore and elucidate the nature of differences in consumer complaint behaviour between cultures traditionally conceived and operationalised as identical.

Particular interest is directed towards what such local epistemic considerations might imply for our scholarly understanding of how economic theories and models shape markets. Our exploration depicts an indigenous epistemology characterised by a number of interrelated tensions (market research as: description vs. recommendation; art vs. science; information vs. source of inspiration; and distance vs. engagement).

By ontologically as well as epistemologically adopting a performative approach where brands are seen as loose performative assemblages, the present article suggests instead that the brand regeneration process is truly processual, multiple and political. A specific brand regeneration process should be seen as relationally spatial and as only one of several possible ‘realities’. The argument is based on an analysis of a 5-year-long case study of the branding of Stockholm, inspired by a Latourian hybrid fieldwork approach. Based on the analysis, the novel concept ‘brand transformation’ is suggested to frame the characteristics and complexities of the brand regeneration process. © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","assemblage; brand regeneration; brand transformation; multiple; performativity; political; processual; relational space",""

Based on an online survey (n = 888), a series of regressions of various benefits on posting behaviour supports the usability of the proposed taxonomy. In particular, social benefits had the strongest effect on consumers’ posting behaviour across all communities, while the effects of functional, altruistic and sharing benefits varied in significance and direction of influence when accounting for the different community characteristics.

It follows the market studies programme to examine a problem that puzzles researchers in finance: Why do lay-investors remain in the market despite their poor returns? Using a qualitative study of lay-investors in the United Kingdom, it considers the devices, ‘agencements’ and discourses that structure investment behaviour. It uses Foucault’s writing on governance under neo-liberalism to suggest that investors are constituted as self-entrepreneurs, sustained by antagonism to professional investors, heterodox market beliefs and a consumer allegiance to investment styles and products. Marketing knowledge is inscribed in market devices and structures market relations. Finally, it suggests that self-discipline and confession are normalising technologies that help investors cope with difficulties and losses in the market.

It is assumed that the quality gap would boost consumer willingness to pay a price premium for national brands over private labels. Differing from this conventional approach, the current study focuses on the perceived authenticity gap between national brands and private labels, to explore whether and how this factor influences the effect of marketing and manufacturing variables on willingness to pay. This relationship is relevant in milieus where consumers might take brand authenticity rather than quality perceptions to guide their brand evaluations. The current study finds that the perceived authenticity gap mediates the effect of only some particular conventional marketing tools on willingness to pay. The study suggests that national brand managers should take the presence of private labels in the national markets as an opportunity to exploit the dynamics of authenticity evaluations, rather than as a threat. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Marketing mix effects; National brand; Perceived authenticity; Private label; Quality gap; Willingness to pay",""

We question self-sustained brand meaning structures causing structural silence by showing that the influence of theoretically informed brand discourse constructs silence regarding issues of sustainability in the fashion market. Results from a case study of Swedish fashion companies’ communication of their efforts in the sustainability domain as part of their brand management practice are analysed as representing different marketing approaches. The findings elucidate that we can understand silence on issues of sustainability in the fashion market as a separation of norm production and economic exchange that reflects basic assumptions about competition and the meaning of branding in dominant theoretical marketing approaches. © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand governance; construction of eco-fashion consumption; market practice; silence on issues of sustainability",""

We contrast the traditional numeric approach to transparency, which involves auditing and third-party certifications; with an alternative approach that we call narrative transparency. Central to narrative transparency is an emphasis on stake-holder dialogue and an invitation to stake-holders to play the role of auditor. This article illustrates how alternative marketing organisations engage in rhetorical tactics central to a narrative approach, to communicate transparency to their stakeholders. These rhetorical tactics include persona, allegory, consumer sovereignty and enlightenment. Community supported agriculture programmes from across the United States are the context for this study. Findings enrich discussions about best practices for transparency and communications. The central contribution is identification of a narrative approach to transparency, the rhetorical techniques such an approach employs, and an explanation of why an alternative approach to transparency reporting emerges. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","audit society; community supported agriculture; marketing communications; narrative; rhetoric; transparency",""

The case provides detailed support for the idea that marketing (and other) theories help perform or bring into existence that which they purport to describe. It also shows how such theories are hybridised and streamlined in the iterative battleground of a creative process, framed by the need to create plausible consumption and competitive relations. The main contribution of this article is to show how the performative power of marketing knowledge is ultimately determined not by its ‘truth value’, but by its ability to produce compelling stories that stabilise the reflexive relationships between product attributes, consumer profiles and competitive relations. © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","advertising planning; ethnography; market creation; performativity; positioning",""

However, place marketing does not typically incorporate all elements of the traditional 7 Ps, focusing far too often on just one of these – promotion. Besides this rather myopic approach, place marketing suffers from an overly strategic view of the world that ignores the meaning and lived experience of places to individuals, especially residents. The purpose of this article is twofold – first, we investigate the impact of litter on place attitudes. Litter is a common, but negative, element of place, which is intimately connected to the lived experience of a place but typically far removed from the positive promotional activity favoured by place marketing efforts and the study thereof. In this sense, the article reframes place marketing from a strategic to a micro-marketing endeavour. We found that exposing respondents to litter significantly lowers their place attitudes. Our second contribution is to demonstrate the relevance of classic marketing research approaches, such as attitudinal measures, to investigate litter and its impact on place evaluations, through quasi-experimental design (with 662 respondents). Through this, we extend the range of theory and method applied in place marketing – away from controllable promotional endeavours investigated through case-studies to a more holistic and robust interpretation of place marketing, which has a measurable impact upon the places where people live and visit. © 2015, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand attitude; Litter; Place branding; Place marketing; Quasi-experiment; Semantic differentials",""

Despite this, the factors that facilitate or inhibit parents’ capacity to socialise fruit and vegetable consumption into their children’s daily diets remain poorly defined. Thirty-eight semi-structured interviews with residents, allied healthcare professionals, community leaders, community programme leaders and a local government leader living or working in two low socioeconomic suburbs were consequently conducted to ascertain factors exogenous and endogenous to the family unit that shaped parental food socialisation practices. Budgetary and time constraints emerged as exogenous factors that constrained fruit and vegetable socialisation. Constraining effects were also found for a range of endogenous factors, including commensal experiences, children’s food fussiness and the feeding styles employed by parents. As such, while many caregivers may wish to socialise fruit and vegetable consumption into their children’s daily diets, their capacity to do so is often inhibited by factors beyond their volitional control. Failure to take heed of these factors could therefore result in the development of social marketing campaigns that are ineffective at best or give rise to unintentionally harmful outcomes at worst. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","children; family; fruit and vegetable consumption; socialisation",""

This is conceptualised as a movement from traditional, two-dimensional outdoor advertising, through three dimensional and four dimensional, towards a more overt multimodal perspective. The paper highlights a series of interesting ontological shifts relating the visual, embodied and performative function of such advertising signs, whereby product marketing begins to increasingly incorporate place, encompassing a sophisticated use of ‘spatiality’ (e.g. buildings and spaces) as well as ‘temporality’ (e.g. movement and mapping) as integral elements of communications strategy. With emerging technology, we begin to observe an emphasis towards ‘interactive out-of-home experience’ (e.g. through locative and social media). This paper contributes to the debate in arguing that these aspects (in isolation or in combination) have the potential to change the relationship(s) between outdoor advertising, the urban environment and its people, with potentially very significant implications not only for marketing activity, but also our relationships with the towns and cities we inhabit. The paper concludes by introducing three tendencies – towards spectacle, portal and fluid space – as key constituents of present and future forms of outdoor advertising. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","billboards; built environment; outdoor advertising; place; place marketing",""

Despite the considerable research available on linking brand associations to employer brand attractiveness, research on how to become an employer of choice is limited. This article addresses the research gap by investigating employer brand associations that predict status as an employer first-choice brand (FCBe), and by determining how these associations are transferred into preference. Research was based on university students’ evaluations of employer brand associations and identification of their FCBe. Results indicate that work content and work culture of employer brand associations are drivers of being an FCBe, with no support found for effects of salary, advancement opportunities, location or organisational reputation. Importantly, employer brand emotions emerged as a full mediator in the model, indicating that for an FCBe, work content and work culture need to be linked to emotions. These results suggest that only if employer brand associations lead to positive employer brand emotions can an FCBe be established. This study contributes to the literature by being the first to investigate drivers of employer first-choice brand, and to identify employer brand emotions as essential for establishing an FCBe. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","emotion; employer branding; employer of choice; first-choice brand; preference; structural equation modelling",""

We show that a conduit, as an assemblage of investments and practices among interested actors, requires and allows for the further economisation and calculation of waste management. Conduits shape business-to-business exchanges and relationships, deriving demand across domains of exchange and managing risks to the continuation of industrial processes. They resist singular stewardship, instead allowing multiple actors to recognise their interdependence and contest the development of facilities and services.

But these new market devices do not just exploit technological innovations. They are constructed around a revolutionary new mask of the consumer. They treat consumers not as fixed individuals but as dividualised consumers – that is to say, collections of data that can be exposed, dissected and segmented into new marketable groups. After sketching out how marketing devices and theories have worked to define new marketplace behaviours, the paper turns to Deleuze’s explanation of control societies to consider the social implications of these new marketing techniques within societies that are increasingly mediated through networked relationships. © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","ad-exchanges; ad-networks; Deleuze; dividual; online marketing",""

Drawing on institutional theory and an interpretive investigation of a UK Channel 4 television documentary, namely Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s Fish Fight, we explore a relatively widespread phenomenon, the celebrity campaign. We consider how such campaigns galvanise mainstream malcontent by creating mythic plots, personalising adversaries and framing issues to encourage articulation of malcontent. Although malcontent may be fleeting, we argue that this can set in motion institutional change towards sustainable production and consumption. Celebrity campaigns demonstrate the dynamic and interrelated character of consumer and industry groups in a way that might inform other change efforts. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","activism; celebrity; institutional entrepreneurship; institutional theory; sustainability; mainstream consumers",""

Results from 236 individuals with different income levels show that extension attitude is positively related to purchase intention both directly and indirectly, via the perceived value of the extension; the latter is more strongly correlated than extension attitude to consumers’ purchase intention. Brand attitude is also positively associated with perceived value. Overall, perceived value partially mediates the relationships of brand attitude and of extension attitude with purchase intention. The product category affects the strength of some of the relationships in the model, including the role of fit. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","luxury brand; mediating variable; perceived value; purchase intention; SEM-PLS; vertical brand extension",""

Less attention has been given to how and why customers disengage from their relationships, and the potential interplay between engagement and disengagement has not yet been explored within the marketing literature. This study presents the findings from a qualitative exploration of the concept of customer disengagement, its initiating triggers, nature and the process by which it unfolds within functional/utilitarian (F/U) and participative/co-creative services (P/C). Rather than being mutually exclusive, it finds that engagement and disengagement are highly connected and that prior levels of engagement significantly influenced customers’ subsequent propensities to disengage. Specifically, customers’ propensity towards disengagement was higher within services considered F/U in nature and lower within services of a more P/C nature. In addition, the extent to which customers disengaged from their relationship was strongly determined by their prior levels of engagement with weak engagement for F/U services and strong engagement for P/C services. Relationships in the F/U category were subsequently transactional and volatile when compared to relationships within the P/C category that were comparatively emotionally bonded and enduring. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","co-creation; customer disengagement; customer engagement; functional; participative; relationship ending; service relationships; services; utilitarian",""

Two phases of qualitative inquiry in Australia, comprising 30 and 20 semi-structured interviews, respectively, examined the role of competition in young adults’ decision to adopt and maintain help-seeking for mental ill-health. The findings from thematic analysis suggest that competition operates at both the behavioural and goal level to influence consumers’ decision to perform behaviour and that the types of competition in operation may vary from the adoption to the maintenance of behaviour. The findings are integrated into a framework that social marketers could employ to identify, analyse and address competition. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","competition; Goal Systems Theory; help-seeking; mental health; social marketing",""

By focusing on the voice of the tourist and their consumer experience, we develop an understanding of youth behaviours and motivations associated with dark tourism and the effect of social influences in forming narratives. This empirical study comprises 20 interviews with young American dark tourist site visitors, 11 of whom were re-interviewed. The emic insights suggest dark tourism experiences can be used to (re)affirm individual roles, enhance feelings of national identity and co-create a self as well as a national identity. An etic conceptual model is proposed that is specifically designed for dark tourism sites. It provides a novel explanation of national identity co-creation and recognises the relationship between tourist motivation, experience and co-creation. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","co-creation; dark tourism; narratives; national identity; youth",""

This relatively new genre, typified by The Only Way Is Essex, blends fiction with fact and constitutes a new, playful and interactive iteration of the broader category of reality television. We identify three culturally productive models that create new celebrity discourses and establish a theoretical underpinning for the role of structured reality in the celebritisation process; tournaments of value, spectacle and transformative performances. Whilst not exclusive to structured reality television, these models are particularly effective at explaining how celebrities are interactively understood in an increasingly mediatised marketplace. We contribute a model which proposes that celebritisation in structured reality is a homologising process through which celebrity meaning is legitimised. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","celebritisation; consumer culture; production of culture; structured reality",""

This study examines this process specifically in relation to the role of socialisation agents. It questions whether parents/guardians, who have traditionally been acknowledged as the primary socialisation agents, retain this influence in an era of changing family structures. Leisure-travel provides the context for review with children aged 5–7 the research population. Findings confirm parental influence to be pivotal across different family structures, but note that, in some structures and circumstances, this influence is shared, particularly with grandparents and the leisure industry. Future research opportunities include the need to examine this shared role further, to investigate leisure industry awareness and response to their influence and to investigate further the implications of social class and ethnicity upon the findings. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","children; consumer socialisation; family; grandparents; qualitative",""

It also considers the role which entrepreneurial marketing plays in helping to create the celebrity artist aura. The artist Thomas Kinkade is used to illustrate how this occurs in practice. Here, authenticity and nostalgia dimensions are also influential factors. Underpinning these relationships are the roles played out by the media, including communication of celebrity artist identity, and the catalysing of its commodification within the celebrity artist brandscape. An enduring celebrity brand results due to the market creation activities of the celebrity artist. A conceptual model is developed which synthesises the factors behind the production and consumption of the celebrity artist which can stimulate further research.; This paper provides innovative insight into the world of the celebrity artist by interrogating the market making and shaping devices behind successful production and consumption practices. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","aura; authenticity; celebrity artist; nostalgia; owner/manager",""

However, the empirical literature surrounding consumer responses to such practices features many contradictions concerning their impact. As a result, many businesses are uncertain about the extent to which they should commit resources to these activities to influence a positive response from consumers. Therefore, this paper seeks to address this gap by exploring consumers’ awareness of varying levels of corporate citizenship activities and assessing their moral responses to such efforts. Using a combination of qualitative methods and projective techniques with a broad cross-section of 20 consumers, the results help to shed light on the impact of corporate citizenship activities upon moral recognition, consumer decision-making and choice. © 2014, The Author(s).

Two working-class female celebrities, Cheryl Cole and Katie Price, provide our focus, and we draw on an analysis of articles in the popular press, celebrity autobiographies and qualitative data collected with 16- to 18-year-olds. We find that class-infused celebrity identity myths (‘celebrity chav’) are constructed in terms of glamour, allure and charisma but also vulgarity, repulsion and ordinariness. Young consumers interpret these myths based on judgements of taste, morality, connection and worthiness and utilise them in order to support the identity goals of distinction, affirmation, belonging and enhancement. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","celebrity; chav; identity; myths; social class; youth",""

This study makes two contributions to this evolving field. First, it explores the interrelations of the psychological contract with sales performance, voluntary turnover and organisational advocacy of ISCs, which have hitherto been largely unexplored. Second, it examines differences between high- and low-performing sales contractors on these linkages, due to findings in the literature that a small number of sales contractors often achieve a majority of sales. Based on survey data as well as 7 years of contractor-level data related to sales performance and voluntary turnover (n = 189), results indicate that psychological contract fulfilment and perceived dependency are important determinants of subsequent sales performance, voluntary turnover and organisational advocacy, with significant differences reported between high- and low-performing ISCs. A notable finding pertinent for sales managers responsible for managing ISCs is that high-performing sales contractors are motivated by psychological contract fulfilment and a low perception of dependency, while low-performing sales contractors are more likely to act as advocates for the firm due to perceived dependency, but may concurrently engage in organisational advocacy as a means to leave the firm. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Dependency; Psychological contracts; Sales management; Sales performance; Voluntary turnover",""

First, today social transformations and conceptual sophistications require a revised vocabulary to provide adequate interpretive lenses. Second, extant work has mostly addressed the subjective level of ethnic identity projects but left untended the meso/macro forces affecting ethnicity (de)construction and personal/collective well-being.

Today, the moral discourse of what we should and should not eat is perhaps stronger than ever, and it informs consumers, researchers and policy-makers about what we all should consume, research and regulate. We propose four types of moralities, underlying sets of moral assumptions, that orient the contemporary discourses of food and health: the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ nature of food items, the virtue of self-control and moderation, the management of body size and the actions of market agents. We demonstrate how these moralities influence consumer behaviour as well as transformative research of food and health and develop a critical discussion of the impact of the underlying morality in each domain. We conclude by providing a few guidelines for changes in research questions, designs and methodologies for future research and call for a general reflection on the consequences of the uncovered moralities in research on food and health towards an inclusive view of food well-being. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","food; governmentality; health; life quality; morality",""

A review of the literature indicates that the form, focus, source and context of the communication may negatively impact on the analyst’s ability to identify sentiment polarity and emotional state. Likewise, the selection of analytical tool, the creation of codes, and the classification of the data, adversely affect the researcher’s ability to accurately assess the sentiment expressed in a social media conversation.

Brands can be seen as a heuristic device, encapsulating a series of values that enable the consumer to make quick and efficient choices. More recently, the notion of a political brand and the rhetoric of branding have been widely adopted by many political parties as they seek to differentiate themselves, and this has led to an emerging interest in the idea of the political brand. Therefore, this paper examines the UK Conservative Party brand under David Cameron’s leadership and examines the applicability of Kapferer’s brand identity prism to political branding. This paper extends and operationalises the brand identity prism into a ‘political brand identity network’ which identifies the inter-relatedness of the components of the corporate political brand and the candidate political brand. Crucial for practitioners, this model can demonstrate how the brand is presented and communicated to the electorate and serves as a useful mechanism to identify consistency within the corporate and candidate political brands. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand identity prism; British politics; political branding; political marketing; UK Conservative Party",""

Our narrative subsequently engages with the rise of social marketing (1960s-) and finally TCR (2006-). We move beyond calls for an appreciation of paradigm plurality to encourage TCR scholars to adopt a multiple paradigmatic approach as part of a three-pronged strategy that encompasses an initial ‘provisional moral agnosticism’. As part of this stance, we argue that scholars should value the insights provided by multiple paradigms, turning each paradigmatic lens sequentially on to the issue of the relationship between marketing, development and consumer well-being.

The relatively ponderous responses of the United States and Europe to recent global conditions, and the democratic uprisings in Arabic states, further represent a glaring contrast. While the marketing literature is rich in the particulars of specific management issues in the China market, no analysis from the discipline has attempted to provide a broad, distinctly marketing contribution to the China phenomenon. Choice is a fundamental construct underpinning theories of politics, economics and marketing, though it is notably absent from Chinese politics. The changing relationship between markets, business and government reveals a question that is clearly important to marketers, and China is a challenging boundary case for marketing management. © 2014, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","China; marketing management; monopoly; political marketing",""

The purpose of this study is to gain insights into the key determinants driving future intentions of travel consumers to participate in group-based travel to major events. An integrated theoretical model is empirically tested with 424 travel consumers who have had prior experience travelling in a group to a major event. The results substantiate the model showing that customer value perceptions of a past group-travel consumption experience conceptualised with multiple benefit dimensions has the largest relative effect on future intentions to engage in group-travel behaviour to major events, followed by attitude towards the host destination and enduring event involvement. The results provide managers with holistic insights into components that are used as the basis upon which group-travel consumers develop their choice behaviour which can be used to effectively cultivate more attendees to major events. © 2015, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Attitude towards the host destination; Customer experience; Customer-perceived value; Enduring involvement; Group-travel behaviour; Major events; Tourism marketing",""

For the purposes of this paper, we have adopted the UK term Self Check-Out Tills (SCOT), also known as ‘self-service registers’ in other countries, to describe this form of self-service in retail stores). The study uses qualitative and quantitative data collected from users of retail SCOT. Initial exploratory factor analysis of 232 SCOT users revealed significant differences in learning styles. Three categories emerged: ‘regular reassurance’, ‘motivated practice’ and ‘cautious discovery’. Customers adopting different learning styles varied in their perceptions of ability and enjoyment with SCOT, and in their capability of helping other customers with SCOT. The demographic make-up of customers adopting the different learning styles was also shown to vary. Previously, little has been done to identify the specific training needs of working customers.

Although artists’ branding initiatives are considered relevant to branding and marketing theory, identifying how these are constructed and managed and identity negotiated through this process is an area that needs further development. This research therefore uses a multi-stakeholder approach to branding theory to examine contemporary artists’ careers to understand how value is added to their ‘product’. Qualitative analysis of artists’ biographies and career histories in the London art market illustrates how value is co-constructed through relationships in a temporal manner that must be strategically managed. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","art market; artists; biographical methods; brand narrative; branding; stakeholder",""

Our conceptual model incorporates materialism, environmental concern, social consumption motivation, pro-environmental self-identity and sustainable consumption behaviours. This paper contributes to knowledge by examining the mediating role of pro-environmental self-identity to more fully explain consumers’ (non)sustainable consumption behaviour. An international online panel survey was employed in the UK (n = 1037) and China (n = 1025). Findings show that pro-environmental self-identity partially or fully mediates the relationships between materialism, environmental concern, social consumption motivation and sustainable consumption behaviours. Important cultural differences also emerged, for example, the positive effect of materialism on Chinese consumer’s sustainable consumption, which is contrary to Western evidence. We suggest bolder, culturally informed and more reflexive marketing strategies are needed to significantly advance sustainable consumption, thus effectively helping to redress the crisis facing our planet. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","East–West cultures; environmental concern; materialism and social consumption motivation; pro-environmental self-identity; sustainability marketing; sustainable consumption",""

These campaigns are increasingly extreme spectacles of celebrity-suffering that concentrate public attention on the spectacle image itself rather than on the charities these spectacles espouse. Drawing upon Guy Debord’s critique of spectacle and celebrity in The Society of the Spectacle, we contend that the phenomenon of celebrity fundraising in this context is interesting not only because of its voyeuristic dimensions (as argued by a number of scholars on celebrity humanitarianism) but also because it raises issues about how the use of highly visual and visceral images of celebrities’ suffering has banalised the charitable causes to which they lend their names, often erasing them altogether. Celebrities’ suffering in this context is framed by the media both as mega-spectacles of entertainment and as lavishly staged journeys of heroism and suffering set apart from the material and social abundance celebrities represent. We demonstrate using a range of empirical sources from news reports and live TV coverage that when celebrities submit to these extreme journeys of physical suffering, it raises new questions about the moral limits of the marketisation of emotion and the commodification of the charitable journey itself. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","celebrity; charity; Comic Relief; Guy Debord; hero; spectacle",""

We find that families and caregivers at times construct family together, including the caregiver as a family member, while at other times, consumers construct family in ways that exclude the caregiver. Through our exploration of these various ways of constructing family, we offer three theoretical contributions. First, we challenge traditional distinctions between consumers and producers and highlight the fluid, contextualised nature of family by demonstrating that some contemporary constructions of family include paid service providers. Second, we elucidate the ways in which the provision and consumption of a service, everyday care, produces a liminal position for some service providers. Finally, we develop a broader understanding of the ways in which performances of family protect cultural values. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","caregiving; childcare; elder care; elderly consumers; family; liminality",""

The purpose of this study was to analyse potential adopters’ considerations concerning an innovation that is targeted at intense negative emotions. Choosing a case-study strategy enabled us to focus on extremely negative emotions (related to death) and the acceptance of a radical innovation (a memorial stone made of glass). In this study, we applied a longitudinal mixed-methods approach. Data were collected via interviews with consumers (357 respondents), the entrepreneur and her employee. Findings show that an emotionally sensitive radical innovation evokes more intense emotions and emotional ambivalence among consumers. Its acceptance also seems to depend on the age and gender of the customers and requires cultural change. A lengthy adoption process seems to be characteristic of emotionally intensive innovation. This study has implications for managers facing the challenge of creating new markets for a radical innovation that involves extreme emotions on the part of consumers.

Computer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) data gathered from 500 grocery shoppers are used. The findings show that shoppers who are prone to using non-monetary in-store promotions seek exploration, entertainment and value expression benefits, in common with shoppers who are prone to monetary promotions. Both monetary and non-monetary promotion-prone shoppers feel financially constrained. In addition, non-monetary promotion-prone shoppers enjoy gambling and other hedonic outcomes. The managerial implications of our research findings are that many monetary sales promotion-prone shoppers may be attracted by the benefits provided by non-monetary promotions.

Trying to appeal to such religious segments, companies differentiate food products by adding religious labels (e.g. kosher or halal) to packaging. But while this makes the products more attractive to the consumers of the focal religion, adding a religious label may also impact the brand evaluation by consumers with no religious beliefs or a different religious orientation. Drawing upon social identity theory to explain the psychological basis of inter-group discrimination, and taking account of information integration theory to analyse how religious labels affect product and brand evaluations, this article aims to assess the spillover effects between religion and brand among consumers who are not part of the religious communities addressed by these labels. The findings indicate that the perception of religious labels on food packaging is influenced by the attitudes towards the religion and the brand, while the relative importance of both antecedents is dependent upon several consumer characteristics. The theoretical and managerial implications of our findings, the limitations of our work and directions for future research are discussed. © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","cosmopolitanism; packaging; religious labels; spillover",""

Our findings differ from consumer research to date in that rather than furthering discussion of family structure or furthering discussion on family identity we suggest a new focus is the actual building of intimate family bonds and relationships – the ‘doing’ of family or ‘familying’ – with the context of the Lourdes pilgrimage offering consumers a unique setting comprising faith, fun and family. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","ethnography; family; pilgrimage; ‘doing family’",""

The findings show that while technological change and market competition negatively influence the credibility of the strategy, market attractiveness has a positive influence upon the viability of strategy employed. Moreover, market competition has a positive influence upon the involvement of marketing managers in terms of strategy making and that the presence of an innovative culture is strongly required in executing a strategic marketing plan. In addition, the study shows that the involvement of marketing managers in strategy making, which is strongly supported by an innovative culture, generates their commitment to the strategy, which positively influences strategy viability. © 2013 © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","external environment; firm performance; marketing strategy formulation; marketing strategy implementation; viability of marketing strategy",""

Based on a sample of 535 US grocery shoppers, the model reveals that in-store price search and store deal proneness share many of the same drivers, amongst these, the value of time being the most important. The opportunity cost of time engaged in price search is explained in terms of shoppers’ financial pressures and role construction as price mavens. Price mavenism influences store deal proneness directly due to its capacity to yield the price information required to build and maintain a role identity, and indirectly through its effect on the opportunity cost of time engaged in price search. The primary implication of the research is that the relationship between time, search, and price mavenism may be best explored by viewing price knowledge, the basis for identity maintenance, as a flow rather than a stock. © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Grocery; Hedonic; Identity; Maven; Price search; Utilitarian",""

We identify competing consumer and marketer logics that underscore each tension and discuss how consumers negotiate the resulting conflicts.

Qualitative analysis of the data (and the subsequent development of the Visual Artists’ Marketing Trajectory model) suggests that the marketing orientation and activities undertaken by visual artists deviates significantly from the assumptions underpinning traditional marketing theory.

Drawing on local narratives of Santorini, Greece, we call attention to places as culturally significant and discursively produced and consumed. Local narratives provide multiple meanings constructed around the diverse and contested experiences of living and making a living in a place. Our analysis employs the metaphors of 'harsh beauty', 'service business' and 'home' to capture these perspectives. The paper has implications for the development of generative metaphors of 'place' and 'local' within place marketing and contributes to the dialogue over the continued relevance of our discipline to the public sphere. © 2014 © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","critical marketing; local people; narrative; place",""

To assist with this exploration we draw upon the decomposed theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical lens and conduct a mixed-method study that utilises both an empirical investigation as well as qualitative focus group interviews in order to delve deeper into specific reasons why individuals engage in SNS activities. Results show that a number of antecedents such as attitude, compatibility, relative advantage, complexity, normative influences and self-efficacy come into play when determining SNS usage activities. However, specific antecedents may vary according to the explicit activity under investigation. This study's main contribution involves advancing our understanding of consumer behaviour as it relates to SNS activities by examining not only antecedents to intention but also attitude, subjective norms and behavioural control. Other contributions include additional development of the SNS literature, integrating SNSs into a classical theoretical framework and providing valuable insights and implications for both practitioners and researchers alike. © 2014 © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","decomposed theory of planned behaviour; interactive marketing; internet marketing; social media; social networking sites; structural equation modelling; theory of reasoned action",""

Drawing upon the results of a novel, culture-based research procedure, this paper describes the paradoxical outcomes of an urban branding exercise in Belfast, one of the world's most infamous cities. Albeit dismissed by local worthies as a futile attempt to 'put lipstick on a gorilla', this paper argues that Belfast's branding is not only far from futile but a perversely paradoxical form of marketing that's so bad it's good. © 2013 © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Belfast; city branding; literary analysis; paradoxical marketing",""

Findings suggest that consumers purposefully interact with celebrities in a diverse range of ways and actively engage in a variety of consumer-celebrity relationships. We conceptualise a range of consumer-celebrity relationship types and demonstrate the roles that celebrities can play in providing meaning and context to consumers' identity projects.Summary statement of contribution Our research builds on contemporary understandings of celebrity meaning transfer and in particular explores consumer-driven (rather than managerial) understandings of celebrity meanings. Our findings suggest that consumers' uses of celebrities are somewhat more active and purposeful than McCracken's (1989) model and much prior research suggests. Consumers develop portfolios of celebrity relationships, or celebrityscapes (cf.

Through interviews and contextualised observational research in rural Cambodia, findings reveal that the impacts of mobile money services on marketing interactions in relation to CWB can be categorised at two distinct levels. The first-level impact is the actual physical money transfer transactions as part of the marketing exchange activities which leads to the second-level impact on the social network relationships at interpersonal, social group and cultural levels.

This research applies a simulated choice-based experiment with 196 sponsorship managers to assess their preferences for a set of criteria likely to shape their future decisions about sponsorship selection.

This research proposes a fresh time-based approach to benefit segmentation - namely, focusing on the 'when' element or when in time benefits take effect. Drawing upon a survey of UK consumers, it explains and discusses consumption motivations through examining antecedents of temporally dominated benefits in application to organic food. Specifically, the study investigates why some consumers predominantly seek present-based benefits vis-à-vis future-based benefits or vice versa in organic food purchase and consumption behaviour. Using correlation and regression analyses, the research findings establish significant associations of level of involvement, prior knowledge level, and product usage level, and some association of time orientation with the temporally emphasised consumption benefits consumers ultimately pursue. Overall, the research highlights the added contribution of a time perspective in a benefit segmentation approach which can assist marketers in understanding better and communicating more effectively with consumers through drawing up consumer profiles based on when in time their dominantly pursued benefit for an offering is perceived to take effect. © 2013 The Author(s).

Through a review of seminal articles that have shaped the field and consideration of enduring problems in power-base usage, the paper argues that the numerous studies of this topic have not produced a coherent body of either empirical or theoretical knowledge. In particular, the empirical studies have produced results, some of which are contrary to theoretical predictions, others which contradict previous findings, and an increasing number which indicate that results are significantly affected by the cultural context within which a study is conducted. A detailed reading of French and Raven's (1959) paper shows it to be less rigorous than would be expected of such a frequently cited and influential paper, but also that its application to organisational studies of power is questionable.

It finds that social media contain sets of complex interpersonal relationships in both concentric networks and in ad hoc groupings.

Advances in technology have increased the demand for a services-based economy and prompted a shift from a product-centred logic to a service-centred logic.

This paper contributes both theoretically and practically by critically examining these service loyalty scales and proposing a new multi-item scale based on Oliver's (1997) conceptualisation using a mixed-method study. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from UK retail bank customers using in-depth interviews and an interviewer-administered survey. A two-step structural equation modelling strategy was used to validate the measurement and structural models. The results provide support for a four-dimensional scale of service loyalty.

To accomplish this, the study relies on the Schwartz value theory, which is applied to front-line employees in banking.

Lovelock's (1995) supplementary services model further develops this concept by providing more specific guidelines regarding where to seek value enhancement. However, there is little empirical validation of his theoretical model across the services sector. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we assess the soundness of Lovelock's model across different service businesses by adopting a form of interaction research. Second, drawing upon findings from this process, we then develop a revised model of supplementary services. Finally, we propose an implementation framework for our revised model of supplementary services. © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","differentiation; flower of service; product augmentation; supplementary services",""

This paper presents the findings from two empirical studies that investigate the relationship between consumer innovativeness, price-prestige sensitivity, and need for emotion. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data in both studies from a sample of 668 respondents in two cities in England. The findings show that consumer innovativeness is determined by an individual's sensitivity to price and their need for emotion. While innovative consumers are sensitive in relating price to prestige, this dispositional relationship varies across products. Furthermore, the findings suggest that enjoyment, which facilitates emotional openness and receptivity, influences innovative consumers to take the emotional route, besides the price-prestige route, to the adoption of new products. These findings have a number of important implications for marketers, particularly for the success of marketing campaigns targeted at innovative consumers who find enjoyment in using new products and are prestigiously sensitive to price. © 2013 © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer innovativeness; hedonic enjoyment; mobile phones; need for emotion; price-prestige sensitivity; structural equation modelling",""

This conservative behaviour may arise, in part, because older people are more socially isolated and thus receive less social influence relating to product options. In this multi-study research, the volume of word of mouth (WOM) is used as an indicator of social influence. The WOM received by men and women falls substantially beyond age 65, indicating that a deficit in advice may be part of the explanation for conservative decision-making. To test this proposition, the duration of customer tenure of the current brand (how long the respondent has been a customer) is used as a measure of purchase deferral and, as predicted, tenure is longer when less WOM is received. This evidence indicates that some older consumers experience a degree of social isolation, which affects their decision-making. In marketing and social policy, there is a need to promote procedures, technologies and institutions that help older people to connect with others. © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Age; Older consumers; Purchase decisions; Sex; Social influence; WOM; Word of mouth",""

The current study examines sexual-stimuli intensity (explicit vs. mild) in print advertising and assesses its influence on advertising effectiveness and how this varies by gender for Australian consumers. An experiment is conducted as a test of the hypothesised relationships, with findings indicating that the level of sexual-stimuli intensity in print advertising is more effective in influencing consumers’ attitudinal and behavioural responses when depicted at a mild intensity level than at an explicit intensity level.

Recent advances in technology might overcome these limitations. Using a choice experiment, this paper examines consumer preferences for alternative technological devices that may aid consumer processing of nutritional information on food packaging. The results show which attributes of the technology consumers prefer, and identifies three distinct segments of consumers ('information hungry innovators', 'active label readers', and 'onlookers'), and differences between them in relation to their preferences, demographics, and psychographic characteristics.

In this light, brand orientation becomes an interesting alternative. Brand orientation is more powerful, since it provides a holistic and balanced perspective on an organisation, diminishing the risk of too much focus on customers, which leads to myopia. Brand orientation is more robust because it emphasises continuity coupled with dynamics and interaction, diminishing the risk of short-sightedness and reactivity. Brand orientation also facilitates prioritisation of democratic values, diminishing the risk of too much focus on economic values. © 2013 Copyright The Author(s).

By focusing on care leavers and exploring their transitions to independent living, the research develops new insights into resource interactions and consumption experiences. An interpretivist approach is adopted, comprising in-depth interviews and focus groups, to explore the interaction of operand and operant resources under conditions of resource constraints. Our findings show evidence of care leavers creatively combining constellations of their own resources to access and activate resources afforded by the marketplace. However, at the point of leaving care, our participants overall lack the well-interconnected operant resources that would provide greater capacity for generating value as they perform adult consumer roles. Disentangling the different types of resources, and exploring resource dynamics as people pursue life projects and consumption goals, enables more detailed and consumer-centric diagnosis of consumption patterns for resource-constrained consumers. The implications of this study are discussed, in particular in terms of alleviating the potential risk of care leavers becoming either under-skilled or marginalised consumers due to the lack of opportunities for systematic learning of consumer knowledge for coping in the marketplace. © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","resource integration; transitions; vulnerable consumers",""

This area has received little research investigation, despite the importance of network marketing in small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Strategic Network Marketing Model (SNMM) is generated from the study which presents a typology of six network types, together with their associated value creation opportunities. Both the typology and the focus on opportunities generated by the network types are novel. Qualitative interviews were conducted in 12 software SMEs located in two technology clusters in the UK and United States.

Such knowledge is bound to be useful to various companies and organisations, as they seek to engage such marketplaces, particularly for marketing managers, who quite likely have not had education or experience in marketing in such impoverished settings. This paper complements these practical insights with a normative ethical framework, presented in the marketing literature and labelled the integrative justice model (IJM) for impoverished markets, so as to synthesise a new framework for fair and sustainable marketing for social entrepreneurs in the context of subsistence marketplaces. © 2014 © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","fair and sustainable marketing; integrative justice model; marketing planning; social entrepreneurship; subsistence marketplaces",""

Yet, this knowledge has struggled to penetrate the business world due to a dearth of practical proposals appealing to managers looking for action-guiding toolkits. Based on a relatively small corpus of CCT-related articles published in the main applied journals with academic values, the present article traces the contours of CCT managerial knowledge revolving around the concept of cultural branding and composed of four main approaches: relationship marketing, retromarketing, tribal marketing and collaborative marketing. The article also synthesises the contributions that CCT researchers propose for each of these approaches and discusses the limits of the heroicisation of the consumers. The conclusion looks at potential research paths for the dissemination of CCT applied kind of knowledge. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","applied journals; brand; CCT; culture; dissemination; heroicisation",""

We draw on a data set of three interpretative studies with technology users living in the South of England. Our study makes a unique contribution to our understanding of consumer desire and digital virtual consumption by bringing to the fore the often-neglected role of non-human agents in the practice of consumer desire. In particular, it shows (1) the assemblage of consumer desire in human-non-human hybrids (composed of consumers and online wish lists, online auction tools, and video-game resources; (2) the redistribution of competence and skills in human-software hybrids; (3) the r-distribution of affect and commitment in human-software hybrids; and (4) the refocusing of desire in human-software hybrids. Based on our findings, we conclude that, over time, the use of software in the construction and actualisation of desire reconfigures consumer desire practices into a goal-orientated task, where the focus is not daydreaming activity or material commodities per se but rather the software itself. Here, the software not only presents things to be desired, but also absorbs some of the skill and competence needed to conjure up desire. Ultimately, these configurations appear to create breaks in the experience of desire that weaken the hold previously binding consumers to objects of desire. © 2013 © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer desire; digital virtual consumption; eBay; human-nonhuman hybrids; video games; wish lists",""

This paper provides a detailed investigation of believability in the context of such offers. In particular, it investigates the impact of the presence of, level of, and type of advertised reference prices (ARPs) on believability across a range of product contexts. An experimental methodology is adopted for the study. Findings show that the presence of an ARP does not enhance believability but that the presence of a time limit does. Believability is also shown to vary inversely with the level of ARP but is not related to semantic cues, such as list prices, contained within the offer. The study provides evidence that the product context of the offer impacts on believability. Two interaction effects are also identified. The paper contributes to the extant literature by providing new insights into how consumers' believability is influenced by how a comparative price offer is presented. Such insights will be of interest to academics interested in pricing, practitioners seeking to ensure that their promotions have maximum impact, and policymakers hoping to ensure that consumers are not misled by dishonest comparative price advertising. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","advertised reference price; believability; comparative price advertising",""

First, participants mapped their peer networks and, second, debriefs were undertaken to understand how their peer networks were used across ten product categories. Our research identifies that the choice of peer when seeking referral information is conditional on the type of referral sought. Also, that the cues used by consumers when selecting the most appropriate peer differ depending on the type of referral sought. The different peer activation for these two types of referrals indicates a need to adopt strategies specific to the different referral types. © 2013 © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","end state; mixed method; peer network; referral; regulatory fit",""

This risk perception influences directly the tourist's involvement in trip planning, specifically information seeking before and during the trip.

Destabilising forces precipitated by the Internet and associated digital technologies involving contention and disruption by multiple actors are much less prevalent in the marketing literature. The central point we advance is that rather than marketing strategy being a controlled and stabilising force for firms in their relationships with customers, it can often lead to socially produced spaces where consumers and, importantly, other multiple actors form a social movement to actively attempt to destabilise it and contest its legitimacy. Using an innovative research approach, the findings of this study show how social movements proactively enrol and mobilise a wide range of relevant actors into a network of influence. Critical to this are rhetorical strategies, acting as important levers in attempts to destabilise and delegitimise a dominant firm's marketing strategy. © 2013 © 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Internet marketing; marketing legitimacy; marketing strategy; rhetorical strategies; social movements",""

Utilising equity, power and differential association theories, a conceptual model is forwarded comprising four hypotheses between the constructs: perceived employee service deviance; customer repatronage intent; severity of customer misbehaviour; and past customer misbehaviour. Using survey responses from 380 consumers of bars, hotels and restaurants, the empirical results offer support for the forwarded research model. The results show that customers perceiving employee misbehaviour are profoundly affected. Such experiences erode their repatronage intentions and are linked (directly and indirectly) to the severity of dysfunctional customer behaviour performed.

The study provides evidence that positive and negative emotions are a key driver of this dissonant behaviour. Guilt is the most salient emotion, and a taxonomy of guilt in this context is derived from the data. Consumers are found to employ guilt-management strategies in order to sustain contradictory behaviour and manage cognitive dissonance.

Yet many organisations treat strategy making as an exclusively top management concern, even though the top management team is often remote from the daily interactions and communications taking place at the organisation, market, and customer interface. We challenge the assumption that strategy making 'belongs' to top managers and argue that marketing middle managers, possessing expert market and customer knowledge and insights, adapt top manager's strategy to shifting customer demands in a changing environment. We explore this argument by adopting a strategy-as-practice perspective and analysing marketing middle manager's practices across three case companies operating in a dynamic retail environment. Our research enables two key contributions. Our primary confirmation is to demonstrate that marketers are not passive implementers, but active adapters of top management strategy through three critical practices of sensing, challenging, and transmitting. We use the novel analogy of how adapting a book to make a film involves minor changes to the story line and characters to suit the new medium and to illustrate the strategically relevant and influential role marketing plays in adapting the strategy developed by the top management team for implementation. By demonstrating the value of the strategic practices of functional middle managers we also contribute to the growing debate of the need for greater inclusion and transparency in strategy making. © 2014 © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","adaptation; marketing practice; marketing relevance; middle-managers",""

Sophistication of adopted systems is associated with the organisation placing greater emphasis on information orientation, which is itself driven by an increased integration of IT and sales coupled with increased organisational slack. Increased integration of IT and sales is itself driven by increased strategic importance of sales coupled with increased use of internal communication networks. Importantly, a firm's marketing orientation, although also driven by the strategic importance of sales, has no impact on either information orientation or SFA sophistication. We discuss the implications of our findings to aid understanding of SFA implementation failure. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","sales force automation; sophistication of SFA systems; system implementation",""

However, although marketing scholars have begun to examine the transferability and contribution of marketing tools to destination marketing, relatively little attention has been given to the concept of brand orientation. Drawing on previous empirical work, this study uses path modelling to develop a reliable and valid multidimensional measure of brand orientation in the context of destination branding and examines its relationship to brand performance and brand leadership by senior management. The findings from a sample of CEOs and directors in 90 destination marketing organisations suggest that destination brand orientation consists of five dimensions - brand culture, departmental coordination, brand communication, stakeholder partnership, and brand reality - and has a strong, positive impact on brand performance. The findings also suggest that leadership by senior management is an important determinant of destination brand orientation. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand leadership; brand orientation; brand performance; destination brands; partial least squares",""

Ethnocentric consumers hold strong favourable attitudes towards local-perceived brands. At the same time, brand positioning strategies of local brands acquired by multinational corporations and of foreign brands entering the local market often integrate foreign COO appeals with locally relevant manufacturing and/or symbolic appeals. The results indicate that foreign brand identities that integrate 'localised' appeals communicating respect of local traditions (through the use of local images, symbols, and recipes) and contribution to the local society's well-being (through local manufacture, employment, use of local ingredients) lead to more favourable consumer perceptions. In distinguishing between 'purely foreign' and 'locally integrated foreign brands', consumers perceive the latter to be more acceptable for consumption.

This study explores the phenomenon of cultural pluralism, defined as a pattern of emergent consumption acts that result in the adoption, by individuals, of products or consumption practices from several cultures. A qualitative study involving 20 participants investigated the adoption of culturally cued products over time. Four cultural pluralism strategies emerge from the analysis. First, cultural experimentalism characterises the continuous search for the products, practices, and experiences of other cultures. Second, cultural extensionism characterises a cautious strategy slowly leading consumers beyond their comfort zone of known products towards those of other cultures. Third, cultural purism characterises a selective approach towards culturally cued products which limits consumption to a specific set of cultures. Fourth, cultural passivity characterises inertia or lack of engagement with other cultures and their products. Several antecedents are identified, whose salience appears to vary with each strategy, and each strategy has different behavioural outcomes. The study contributes to the literature on multicultural marketing by providing a more inclusive view of consumption in multicultural environments than that afforded by the sole consideration of ethnic origin or individual traits and orientations. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","cross-cultural studies; cultural pluralism; emergent consumption behaviours; international marketing; multicultural consumption behaviour; qualitative study",""

This paper shows how consumer perceptions of the extent to which behaviours are normal or not normal can be identified and used in the design of sustainability marketing strategies. The research involved a survey of 1000 UK respondents' attitudes to 15 specific activities, and identifies marketing strategies for (re)positioning these activities as either normal or not normal, as appropriate.

Consequently, the most important aspect of the application of SST is the requirement for the customer to provide the operant resource at the point of transaction. It is argued that the implementation of SST could be improved by encompassing an understanding of the resources available to the customer and the value (or lack of value) experienced by the customer in using SST.

We specifically propose that, in market environments with high variability in the competitive set and prices, it is more appropriate to assess a brand's strength relative to alternative assortment configurations rather than against individual competing brands. We build a model that depicts a brand's vulnerability in latent assortment space rather than the traditional brand space.

Based on the premise that shopping is a social phenomenon involving hedonic as well as utilitarian motivation, this study hypothesizes an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived crowding and consumers' store patronage intentions. Additionally, past research considers the mediating role of emotions in the relationship between perceived crowding and shopping outcomes. In this research, the authors argue that consumers' cognitive evaluations of the store and its merchandise also mediate the perceived crowding-patronage intention relationship. Survey results of actual shoppers (n = 201) in a hypermarket in India demonstrate that there exists an optimal level of crowding that maximises consumers' store patronage intentions. The effect of perceived crowding on patronage intention is mediated by the emotional dimension of pleasure and store evaluation. Further, the effect of perceived crowding on emotions and evaluations appears to be moderated by consumers' optimal stimulation level. In particular, the inverted U-shaped relationship of perceived crowding with pleasure and merchandise evaluation is increasingly manifested with increases in optimal stimulation level.

Further, the study explores the relationships between these two forms of forgiveness and service outcomes, including the intention to switch the service provider and spread negative word of mouth. Findings reveal that consumer religiosity has a strong and positive effect on both types of forgiveness. However, contrary to expectations, consumer spirituality has a negative relationship with decisional and no relationship with emotional forgiveness. While consumers' perceived severity of service failure is negatively related to both types of forgiveness, the findings also suggest that emotional intelligence exerts a significant moderating influence on the relationship between service failure severity and emotional forgiveness, whereas its moderating effect on decisional forgiveness does not appear to be significant. Results demonstrate the asymmetric effects of perceived severity of service failure and the two types of forgiveness on negative service outcomes. These findings contribute to the understanding on the role of consumers' implicit personality characteristics in interpretation of service failure incidents. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer forgiveness; emotional intelligence; religiosity; service failure; spirituality",""

A literature review reveals four sets of drivers that are related to the location, the tenant mix, the marketing, and the management of an agglomeration. Based on a survey of 217 managers representing stores that are located in five regional and four supra-regional shopping malls, we demonstrate that location-related drivers including geographical location, accessibility, and parking conditions have a the highest impact on agglomeration effects in terms of the economic success of tenants. The results were consistent amongst different types of tenants differentiated by store size, customer footfall, industry affiliation, and perceived role within the respective mall (as footfall taker or generator within the network). © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","centre management; place marketing; retail agglomeration; shopping centre",""

These extended possessions potentially constituted part of their own extended selves. In addition, by the virtue of their material presence, these extended possessions acted as continuous reminders of these extended selves. The extended possessions hence provided the informants with an anchoring point to increase the relatively stability of their relationships with others, thereby countering the labile nature of ever-changing identity narratives.

The model is a conceptual representation of the relationships proposed to exist between market orientation, learning orientation, innovativeness, perceived external market effects, and perceived organisational performance. The study adopted a quantitative methodology using a self-administered questionnaire delivered to ISR practitioners via e-mail. Analysis, via partial least squares (PLS), provided support for the SOP Model in the ISR context. The SOP Model extends previous orientation-performance models. Additionally, within a discordant body of market orientation literature, this study aligns with one of the dominant paradigms and, thereby, provides a strong impetus for further research.

Managers need actionable frameworks to guide them through the implementation of a service-dominant business logic based on cross-functional involvement. The goal for this research was to explore the importance of developing cross-functional, cross-firm teams in B2B relationships, and to explain the mechanisms by which cross-functional involvement enables value co-creation. A dyadic case-study approach and a collaboration framework were used to structure a B2B relationship focused on value co-creation. We measured the financial outcomes achieved by the companies one year after the cross-functional teams were implemented, and we interviewed managers to analyse their experiences with the new way of working. We found that cross-functional involvement was a key driver of financial performance for the two firms involved in the relationship.

When a limited budget is available, optimising measurement designs involves a trade-off between the accuracy of the data (i.e. generalisability coefficients) and cost considerations. Building on previous and ongoing research, this study presents a multivariate optimisation procedure to achieve the most cost-efficient measurement design under the pre-specified generalisability coefficient constraint. We used the available online concept testing data to illustrate how to optimise the measurement cost by sampling along the facets that contribute to the total error variance in different iso-generalisability designs.

Building on this, we also identify two ways (constructing a fursuit and engaging in ritualised animalistic behaviour) in which Furries reinforce their communal status through authoritative performances that involves 'giving oneself to the animal spirit'. To our knowledge, this study represents the first examination of Furry consumer culture, and contributes to our understanding of human-animal relations through insights for anthropomorphism, zoomorphism, and the extended self. Specifically, we identify that Furries draw on an anthropomorphised animal spirit to heal feelings of disconnection with the postmodern world.

However, both kinds of promotions are widely used in practice, suggesting the importance of other contributory factors. With a consumer experiment on a national panel of consumers, this research demonstrates that extra free product promotions are most preferred for existing products, and introductory low-price promotions are preferred for innovative products. The moderating effect of a product's innovativeness is explained via a new relationship in the marketing literature, whereby perceived risk mediates the relationship between perceived innovativeness and a consumer's tendency to stockpile. © 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","BOGOF; introductory low price; perceived innovativeness; transaction value",""

The survey results reveal that the first accused brand, Sanlu, took disproportionate blame and was made a scapegoat for an industry-wide crisis. The observer/tension-discharging perspective, the 'early information' effect, and the contrasting roles of manufacturers and non-manufacturer parties in the supply chain in causal attributions have the most significant effect in consumer scapegoating. Study of a highly unfortunate 'real-life experiment' shows how a food safety scandal spills over and negatively affects attitudes and beliefs about the whole supply chain and about competing brands. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","attribution; Chinese consumers; food safety; scapegoating; trust",""

In this article, we extend the S-D logic understanding of human operant resources by offering a CKSW Institutional Meta-Role Scheme, developed in information sciences, which identifies and distinguishes fundamental aspects of institutional resources. These represent important role types associated with two different ways of knowing: knowledge ('know-what') and skills ('know-how'). To support our argument that 'knowledge' must be distinguished from 'skills', we review relevant literature from philosophy and cognitive science. We also discuss how the CKSW role types have manifested from the early (historical) trading, and then illustrate how they can be effectively deployed in modern institutional contexts. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","institutional roles; know-how; operant resources; organisational knowledge; organisational skills; Service-Dominant Logic",""

Two distinct clusters whose views and choice behaviours differed markedly existed: one was primarily price-driven and the other more responsive to specific claims.

Cognitive age is seen to be a more accurate reflection of changes related to age and aging than chronological age. Based on self-concept theory, the authors propose that cognitive age moderates the effects of perceptions of store attributes on satisfaction with a store. The hypotheses tests used a sample of 404 supermarket patrons aged 60 and above. The latent construct, cognitive age, was operationalised by six items: feel, look, do, interest, health, and think age. The cognitive ages of our respondents proved to be significantly lower than their chronological ages. To evaluate the moderating effects, we applied the product-indicator approach using variance-based structural equation modelling. The results show that the impacts of product range, manoeuvrability, and atmosphere within the store on satisfaction become significantly stronger with increasing cognitive age. We conclude that cognitive age dimensions influence perceptions and, subsequently, behaviour related to store patronage, and thus contribute to the understanding of the growing segment of elderly shoppers. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","cognitive age; consumer; grocery; patronage; retail; senior citizen",""

The study begins by tracing the cow's representation in culture as an object that is simultaneously revered and profaned, tracing this to its long-standing association with nature and the feminine. It then offers a historical perspective on the representation of cows in advertising, outlining some of the controversies that have raged about how cows are depicted. This leads to a consideration of ecofeminism and related issues around this, such as environmentalism and gender. Its central argument is that an anthropocentric world view has led to cows being positioned in anthropomorphic advertisements as 'the Other'. Applying an ecofeminist analysis, the authors identify an overarching narrative of 'benevolent mastery' in many cow advertisements that adopt anthropomorphic devices. As such, these advertisements serve to delude us about the true nature of cows' lives. The authors conclude by suggesting that an ecofeminist lens enables us to unmask the 'dark side' of anthropomorphism in marketing, revealing fundamental prejudices in contemporary culture. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","advertising; anthropomorphic marketing; anthropomorphism; cow advertisements; critical marketing; ecofeminism",""

The evidence on the effectiveness of fear appeals is mixed, and in some studies strong fear appeals have been found to reinforce the undesirable behaviour. Individual self-efficacy may play a role in moderating the effects of fear appeals. In advertising contexts where the intention was to encourage socially desirable behaviours, it has been shown that greater self-efficacy is associated with a more positive response to fear appeals. Similarly, in such contexts, the perceived ethicality of a fear-appeal advertisement appears to be positively related to self-efficacy. The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between self-efficacy, perceived ethicality, and the impact of advertising on behavioural intentions in a context where the aim is to discourage undesirable behaviour, namely anti-smoking advertising. Questionnaire data were gathered from 434 respondents in London, England.

This is because these systems are designed for stable environments. This paper examines ways in which CRM resource networks can be designed to be adaptive on a continuous basis. Drawing conclusions from the literature review, we define the theoretical focus of this study at the 'intersection' of three theories, and propose a conceptual model describing the phenomenon of interest. We use as our unit of analysis customer recruitment processes (CRPs), which are a subset of CRM systems. Based on an in-depth case study, we found seven principles to guide organisations develop CRPs that are designed for change. We expand on the conceptual model by linking together these seven empirically derived principles so that design issues influenced by stakeholders, social networks, and resources are better understood. This study is of value to scholars because it uses, for the first time, three theories - stakeholder theory, resource-based theory, and social network theory - to study resource networks in CRPs. It is of value to practitioners because it provides direction for management action. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","case study; CRM; customer recruitment processes; resource-based theory; social network theory; stakeholder theory",""

Face-to-face between-subjects survey experiments were carried out at permanent DS installations in the UK: a pretest in a university (n = 103), and a field trial at the Harrods department store, London (n = 437). Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of DS sensory-affective advertisments (little functional information), whereas previous studies concern mainly cognitive content. DS content high on sensory cues evokes affective experience. DS ads that are high in factual information evoke intellectual experience. Evoked affective experience is more associated with attitude towards the ad and approach towards the advertiser than is evoked intellectual experience. Summary statement of contribution: The findings indicate that incidental brand-related stimuli on DS can lead to evaluative judgments such as attitudes. Such stimuli can also work by evoking sensory and affective experiences and eliciting approach behaviour towards an advertiser. Practical implications arise as 'affective' DS ads can increase shoppers' approach towards an advertiser and the store that carries the ads, especially in generating loyalty from first time shoppers. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","customer experience; digital signage; experiential message cues",""

The highest evaluation was obtained for the moderately incongruent extension compared to the congruent and extremely incongruent brand extensions of an established brand for individuals high on both personality dimensions.

Particularly in the premium segment with higher revenue opportunities, competition intensity is rising continuously. Numerous traditional car concepts, as well as new body styles, explicitly address heterogeneous premium customers' expectations. The build-up of body styles, exterior designs, and engine types result in a loss of traditional basing points for new car categorisation. Therefore, new car positioning is no longer the sheer outcome of technical data. Instead, it turns out to be a key issue of successful product management and a trigger of customers' purchasing decisions. Against this background, we investigated two positioning alternatives - 'high' versus 'premium' - by means of a large-scale customer base generated from an innovative car clinic set-up. The paper illustrates the effects of alternative positioning strategies and corresponding context effects on the willingness to pay, design perception, and purchase intention.

We suggest that our analysis of the UK's drinking 'culture' hints at a previously untheorised complexity and force, and points to a deep contradiction between young people's lived experience of alcohol and government policy discourses based on appeals to individual moral responsibility.

The present study advances this theory by exhibiting the adaptation capability of the generic values instrument (the Portrait Value Questionnaire, PVQ), demonstrating that tailor-made PVQ versions can reflect consumers' motives towards differentiated products (i.e. organic foods). A questionnaire was completed by approximately 1000 households in each of eight EU countries (N = 8171). The organic food-relevant PVQ was developed through a preliminary qualitative phase (i.e. a means-end chain analysis), and its factorial design was validated through CFA, showing high statistical performance. PVQ-based European clusters with strong self-transcendence values comprised large numbers of organic purchasers. Moreover, results point to the fact that when a circumplex taxonomy, such as the PVQ, is applied in a real context (i.e. organic food purchases), the situation-relevant value domains merge into new hierarchical dimensions in absolute respect of the original taxonomy.

In the ambiguous and dynamic exchange process of marketing, the articulation of identities is fundamental to demarcate the activities and actions that take place between market actors. In recent times, growing importance has been placed on a different breed of marketer in these exchanges - the cultural intermediary. For these marketing practitioners, knowledge about the interplay between culture and economy generates the cultural capital that legitimises their expertise and value. Yet, this simultaneously gives rise to the difficult navigation and accomplishment of boundaries between their work and pleasure. Through a case study of two coolhunting agencies, this paper examines how marketers discursively perform boundary work in the construction of their identities. The findings show that, for coolhunters, a tension exists in drawing on discourses of renegadism and professionalism to construct their identities, resulting in their engagement in chameleon-like identity work. The research proposes that the tensions pervading the construction of boundaries and identities for marketers can be usefully understood through a paradox lens, and offers the metaphor of the nomad as a theoretical representation of interwoven identity conflicts for marketers. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","boundary work; coolhunting; cultural intermediaries; discourse analysis; identity; marketing practitioners",""

An exception is the development of the E-S-QUAL scale by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra (2005). Whilst E-S-QUAL demonstrated good psychometric properties in the original study, the scale lacks external validation. This paper presents a reassessment and validation of the E-S-QUAL in the context of the Internet grocery sector. Data were collected via a web-based cross-sectional survey using self-administered questionnaires distributed to online grocery shoppers. A total of 491 usable questionnaires were received. The results show that there are potential discriminant validity problems with the Efficiency and System Availability dimensions of E-S-QUAL. Further analysis shows that a second-order, three-factor model of E-S-QUAL, consisting of Efficiency, System Availability, and Fulfilment, provides the best fit to the data in this study.

Using a qualitative study involving 22 in-depth interviews with FLEs, the analysis reveals three categories of COD behaviours: deviant service adaptation (DSA), deviant service communication (DSC), and deviant use of resources (DUR). The drivers of COD are categorised as individual (risk-taking, service aptitude, and pro-social moral values), situational (resource availability, social capita with customers, legitimacy of customer problems, and avoidance of hassles), and organisational (unconducive service climate and anticipated rewards). This paper contributes to understanding how and why FLEs over-service customers and extends current research by exploring multiple categories of behaviours within a services marketing context. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","frontline employees; interviews; positive deviance; pro-customer",""

Results demonstrate that anthropomorphism can account for the personal value of a product beyond the influence of common marketplace factors. Additionally, a series of paired t-tests found that the magnitude of anthropomorphism is related to product complexity. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of product managers to prime or otherwise influence consumer anthropomorphism may depend upon what product is being anthropomorphised.

To investigate how national culture influences student expectations during such encounters, 40 students from the UK and Bangladesh were interviewed and 210 questionnaires were completed by students. Using the semi-standardised laddering interviewing technique in combination with Kano questionnaires, the study provides an in-depth insight into the qualities and behaviours that students expect professors to portray during service-recovery encounters. The research reveals that the key attributes desired by both groups of students include being approachable, listening actively, showing empathy and providing an explanation.

It is based on an evaluation of the level and acceptability of congruency between the image of the music and the self-concept, both of which are socially situated. Identity is expressed through a variety of consumption rituals, which allow the individual to 'own' or 'possess' the associated meanings.

The extension attitude is mainly determined by the degree of perceived fit between the extension and the parent brand image. In the Spanish sample, it is also determined by the degree of familiarity with the parent brand and the perceived fit at the product category level. After analysing these relationships, the paper focuses on the moderating role of two dimensions of consumer innovativeness: hedonist innovativeness (tied to need for stimulation) and social innovativeness (tied to need for uniqueness).

Further analysis shows that consumers have to compromise and balance between their conflicting end-goals.

Indeed, this is a challenge for social marketers seeking to advance the sustainability agenda. Therefore, this study problematises what has been conceptualised as attitude-behaviour gaps (Boulstridge & Carrigan, 2000), and explores how groups of consumers have re-construed such practices and their meanings through the formation of New Consumption Communities (Szmigin, Carrigan, & Bekin, 2007). Multi-sited ethnographic findings illustrate the social processes through which ethical and green forms of consumption are established and normalised. Findings also stress the importance of normative and habitual reframing through 'ethical spaces' (Barnett, Clarke et al., 2005) in establishing and maintaining increased consistency in participants' consumption meanings, behaviours, and goals. Thus we re-frame attitude-behaviour gaps as coherent inconsistencies, which allows for a move away from solely trying to explain and change individual consumer behaviour, to identifying how suitable upstream and downstream (Verplanken & Wood, 2006) approaches and policies can be used to facilitate more sustainable forms of consumption. © 2012 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","behavioural inconsistency; consumption; social marketing",""

Briefly, findings illustrate that SMEs are performing e-CRM to varying extents, reaping a range of performance benefits and facing a range of challenges. It is true that SMEs are not adopting e-CRM per se, as described in the large organisation-biased literature, but they are adopting relatively simple IBTs to improve their customer communication and information management capabilities and thus to create competitive advantage in their own strategic way.

Whether a kiosk salesperson was aggressive or passive had virtually the same effect upon shoppers. Similarly, passive kiosk salespeople and the absence of kiosks resulted in relatively the same level of arousal on shoppers, while aggressive salespeople caused a higher level of arousal than either of the other two conditions.

The aim of the current paper is to investigate the extent to which the techniques of neutralisation used by service consumers vary across different forms of deviant consumer behaviour. After providing an overview of extant research into deviant consumer behaviour and of research into the techniques of neutralisation, we detail our methodology. Thereafter, we present our findings to reflect the five forms of deviant consumer behaviour that were most consistently identified by informants (property abuses, verbal abuses during service, post-service negative word of mouth, dishonest actions, and sexual exploitation).

This study examines the degrees of implementation of competitive and/or strategic approaches to internationalisation of a sample of 92 European business schools. Several possible antecedents of competitive and strategic orientations towards internationalisation are considered including coercive, normative and mimetic influences, risk aversion, resource availability and institutional priorities. The level of a business school's autonomy from its host university is also hypothesised to affect internationalisation decisions. It seems from the results that engagement with internationalisation activities is widespread and that, apart from risk aversion, all of the above variables typically impact on the total extent of a business school's internationalisation activities. A number of these variables also appear to encourage the application of strategic and competitive approaches towards internationalisation.

An adaptation of Pavis's evaluation framework is illustrated in the context of a restaurant service performance. A focus on the work of Pavis directs attention to the mise-en-scène or metatext of a performance as a vehicle for consumer analysis, and explicitly acknowledges the value of nurturing and enhancing the critical capacity of an audience. Although an audience should be made aware of the main components of a performance, most importantly they should be encouraged to take a holistic, rather than fragmented, view of what is being presented. In addition, unlike other research approaches, the customer-critic process involves customers before, during, and after the performance, and builds in the opportunity for both reporting and reconstruction. It is an approach to data collection and analysis more closely aligned to the Service-Dominant Logic of marketing than methods currently adopted by service managers, recognising consumers as operant resources and the 'value in use' of the performance from a consumer experience perspective. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Aesthetics; Critical discourse; Service performance; Service-dominant logic; Theatre",""

We present results, based on separate models for 11 colleges (n = 5606) at a major US university, that run counter to published findings. We discuss fundamental differences between our methods and those used in (most) previous research to explain our findings. Rather than use market level data, we model individual student-choice behaviour and derive market level implications via upward aggregation. Our modelling uses discrete-choice experiments in which choice sets are customised in real-time to reflect each respondent's true consideration set of schools as well as to capture elements of inter-university competition. Published research using market-level data, though appropriate for national policy debates, is not necessarily useful for governance decisions at the university level. We illustrate using tuition elasticities estimated by college and further show that elastic demand can have deleterious effects on the quality of an incoming class even when demand for seats far outstrips supply. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Discrete choice; Higher education; Price elasticity; Tuition elasticity",""

It introduces the concept of celebritisation as the engine of celebrity culture, discussing ways in which celebrity brands operate as 'map-making' devices which situate consumers within networks of symbolic resources. We construct particulars via an investigative narrative that draws critically upon published accounts of the life and work of Andy Warhol, generating observations of signature practices and technologies of formation of Celebrity Brandhood. Within an inductive architecture we modulate to celebrity brands as transmediated marketing accomplishments which trade upon allure, glamour and charisma, constructed around rituals of transition, belonging, intimacy, and affect. We suggest that at the heart of the machinery of the cultural logic of the Celebrity Brand is the mediated spectacle as a field of social invention and transformation. In this way, the paper opens up pathways toward further interpretive analyses of celebrity brands, articulating the basis of accounts of Celebrity Brand Theoretics. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","biographical methods; celebritisation; celebrity brand theoretics; celebrity brands; culture and consumption; narrative analysis",""

The use of natural settings has been shown to be effective in assisting the restorative process. Some would go further to argue for the development of the practice of active engagement in social and therapeutic horticulture and agriculture as a form of therapy, particularly in regard to the benefits to health, well-being, and improved recovery times. This phenomenon is utilised in the development of a novel service (CaRE - Care and Rural Enterprise) based on collaboration between rural micro-businesses and a UK university, reflecting a national government agenda of linking business with higher education. The approach to this new service development is one of action research, which has been used particularly by health and social care practitioners who wish to improve their practices by a cycle of gradual learning and improvement and the encouragement of reflection. Modern health care provision has come to emphasise delivery of value for patients as consumers, often placing them at the centre of stakeholder networks. This paper reviews the progress of a novel respite care service that linked social provision to rural entrepreneurial activity, and charts development from what was envisaged initially as private-sector niche opportunities in health and recuperative care, evolving into social care in the rural environment. The study resulted in the initiation and development of the CaRE service providing a network of rural community-based care facilities. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Action research; Respite care; Restorative experience; Rural business opportunity; Value in health care",""

Parties persist in government when our conventional understanding of the prevalent conditions in the political market suggests there should be greater 'churn'. It considers political brands as cultural brands, suggesting that a long-term competitive advantage arises for the party perceived to be most in tune with the popular culture within society. We draw on a model by which such cultural advantage is attained, namely cultural innovation. To exemplify the approach, a case study of the Conservative Party as a cultural brand is considered over some 30 years. The paper concludes that the cultural branding approach is a useful way to explain long-term political phenomena. It also allows us to forecast the likely future of the current government's electoral success in terms of its cultural resources/strategy (the Big Society). The political marketing sub-discipline has grown substantially over the last few decades. This paper is a significant contribution to this, building as it does on the political branding literature from a novel, cultural branding perspective. Apart from its ability to explain previously difficult-to-explain phenomenon of political party stability, it also opens up a new stream of applied, culturally focused, political marketing research. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Conservative Party; cultural branding; politics",""

However, organic food products are now available in upscale supermarkets in East and South-East China metropolises such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. This paper reports the results of a study investigating what motivates early adopters of organic food in China. The data were collected in Guangzhou by means of a mall-intercept survey. As in Western Europe, the early adoption of organic food in China is positively related to what Schwartz termed 'universalism values'. Also as in the West, the personal attitude towards buying organic food in China is strongly linked to beliefs about its healthiness, taste, and environmental friendliness. Social norms play a minor role for the intention to buy organic food, probably because the early adopters have few role models and face few expectations in this respect. © 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","China; consumer motivation; mall-intercept survey; organic food",""

This paper examines the brand value of real-life brands that have moved to the virtual world of Second Life. Using axiology, we assess the value of real-life brands in the virtual world and test an exploratory model of brand fit to the virtual world. While category fit is an established construct, channel extension fit represents a new variable developed specifically to help explain brand transference to the new context. Data were collected in two phases, both in Second Life via automated avatar survey bots and via a Web survey. A total of 211 matched responses were collected and tested using partial least squares. The overall research model is strongly supported. Virtual-world brand value is strongly determined by extension attitudes driven by an assessment of how well the category of the real-life brand offerings fit with the virtual world and how well the real-life brand offerings fit with the three-dimensional virtual-world channel within which they have emerged. This implies that organisations must carefully consider not only the nature of existing brand offerings before entering into the virtual world, but also whether this new channel is indeed a suitable channel in which to be embarking on branding activities. This also has clear implications for branding activities in other social media.

This study, however, examines whether branding can constitute an anticompetitive act. While most markets and firms do not undertake anticompetitive actions, being identified as such can result in a wide range of negative outcomes. To explore this low-frequency yet high-risk outcome, this study assesses how branding has been perceived to be anticompetitive by the UK competition authorities. This assessment is undertaken by examination of all UK competition law regulatory decisions undertaken over the period 1950-2007 by the UK competition authorities. From this assessment, it is observed that branding can facilitate excessive pricing, requires vertical restraints, and can lead to consumer confusion; all potentially anticompetitive acts. The competition regulatory decisions focused on branding issues are demonstrably different from regulatory decisions without branding concerns and involve larger, often manufacturing, firms, which operate in more concentrated markets. It is concluded that comprehension of competition law needs to be disseminated more widely amongst marketing communities and greater reference to business and marketing theory should be made by competition law agencies to assist the comprehension of marketing techniques such as branding. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Antitrust; Branding; Business government interface; Competition law; Content analysis",""

In evaluating the use of attack advertising in elections, we reveal how its future needs to be significantly different from its past. In this paper, we begin by examining some of the central contextual issues that were purported to inform the campaigns, and that also influenced public opinion towards parties, leaders, and voting itself. We then present the core arguments that both support and reject the use of attack advertising in election campaigns. We then move on to present detailed accounts of the advertising campaigns for the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat parties - using a combination of primary interview and secondary data. Our evaluation of these campaigns focuses on the consequences of attack advertising for political engagement and trust, and thus the reputation of political marketing.

There is a prevailing school of thought that holds that where children pose purchasing requests to their parents, pestering and unhappiness may result if those requests are denied. This paper approaches this issue by accessing children's views on pester power, as opposed to previous research studies that have tended to prioritise parental perspectives. Findings are presented from an interpretive study involving children aged between seven and nine years. The study suggests that children understand the various responses that parents make to purchase requests, for example, agreement, refusal, procrastination, and negotiation, and their parents' rationale for such responses. Furthermore, the outcome of such interaction tends to constitute more of a good-natured 'game' between parent and child, as suggested by the children, as opposed to the negative overtones of conflict indicated in the literature. The paper concludes that this interaction can be more closely aligned with our expanding understanding of the process of consumer socialisation, rather than the negative connotations of pester power and conflict phenomena, as suggested in previous studies. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Children; Consumer socialisation; Influence strategies; Pester power",""

Multivariate analysis techniques were utilised to identify a set of drivers of and inhibitors to local food buying. Following this, two types of local food buyers were distinguished based upon the reasons for buying/not buying, and these were further categorised using demographic and location variables. An integrated modelling process was then used to establish the effects of the different influences on behavioural intentions and actual buying behaviour. Results identified a complex range of outcomes which indicate that the ethical sustainability dimension of local food shopping does not positively affect consumer buying in this market.

The aim of this research is to develop an understanding of the consumer culture of 'sensible drinking' by analysing young adult's constructions of credible identities and resistant motivations for manoeuvring within, and beyond, a culture where excessive drinking is the accepted norm. Using narrative theory approach, young adults' self-generated stories surrounding responsible consumption of alcohol are explored. Informants engage a resistance narrative to the dominant culture of intoxication and legitimise identity through construction of alternate subject positions. Despite underpinnings of belief homogeneity, informants displayed heterogeneity when manoeuvring within intoxicated social spaces suggesting a continuum of resistance behaviour and existence of micro-subcultures within a culture of sensible drinking. Understanding discourses of young people who create a legitimate culture of 'sensible' drinking offers critical, yet often dismissed, insight into the relationship between identity and alcohol resistance for the creation of a safer, healthier drinking culture. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Alcohol; Anti-consumption; Non-drinkers; Responsible drinking; Social marketing",""

The results from the research offer insight into how high religiosity consumers are able to acquire material wealth despite a strong aversion to such practices within their doctrine.

The authors link attention restoration theory with the servicescape framework to demonstrate empirically that home-like cancer resource centres may offer their members a built setting in which some members undergo restoration from symptoms associated with cancer-related fatigue. Using mediation analysis, the authors demonstrate that some cancer-centre members are attracted to these centres partially because they are able to relieve two types of fatigue from participating in activities and classes - namely, low energy and personal productivity concerns. Fatigue is the leading symptom reported by cancer patients undergoing medical treatment, and thus the ability of cancer resource services to positively influence individual and societal well-being is profound. This work supports the transformative service research paradigm by revealing that not-for-profit 'third places' have important public-health implications. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","attention restoration theory; cancer resource centres; cancer-related fatigue; servicescapes; third places; transformative research",""

The findings of the research suggest that a positive relationship was found between general and carbon-specific knowledge, attitude towards the environment, and general and carbon-specific behaviours. Therefore, general and carbon-specific environmental behaviours are related and may be driven by general attitudes and knowledge (i.e. both carbon-specific and general environmental knowledge). The implications of the study would suggest that marketers, working in tandem with government policymakers, need to focus efforts on developing consumers' knowledge about specific sub-issues, such as global warming.

By understanding bloggers' motivations to blog, marketers can better address bloggers' needs and adapt social media campaigns accordingly. This paper contributes to social media and gratifications research by studying the perceived gratifications of 12 experienced private bloggers from Estonia. The bloggers sought process, content, and social gratifications from blogging activities. Several new categories were found compared with previous research. For example, the content gratifications of enlightening others, advertising, and promotion, and the social gratifications of communication, image management, and vanity, are new to blogging. Bloggers' gratifications were found to evolve over time, leading to blog changes.

The present article addresses the next logical question, namely, given the inevitable emergence of the dark-side symptoms over time, what corrective strategies can the relational partners utilise to arrest this deterioration of their relationships. RM literature has frequently invoked the marriage metaphor to describe relational exchange partnerships. Not surprisingly, then, even though the metaphor is not perfect, this paper draws on the twin related literature streams of marriage counselling and marriage and relationship education to make recommendations about preventative and combative strategies for countering the onset of dark-side symptoms. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","dark side; literature review; myopia; prevention; relationship marketing; suspicion",""

Drawing on the consumption community and co-creation literature, this paper reports on a study that examines the nature and characteristics of a virtual co-creation context. Findings suggest consumers are able to take ownership, define and create their own post-product consumption experience, and, through a collaborative - often implicit - process between firm and consumer, continually modify and 'co-evolve' the product in an ongoing and iterative process.

Hypotheses related their involvement in online peer-to-peer media to their perceived level of satisfaction, emotions evoked, and likelihood of recommending the institution.

Subsequently, the hospital system should become far more competitive with supply chains having to react to these changes as patient demand becomes less predictable. Using a qualitative case study methodology, hospital managers are interviewed on a range of issues. Views on the development of the hospital supply chain in different phases are derived, and are used to develop amap of the current hospital chain. The findings show hospital managers anticipating some significant changes to the hospital supply chain and its workings as Patient Choice expands. The research also maps the various aspects of the hospital supply chain as it moves through different operational phases and highlights underlying challenges and complexities. The hospital supply chain, as discussed and mapped in this research, is original work given there are no examples in the literature that provide holistic representations of hospital activity. At the end, specific recommendations are provided that will be of interest to service to managers, researchers, and policymakers. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Elective surgery; Hospital supply chain; NHS england; Patient Choice; Qualitative case-study methodology",""

The analysis reveals that physicians are satisfied with physician-targeted communication strategies and greatly value two-way interactive approaches, though they have significantly differing attitudes across cultures towards the likely impacts of DTC advertising, with Greek physicians the most opposed. They generally support unbranded disease awareness campaigns though. The research findings thus suggest that planned value creation for manufacturers and consumers through DTC advertising conflicts with the value delivery for the intermediary physician, which delays the expansion of this advertising policy. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Advertising ethics; Direct-to-consumer advertising; Drug marketing; International; Value creation; Value delivery",""

We suggest that a bottom-up approach based on the paradigm of co-creation should be taken to developing a place brand and that brand ownership is determined by the extent to which the representation of the place reflects the experience of the community. Such an approach, we believe, is essential to achieve authenticity (brand essence), commitment from stakeholders, and brand sustainability. Grounded in ethnographic research, this paper presents a model that structures the features of community ownership from a bottom-up perspective and proposes four fundamental elements of place branding that encapsulate the experience of the place: rights, roles, relationships, and responsibilities. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand co-creation; Brand ownership; Place branding",""

One such concept that is held to be at the core of marketing is consumer value, which considers how consumers perceive the outcomes of their consumption experiences. Consequently, the functional relationships between service quality, value (disaggregated into the constituent dimensions of its give and get components), satisfaction and recommendation within the educational domain form the focus of this study. Service quality is treated as an antecedent of value, which in turn is a driver of satisfaction, the ultimate outcome of which is word of mouth recommendation. The idiosyncratic behaviour of the proposed functional relationships is tested in two cohorts of postgraduate students (MBA and specialist Masters). The data are analysed using Partial Least Squares. The impact of service quality on the formation of perceptions of value is confirmed for both cohorts. However, in relative terms the relationships are stronger for the specialist Masters cohort. At the same time, notable differences between the two cohorts are observed in the functional relationships between the dimensions of value and satisfaction. Although, collectively, the results are in line with extant value literature, they also indicate that contextual differences, even within a single domain, play an important role in the behaviour of the functional relationships. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Consumer perceived value; Satisfaction; Service quality; Wom",""

Findings from focus group interviews with employees of five large UK organisations show that individual personal factors such as environmental concern, values, beliefs, norms, and habits formed from domestic behaviour are fundamental to EROCBs. An important role for internal social marketing (ISM) is highlighted in identifying environmentally concerned employees, or 'internal customers', creating incentives and removing barriers to pro-environmental behaviour.

Contrary to some evidence, we find that product-recall experience has greater negative impacts for established strong brands than weaker non-established brands. Additionally, attributes of product recall such as the seriousness of the recall problem and speed of recall announcement impact on pre- and post-recall differences in consumer evaluations of brand equity.

The objective is to map citizens' attitudes towards sustainable characteristics of pig production systems, and investigate whether these attitudes coincide with people's general attitudes towards sustainability, on one hand, and their consumption of specific pork products, on the other. A conjoint experiment was designed to evaluate citizens' preferences towards pig production systems with varying sustainability levels. Conjoint analysis results were then used for a subsequent cluster analysis in order to identify international citizen clusters across the three continents. Respondents' sociodemographic profile, attitudes towards sustainability issues, and consumption frequency of various pork products are used to profile resulting segments. Results for the three continents point out that general sustainability attitudes relate to citizens' attitudes towards pig farming only for specific small-sized social groups. However, what the large majority of respondents think in their role as citizens related to pig production did not appear to influence their pork consumption choices significantly. The main implication of this finding is that while critical attitudes only weakly influence purchasing behaviour, they may, however, still be expressed in the public debate and influence policy formation at national and global levels.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the two disciplines were connected via the work of Frederick Taylor and Percival White. As conventionally represented, Taylor was the father of scientific management and, by extension, the management sciences more generally. He is also frequently associated with a focus on production efficiency. However, a close reading of Taylor reveals his appreciation of the connection between production and consumption and thus the importance of the ultimate consumer. Taylor's ideas and the work, published in the Bulletin of the Taylor Society, which provided an outlet for the scholarship of early marketing thinkers, provide the linchpin between the production ethos of Taylor and the emergence of 'scientific marketing' exemplified in the work of Percival White. The latter demonstrated the ideological credibility of his scientific marketing system via its association with science and attributes such as objectivity. Importantly, in his work we find the first clear articulation of the marketing concept. Unlike present-day debates, which frequently treat it as a synonym for shareholder value, the early articulations of the marketing concept were underwritten by an explicit ethical orientation that placed limits on corporate behaviour, ideas that were again brought to prominence courtesy of the consumerist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. © 2012 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","customer orientation; Frederick Taylor; Percival White; scientific marketing management; scientific salesmanship; the marketing concept",""

To understand consumer value in health care, we focused on one context - word-of-mouth referrals by new mothers.

In particular, the paper investigates the extent to which consumers' familiarity and objective/subjective expertise affect the degree to which functional and non-functional cues are used in evaluating investment products. The methodology for the study is quantitative, involving a random telephone sample of 1002 respondents broadly representative of the UK population. Means scores for various constructs are used in a regression analysis to test three hypotheses. The findings indicate that greater familiarity is associated with the importance of functional, rather than non-functional, cues in financial services evaluation, as is greater objective expertise. However, no relationship is apparent between subjective expertise and cue utilisation. The study has significant managerial implications, as an informed understanding of how cue utilisation varies with consumers' familiarity and expertise will assist managers in their attempts to formulate marketing strategies that appeal to targeted customer segments. Overall, the paper provides a novel insight into the appropriate conceptualisation of evaluative cues in a services setting, as well as an enhanced understanding of how consumers' utilisation of such cues in their evaluations of a high credence financial services is contingent upon familiarity and expertise. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer decision making; evaluative cues; expertise; familiarity; information search; services",""

An experiential approach is deemed more appropriate for government health care services that are free and preventative rather than for treatment purposes. Thus, instead of using an illness paradigm to view health-services outcomes, the researchers applied a wellness paradigm.

Yet, consumer research is limited in its consideration of the separate memory systems conceptualisation dominant in psychology, and rather has primarily focused on semantic forms of memory. As Autobiographical Memory (AM) may equally affect one's brand consumption decisions, it is critical to integrate this system into brand-related memory studies for a complete understanding of the consumer learning and decision-making process. The study conceptualises affective, self-relevant brand episodes as Brand-Related Autobiographical Memory (BRAM), and storage of abstract brand knowledge as Brand-Related Semantic Memory (BRSM). It presents a conceptualisation of brand-related memories, posits the relationships between different memory systems/ behaviours, and investigates the neural response of these brand-related memories. Through a series of fMRI experiments, the neural correlates of BRAM and BRSM can be distinguished, and the association between BRAM and the self-construal demonstrated.

Non-profits can improve retention by nurturing donor relationships. Acknowledging or thanking the donor is a vital building block in the non-profit organisation-donor relationship. This paper examines the impact of such acknowledgements on donor relationships. In study 1, we employed crosssectional data obtained from 478 donors to a regional public television station in the United States. We found that the effect of acknowledgements on the donor relationship is moderated by how frequently the donor gives to the organisation, and that acknowledgements help strengthen the non-profit's relationship with less frequent donors. In study 2, we used an experimental design (111 respondents) to probe the emotional effects of a thank-you note. The findings indicate that acknowledgements enhance positive emotions and alleviate negative emotions; the converse effect is observed when the donor does not get a thank-you note. Thus acknowledging the donor's gift provides a promising means of fostering donor relationships and retaining donors. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Acknowledgements; Charitable giving; Donor relationship; Fundraising; Not-for-profit marketing; Relationship marketing",""

As a result, little is known about what makes an organisation's employer brand attractive to its current employees. The objective of our study is to address this question through the lens of Social Identity Theory (SIT) which we do by conducting a comparative case study across four organisations. We found that the specific attributes considered most attractive by employees were different in each organisation. However the categories of attribute were almost identical; these were employment, organisational successes, construed external image, and product or service characteristics. We also argue that managers need to identify the attributes of their own organisation that employees find most attractive within these categories in order to link the employer brand with the identity of the organisation, and the interests of employees. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Case study; Corporate brand; Employee behaviour; Employer brand; Social Identity Theory",""

In this paper, we use personal interviews with consumers to establish the existence of SGCB in China, and further to compare motivations for and the emotions associated with SGCB in positive-related contexts in the UK and mainland China, with a particular focus on the Chinese side. We also address the nature of this behaviour for Chinese participants.

However, little scholarly research has examined factors influencing Asian consumers' selection of private brand (PB) food products. This paper proposes a model that integrates four key variables measuring consumer characteristics (price consciousness, perceived PB quality, perceived PB risk and familiarity with PB) that influence PB attitude and purchase intention in Taiwan. Two surveys generated 409 useable questionnaires (222 from on-line survey and 187 from face-to-face interviews). The findings reveal that Taiwanese consumers are more concerned about the quality than the price of these European retailers' PB. When consumers are more familiar with the retailer's PB, they have more confidence in evaluating product quality, reducing perceived risk and enhancing price consciousness. Theses findings suggest that retailers should increase various promotional activities, such as offering free samples or tasting at the point of sale, to increase consumers' familiarity with their PB products. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Attitude; Familiarity; Food product; Private brand; Purchase intention; Taiwan",""

Few studies have addressed this issue in detail, but those that do, advise supplier firms to implement strategies such as service teams and boundary spanner rotation to lessen the negative effects of boundary spanner turnover. By creating multiple bonds between the two firms, dispersing client-specific knowledge widely throughout the supplier firm, and preventing the development of a close bond between buyer and seller boundary spanners, individual interpersonal relationships become less important. However, a review of relationship literature on trust, commitment, social bonds, and knowledge suggests the potential for negative outcomes from the implementation of the strategies. Using case studies and one-to-one interviews with design buyers and their agencies, this paper explores the outcomes of the two strategies, and the contexts in which these outcomes occur.

Two-stage structural equation modelling is employed to understand the relationship of possession centrality, lifestyle behaviours, purchases, and possession ownership on cultural fracture experiences. The possessions that educational visitors bring from home and goods they purchase once in the host culture relate positively to cultural fracture, demonstrating possible anchoring effects of possessions brought from home and the culturally disorientating effects of making purchases in a host cultural space. Possession centrality, or the skill and confidence in aspects of consumption and possession use, is principal in alleviating the experiences of cultural fracture. Visitors possessing higher levels of possession centrality experience less fracture than those with lower levels of possession centrality.

At this time the author's academic future in marketing was also unclear. He was working in the area of Technology Forecasting, a highly specialised field, not only within social policy and techno-economics, but within the then emerging field of strategic marketing and its subaltern, environmental scanning. In the spirit of ""The lessons of history"" (Baker 2006) the paper revisits scenarios generated by the author 25 years ago regarding technological futures in the offshore oil and gas industry. It draws on the premise that understanding can be gained by taking a forecast, a knowledge claim, whose tenure is now over, and revisiting it in the light of the present which at the time of making the forecast was, of course, the future. In the arts this historicising approach to a subject is a necessary conjunction to the development of knowledge on matters of creativity, judgement and interpretation. The cultivation of aesthetic sensibilities takes place through disciplinary frameworks of historicism and comparative interpretation, widely known as 'critical and contextual studies'. This paper is the product of such study. It attempts to set knowledge claims in historical and cultural context, suggesting where critical marketing can contribute. The forecasts of technological development were generated by means of an international Delphi study which was conducted during 1980-1983. The paper reflects on the passage of time and the evolution of the offshore oil and gas industry against the flux and flow of circumstance and event. It discusses localised historical accounts of where and how the original futures scenarios have been found to diverge or otherwise from what has come to pass, reflecting on the framing of uncertainty by broader socio-technical discourses. In this way the paper illuminates the indeterminate and emergent nature of uncertainty and the implications of this for our understanding of decision making in marketing management. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Critical and contextual studies; Historicism; Narrative; Practice; Uncertainty",""

In particular, it draws on Holt's (2002) notion that as 'unruly bricoleurs', consumers kick-start processes of market adjustment and innovation through improvising ways to negotiate the demands of daily life. In this way, consumers can become active players in realising new possibilities for identity construction and empowerment that involve the creative re-appropriation ofmarketer-basedmeaning. To investigate those issues,we turn to a virtual community in the empirical setting of car customisation. Over an eightmonth period, an internet-based methodology generated textual observations of online posting activity on five internet newsgroups attracting those interested in the particular pursuit of car modification. Participants used those web-forums to share information, passions, and enthusiasms. Analysis shows that grounded aesthetics function as vehicles for creativity and the reworking of dominant market logics (Vargo & Lusch, 2004). We conclude that online discussion threads offer valuable access to the emergent interplay of discursive resources in circulation among virtual communities and that this has implications for the conduct of environmental scanning. The paper illustrates how the discursive resource-base is nurtured, sustained, and transformed through various interpellations, including performing claims to prestige and self-defining distinctions, as well as constructing narratives of personal history and social dynamics. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Aesthetics; Consumer creativity; Consumer resistance; Debadging; Debranding rituals",""

Through the advent of the Internet, regional news media are experiencing a revolution in their production and administrative processes, such that their survival depends on their ability to find a workable online business model. A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen journalists now delivers - but rarely edits - content for all media platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing structure of regional news industries, are radically changing the ways in which a news-media organisation functions and achieves profitability. Our research seeks to answer the question of how the Internet is impacting on producer/consumer value activities in the regional news media. To answer this question, 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted at three regional newspapers, followed by a focus group with London-based newsmedia organisations (including radio and television) and bloggers, which aimed to expand our analysis from its initial focus on the impact of the Internet on print media (paid-for and free newspapers) to that of online cocreation activities. Our findings show that regional news media face fierce competition for audience and advertising from an ever-growing host of other media and advertising mediums, both new and traditional. There is a strategic gap in terms of media organisations' use of the Internet (despite their developing multimedia portfolios) such that they are not fully harnessing the unique potential of social media to deliver engaging user experiences. Regional news-media organisations will probably continue to survive if they can fill the strategic gap through online marketing operations, which offer a highly personalised and 'hyper local' community service with instant interaction and self-organising co-creation activities. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Co-creation; Regional news media; Service-Dominant Logic; Web 2.0",""

New strategic thinking logic and initiatives require a conceptual framework to guide obtaining information, perceptive interpretation of strategic issues and trends, and choice of the right strategic initiatives. The conceptualisation begins by determining the market-based strategic capabilities needed to identify the nature and scope of determinants of market changes. These changes must be identified, driven by new competition, new business models, and creativity and innovation. Understanding fast changing markets requires identifying new market space, conducting strategic segmentation analysis, and determining customer value requirements.

Second, attempts to standardise ethics into marketable products are explored. Third, the possibilities offered by a reflexive take on marketing ethics are analysed. The paper addresses these three issues by drawing together and interrogating ideas from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and marketing. A thorough-going reflexive scepticism is adopted which leaves nothing taken for granted, addressing the nature of what might be meant by, for example, products and marketing and the world to which they aspire. Furthermore, an STS-inspired inversion is performed on marketing. In place of a conventional notion that marketing involves 'launching' products into the world, comes a notion that marketing could be considered as 'launching' a version of the world into the product. This opens up opportunities for exploring possible tensions between reflexive scepticism and ethics.

Drawing on literature from educational philosophy and the work of Emmanuel Levinas, we argue that the conceptualisation of ethics in marketing cannot be divorced from the question of pedagogy and the responsibilities of the tutor. This reading of ethics in marketing leads us to suggest that the largely conventional model adopted for the teaching of marketing may be unsatisfactory. Whilst current approaches may provide students with a prescribed set of knowledge and skills, it may by the same token refuse us the moral education that seems to be necessary. The significance for the teaching of ethics in an atmosphere punctuated with the discourses of economic crisis is acknowledged. We call for a reappraisal of the tutor/student relationship such that we may facilitate a greater understanding of how marketing students can make sense of themselves and of 'the Other'. To begin the process of articulation, we offer an example drawn from nursing education. Through this, we consider the requirements of the capable moral educator and offer initial practical suggestions on how this could be incorporated within teaching. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Higher education and recession; Levinas; Marketing ethics; Moral philosophy and alterity; Pedagogy",""

As global citizens, we face enormous inequities and unprecedented challenges such as global warming and rising rates of poverty. Consumption and markets are at the very heart of our most pressing social problems ranging from materialism and pollution to obesity and addiction. Critical theory is often presented as a conceptual tool designed to engage these problems. Traditionally, critical theory consists of two key moments. The first is the negative moment; here the researcher forms a critique of existing social practices and institutions. The second is the positive moment; here the researcher envisions creative alternatives to the status quo. In this article, the authors argue that there is a third moment called critical participation. This third moment encourages the researcher to participate in theoretically inspired social change. The article develops the third moment by discussing the role of the public intellectual, critical practice in teaching, and critical practice in research. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","",""

There has been relatively little reported research into the differential effects of positive and negative emotions, and furthermore, whether emotions act differently on core and secondary components of a service offer. This paper reports on a study of 513 theatre guests. The research framework distinguished between a core service offer, operationalised here as a musical performed onstage, and the secondary service offer, which in this context referred to supporting facilities available at the venue. The analysis showed evidence that emotions have a differential effect on satisfaction with the core service (the musical performance) and the secondary service (the venue). While positive emotions had a direct and significant effect on both core satisfaction and secondary satisfaction, negative emotions had no effect on core satisfaction. Positive and negative emotions only had an effect on respondents' likelihood of recommending the core service to a friend. This paper contributes to our understanding of the effects of emotions on satisfaction and behavioural intention, and identifies that emotions primarily work on the elements of the service offer associated with its primary purpose. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Behavioural intention; Emotions; Satisfaction; Theatre",""

However, there is little research exploring the common sociopsychological processes regulating these behaviours. This gap is addressed with a conceptual framework incorporating the discrepancy between actual and optimum stimulation levels as the driver of both the behaviours, and self-monitoring as the moderator of interpersonal influences on these. Findings from a field-survey-based study with retail shoppers show that both the behaviours are responses to exploratory urges triggered by lower stimulation levels. Moreover, high self-monitors exhibit greater impulsiveness in private and seek greater variety in public compared to lowself-monitors.

Two questionnaires were designed for every population. One of them was auto-administrated to a sample of consumers in the north of Spain, and the other one was sent to a representative sample of Spanish firms. The data analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. The findings confirm the importance that theory accords to the relationship-marketing strategy, and also provide evidence for the importance of complaint management.

The findings suggest that SKU loyalty is a better predictor of consumer choices than brand and size loyalty. Although online consumers are not sensitive to the net prices of SKU alternatives, they are attracted to price promotions. While webpage display has little effect on SKU choices, speedy delivery has a positive impact. The latent class approach significantly improves model fitness and classification accuracy.

Concurrently, the Internet medium characteristics and websites' capacity to store vast amounts of pages, products, and information increase the role and occurrences of exploration during online shopping. Hence, a re-conceptualisation of exploration in online shopping contexts is timely, important, and necessary. This article (1) draws from multidisciplinary literature to develop a new conceptualisation of exploration as an activity inherent to online shopping contexts; (2) further characterises specific and diversive exploration through a qualitative enquiry, which explores the interplay of environmental stimuli and shoppingmotives facilitating each form of exploration; and (3) presents an agenda for further research on the construct. By expanding the conceptualisation of exploration in line with other literatures to encompass both intrinsic and extrinsicmotivations, this paper brings together aspects of information search and atmospherics literature by situating online information searchwithin an environment replete with stimuli. The concepts of diversive and specific exploration provide an integrated and parsimonious theoretical explanation of the manner in which consumers shop online, and the study reveals that both forms of exploration result in important, yet distinct, types of learning, which have so far not been fully acknowledged or leveraged by marketers. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Environmental psychology; Exploration; Internet; Online shopping; Qualitative study; Website exploration",""

I devote considerable attention to the period 1940 to 1990, as this is the historical range of critical marketing literature that most scholars will be unfamiliar with, linking this through citation and discussion to more recently published work. In this way, this paper provides a guide to sources of literature that may have passed marketing scholars by because they violate our disciplinary demands for 'recency' (Baker, 2001).

However, questions remain as to the dynamics of how market orientation translates into intermediate capabilities. This study explores relationships among different types of Internet usage, IT market orientation (the extent to which IT is aligned to manage customer and competitor information and internal activities), and strategic flexibility (firm capability to respond to the need for change). Specifically, use of the Internet for communication with relevant stakeholders, owing to its market-sensing potential, should be positively and significantly related to strategic flexibility for SMEs with more IT market-oriented alignment. The market-sensing potential of Internet communication to impact strategic flexibility positively for SMEs is likely to be lost under low IT market-oriented-alignment conditions. In contrast, IT market orientation should not moderate the relationship between Internet use for transactions with relevant stakeholders and strategic flexibility, given that the typical order taking and processing is a static, routine function for SMEs. Results supported hypothesised relationships. By delineating the type of Internet usage and required IT alignment that contribute to leveraging the Internet effectively, findings hold implications for future research by clarifying boundary conditions for Internet effects. Specifying how and when Internet use promotes strategic flexibility, an important enabler of competitive advantage, helps small business owner/managers better utilise their limited resources. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Internet use; Market orientation; Strategic flexibility",""

Its historical narrative, on the other hand, has been repeatedly challenged: Some doubt whether the marketing concept emerged as late as the 1950s and 1960s. Commensurate with this view, a variety of papers have documented key associated ideas such as customer centricity far earlier in the historical record, from the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries respectively. The purpose of this paper is to contest Keith's own claims regarding the marketing practices adopted during the so-called 'marketing' and 'marketing control' eras. Drawing from the FBI file kept on the activities of The Pillsbury Company, this paper documents the participation of Pillsbury in anti-competitive practices that started in 1958, just two years prior to the publication of Keith's important article, and concluded in the mid 1960s, with Pillsbury being charged and fined for their involvement with a price-fixing cartel.

Set against these longer-run trends, the contribution of this paper is to examine the year-on-year persistence of brand purchasing and behavioural brand loyalty in packaged goods markets in China. Revealed preference data for two product categories (toothpaste and soy sauce) in two contrasting cities (Shanghai and Xi'an) are analysed, with particular attention being paid to whether brand purchasing and behavioural brand loyalty are invariant over a five-year period. Conceptually, the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice and purchase incidence is employed. Analysis shows that patterns found in the Chinese data are quite similar to those reported previously for Western markets, with invariant results over time - notwithstanding supplyside and demand-side changes over the study period. In particular, the double jeopardy effect and multi-brand loyalty are consistently observed in the toothpaste and soy-sauce markets in both cities over the full five-year period. Results distinct to the Chinese market are also identified: exclusive brand loyalty appears to be declining in favour of multi-brand loyalty, and there are betweencity differences in the magnitude of this decline. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Behavioural loyalty; Brand purchasing; Declining loyalty; Longitudinal study; NBD-Dirichlet model; Temporal invariance analysis; Urban Chinese consumers",""

This paper presents the results of a study conducted among 500 Cypriot consumers, focusing on the factors that shape consumer environmental attitudes and behaviour, as well as on the resulting outcomes. The findings confirmed that both the inward and outward environmental attitudes of a consumer are positively influenced by his/her degree of collectivism, long-term orientation, political involvement, deontology, and law obedience, but have no connection with liberalism. The adoption of an inward environmental attitude was also found to be conducive to green purchasing behaviour that ultimately leads to high product satisfaction. On the other hand, an outward environmental attitude facilitates the adoption of a general environmental behaviour, which is responsible for greater satisfaction with life. The findings of the study have important implications for shaping effective company offerings to consumers in target markets, as well as formulating appropriate policies at the governmental level to enhance environmental sensitivity among citizens. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Buyer satisfaction; Consumer behaviour; Environmental marketing",""

In doing so, it provides a dyadic point of view, critically examining the different layers of meaning of relationships as experienced by both consumers and their banks. By analysing 41 in-depth interviews with consumers and bank personnel, it develops a segmented approach to these different relationships, identifying new forms of interactions and their dimensions. Findings suggest that consumer-bank relationships are multifaceted and dynamic experiences made up of 'fluid' dimensions. Unpacking these relationships, two key types of interaction emerged: 'utilitarian interactions' and 'communal interactions'. Within each type, a further set of interactions were identified. Overall, the study illuminates the richness and complexity of the relationship concept in consumer markets and explores the implications of a segmented approach for relationship marketing theory and practice. The study also underscores the importance of an in-depth understanding of the cultural context in which relationships are formed and nurtured, with a particular emphasis on the role of friendship in shaping commercial relationships in the Eastern context. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Banking; Egypt; Financial services; Phenomenology; Relationship marketing",""

Within the last decade, significant advances in theWWW(Web 2.0), open-source architecture, and open-innovation strategies have led to the emergence of a 'new wave' of global firms. For these firms the Internet is a key driver of business development and speedy internationalisation. In this paper, having synthesised the literature on the Internet and rapid internationalisation and on open innovation, we discuss how these new-wave firms leverage value through close collaboration with other firms and co-creation with customers. Thereafter, we provide illustrative cases of these new-wave firms developed using Internet sources. These cases demonstrate how the focal firms have used Web 2.0 tools and techniques to leverage their internal and external capabilities, and become rapidly internationalising firms with fuzzy porous boundaries.

Using an ethnoconsumerist framework, we interviewed sixteen, second-generation Indian women living in Britain, who were matched in terms of their acculturation, socio-economic backgrounds, and level of religiosity. The data analysis showed subtle but important divergences between the religions, with Hindu participants' religion having little influence on their consumption, whilst Sikh participants consumed products that affirmed an ethnic rather than religious identity. In contrast, Muslim participants consumed products that they felt rejected their Indian cultural identity and affirmed their British and Muslim identities.

Using the Swedish grocery market, 34 grocery categories were studied from 2000 to 2004. Data from Gfk household panel data, Mintel database of product releases and face-to-face interviews with consumers are used. The paper uses four alternative measures of category innovativeness capturing different levels of consumer orientation. The study is limited to one geographic market over a four-year time period. Although the panel data are based on the purchase data of 300 households, one of the four alternative models is in part only based on a sample of 59 respondents. The study shows that there is no empirical support for the suggestion that retailer brands have a negative impact on the overall innovativeness in the grocery categories. However, there was a significant positive relationship between growth in the retailer market share in a category and level of innovativeness in the category. Prevalent innovative behaviour - line extensions - does not rank high with consumers in terms of innovativeness.

Thus the conceptual equivalence of 'savvy' across cultures is supported. However, further analysis indicates that a parsimonious 10-item measurement model in the French context may be justified.

Based on a survey of active users of mobile telecommunications services in Taiwan, we obtained the following findings. First, we found that empathy, network quality, reliability, and assurance, but not tangibles and responsiveness, have a significant effect on service quality and value perception. Second, the effect of overall service quality on brand equity is partially mediated by perceived value. Third, overall service quality has differential mediation effects on the relationships between specific service quality dimensions and perceived value. Finally, empathy and network quality have direct effects on brand equity. For managers, our study suggests the importance of identifying key service drivers for building strong service brand for high-tech service firms. The identification of key service drivers could then enable these firms to make strategic decisions on services investments. It also demonstrates the importance of the humanisation of technology for services firms. This study is original in that it explores the path from specific services qualities to service brand equity. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand equity; Perceived value; Service brand; Service brand equity; Service quality",""

To answer this question, an exploratory research study was conducted in the facilities-management industry with business-to-business service customers. The study was conducted in two stages: an exploratory stage that focused on the industry as a whole, and a confirmatory stage that focused on lost customers from one specific company.

It examines the approach of the top 100 European listed companies which have a corporate website with head offices in the UK, France or Germany by comparing their home (""parent"") website with the host websites in the other two countries using a content analysis approach. It finds that companies adopted a ""glocal"" approach which varied according to the country of origin and also to the industry sector. It suggests that a true ""Single Market"" in European corporate communications still has some way to go and that companies need to adapt elements of their internet communications and website policy more fully to cross-country differences and exploit the full benefits of internet-based corporate branding. The study therefore integrates the literature on global and corporate branding and corporate communications and the internet.

Conclusions reached demonstrate how challenging many carers find tourism-marketplace engagement and confirm carers can indeed be considered as vulnerable consumers. They introduce us to a range of circumstances that prompt exclusion and call upon policy makers to recognise the existence of multiple categories of vulnerability in accommodating the needs of this consumer.

Consequently, strategic investments in attracting suitably qualified and skilled employees are recommended. One such strategy is employer branding. Employer branding in the context of recruitment is the package of psychological, economic, and functional benefits that potential employees associate with employment with a particular company. Knowledge of these perceptions can help organisations to create an attractive and competitive employer brand. Utilising information economics and signalling theory, we examine the nature and consequences of employer branding. Depth interviews reveal that job seekers evaluate: the attractiveness of employers based on any previous direct work experiences with the employer or in the sector; the clarity, credibility, and consistency of the potential employers' brand signals; perceptions of the employers' brand investments; and perceptions of the employers' product or service brand portfolio. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Brand equity; Employer branding; Qualitative research; Recruitment; Signalling theory",""

This special issue is motivated by this tension between theory and practice, which has shaped and continues to influence the research priorities for the field. Although many years may have elapsed since Wind's original research agenda, pressing questions about effectiveness and productivity apparently remain; namely: (i) concerns about the link between segmentation and performance, and its measurement; and (ii) the notion that productivity improvements arising from segmentation are only achievable if the segmentation process is effectively implemented.

To address these issues the present study offers an empirical investigation of the relationship among psychic distance, international marketing strategies, and export performance of Brazilian firms. A sample of senior managers of industrial firms in Brazil is used to test the hypotheses. The results reported here indicate that the degree of international marketing strategy adaptation is affected by the manager's psychic distance towards the foreign markets. Product and promotion adaptation were found to have a positive effect on export performance while surprisingly, distribution and price adaptation were found to influence export performance negatively.

A thematic review of the literature is presented in order to reflect on the way various aspects of the literature have developed, and how this has impacted on the current debate. The confusion over the use of terms originates from the way the literature developed over time in different subject areas, but also appears to be linked to the way authors successfully target articles for publication, using terms that better align with a journal's focus rather than necessarily using the most appropriate term for the specific construct under investigation. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Corporate branding; Destination branding; Place branding; Place marketing",""

When the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK said in August that Britain was facing ""arguably the worst"" economic downturn in 60 years which would be ""more profound and long-lasting"" than people had expected, much scorn was poured on his assessment. Time changes views, however, as do facts. In that same interview, he also predicted that two million people would be unemployed by the end of the year, again to be met by scepticism at the time. Now that the end of the year approaches, however, unemployment in the UK has been quoted at an 11-year high, with renewed endorsement of the 2 million figure to be reached shortly. The worst in 60 years comment is now echoed by many comparisons to the 1930s. The economic climate and its associated daily commentaries have changed radically in the past 6 months.

These relationships can be managed through the implementation of specific managerial and organisational structures, commonly implemented via Key Account Programmes (on the supplier side) or Key Supplier Programmes (on the customer side). Underlying this managerial process is an implicit assumption that these important relationships bring some form of additional value to one or both parties involved. However, a dyadic view of how this value is created and shared between the parties remains an under-researched area. In this conceptual paper, we use the multi-faceted value construct introduced in Pardo et al. (2006) and posit that the buyer's or seller's value strategies can be best understood as being internally, exchange, or relationship based. This in turn allows us to analyse the value gained as being the outcome of one of nine generic key relationship postures within any dyadic KRP. We focus on an analysis of so-called ""managed"" relationship postures and identify a number of dyadic activities and competencies that we hypothesise are important in managing such KRPs, and which can form the basis for further empirical research. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Dyadic competence; Key Relationship Programme; Key Supplier Programme; Value management",""

In order to support our goal, we employ the shopping orientation segmentation approach which allows to segment customers in a ""live"" and therefore exploitable manner. According to the findings of an exit survey among retail customers, this study reveals that ""situational"" as well as ""individual"" store-choice criteria do merit our attention as the basis for segmenting retail customers. These criteria, together with satisfaction, can be seen as a conceptual platform based on which retail customers can be effectively segmented. As our findings suggest, the customers interviewed clearly fall into two distinct segments, namely the ""fastidious"" and the ""easy-going"" customers, each calling for special attention from retailing managers in order to obtain higher levels of satisfaction. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Retailing; Satisfaction; Shopping orientation-defined segments; Store-choice criteria",""

Specifically, the simple question that appears to have been overlooked in the literature is what is the compelling reason for a college student to want to own and use a credit card? This paper aims to contribute to the marketing literature by developing and validating a scale that measures college students' choice criteria of credit cards. The findings identify four key choice criterions that were named (1) ""buying power,"" (2) ""incentives,"" (3) ""firm's reputation,"" and (4) ""good credit rating.""

Through exploration of a case study of a finite experiential episode (a consumer campaign to save a local, independent cinema), examples of the use and integration of consumer operant resources are highlighted, and characteristics of successful outcomes of consumer resource integration (the manner of consuming and coconsuming and the interaction with key elements of the external environment) are identified.

On the one hand, it originated in a spirit of critique and dissent which has since been manifest in a rich, diverse and fiercely contested outpouring of marketing scholarship and research. On the other, it is a highly packaged brand with a remarkably uniform identity as a set of universal managerial problem-solving techniques. This paper explores this deep contradiction, positing the notion of parallel universes of disciplinary space, the one characterised by a critical social scientific orientation, the other by a naïve managerial orientation. While such a dialectical figure may lead to some blurring of important distinctions, this paper suggests that an investigation of the historical, political and ideological undercurrents of this bifurcation can contribute significantly to a re-orientation of the disciplinary space of marketing studies. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Critical theory; Marketing history; Marketing ideology; Neo-liberalism",""

This paper explores consumers' attitudes towards marketing and their perceptions of it, reflecting critically upon their views. Since much criticism of marketing focuses on its role in promoting consumption, we also consider perceptions of current levels of consumption and the extent to which marketing is held responsible for them. Based on 29 in-depth interviews we find evidence suggesting the prevalence of negative attitudes towards marketing, especially associated with deceptive or dishonest campaigns, although marketing's informative role is acknowledged. Importantly, findings reveal a limited understanding of the discipline, suggesting a gap between the concept of marketing and consumers' perceptions of it.

Combining prior theory about product characteristics with studies on lifestyle segmentation, the authors show in a large-scale field study that consumers can be segmented into four lifestyle clusters according to their preferences for different mobile charging attributes. In addition, it is observed that the differential effect of certain mobile charging attributes on consumers in different clusters may be related to consumers' perceived functional or hedonic use of these attributes.

Relying on social identity theory and reciprocal action theory, we develop a framework that explores the process of how a firm's online community enhances consumers' brand commitment. We empirically examine how online communities influence brand commitment and subsequent customer behaviour in a field study of over 1,500 members of an existing online community for herbal products. In our analysis, we confirm that online community commitment is a key influence on brand commitment. We also find that online community participants possess stronger brand commitment than consumers who are not members of the community.

Managerial insights are evidenced through a key-informant interviewing method within 10 case-organisations. The results indicate a number of plausible, managerial reasons for not pursuing sophisticated segmentation solutions. An underlying issue is a widely held belief in the adequacy and manageability of gross-level, descriptive segmentation approaches. Market segmentation was also seen as a managerial concept from which to inform decision-making but not for determining it or supplanting it. Segmentation thus represents an important sensemaking tool, often for communicative purposes.

The findings highlight the extent of the behaviour with 50% admitting to partaking in deshopping. The TPB variables can be utilised to manage and prevent deshopping. The results indicate that currently these customers perceive it to be easy to deshop as there are no consequences with the result that such behaviour continues to grow. If retailers were less myopic they would monitor returns more thoroughly and make it less easy for such customers to get away with undesirable deshopping behaviour. The paper makes recommendations for retailers to manage or alter perceived behavioural characteristics for customers, which in turn, would reduce tendencies for dishonesty in customers returning goods for refunds.

This leads to a new stream of COO studies being termed ""hybrid product research"". This paper studies the impact of assembly location on Thai consumer perception of automobile quality. While automobiles assembled domestically (CKD) are considerably cheaper, COO studies have reported that consumers prefer automobiles assembled in highly industrialised countries (CBU). Two surveys were conducted with 186 respondents in Bangkok, Thailand. It was found that a brand with a strong quality image could reduce COA bias when evaluating automobiles from a country with a negative quality image. Consumer ethnocentrism was also studied to determine whether it can play a role in consumers' evaluation of domestically assembled automobiles (CKD). The result, as expected, revealed that ethnocentric consumers exhibit their home country bias by championing locally assembled automobiles. As expected, ethnocentric consumers were found to have lower education achievements and live in larger households but age and income were found to have no bearing unlike previous research. Following these findings, conceptual and practical implications were discussed. This study supported previous research findings and provided two new research scales. Meanwhile, practical implications for automakers are that they need to weigh up the benefit of relocating their assembly plants against a very likely reduction in perceived value due to associations with a country's negative quality image. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Branding; Country of Assembly; Hybrid product research; Image; Quality; Thailand",""

A retailer survey in Scotland is reported that considered availability and affordability of a basket of indicator healthy food items, termed the Healthy Eating Indicator Shopping Basket (HEISB). It comprised 35 items drawn from 5 major food groups. A census of HEISB availability in 466 stores was undertaken in a sample of locations that varied on dimensions of urban-rural and affluent-deprived. Around half of the supermarkets surveyed stocked all the items. Availability of healthy food items was generally seen to be adequate but there were notable variations in availability for specific items. There were large variations in price for the HEISB items across the stores and the survey areas. The total HEISB median price varied by store type. Basket price tended to rise with deprivation with a caveat of the lowest prices in the most deprived areas. Accessibility to a range of healthy food depends more on the presence of medium and large stores than being in a deprived or affluent area. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Food access; Food prices; Food retailing; Healthy food; Neighbourhood retailing; Scotland",""

It reviews the criticism on the 4P's emanating from five ""traditional"" marketing areas - Consumer Marketing, Relationship Marketing, Services Marketing, Retail Marketing, Industrial Marketing - and the emerging field of Electronic Marketing. The paper identifies two main limitations of the Marketing Mix as management tool, common in all examined domains, namely the model's internal orientation and lack of personalisation. It also identifies several area-specific limitations and underlines the need for further research on the issue.

In the very first edition of the Journal of Marketing Management, Keith Blois examined the influence of customers and competitors in the new product development process, concluding that the widely referenced process models were insufficient for capturing external inputs central to the progress from the generation of ideas to eventual market launch and growth. In the intervening period numerous authors have published research on ""product innovation"" with the alternative conceptualisations process centre stage. Much of this research, however, is rooted in theories intrinsically concerned with incremental product development and most of that relating to physical consumer goods. More recently, some product innovation research has turned to the specific issue of radical innovation, concluding again that the traditional ""stage"" models are a necessary but insufficient conceptual framework for analysis. At the same time, the conceptual foundations of marketing have been strengthened by the discussion of the role of interaction, markets and networks.

This has also contributed to a widening gap regarding opportunities to consume in affluent societies. The purpose of this article is to bring attention to the importance of considering economic scarcity in affluent societies among marketers in studies on consumption by using theoretical concepts from welfare studies such as inclusion and exclusion, participation and inequality. Researchers who ignore the consequences of the lower strata in the income hierarchy disregard the complexity of consumption. It is argued that regardless of income, we are all consumers, but with different opportunities and abilities.

The end result is that consumers have developed a new type of resistance to marketing approaches, one that will require second order types of changes in our discipline. Some of the seeds for this change can be found in the most recent marketing panaceas, which have been presented (and maybe conceptualised) using two ideas: 'market with' and 'societing'.

The present study attempts to fill this gap by developing a customer portfolio framework that includes four levels of business relationships, and integrates a resource-based view and industry determinants of competitive advantage. The proposed framework is applied and analysed using data of UK-based food service companies. The main results show that a focal relationship performance is influenced by both industry and resource-based advantages in a business network context.

Digital content is defined as: 'bit-based objects distributed through electronic channels'. A structured analysis is conducted on the basis of a set of questions in order to surface some of the unique characteristics of digital content marketing. The analysis is informed by a literature review, and the exploration of numerous web sites which deliver different types of digital content. The conclusion summarises the unique characteristics of digital content, and associated consequences for digital content marketing. It focuses on the impact of the difficulty in developing a notion of 'value' in the context of digital content, and its consequences for value chain structures, pricing strategies, marketing communications and branding, and licensing and digital rights management. In addition, the customer's experience of digital content is influenced by all stakeholders in the value chain as well as requiring the customer to participate in learning and co-creation of the experience. The potential of the 'value-in-use' notion of customer value as a basis for ensuring that consumers are fully engaged as stakeholders in the content economy is discussed.

Within this case set, market segmentation, using a variety of segmentation bases, is still regarded as essential for customer selection, proposition development and mass communication. Addressable and interactive communications with individual customers, though, are increasingly based on individualised customer analytics and propensity modelling, which aid the determination of the likelihood of uptake of specific propositions.

This American rendition of Halloween has somewhat ironically migrated back to Europe, where it has been readily embraced by retailers and consumers alike. This paper explores the perceptions of British consumers towards the contemporary Halloween celebration.

In this study, 352 graduates who attended a graduation ceremony were tracked over a period of six months and their level of satisfaction, and the emotions evoked by the experience of attending their ceremony were recorded. Satisfaction was observed to be a poor predictor of an individual's likelihood of recommending attendance at a future graduation ceremony to a friend. Furthermore, satisfaction had a declining effect over time. However, the level of positive emotions evoked after six months continued to be strongly associated with behavioural intention.

Little has been written about the need (or opportunity) for marketing to work more closely with the accounting function in reporting value creation or performance enhancements achieved through its activities. And yet, the accounts represent the primary and formal mechanism by which the firm reports its past financial performance, for internal control purposes and to the financial community. In the face of a widening accounting-finance gap (evidenced by growing Market to Book ratios) a closer marketing-accounting communication may allow accounting to increase its relevance to shareholder value without compromising its aversion to numbers involving uncertainty and judgment.

The key idea is that the seller's understanding of identifiable customers' concerns is compared with the customers' actual experiences. The technique combines qualitative and quantitative information and generates results on the incidents, single relationships, and customer portfolio. Empirical findings from two studies when generating the technique are presented in the article. The technique may be useful to account managers for managing individual relationships and the portfolio of relationships.

The paper works from first principles by considering the initial design of market segments which then leads into assessment of available segments. It suggests that segment design and variable choice necessarily include evaluation which can be framed by using the standard approaches to establishing validity.

"Investing in consumer confidence through genetically modified labelling: An evaluation of compliance options and their marketing challenges for Australian firms","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905561835&doi=10.1362%2f026725708X326020&partnerID=40&md5=fcd4aa89f5e42cda74c8be62015cb7e8","A significant number of studies have examined aspects of consumer responses towards genetically modified foods (GMFs). However, much of this effort has resulted in somewhat mixed findings which have not added real value in terms of providing viable directions for international and national organisations concerned with the labelling of GMFs. This is particularly true in an environment where labelling regulation is increasingly inconsistent and may therefore present real barriers to international trade and the marketing and sales of these food products. The aim of this article therefore is to shed light on the extent to which the labelling impositions on genetically modified foods would impact on the overall viability of the GMF industry particularly from an international and firm perspective. To this end, a selection of literatures that cover labelling issues in Europe, USA, Canada and Australasia were distilled in order to better understand the pros and cons of labelling disclosures globally and from these present a platform for future marketing and implementation scenarios in Australia. On the basis of this literature synthesis, we propose that the success of the GMF imperative is contingent on two levels of compliance. First, at the global level, there is need for greater international consensus regarding uniformity of standards of regulation that would allow for fair trade particularly through such bodies as the World Trade Organisation. By implication, Australia would require to adopt levels of compliance that are comparable to the stringent European Union requirements in order to be able to access those markets and any others. Second, we note that at the firm level, whilst production costs in developing appropriate labelling disclosures can be expected to rise on account of higher standards of compliance, these would be more than offset by the increase in consumer confidence as a consequence of the opportunity to make more informed choices. This in turn would generate positive Word of Mouth most likely resulting in increased uptake and adoption of GMFs generally thus allowing for disclosure costs to fall over time. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Genetically modified foods; GM labelling in Australia; GM labelling in EU; Labelling",""

Yet, given the contemporary phenomenon of rapid decline in direct participation in politics, with tumbling party membership rosters, the relevance of relationship marketing and its capacity to re-energise democratic politics has intuitive plausibility. We therefore seek to theorise about relationship marketing in a political context, arguing that the development of a theoretical construct and rigorous conceptual frameworks would invigorate current research on political marketing. We distinguish in particular two approaches - a micro view dealing with specific entity and exchange-oriented aspects, while a macro-perspective will look at the interplay with the wider political structures and the overall political system. Beyond this, the authors are also acutely conscious of the applied perspective and explore various methods by which the concept could be operationalised and grounded in practice. In this article we therefore seek to remedy the literature's remarkable neglect of relationship marketing in politics. There is a crisis in democracy when people perceive politics as something which happens to them rather than something over which they exert ownership, and such a crisis was created in part by the substitution of political marketing tools for face to face contact. These authors thus suggest how political marketing potentially can help solve a dilemma it has helped create. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Campaign examples; Political marketing; Relationship marketing",""

The results using regression analysis demonstrate that these attitudes are driven by differences in psychographics and store image. Attitude toward promoted brands is characterised by positive store image, smart shopper self-perception, need for affiliation, and money attitude regarding power-prestige and anxiety. Private label attitude is characterised by more positive store image, and money attitude regarding retention and distrust. Noticeably, the conclusion of Ailawadi et al. (2001) regarding the indirect effect of demographics on the feasibility of using store brands and national brand promotions via psychographics appears weak, since we conclude that the impacts of demographics on the two types of purchase attitudes are weakly funneled through psychographics. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Money attitudes; Motivational needs; Private label attitude; Promoted brand attitude; Smart shopper self-perception",""

The market orientation concept exemplifies the extant research within the marketing literature in which a firm's interfunctionally coordinated resources are focused on understanding and competitively responding to customers' needs. Within the management accounting literature, a range of similarly focused techniques, interpreted in this study as market-oriented accounting (MOA), have evolved in which information for decision-making is fashioned by the firm's customers and competitors. The findings of an interfunctional case study highlight a number of factors which potentially moderate the adoption of MOA and reveal a space in conceptual linkages between market orientation and contemporary management accounting techniques.

Innovative developments in MA measures and increasing pressure on marketers to ""prove"" their worth, combined with technological advancements in database management are, however, contributing to a need for more effective synergy. An examination of the treatment and coverage of customer profitability (CP) in both the MA and marketing literatures and in a sample of forty textbooks: (i) confirms apparent synergy in CP research, (ii) identifies how each discipline approaches the subject and (iii) examines similarities and differences in the approach to the measurement and management of CP. Both disciplines show a sporadic and variable interest in CP and there is still a long way to go in order to develop consistent definitions, language and application methods for the concept. The marketing literature shows confusion and contradiction in its understanding of this issue but does take an innovative approach to the subject. It advocates the measurement of future customer lifetime profit potential through two closely linked additional concepts - customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer equity (CE) both of which the management accounting literature largely ignores, perhaps highlighting the accountant's inbuilt conservatism and reluctance to wrestle with these more creative and judgement based measures. A conceptual model is presented as a means to clarify the differences between CP, CLV and CE, and to establish a common ""platform of understanding"" both within and between the two disciplines in order that further research progress can be made. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Customer accounting; Customer equity; Customer lifetime value; Customer profitability; Management accounting; Marketing",""

But more than this, it will not simply call upon canonical sources in relation to debates surrounding the marketing concept for the reason that non-canonical sources - that is, periodical material or out-of-print texts that very few people have read or have acknowledged as central contributions to the field - may contain references to debates that have long been written out of the historical record and could encourage us, as marketing scholars, to adopt a more sceptical stance toward what we take for granted historically and neglect to subject to critical scrutiny. This argument is illustrated via the demonstration that marketing scholars and practitioners were well aware of the benefits that accrue from a customer orientation and were encouraged to orient their organisations in this manner by the growth in industrial production facilities stimulated by World War I. This growth meant that production output could be maintained at levels far in excess of consumer demand, thereby necessitating that organisations register and act upon consumer requirements. These themes continue to gain prominence until World War II when there was a brief return to a production orientation. At this point, business and marketing practitioners adopted a critical stance with regard to certain types of consumer research. There are multiple reasons for this. Firstly, the U.S. government became the major purchaser of industrial and consumer goods. Secondly, business practitioners were sceptical of the value of market and consumer research as a result of the failure by pollsters (who were utilising sophisticated statistical techniques) to predict the outcome of the 1948 U.S. Presidential election. Given the conflation of market research with polling research in the popular press and business community, business practitioners were unsure about the validity and usefulness of market research. In equal measure, environmental factors including rising levels of competition, employee specialisation, product diversification and organisational decentralisation would contribute to the (re)emergence of themes associated with the marketing concept. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Foucault; Marketing concept; Marketing management; Marketing orientation",""

This exploratory survey, carried out by means of a postal questionnaire with 678 respondents, uses cluster analysis to derive a grouped classification of e-commerce adoption. Four groups of organisations emerge, which we term developers, communicators, promoters and customer lifecycle managers. Through inductive analysis of these groups we are able to suggest that they represent four stages in the adoption of e-commerce. Five factors found to influence this adoption are top management support, management understanding of business benefits, presence of IT skills, availability of consultancy, and prioritisation of e-commerce. In addition to these factors, several other factors influence the value of e-commerce to the enterprise for any given adoption level, notably perceived risk and customer demand. Further research is encouraged to validate and extend the stage model: further stages are hypothesised, for example, termed supply chain managers and virtual value deliverers. Implications for practitioners include the need to include customer demand information and a risk assessment in decisions on adoption, and the importance of building in-house skills as part of the adoption plan. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Adoption; Barriers; E-commerce; Internet; Small and medium enterprises; Stage model; Success factors; Survey",""

It aims to provide a form of consumer intelligence that captures the flow of discontinuities in the fragmented expressions of marketing, by proposing a critical poetics as an aesthetic form of sceptical reflexivity on brands. Traditionally narrative perspectives of theory and method have prevailed in the storied understanding of brands and consumption. This paper proposes that the inherent openness of poetics in method and representation provides an academic and managerial alternative that combines the big mythical stories and the small real-time experiences of the everyday materiality of brands. The exploration of a critical poetics as a formal 'mattering' of the cultural complexity of marketing artefacts is advanced in two ways: firstly as a complementary mediation of the singularities of marketable meanings in a wider cultural setting and secondly as a critical alternative for a re-textualisation of the brand concept itself. As a critique of existing critical narrative itself, and especially as an alternative for the predictable countercultural mythology against the McDonald's brandscape, new poetry has been purposively written. This is an evocation of the messy multiplicity and ambiguity of consumers and outsiders, in the warm chaosmos and on the far fringes of Birdland. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Aesthetics; Branding; Criticality; Discontinuity; Ethnography; Poetics; Poetry",""

There is, however, uncertainty regarding the antecedents of relationship commitment. The study on which this paper is based focused on four possible antecedents of relationship commitment, namely trust, communication, shared values and attractiveness of alternatives. The study was conducted in the South African business-to-business (B2B) financial services industry. A web-based approach was used to survey 300 relationship managers, while data from 400 B2B clients were collected using a telephone survey. The relationship-manager data were analysed with regression analysis, while structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the client data. The uniqueness of the study is the simultaneous consideration of the perceptions of both relationship managers and clients. As far as could be ascertained, a study of this nature has not yet been conducted in the B2B financial services industry. Based on the perceptions of both relationship managers and clients, the contribution of this study is the confirmation of the important roles of trust, communication, shared values and attractiveness of alternatives in the management of commitment to a relationship from both a customer and a provider perspective. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Antecedents; Commitment; Relationship marketing",""

Firms must use these relationships to ensure that the inputs they acquire are the most appropriate to achieve the desired product. But since not all firms, particularly SMEs, have personnel specifically trained to manage these relationships, or even to manage the firm itself, difficulties can sometimes arise in the management of the firm's supply function. The relationship marketing literature considers it beneficial to establish lasting relationships both with customers and with suppliers. It may be that people who are less well-educated academically are not aware of this situation. Thus, the current work aims to analyse the possible influence of the educational level of the purchasing/supply manager on the long-term orientation of firm-supplier relationships. Specifically, we use a sample of Spanish firms to analyse the moderating effect of this variable on the temporal orientation. Dividing the total sample into two subsamples - ""better-educated"" and ""less well-educated"" managers responsible for the supply function - we obtain some very interesting results and implications about the effects of trust, communication, cooperation, satisfaction and commitment on the temporal orientation of such relationships. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Educational level; Moderating effect; Relationship marketing; Supply function; Supply manager",""

By analysing the case of the FI, based on Foucault's notions of disciplinary and pastoral power, the paper suggests that service marketing practices contribute toward making the subjectivity of front-line employees (FLEs) more proactive. More specifically, the paper suggests that the disciplinary power of service marketing practices generates knowledge of the FLEs - in the present case, that they are reactive but need to be proactive - and that the pastoral power of service marketing practices draw on that knowledge, making the subjectivity of the FLEs more proactive.

The empirical data is gathered from interviews and focus group discussions embedded in three cases from banking, mobile communications and retailing services.

Examples include the emergence of shopaholics, the slavish adulation to buying products on the basis of their leading brand names, violation of the environment, problems of pollution, wastage of resources and global warming. Are organisations so myopic in their marketing that they have become too self-interested in what they produce for profit?

In this model, two stages of consumer choice are affected by usage situations. First, the alternatives included within the consideration set are determined by foreseen usage contexts. Second, the evaluation of alternatives is performed using an ideal-value scheme, which depends directly on the intended consumption situations. This model is validated with survey data and scanner panel data.

The theoretical implication is that personal reciprocity not only enhances consumers' future purchase intentions but also provides an alternative path linking brand trust and brand loyalty to consumers' future purchase intentions.

So far as performance evaluation is concerned, six objections to the use of ROI, five to the use of DCF and four to Return on Customer are identified. Furthermore, the authors highlight the critical and potentially misleading role of forecasts as benchmarks for performance assessment. At the same time, the value of DCF techniques, such as customer equity and customer lifetime value, is recognis ed for planning purposes.

Second, we argue that it may be difficult to influence long-tenure customers profitably. Third, we consider the evidence that increases in customer satisfaction lead to increases in profit for a firm. The connection between satisfaction and profit has been explained as the result of increased customer retention but we find little evidence to support this claim. A counter view is that increases in customer satisfaction affect profit because they raise recommendation and, as a result, customer acquisition.

This paper investigates current marketing practice to clarify the relevance of these alternative approaches using four case studies and a survey of 134 firms. The results do not support the notion of a complete “paradigm shift”. Rather, the findings show that for many firms, transactional marketing is relevant and practised concurrently with various types of relational marketing.

Central to such marketing activity are those technical staff responsible for the delivery of the service, the so-called part-time marketers (Grönroos 1994). Focusing on the health sector in the United Kingdom, this paper examines the attitudes and behaviours of those professional staff responsible for service delivery towards embracing such a marketing role. The data suggests that although the majority of such staff has considerable reservations about embracing marketing responsibilities, these reservations reflect concerns over professional autonomy and language rather than any deep-seated antipathy towards the core concepts of marketing. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This is an industry that has attracted little attention from researchers into professional services, and represents a significant gap in the marketing literature on relationship management. However, management consultancy is an important context for researching relationships as consultancy assignments tend to be project-based and long term in nature and client-consultant interactions are characterised by complexity; value conflicts; asymmetry of information; complex power balances; and differences in perceptions and expectations between clients and consultants. Using a case study approach, consultants' strategic views of relationships; their policies for managing relationships; the opportunity costs of relationship management policies for consultancy firms; as well as clients' views on loyalty and relationship development, are investigated. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The linkages between employee value, customer value and shareholder value, including the research on the service-profit chain, are explored. The paper also explores the extent to which linkage models or enterprise performance models, which integrate these components of value, have been adopted by organisations.

The analysis has shown that three development stages are significant determinants of non-innovative products' performance, namely (i) market analysis and commercialization, (ii) technical development, with a positive effect and (iii) operational testing with a negative impact on performance. In the case of innovative products, four development stages were found to impact their performance significantly and positively, namely (i) idea generation and screening, (ii) internal marketing and training, (iii) market analysis and commercialization and (iv) technical development. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The analysis goes beyond the product concept and develops a resources-and-competencies approach to the market offer.

The present article should be seen as an attempt to contribute to the development of a more general understanding of how consumption (objects) may contribute (on a symbolic level) to consumers’ transitions between stages in their life cycle. To this end, we will introduce and apply an analytical framework that integrates the ideas that (1) objects can support identity construction, because of their signal value or because of their potential to provide the consumer with a certain experience of self, (2) these meanings can reside in either a public or in a more private domain, and (3) these meanings can be vehicles for the maintenance as well as the acquisition of new life roles. More specifically, we investigate the ways in which a pram can contribute to a woman’s transition into motherhood as well as to the maintenance of her new identity as a mother. The study shows that pram consumption offers a broad range of symbolic meanings which women may tap into in the course of their identity construction as mothers. The findings also support the ideas that consumption is related to the concept of role embrace and that liminal consumers rely on consumption symbolism to approach a desired motherhood identity. It is also suggested that post-liminal consumers may have to dispose of products, in order fully to escape any discomforts of liminality. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Consumer identity; Life role transition; Motherhood; Pram consumption; Symbolic consumption",""

Forty usable responses were returned, corresponding to a response rate of twenty-five percent. Correlation analysis of the data indicates that the degree to which partners exhibit both functional and dysfunctional conflict is influenced by (a) the degree to which joint venture partners share strategic and operational fit, (b) partners' level of mutual commitment, (c) levels of mutual trust, (d) opportunistic behaviours and (e) the adoption of collaborative communication approaches. Furthermore, both functional and dysfunctional partner conflict appear to significantly influence the quality of joint ventures' marketing strategy formulation and implementation.

Five pharmaceutical companies are separated out as having their internationalisation strategy affected by extreme turbulence in the industry, resulting in acquisition or merger. The relatively stable environment of the other five companies provides a telling contrast. Internationalisation strategies are found to depend on the company's overall strategy, the immediate context of the firm and its past history of inter-nationalisation.

Towards that goal, this paper considers issues in how to develop, implement, and evaluate an integrated marketing communication program.

To provide macro perspectives -- especially relevant for managerial planning -- we provide criteria as to how integrated marketing communication programs can be designed and evaluated as a whole (i.e. according to coverage, contribution, commonality, complementarity, robustness, and cost considerations).

Despite similarities between the two it is the latter which has captured both public and academic imagination and which, in the process, has determined our preconceptions regarding what service quality might be. Due in part to misinterpretation and misunderstanding, the PBZ model has helped shape a view of service quality that now over-emphasises the functional and under-represents the technical and, to a degree, has encouraged within the marketing fraternity a presumption that 'service quantity' stands proxy for 'service quality'.

It is particularly focused on the concept of marketing equilibrium which is a marketing management correspondence to market equilibrium, the traditional concept of neoclassical economics. The paper starts with a brief introduction to the author's approach to RM. It proceeds- with a summary of the concept of marketing equilibrium. The next section is a discourse on hypercompetition, a particularly intense type of competition that has been observed by several authors. RM offers a marketing theory based on collaboration with various stakeholders through long-term relationships, customer retention and loyalty. In contrast, hypercompetition claims that customers will switch between suppliers at an increasingly faster rate and that competitors will become increasingly hostile to one another. Two basic questions are raised: do RM and hypercompetition represent two conflicting but coexisting trends that are both growing in intensity? and How can this coexistence or conflict be conceptually handled? The aim of this paper is not to be complete and provide an answer, only to draw the reader's attention to hypercompetition as an opposite trend to RM and to offer a platform for further analysis and constructive and reflective scholarly dialogue. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Both stem from the familiarity of the parent brand, the main driver of line extension strategy. For a brand manager, considering the launch of a new line, these two effects create tensions; how can trial be maximised whilst parental share loss is minimised? We examine these two effects in different line extensions in the UK and Germany to understand how trial and cannibalisation interact to affect the success of a line extension. Our empirical research analyses the purchase patterns of buyers of a new line, before and after the launch of the extension, and compares these with the level of cannibalisation. Our aim is to understand the dynamics of consumer response to the new line. The household panel data analysis of fmcg purchases shows that line extension buyers are disproportionate purchasers of the parent brand, both before and after the launch. However these measures of cross-purchase correlate only weakly with the level of cannibalisation (rho =.42 before,.43 after). Whilst a line extension clearly encourages purchase of the new line by purchasers of the existing parent, this leads to additional portfolio purchasing as often as substitution. This provides some proof of the efficacy of line extension strategies in expanding brand sales. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

These methods are reviewed and the main findings are reported. Price elasticities vary in response to a variety of market conditions but there are also product-specific factors that are related to elasticity. The price elasticities of the leading five brands in 100 categories were established by regression. Elasticities were found to be widely spread and 19% were positive. Stronger regression estimates tended to produce higher elasticities. The study also revealed: greater price elasticity magnitudes for new brands; no difference between growing and declining brands; brand leaders were slightly less sensitive to price changes than other brands; higher adspend was associated with lower price sensitivity. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Discussion focuses on the dynamic nature of relationship marketing in the company–how the intent, thrust and characteristics of relationship marketing evolved over 53 years and five eras of the firm's history. In this context, customer loyalty is observed to have an enduring and at times idiosyncratic character. Further, relationship marketing is found to be enmeshed in other competences and capabilities of the firm, and to have an important tacit dimension.

Personal legitimising has two groupings of behaviour, namely “obstructing existing marketing activity” and “driving new marketing activity”. Within the former are the categories of “stigmatising”, “pseudo endorsing” and “smokescreening”. The latter incorporates the categories of “latching on”, “self indulging” and “bragging”.

However, the mechanisms of this relationship have yet to be explored in detail. This article addresses such a gap by proposing a conceptual model that links market orientation to wealth creation in firms. The model posits that a market orientation guides investment in market-based assets that may be deployed to create customer value. The realisation of customer value helps to both capture and retain customers. Quicker and more extensive market penetration, shorter sales cycles, and decreased marketing and sales costs enhance the cash flow of a market-oriented firm. This may be recognised in higher valuations, which ultimately translate into higher share prices and wealth creation for the owners of the firm. This model is used to describe the creation of value in the Major Business Division of BT, a large information technology service company. Recent success in this Division of BT is attributed to the creation of a market orientation and customer value-based strategy and processes.

The authors review the various metaphorical uses of the term and observe that much previous theorising has been based on deductions metaphorically transferred from theorising about human identities, rather than being based on empirical observations. A number of explanations based on these deductions are criticised as theoretically naïve and empirically false. The article reviews these misconceptions and identifies the theoretically as well as empirically legitimate ways to conceptualise the corporate identity metaphor. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Firstly, story is a factual report of events. Secondly, story is myth; a myth describes the storyteller's readily construed version of events. Finally, story is narrative, and narrative is a means of coming to understand events and constructing their reality. The paper reviews extant work in marketing and management fields to show how the analysis of story differs across these three understandings and to illustrate the types of knowledge that can be generated within each understanding of story. The paper argues that, in marketing research, story has predominantly been seen as report and analysed through the critical incident technique and that an extension of marketing's use of story can make a useful contribution to marketing knowledge. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This research aims to explore and empirically test the questions as to what, why and how various relationship marketing tactics (RMTs) differentially influence consumers' decision to stay, or to switch their service providers? It examines customers' perceived level of impact of the various RMTs on their decision to choose service providers. As theory suggests and as empirically validated in this study, switchers and stayers differ significantly in their perceived level of impact of the various marketing tactics on their choice of service providers. The findings offer new insights for both practitioners and researchers. © 2006, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","MARKETING COMMUNICATION; PRICE PERCEPTION; RELATIONSHIP MARKETING TACTICS; REPUTATION; SERVICE QUALITY; VALUE OFFERS",""

As a result, this paper comprehensively conceptualises those front-line employee behaviours which are the most likely to enhance customers' service quality perceptions.

However, within both industries the major UK and American owned firms have to operate under the shadow of traditionally antagonistic relations with suppliers. The current state of buyer/supplier partnering within the two industries is evaluated within this historical context, and the key problem identified is the need to overcome antagonism within the inter-organisational culture.

And, the main focus of their FDI is shifting from North America and Europe to Asia, China being the biggest draw. By the end of 1993, China, when combined with Hong Kong, pushed Britain aside to emerge as the second most popular destination for Japanese FDI and also Japan's second largest trading partner. Indeed, China is fast becoming a major manufacturing base as well as an important market for Japanese firms.

This paper uses traditional and contemporary legend in an attempt to gain some understanding of the consumption experiences and decision-making processes of families. It finds that the modern oral tradition overwhelmingly reflects the worries that parents feel for the safety of their children: fear of abduction, of poisoning, of violence and other forms of victimisation; these parental concerns are highlighted also in many of the more conventional studies used to help ground the theory in this paper. These anxieties in turn shape family consumption decisions in the areas of housing, leisure, food and transport. But although understanding the conditions of late modernity can be useful in explaining the socially constructed realities which families share, the evidence of traditional folklore, dating back before the 19th century, suggests that these worries may yet have a deeper basis. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Child safety; Housing; Processed foods; Shopping malls; Urban legends",""

Consequently, a significant gap remains to be filled before we can understand the impact of negative symbolic consumption on consumer behaviour and the significance of the influence of negative product/brand imagery on the less rational aspects of consumers' decision making. We propose that the undesired end state will function as an incentive to avoid products with negative images. And we would argue that it is through the formation of distastes ~ and the associated consumer stereotypes ~ that consumers are able to identify the undesired end state, and ultimately define themselves. We develop and empirically test a theoretical framework for the relationship between dislikes, distastes and the undesired self.

Whilst a considerable body of literature exists on inter-organisational relationships (IORs), our assertion is that much of this takes an overly deterministic view of the complex and sometimes conflicting situations that profoundly affect an organisation's (and, indeed, a network's) ability to perform effectively. Thus we turn for insight to literature beyond the traditional marketing arena, i.e.to sociology and organisational science. We begin by relating aspects of the relationship marketing (RM) literature to a case context wherein the focal firm operates globally, supplying speciality chemicals to the chemical manufacturing market. Next, a brief comparison between the RM and the rather more inductive network (NW) literatures is undertaken. In a section representing the core theoretical underpinning of our study, Giddens' (1984) notion of structuration is then discussed; in particular how it relates to industrial NWs. Further literature from the management sphere is introduced to illustrate how a structurationist perspective might be taken forward in business marketing research. Thereafter, following a discussion of methodological issues, we describe the case findings. These are presented in the form of ""before"" and ""after"" scenarios which illustrate both intra- and inter-firm issues. Our analysis highlights factors and behaviours which we believe can redirect (consciously or not) an organisation's activities away from any intended relationship building and towards a transactional orientation, despite the long term consequences for the NW. In the paper's conclusions, as well as making some pertinent case observations, we discuss the utility of a structurationist approach to research.

This paper discusses why the Internet is particularly important for small business international marketing. It then investigates how small business network exchange can be initiated and supported using the Internet, which in turn provides a platform for international marketing. It abo explores strategies for carrying out marketing activities on the Internet, considering the different kinds of inter-organizational relationships that exist within small business networks.

Through not having to provide these other features the firm has an avenue to save costs. The firm benefits from the reduced sensitivity in terms of reduced directness of competition allowing it to capture a greater proportion of the value created by exchange. We observe that real world differentiation is a pervasive feature of modern markets, but seems to be largely due differences in distribution and awareness, and occasionally design. Brand level differentiation on functional features is less common due to competitive matching. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Consumers who send unsolicited complaints or compliments to mass marketers have well-established traits that make them naturals for ongoing relationships. Complimenters, in particular, are likely to be brand-loyal and highly motivated. This study explores whether such consumers are treated in a manner consistent with relationship marketing concepts and whether complainers and complimenters are treated similarly or differently. Given a lack of real cultivation of these consumers, marketers may wish to give more attention to consumer affairs units and how they handle unsolicited consumer correspondence. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Specifically, an attempt is made: to examine exporting manufacturer power exercised in trading relationships with overseas distributors; and, to identify differences between two distinct exporter categories in terms of degree of internationalisation, with regard to the level of manufacturer power exercised in such business relationships. Eighty-seven Greek manufacturer-German overseas distributor relationships have been studied from the manufacturer's perspective.

Most senior marketing executives are acutely aware of the costs of this. Analyses are made of such variables as cost per thousand in advertising budgets, new accounts opened in sales management, and coupons redeemed in new product launches. Fewer executives seem to realize the substantially higher cost of losing existing customers. Perhaps this is because advertising, selling and sales promotion are much more pleasurable, exciting, and seemingly challenging, activities. Customer service — including the activity of keeping customers once the firm has them — can often be regarded as somewhat boring, dreary and tiresome. This paper presents a simple model for evaluating graphically the effects of customer defections on corporate financial performance, using data from a real-world firm operating in the business-to-business sphere to illustrate the applicability of the approach.

Marketers need to get close to their customers to establish exchange relationships, and this “intimacy” is achieved using database technology and direct marketing communications. However, in implementing relationship marketing in this way, the potential exists for the use of technology to result in invasions of individual consumer privacy. The literature on relationship marketing and privacy are reviewed, and the findings of six exploratory focus group discussions, conducted in the UK, are presented. The study suggests that what some consumers define as “intrusion” is similar to what has been called “intimacy” by marketers. Nine propositions are presented which reflect the implications of current approaches to relationship marketing in consumer markets. In particular, the integral elements of meaningful relationships are absent or inhibited as a result of consumer concerns over intrusions of their privacy. Thus, marketers need to adapt their attitudes, behaviours, and processes in order to accommodate the participation of the consumer in the relationship. The implications for marketers are identified, and directions are offered for future research. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Much published work on the subject relies implicitly on behaviourist exchange theory to support major propositions. Exchange theory neatly elucidates many RM hypotheses, but cannot explain the failure of campaigns that furnish customers with increasingly generous relationship rewards. Phenomenological approaches which explore the fundamental psychodynamics of supplier/customer relationships (especially the ways in which entities inwardly construct their own meanings for their experiences) represent a powerful alternative to the behaviourist model. A business, it is suggested, is like a person in that it possesses an ego, has a collective psyche, adopts specific ego states, and occupies a particular corporate life position which helps determine the nature of its relationships with its clientele. Core propositions of transactional analysis are commandeered to categorize managerial feelings towards customers. It is concluded that positive self-regard, corporate openness and integrity, transparency of the corporate self, genuine liking for customers, and unadulterated confidence in the propriety of the company's mission are necessary prerequisites for successful RM. Also the firm has to view RM as an entire philosophy of marketing; not merely as a set of promotional practices and techniques. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In particular, the brand manager as the champion of the brand has been under attack, namely, they are too young, inexperienced and focus too much on the short term. Indeed, the entire system of brand management has been questioned in the light of the rapidly changing marketing environment brought about by economic recession, internationalization and changing patterns of distribution. Add to this the growth of corporate branding and it is not difficult to understand the concerns. However, do these concerns reflect the reality? This paper explores the role and profile of the brand manager through a research survey carried out by the authors. The research examined the age, experience and remuneration package of brand managers and looked at their responsibilities, accountability and planning horizons within marketing departments. The results are discussed in the context of the wider marketing environment and trends towards alternative management systems such as category management and flatter organizational structures. It concludes that many of the criticisms are true but sometimes only in part. For example, brand managers are young and well educated but poorly trained. They manage more brands than they used to but have not widened their span of functional responsibilities to include the newer areas of marketing such as database marketing and trade marketing. They spend a relatively short period of time in one job, have short-term objectives and are paid in proportion to the size of their advertising and promotion budgets but are nevertheless usually part of a strategy formulation team. The research also indicates that organizations have been slow to adopt new structures, which is resulting in an increasingly fragmented brand management process. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

While attention has been rightly focused on consumer understanding of brand imagery, insufficient attention has been given to how the firm's managers create, understand and communicate to each other something so intangible as a future brand's vision. We demonstrate how using metaphors in brand design enhances the ability of a cross-functional team to create a coherent brand vision: facilitating both creativity and its communication. Brand visions are vital given the essential periodic improvements and mutations brands must undergo, without sacrificing the integrity and values which drive their purchase. Management complexity arises because brand development happens in a multi-disciplinary environment. Moreover these different managers must translate the intangible meanings held by consumers into very tangible product and service specifications. The role and nature of metaphor in this process is examined in detail.

Benefits supported by the study were that systems can: aid in the use of marketing tools through automated calculations, graphics and guidance; facilitate group planning through support for fast iteration; aid the integration of cross-functional and multiple-level analyses; and form the repository for live electronic plans from which annual plans are a snapshot. Success factors supported were top management support, sufficiently wide team definition, a system that is seen as empowering rather than controlling, and definition of appropriate planning units. The study confirms the potential of software for reducing some of the barriers to effective marketing planning practice. Further research is needed to examine the areas where this study was inconclusive. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

However, the philosophy has evolved to a strategic level where the concept can be applied throughout an organization. In particular, the cross-functional integration of JIT in production, purchasing and marketing can provide continuous improvement and sustain a source of differential advantage for a firm. This paper explores this philosophy and presents research data to demonstrate that the functional integration needed to implement JIT can improve a company's efficiency, quality, flexibility and innovativeness. and lead potentially to the acquisition of competitive advantage and, perhaps, to world-class status. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A simple share order effect (SOE) model based on Luce's Axiom of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) is tested on four different new product launches. Of these, only the product with both a new brand name and a new product format is consistent with the model. In the remaining three cases, all line extensions, the empirical data deviate from the model's predictions. The two UK line extensions appear to be affected by product format; the German line extension cannibalizes the parent. From these studies, it is suggested that radical line extensions do not cannibalize whereas line extensions that have a close fit with the parent are more likely to take sales from the core brand. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The conclusion is that due to new technology and the emergence of more qualified and demanding consumers, the logic is already appearing in a wider range of industries, with interaction in one or more activities in the value-creating process; in design, production and marketing as well as in the consumption and later destruction of products. But, up to now, the benefits are mainly on the consumer side.

Indeed, as any good marketing student will tell you, the marketing audit should be the starting-point for any considered course of managerial action in marketing. Yet, in practice there is often confusion about how to conduct a marketing audit to good effect. This paper argues that confusion does not arise out of uncertainty about what to do, for there is a wealth of accessible literature setting out the steps. Rather, this confusion is seen to be a product of an implicit bias towards means rather than ends in the existing literature. This bias manifests itself in a clear emphasis on the content of marketing audits, i.e. the checklists and questionnaires which facilitate diagnosis. However, the purpose of the marketing audit is not merely to diagnose, but to facilitate collective action in the light of that diagnosis. Thus, if the end of the marketing audit is learning and change, then the auditing process is inevitably an organizational intervention. In this paper, the author attempts to redress the balance between the means of marketing auditing, i.e. diagnosis, and its end, i.e. organizational change. It sets out an approach to the process of marketing auditing that places benchmarks and benchmarking at its centre. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Their current success and proliferation (in Britain) has raised ethical and legal issues about whether they confuse consumers. A set of factors that foster or inhibit consumer confusion adapted from a framework on consumer confusion, were tested on a sample of 50 shoppers at the end of their shopping visit. No incidents of consumers having falsely bought a lookalike product were identified. However, low-price products subject to impulse buying were found to be more likely to confuse shoppers. Additionally, elderly and impulsive shoppers appear to be more susceptible to confusion. Thus, effective brand identification or confusion-protection strategies are more important for the above sets of products and shoppers.

In examining the direct effects of situational variables on mode choice, one variable, socio-cultural distance, was found to significantly influence the choice among export, contractual and investment entry arrangements. As socio-cultural distance increases, firms are more likely to choose contractual rather than investment modes. Three situational determinants — socio-cultural distance, tacit knowhow and product differentiation significantly influenced separate choice dimensions. Resource commitment was primarily influenced by the nature of a firm's knowhow and to a lesser extent, by the socio-cultural distance between a firm's home and host country. Dissemination risk was influenced by product differentiation and to a lesser degree, the tacit nature of a firm's knowhow. Finally, control was significantly influenced by socio-cultural distance.

The internal marketing concept, in a modified form, is the basis for improving internal working relationships between functional specialists by taking a social process perspective. It is suggested that a macromarketing or societal marketing concept can be adopted to provide a way of thinking about customer-supplier relationships in the organization as an open system which is not limited by a “market” characterization. In this way the broadened internal marketing concept can contribute to change management to make the organization more flexible and responsive. A number of recommendations are made for operating such a mechanism and process. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

Of 80 texts surveyed, only 5% defined the term. However 100% of the sample of texts, used the concept of added value. Several issues emerged from the survey. First, there were variations in the use in marketing textbooks, of the term added value. Second, where the term was used, often it was not defined. Finally, textbooks used the underlying concept (for which there is also some variation) of added value without necessarily using the term. This paper reviews the various approaches to the concept of added value, and draws together some key themes in the form of a working model. The model developed recognises the accounting origins of the concept of added value, but arguments are developed within a marketing framework. A key principle of the model developed, is the quantifiable nature of added value. This is viewed as being important, though difficult, where a sales transaction has not taken place. From a marketing perspective, it is recognised that products which have yet to be sold, have potential added value which marketing activity can help to realize. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Under the “Options for Change “, the UK has abandoned certain weapons programmes, while Germany has had the additional economic and social problems brought on by re-unification. The industry's options comprise conversion, diversification or specialization, thus continuing to face structure change and competition from defence imports and “off-the-shelf” systems and equipment. Given the high exit barriers and past “cushioning” of the industry by governments, the presence of skills and know-how to compete effectively is questionable.

As a result, very little is known about the construct itself or its influences and outcomes. Among the factors believed to affect export information use, decision-makers’ awareness of export information sources play a vital role since this awareness tends to reflect the amount of information collected and thus available for use. Another crucial antecedent factor to the export information use construct is the extent to which export decision-makers experience information overload. Furthermore, the main outcome of export information use is believed to be the latter's effect on export performance. This paper thus seeks to shed some light on the use versus non-use of export information and its relationship with: (1) awareness of export information sources; (2) export information overload; (3) export information acquisition modes; and (4) export performance. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This is because in most cases there is an obvious and direct link in the economic transaction which takes place, between the consumers of the product and the suppliers of the product. In such a relationship, consumer preference and consumer sovereignty are meaningful and explanatory concepts. In contrast, in the Charitable Sector, the situation arises where a consumer receives a product or service which is supplied by a charity, but paid for by a third party, which may be a private sector organisation, a public sector organisation or a private individual. This arrangement has often meant that charities have only selectively applied those marketing techniques which are primarily concerned with attracting income from funders to the organisation. Thus a marketing philosophy and all that it implies for the development of an interactive and consumer responsive marketing system, has not been significantly developed. This paper will argue through use of the illustrative example of the NSPCC (National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children), that charitable organisations can enjoy substantial benefits through the wider application of marketing principles to their activities. It will show through its narrow emphasis upon its relationship with the funders, that the NSPCC has created a brand image based upon the problems encountered by the NSPCC, rather than upon the “solutions “ to those problems. This has had the further consequence that the resource allocation and resource attraction systems within the NSPCC has remained separate. A simple model is presented which facilitates examination of this relationship. It will be suggested that this dichotomy within the NSPCC can be bridged through the Introduction of a marketing orientation which will enhance understanding of the relationship between the NSPCC and its funders, and which above all will provide the stimulus to the creation of a communication system between the funders and the children who are beneficiaries of the NSPCC activity. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The objective was to obtain insights into the efficacy of international advertising standardization options. When the rationales behind the international advertising practices of the sampled companies were examined, it was found that the executives concerned brought a wide-ranging agenda to the decision-making process and that factors beyond the specific benefits of standardization influenced their policies. As regards their actual policies, the practice of some form of standardization was found to be widespread, but the practice of total standardization was rare. As such, the data indicate that standardization is a flexible option, with many possible variants, i.e. it can be adapted to circumstances and is not an either/or policy. The paper concludes that the focus on whether or not multinationals should practice international advertising is misplaced, if only because, just as at the local or national level, there will be good and bad international advertising.

A key competitive issue is the way banks manage their existing customer relationships whilst developing their “product” range and service quality to meet increasingly sophisticated and demanding corporate clients. The relationship marketing approach forms the central theoretical perspective on which the empirical work was based. In-depth interviews with the major banks and a sample of medium-sized Cypriot companies were conducted to determine the nature of bank usage and buying behaviour, as well as perceptions of service quality among respondent companies. Interesting differences emerge in the research findings regarding the importance of various banks evaluation criteria as perceived by bank executives on the one hand and by corporate financial decision-makers on the other. The research also identifies significant differences between clients’ expectations and perceptions of bank performance on a number of service quality dimensions. These findings have a number of managerial implications which are discussed in the conclusions. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

Focusing on budget holding General Practitioners, that is those practices responsible for purchasing hospital services for their practice populations, this paper explores the evolving purchasing behaviour of these professional intermediaries. Drawing on empirical evidence gathered as part of a broader study of the purchasing behaviour of GP Fundholders in Scotland, specifically it examines the key information sources and decisional criteria utilised by these professional intermediaries in selecting health care providers for their practice population. Utilising relational models of market behaviour, it addresses both the contextually specific issue of whether the market mechanism within the NHS is achieving the twin objectives of improving health care provision and restraining cost pressures, and the broader conceptual issue of the purchasing behaviour of professional intermediaries within a service sector environment. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Interest in service quality improvement, which had some early and superficial expression as customer care, is being refitelled by a number of problem-solving techniques (with origins in total quality management) and broad-based staff involvement with those techniques (with origins in participative management). These practices are not new but they are now often fused together in one integrated service quality programme. Every industry is now potentially a “service” industry. Every company has the opportunity to design and market its own unique set of service quality solutions to meet customer requirements. This demands practical approaches to monitoring service quality and diagnostic approaches to problem-solving on an on-going relationship marketing basis.

Based on an extensive literature review of pioneering advantages and brand strategies it became clear that the concept of pioneering was not well defined and covered several different phenomena. Existing research did not differentiate between being a pioneer in a new geographic market and product innovations effectively creating new market segments in old territories. The issue this study was most concerned with was whether it is advantageous for a well-established fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brand from a western country to enter a new geographic market as a pioneer. Much of the existing literature and common wisdom suggests that being first in a market is per se an advantage. Pioneering advantage is seen to arise from the opportunity to erect or strengthen entry barriers which would prevent or delay competitor entry, or from behavioural advantages like the “head start effect” giving the pioneer time and opportunity to establish his brand as the reference brand on the top of the consumers mind before competition arrives. Based upon a case study approach using grounded theory this study found that pioneering FMCG brands in central Europe did not necessarily gain an advantage over their competitors who entered later. In many cases, “following” seems to be a more attractive option, a finding which challenges the conventional view. A number of other factors influencing pioneering advantage were also identified, particularly in the context of new geographic markets. These have not been recognised at all previously or, alternatively, have not been recognised as having a significant impact on the opportunity to gain and exploit pioneering advantages as part of an overall strategy. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The analysis of 15 attraction types generated one common perceptual space whose axes were interpreted as underlying competing dimensions. Data were collected by self-administering computer-assisted interviews using the technique of individual grouping which consists of an unconstrained sorting task of the stimuli. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedures were employed in order to reveal a three-dimensional configuration. Besides the direct stimuli comparisons, attribute data were generated for avoiding a completely subjective interpretation of the perceptual map. Individual difference scaling (INDSCAL) procedures were applied for an a priori segmentation approach which resulted in remarkable perceptual differences among the analysed sub-groups. The MDS configuration suggests that despite the obvious unique character of every leisure attraction the descision process for visiting a particular attraction site is based upon a few perceptual dimensions. Implications of these results for marketing purposes are briefly discussed. © 1994 The Dryden Press.","",""

The influence of the retail buyer in the marketing of consumer products has become ever more significant. Much academic research into retail buying has aimed at identifying criteria that affect purchasing decisions but few generalizable findings have emerged due to the context-specific nature of such decision making. In this research a specific context is chosen, that of the de-selection or delisting of products, a topic that has received little attention to date. The results of interviews with 125 buyers, working for large and small retailers, on their reasons for 290 examples of product delistings are reported. The influence of more detailed contextual variables such as the buyer’s age, experience and qualification, the product type, and the source of the product are examined together with a number of reasons for delisting the product. Many of these contextual variables, particularly the size of the retail business and whether the buyer had experience of working in a retail outlet, correlated widely with the relative importance of decision variables. Buyers working for smaller retailers tended to delist because of low sales volumes. Nett profitability, the reason why products should be delisted, was rarely cited as a major criterion. More detailed analysis of the data set using factor and cluster analysis revealed that delisting decisions could be categorized into two types, each defined by combinations of contextual and decision variables. The most important variables in distinguishing between the two types of decisions were the buyer’s age and experience as a buyer (contextual variables) and the decision criteria of nett margin being too low or the selling price to the retailer being too high. Younger, less experienced buyers were more likely to delist products because of low nett margins and high buying prices. Older, more experienced buyers were likely to delist for reasons other than these. The implications for retailers and for their suppliers of both the major and minor findings from the study are discussed. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A key element in the new transfer pricing system was the identification of the real limiting resource constraint on the business which, in this case, did not agree with the basis on which internal transfer prices and some external selling prices had traditionally been established. The new financial, and consequent managerial, emphasis on the effective utilization of this key limiting factor led to a significant reallocation of resources across the product mix, due to the considerable changes caused in relative selling prices of different products.

The common explanation for such occurrences is the failure to recognize the need to change not just policies but also beliefs and attitudes. However, there may be instances in which a preference for trappings rather than substance reflects a more purposive decision process; in particular, procedures and techniques associated with marketing activities may be adopted as symbols to legitimize decisions which are fundamentally political rather than conventionally rational.

The survey was conducted in the high street of Worcester city centre and in the modem shopping mall at Merry Hill. Factor analysis showed respondents to structure their shopping location values using different dimensions (different in the type and number of factors present) between the two types of shopping location. In the high street four significant factors were discovered: service quality, access and facilities, social aspects, choice and variety. However, in the mall three significant factors were revealed: store variety, comfort and convenience, ancillary convenience.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual basis for analysing this phenomenon structured around the idea that suppliers and product users use informational “surrogates” to overcome ex post uncertainty about purchase quality. Many such surrogates are based on the idea at the heart of herding behaviour where prospective buyers group with others, i.e. join a herd, so that they can utilize the observed effects of choices made by others as information to support their own choices. Under such conditions, the “size” of a selling organization’s client base provides a competitive advantage; analogously, the organization’s “age” also provides an advantage. Our ideas are illustrated by references to examples drawn from service industries such as insurance, banking and legal services. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

The method employed initially focuses on the roots of satisfaction research in consumer behaviour, its applications in business and medicine and the potential shortcomings of satisfaction measures. A review of the literature on outcome measures emphasizes the problems that may arise in the general practice setting. A more broadly-based service quality perspective is also discussed. As a result of the review, a link is made incorporating the three research traditions (satisfaction focus, outcome focus and quality focus) into a service quality model for general practice. The theoretical constructs of the model are then related to specific variables. The implications of the proposed model for general practice management are discussed and suggestions are made for testing the model in the general practice setting. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

The article suggests that there are particular problems for consumers in acquiring effective information regarding services, making comparisons on the basis of that information and subsequently evaluating the service encounter.

Retentions are defined, here as the concepts and mental models used by marketing managers when trying to respond to environmental changes. The influence of retentions on strategic orientation and factors affecting how retentions change are studied in the context of how a bank trust department responded to the deregulation of the financial services industry between 1982 and 1984. The dominant retentions held by managers both before and after deregulation are presented, and the events that contributed to the change of the retentions are examined. The results suggest that retentions prior to deregulation focused on external sources of influence and were associated with a defender strategic orientation. Retentions after deregulation, once the organization’s strategic orientation stabilized, focused on critical resources and competitors and were associated with an analyser orientation. The adoption of the new retentions lagged deregulation by several years, and the transition did not match the steps prescribed by the marketing and strategic management literature. Instead, the transition took place through an iterative sequence of behaviours and evaluations more characteristic of the organizing model (Weick 1979). Managers changed their retentions incrementally by enacting small changes, evaluating the outcomes of their behaviour, and letting the outcomes redefine their retentions. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

"A practical approach to maximizing customer retention in the credit card industry","1995","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20144377771&doi=10.1080%2f0267257X.1995.9964335&partnerID=40&md5=d99fd98e9e67fd3dea4d1c193240bd42","One of the main problems currently facing credit card issuers is the increasing number of credit card holders who are using their cards less often (i.e. attrition) and/or returning their cards (closures). This problem is of particular concern as the total number of credit cards held by consumers is declining by approximately 0.6% per month, and the number of new applicants is also running at an all time low (less than 1% per month). Most of the published literature in the broad area of credit cards looks at credit scoring, rather than the need for card issuers to identify and retain a profitable portfolio of credit card customers. The overall objective of this paper, therefore, is to construct a customer database model with the capacity to predict which customers are most likely to close their accounts and to identify certain customer characteristics which can be used by the card issuer as part of a marketing or relationship strategy to maximize retention and increase customer profitability. The database model is constructed using linear discriminant analysis, which is applied to a sample of approximately 17 000 UK bank credit card holders using various behavioural and socio-demographic variables, and tested on a holdout sample of 10 000 cases. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

By adopting an “if-we-were-to-start-again” policy, such elementary questions are currently being addressed in a number of major corporations. Using this approach, the notion of redefining branding policy and practice emerges as a fundamental and, arguably, the dominant core process in business redesign. In this paper, the skills required to manage this new process are delineated as value chain activities. The Integrated Brand, as this core process has been termed here, requires a multifunctional management cohesion if the new doctrine of customer retention is to be realized. Whilst these retention strategies may vary in execution across the stakeholder groups, each serve to reduce replacement costs. By also managing system costs and building primary customer share for revenue, the Integrated Brand organization can emerge with a balanced financial performance and brand equity managed as an asset. Amongst successful re-engineered organizations, price premiums would be an acknowledgment of a superior offer but not a necessity in sustaining this balanced financial performance. © 1994 The Dryden Press.","",""

Its authors, Parasuraman et al., claim that the 22-item questionnaire is a measure relevant to a broad spectrum of services and based on Jive generic quality dimensions-reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles. Design of the instrument involved rigorous methodological and conceptual development, where the latter defined perceived service quality as the degree and direction of discrepancy between customer expectations and perceptions. Further, this construct “perceived service quality”, as defined, was differentiated from satisfaction on the basis of differing expectations measures and a temporal dimension-a global view rather than a service encounter. Since 1988, several researchers have conducted studies using SER VQUAL and/or examined various aspects of the methodology. This paper reviews the criticisms made in the literature and, with reference to a recent study which examined the methodology within a health care environment, questions the value of SERVQUAL to practitioners by highlighting the problems involved in the interpretation of the data obtained. © 1995 The Dryden Press.","",""

The controversy around this practice is discussed, and suggestions for the possible impact on marketing outlined. Many companies are already reviewing the way that they manage their brands, and some are. restructuring accordingly. This may be the beginning of many such changes. The brand valuation and capitalization debate is reviewed from the late 1980s to date. The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has now released Financial Reporting Standards that relate to the discussion, but do not, as one might hope, conclude it. The standards deal with intangible assets generally, rather than brands specifically. Hence the treatment of brands remains ambiguous and open to interpretation. Financial reporting systems, which still seem to focus brands as short-term propositions, are far removed from the way that many marketers and some accountants believe brands should be managed. Therefore, it is concluded to be unlikely that these ASB pronouncements will have created a new order. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A survey of samples of existing shopping centre users sought responses on attractiveness and usage of various leisure facilities. Once the popular facilities had been identified, some appropriate segmentation of respondents showing a high level of interest in a particular facility was required. Initially, this was achieved by standard cross-tabulation analysis with age, gender, frequency of visit, etc. and testing for significance. Subsequently, the same data was analysed using CHAID.

These have ranged from changing demand patterns to wholesale deregulation and market liberalization. International competition and new entrants exploiting technological innovations have also added to the turbulence in what has been a traditionally parochial and stable sector. Under these conditions, it is to be expected that companies would develop a much sharper customer focus and, if they are to survive and prosper, that they would adopt the core principles of the marketing concept. In this paper, the findings of research which tests this assumption amongst merchant banks, retail banks, insurance companies and building societies are presented. Conclusions are drawn which indicate that there is a growing awareness of the need for a marketing orientation and that some sectors appear to be more customer-orientated than others at this point in time.

The research question is: For an identical good (same manufacturer, same brand), do consumers belonging to lower social classes ask for a larger price discount than higher social status consumers when they are offered the opportunity to switch from a country of manufacture whose quality image is well established, to a country of manufacture, the image of which is more uncertain (e.g. South Korea)? A structural equations model is used to highlight the fact that social status has only an indirect influence on the discounts for shifting to lower-image countries. The relatively weak image of Korean products (at least against Germany and Japan) tends to result in higher price rebates asked for the Korean manufacturing origin. But lower social status consumers evaluate Korea more positively as a country-of-origin. The normative recommendation for the advertising strategy of “cheap” origins’ goods in highly developed markets would be to put emphasis on quality rather than price, especially when modest consumers and lower classes are explicitly targeted. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), by building a customized hierarchy to represent each problem, leads to the likely identification of all key components affecting decision-making, which contrasts with “seat of the pants” decisions. The most important objectives and alternatives at each hierarchical level are determined through trading off preferences. This can also help reconcile group conflict. Data collection using AHP involves each decision maker determining their relative intensity of preferences by uniquely combining quantitative and qualitative data on to a single scale. To reduce tedium, appropriate software can significantly speed up results. Furthermore, the ability to calculate and present results at each decision level can be used to support, persuade and justify proposed outcomes to top management.

Analysis of long-term buyer-seller relationships has drawn heavily on the literature of social psychology, especially in making comparisons with family relationships. It has been proposed that buyer-seller relationships go through some form of lifecycle, paralleling cyclical relationships in other areas of human activity. However, models of the evolutionary development of buyer-seller relationships have remained largely theoretical, with little empirical validation of the life cycle concept, or analysis of the changing composition of a relationship as it progresses through a life cycle. This paper provides cross-sectional empirical evidence of the existence of a buyer-seller relationship life cycle within the investment services sector. The elements that buyers perceive as being important in holding a relationship together are dependent on the duration to date of the relationship. In the early stages of development, selling pressure is perceived as being a dominant element in relationship development, giving way to judgements of ethical credibility and empathy as the relationship develops. From this initial survey of investment services customers, a number of implications for relationship marketing strategies within the services sector are suggested. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Both the academic as well as the commercial community have shown a strong interest in the conjoint methodology. In the academic literature attention is either directed at methodological issues or is aimed at application issues. A considerable amount of academic research is now available, both in the field of marketing as well as in other disciplines. The methodological developments have been reviewed extensively, as well as the commercial use of conjoint analysis. In the academic literature no systematic evaluation of the developments in the area of applications has been given. In this article we aim to fill this gap in the literature. After a brief discussion of the basic concepts of conjoint analysis we discuss the range of marketing problems which can be addressed by conjoint analysis. Issues to which attention is addressed include among others: (1) strategic issues, (2) segmentation issues, (3) product related issues (including market simulations), (4) pricing issues, (5) distribution issues and (6) promotion and advertising issues. For each kind of issue the applicability of conjoint analysis is systematically reviewed. By classifying the applications according to the research purpose (i.c. the marketing problem) we obtain insight into the areas in which conjoint analysis may be successfully applied. In addition, a brief discussion of the types of products (e.g. consumer durables, fast moving consumer goods, industrial goods, etc.) to which conjoint analysis may be applied is provided. Finally, we also comment on the limitations of the methodology with respect to its applicability. © 1994 The Dryden Press.","",""

Organizational environment, internal context, performance and distinctive competency affect marketing planning only as information inputs for the planning process, not as influences on the choice of process. However, rapid change in environments, in competitive patterns and in market responses all demand action from organizations. Intuitively, we expect that rapid environmental change will require a faster planning process, and that increasing environmental complexity requires more careful deliberation. The marketing planning model does not accommodate such intuition. This paper outlines the case for rethinking marketing planning models, and develops a conceptual framework through which the impact of environmental context on marketing planning processes can be effectively examined. © 1994 The Dryden Press.","",""

This study uses data obtained from an experimental research design, in an attempt to compare the facial presentation of multivariate service quality data. The data set was gathered across two groupings of customers which in turn was subdivided into users and non users of the service which served as input for the preparation of the Chernoff faces.

This paper explains and exemplifies the concept of the charity affinity card by discussing both the history and economies of the credit card and of its affinity variant. Using charity affinity card examples, the benefits that the card issuer and the affinity charity can derive from this type of credit card are contrasted and con- pared. Whilst the card issuers often have a clear marketing objectives, their choice of affinity charity is a key factor for success, as is the way that the ongoing relationship with the charity is managed. The charities enter into these affinity relationships with different objectives in mind, but their own marketing expertise and the quality of the relationship that they establish with the card issuer are critical elements in achieving their objectives.

Perhaps the most significant of these has been the introduction of competition into health care, that is the split of the health service into purchasers and providers of care. Central to this development has been the introduction of general practice fundholding, whereby practices are able to purchase health care for their patients directly from competing suppliers. Those practices which have become fundholders have faced considerable challenges in developing their purchasing function. At the same time, provider units in areas where fundholding has become established face an increasingly fragmented purchasing base.

The inter-linkages are made through four inter-connective elements: human resources, techno logical resources, information resources and financial resources.

In carrying out this research, it became clear that there was a dearth of well articulated and considered thought on the issue of marketing skills. Behind a rhetoric that depicts employers as knowing and discriminating, the emergent reality was of a group which had no clear idea of the particular skills which they needed in marketing personnel. Perhaps even more worrying is the extent to which employers cannot distinguish between the performance of marketing and non-marketing trained entrants to their companies either at the stage of recruitment or when they are in post.

It argues that, despite its success in initiating the modern era of consumer research, cognitive psychology’s very pre-eminence is now a barrier to intellectual development in the field. Scientific progress requires the juxtaposing of alternative theoretical stances with cognitive consumer psychology to encourage an interplay of competing explanations. The paper begins this process by developing a model of purchase and consumption based on a critical reappraisal of behaviour analysis, a psychological paradigm which is antithetical at almost all points to cognitivism. This original model provides a unique interpretation of the major classes of consumer behaviour: maintenance, accumulation, pleasure and accomplishment. The paper considers the implications of the model for our understanding of consumer choice and marketing management. It concludes by describing the research that is now required to substantiate and develop the model further, and its unique comprehension of the nature of managerial marketing. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

It is argued that an understanding of marketing problems can only be achieved when viewed in terms of other preceding stages in the innovation cycle, of which marketing is a key final act. The subsequent presentation of evidence from two recent research studies indicates that marketing has been neglected in a surprising number of the high technology small firms studied, in which there was a considerable reliance on unsolicited orders as a reactive form of selling. It is argued that this lack of marketing vigour is partly caused by a shortage of human and financial resources which frequently stem from expensive earlier stages in the innovation cycle (e.g. R&D). It is concluded that vigorous marketing would increase output and growth in several of the currently reactive instances. Thus, the paper concludes with suggestions for a more pro-active policy on the part of government agencies towards the promotion of sales growth in these currently inactive high technology small enterprises. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

It is argued that this language provides a surer way of becoming customer orientated than an input- or seller-based language. This new perspective leads to a surprising and novel insight about the appropriate unit for fram ing competitive strategy. It also helps in providing a more realistic model of the dynamics of competitive strategy, and the role it plays in achieving profitability.

It finds that the companies who subscribe to what is described in the paper as a “complete marketing planning process”, are further along an organizational evolutionary development path than their semi-planning and non-planning counterparts. While the marketing planning process appears on the surface to be just a series of procedural steps, it does in fact embrace a set of underlying values and assumptions. Only the more developed and mature organizations seem likely to have the corporate culture which is capable of sustaining these values. Corporate culture is often intangible to the outsider, but can be very real to those within the company. It develops partly through the way the company has triumphed over adversity in the past, and partly through the so-called “culture carriers”. These are the influential figures who, by their behaviour, communicate the organizational values they wish to see espoused. Because marketing planning often challenges existing corporate values and attempts to introduce new ones, the process cannot be regarded simply as a neutral, cognitive activity; it is clearly a political process. The problems this poses for executives of organizations and their external advisers are complex and far-reaching. Nevertheless the potential rewards which result from comprehensive marketing planning can be substantial, and make it a goal worth striving for. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Both the proactive and reactive approaches to innovation strategy are discussed in the context of change factors and the sourcing of new ideas for innovation. Four loci of idea initiation are identified, which appear to vary in importance according to industry sector. Although evidence is presented to suggest that heuristic techniques are being used increasingly to enhance creativity, their use is limited both by the perception of their function and the strategic mode adopted by the organisation. The concept of the marketing-centred creative circle is introduced to counter these limiting factors. It is argued that the creative circle offers a bridging function in the generation of new ideas for innovation and in extending the existing stock. As well as performing this function, a more creative and entrepreneurial atmosphere will emerge as lateral relationships develop. With the development of successive marketing-centred creative circles within the organisation, a unified approach to creative innovation will evolve as the traditional proactive and reactive strategies merge. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In particular, the authors argue that the predominating influence of the owner/manager and the managerial and structural features of small enterprises leads to a marketing planning approach that is unique to them and suited to their needs and capacities. This approach, while it encapsulates the fundamental elements of marketing planning and investigates internal and external planning dimensions, allows owner/managers to approach marketing planning with varying degrees of rigour and sophistication. The authors develop a model to make this approach operational. To investigate the utility of the model, semi-structured interviews were carried out with the owners of 68 four-year-old firms and results show that around two thirds of owners adopted a “non-marketing” approach to marketing planning, almost one third were “implicit marketers” and that there were very few “sophisticated marketers”.

The paper further examines whether the marketing concepts and tools such as the marketing mix, segmentation and marketing research can be applied to the internal markets. For instance there are problems with the definition of product. What are internal customers buying? How are they paying? Can customers really be treated as customers? This is especially pertinent as the key difference between internal and external customers is that internal customers can be “coerced” into “buying”. This is because of the contractual nature of employment which gives the personnel function the coercive power to enforce compliance.

The degree of enthusiasm expressed is often strongly at variance with reality. The purpose of this paper is to give a. moderating view on the role of expert systems in marketing. The paper begins with a short review of “conventional” management support systems (MSS). This provides a firm base from which to develop a comparison between MSS and ES in terms of the components of these systems. Throughout the comparison, characteristics are highlighted that might at first glance appear to be uniquely characteristic of Expert Systems but are available in “traditional"" MSS. The present state of expert systems in business, and particularly in marketing are then discussed. Consideration is then given of the strengths and weaknesses of ES and of the match of these characteristics with marketing activities. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Some of the changes in Hungarian retail organization date back to the two periods of reform in 1968 and the early 1980s. Those reforms which in the retail sector were designed primarily to encourage innovation and diminish the bureaucracy of large organizations are examined, as well as the major factors in the economy which continued to frustrate many of their beneficial effects. The subsequent effects of deregulation measures since 1985 on retailing are analysed, particularly the main changes which have occurred in the structure of retailing, e.g. accelerated establishment of private retailers; the expansion of self-service; the forward integration of importers, manufacturers and wholesalers; the hiving off of the small units belonging to large state multiples and cooperatives. In addition, how these governmental market-oriented policies have affected the marketing strategies of some of the major Hungarian retailers, and the relationships they arc now forging with foreign retailers are also examined. Finally, the various entry methods utilized by foreign retailers are assessed, and the constraints in the retail infrastructure which still remain to be overcome if more foreign retailers than hitherto are to be encouraged to enter this market. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Marketing planning in the larger family business","1991","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0039542085&doi=10.1080%2f0267257X.1991.9964162&partnerID=40&md5=2845e0b9046a1923b64a266c12736ea2","In recent decades a considerable literature on marketing planning has accumulated. The larger part relates to marketing planning in big firms with specialized, professional managers. There are books on the subject, like that of Malcolm McDonald which has gone through several editions, and there is also a steady stream of articles in the academic journals. In addition, the marketing planning activities of big firms are referred to by many more writers in the overlapping but broader contexts of “strategic marketing” and “strategic planning”. A lesser part of the literature relates to marketing planning in small firms. The small firms in question are usually very small. Typically they are owner-managed and employ just a handful of people in a single location. The purpose of this study is to fill a gap in the literature by examining a medium-sized firm; a category which seems to have been neglected by researchers. Most modern economies are characterized by a significant group of middle-sized firms, still owner-managed, but with multi-million dollar turnovers. Many of these remain family companies and constitute an important reservoir of business initiative. One such family business is the focus of this study. Given the relative lack of scrutiny of such firms to date, the author decided to conduct an in depth evaluation from within one large, family firm rather than seek by means of questionnaire to obtain information from a significant sample of the group. The results of the study suggest that neither the existing typologies of small firm approaches to marketing nor the formal models of marketing planning attributed to big companies necessarily characterize the marketing planning and management of larger, family businesses. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The relative contribution of expected benefits and normative beliefs in decisions can be measured within Ajzen’s (1985) theory of planned behaviour.

Low response rates form the major disadvantage of the technique and advantages of prenotification which can help to increase response rates are discussed. A limited number of studies exist on the effect of prenotification and its associated costs and benefits. This paper reports the results of an experimental study on telephone prenotification within the industrial sector (n = 235). Results showed that a significantly higher (14%) response rate was achieved when individuals were pre-notified, but there was no significant difference between the groups which were contacted directly and indirectly. Time of day and day of week had no significant effect on the success of pre-contacting. Return times were shortest for the group contacted directly and longest for the control group, but not significantly so. A call duration of around 6 minutes appeared to give the highest probability of response. A cost increase of over 100% per return was associated with the telephone pre-notification technique.

The specific focus of these studies has often been to identify and describe those factors which determine the outcome of new product developments; the critical success factors in NPD. In order to fulfill their objectives, the studies have focused on many aspects of the management of new product development programmes in companies, and attempted to relate them to a number of alternative outcomes. This has called for the measurement of “success” itself. Unfortunately, there is very little consensus amongst the studies regarding how best to operationalize “success”, and researchers have employed a variety of measures, focused on different levels of analysis, sought data from different sources and used different data collection methods.

The relationship between the industrialized world and the less developed countries will continue to be mediated largely through multinational firms.

Because CT arrangements comprise bundles of buying, selling and financing contracts, explaining why firms conduct CT requires explanation of why a package deal is preferred to a set of component contracts. Examination of domestic CT stripped of “international ramifications” reveals the inherent rationale for CT as a desire to hide price discounts and to overcome cash shortages. Questionnaire data obtained from UK and Canadian firms broadly support this. If CT is worth undertaking, it requires effective management.

For corporate clients, a positive and proactive approach by a supplier can enhance a relationship both in the initial stages and later, as the relationship develops. Professional services are no exception, perhaps because, in the longer term, both parties can contribute to a situation where “peace of mind” is the dominant emotion. However, such a generalisation may not be true for all professional services nor over a range of countries where currently, many changing environmental factors such as regulations, image and technology, are creating a climate which may result in different perceptions within a relationship. This article attempts to measure and compare these differences using suppliers and corporate clients of two specific categories of professional services, namely, legal and accounting services, in each of three countries, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It attempts to examine the supplier-client relationships using elements of the Interaction Approach as developed by the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group of researchers (Hakansson 1982). From the supplier firm’s point of view, in tar getting prospective clients and maintaining existing ones in a search for an “optimum” portfolio, the constant monitoring of clients’ perceptions and requirements as an element in generating and sustaining a positive atmosphere should be undertaken.

It then looks at differences between firms based on their level of involvement in exporting, i.e. stage of inter nationalization, and the extent to which they are successful. It therefore substantially builds upon previous research by showing that there are differences between the factors that firms believe are desirable to importers and how their performance could improve with the emphasis and assistance of internal and external change agents. Furthermore, it shows that exporting firms should not be seen as homogeneous and that significant differences exist between firms based on their level of internationalization and their level of success. In this way, the study has implications for UK policy makers insofar as it questions the idea that export promotion policies should be standardized, and offers evidence to support the view that firms with different characteristics actually require different kinds of support. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In this study we attempted to prove whether this relationship really exists. In order to do so we examined the case of an automobile-dealer network. Three different types of customer satisfaction were distinguished: (a) satisfaction with the car; (b) satisfaction with the sales service and (c) satisfaction with the after-sales service. It was expected that all three types of satisfaction would have an influence on brand loyalty as well as on dealer loyalty. More specifically, it was expected that satisfaction with the car would be the major determinant of brand loyalty and that satisfaction with the service (both sales- and after-sales service) would be the major determinant of dealer loyalty. Furthermore, a study of the literature revealed that dealer loyalty might also significantly affect brand loyalty. In the empirical part of the study, customers (n = 416) of. different automobile-dealers of the same brand were asked to fill in a mailed questionnaire. The three different types of customer satisfaction and the intention to buy the same brand of car again, as well as the intention to buy from the same dealer again were measured. The customers were also asked why they would buy the same brand (again) or from the same dealer. In general, the analyses of the results revealed that: customer satisfaction with the car, as well as dealer loyalty are major determinants of brand loyalty; customer satisfaction with the sales service as well as with the after-sales service are major determinants of dealer loyalty and dealer loyalty is an intervening variable in the relation between satisfaction and brand loyalty. Furthermore, it was found that the strength of the relationship between different types of satisfaction and loyalty indicators differs markedly between various market segments (private/business use of car and new/used car buyers).

Successful brands clearly generate higher returns on sales and on investment. But quality and service, rather than advertising, is the best way of creating such brands.

The policy towards brand extension is shown to depend upon the similarity of positioning strategies between current and new brands. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Many academics share similar feelings about what they perceive as helpful devices or methods which should aid and improve managerial decision-making. (Why, for example, don’t managers attempt to assess the expected value of information?) Perhaps the answer is that the academics have failed to communicate both the nature of the technique and its application.

If growth is to be maintained by the ambitious multiples, reappraisal of threats and opportunities and re-shaping of marketing strategies will be needed. Market leakage analysis can be used to show where present and future opportunities lie, and to indicate what sort of competitive strategies are needed to prevail and thrive in post-saturation grocery retailing. Retailers must differentiate themselves from each other, destroying the consumer’s commodity-like perception of competing stores. This can be promoted through the strategic development of store personnel, the marketing-oriented application of technology, and more precise targeting of consumer demands and under-satisfied needs. The author’s Strategic Choice Grid indicates that, through insightful and innovative marketing, UK grocery retailers can avoid the stagnation threatened by saturation. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The aim of this survey was to gain an insight into the role marketing plays in affecting the competitive position of Japanese firms in the British market. In particular the researcher focused on the overall approach of Japanese companies to the marketplace and the process by which they identify and bring products to the market. The broad findings emerging from this study present few surprises, Japanese companies do not seem to suffer from a “sales orientation”, a “production orientation” or “finance orientation” as opposed to a “marketing orientation”. The in-roads being made into the British market are based by and large on a strategy aimed at satisfying customer needs and wants.

This paper describes changes in these issues and marketing response to these changes. There is, however, a marketing challenge which goes beyond reaction to individual issues and specific crises such as salmonella or listeria. This broader marketing challenge is the general increase in interest in food and in food related issues. This paper asserts that this phenomena itself is the greatest challenge to food marketers and further, that in today’s consumer environment, it is a challenge which must be addressed without delay. There is currently a merging of food and environmental/conservation issues along with the general increase in public awareness and information campaigns relating to “green” issues. This highlights the need for organisations in the food sector to take immediate action to rebuild customer confidence in the industry and in producers and in information produced by them. This problem is a shared one throughout the industry and when addressed will restore a more stable environment for competitive product marketing. This paper is presented as a demonstration of the importance of the holistic view of research-of looking at the total situation and pulling the issues or hypotheses in context of the total situation. It draws on a variety of sources, secondary and primary whilst also taking into account environmental factors such as media coverage and the particular history of the situation such as the distribution of the Villejuif list of food additives in 1986.

Companies that have performed exceptionally well on such criteria have, however, proved far from robust. It is shown how the objectives of the firm partly conflict with one another and these conflicts are exacerbated when the firm seeks exceptional performance along one specific measure. Performance in the long run depends upon satisfying several stakeholder groups. A concept of a “tolerance zone” of performance is defined which is bounded by zones of disequilibrium. Within this tolerance zone the firm is likely to be in a position to satisfy its key stakeholder groups.

The rapid technological changes within the computer market further increase the high risk already perceived as the result of the high price tag and the far reaching organizational consequences of such a purchase. An examination of this purchase situation using a perceived risk framework would highlight the risks involved and how those risks can be reduced. A questionnaire survey of DEC computer purchasers showed that personal risks were as important as company risks to the respondents, and that the two underlying factors seemed to be psycho-social risk and personal financial risk. In addition, the probability and seriousness components of all the risk statements were significantly correlated. The most useful strategies to reduce these risks were to obtain a warranty or guarantee and to see the product in operation before purchasing. Several underlying factors were discernible from the risk relievers ratings. These included a clarifying factor and a simplifying factor. Implications are discussed for a best practice guide for industrial purchasers and for the more effective training of the salesforce. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Its aim is to identify and delineate market segments or “sets of buyers” which would then become targets for the company’s marketing plans. The advantage to marketing management is that this technique divides total demand into relatively homogeneous segments which are identified by some common characteristics. These characteristics are relevant in explaining and in predicting the response of consumers, in a given segment, to marketing stimuli. The market can be subdivided by geographic, demographic, psychological, psychographic or behavioural variables. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these types of segmentation variables are discussed in detail in this paper. Kotler (1984) has identified four requirements that a marketer can use in evaluating the desirability of potential market segments, namely measureability, accessibility, substantiality and actionability. Once a segment has been identified which meets these requirements, it is possible to develop a product or service which meets the unfulfilled needs of this segment. A marketing mix can then be devised to reach the segment identified economically and efficiently. A strategy of market segmentation attempts to regain some of the benefits of the closer association with customers which was the strength of traditional business operations. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In short, the greater the change in the firm’s environment, the greater the need to develop the product mix in consonance with the environment. This need for the development and redevelopment of the product mix-which is the essence of product policy-has resulted in a continual interest on the part of both academics and practitioners in innovation and new product development (NPD) (Rothwell et al. 1974, Gardiner and Rothwell 1985, Cooper 1979, 1984, Johne and Snelson 1987, Parkinson 1980). Yet to equate product mix change with product proliferation leads to an incomplete understanding of product policy which eclipses the crucial tasks of identifying and withdrawing products which no longer contribute to the company’s goals.

Using the example of Debenhams, the growth of both credit cards and direct marketing is examined and the synergy between the two explored. Detail is given about the credit card data base held by Debenhams and suggestions are made as to how this information could be translated into effective direct marketing communication.

Also to be found is a plethora of normative expositions of the organisational systems, techniques and procedures that can be used to generate the data and analyses that provide the basis for knowledge of the firm’s market environment (Brownlie 1987). Students of marketing may be forgiven for congratulating themselves that the merit of one of the basic maxims of the subject is at last achieving widespread recognition. The author would just counsel a moment of caution. In this paper he argues that the popular thrust towards environmental awareness may bring about an overriding concern with the environmental appraisal, to the detriment of its indispensable obverse, the internal appraisal. The writer reminds us that survival and prosperity are also determined by the match the firm achieves between its distinctive competences and market opportunities. In doing so he calls for a reawakening of interest in what is in danger of becoming the cinderella function of strategic marketing, i.e. the internal appraisal.

It introduces a conceptual framework which integrates the tasks of defining, identifying and evaluating the firm’s strengths and weaknesses.

It draws particularly on research into experience with partially-integrated applications of advanced manufacturing technology such as flexible manufacturing systems. Analysis of both supplier and user side issues is followed by a brief discussion arguing the need for closer integration at a number of levels. Within the supply side the various actors need to cooperate or move towards other forms of strategic alliance. On the user side successful implementation of integrated manufacturing technology appears to depend on supporting organisational integration. Finally, the novelty and complexity of the technological systems being sold requires a shift from simply selling automation products towards working closely with users in providing appropriate and often highly specific solutions to their problems. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The research was of an exploratory and qualitative nature, involving in-depth personal interviews with a relatively small sample of 37 retail pharmacists within the Greater Manchester and Mersey area. The results show that retail pharmacists in general are indifferent to and reluctant to accept new pharmaceutical products. Retail pharmacists normally are too busy to attend any professional meetings but those who do attend meetings regularly seem to be more innovative, which indicates the existence of opinion leadership in the pharmaceutical community. With respect to the sources of information, commercial sources are useful for creating awareness, but personal channels are more influential in the later stages of the decision-making process. Finally, the results indicate that lack of information and poor communications amongst retail pharmacists, physicians and manufacturers are possibly a major reason for new product failure.

Although the decision on globalisation will always be fairly subjective, a careful attempt to weigh various factors will add elements of reason to the decision. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The findings highlight significant weaknesses in the marketing effort of British companies, these being exacerbated by excessive focus on short-run financial gains. The US competitors, equally concerned with short-term profits, were less committed to the UK market than their Japanese rivals, their market position being in danger of deteriorating further as the Japanese close the technological gap between them. The Japanese were unmistakably aggressive, single-minded in their pursuit of market share and undeniably more market-oriented than their US and British counterparts.

Yet the substantial literature on pre-purchase information seeking suggests otherwise. Relatively little external search or “shopping” behaviour actually takes place. This discrepancy is attributable to the shortcomings of the pre-purchase research tradition which relies largely upon retrospective interviewing and treats each product in isolation, despite the prevalence of multi-purpose shopping expeditions. By unobtrusively observing the behaviour of shoppers in the Park Centre, Belfast, this paper demonstrates that consumers indulge in “shopping” activity, though much of this is incidental to the main purpose of the trip.

As such, marketers would be required to adopt different communication strategies and stress different marketing mix or product features if they were to be successful in influencing the consumer’s final choice. The debate can be classified into whether or not consumers follow a formalised decision sequence of search and evaluation leading to final product choice. If consumers are not prepared to commit themselves to the cognitive and behavioural effort required by this formal process then they will satisfice their decision-making, applying simplifying strategies to arrive at a satisfactory, although not the optimum, choice. This paper reviews the common assumptions of search and choice, suggesting a three- stage model which can be used to guide marketing strategy. Research into the decision process used by consumers in the acquisition of a video recorder is used to illustrate the operation of the satisficing model.

Many marketing executives never consider the very substantial contributions which effective logistics management could make to success in the marketplace. “Marketing Logistics” can lead to success by securing a cost advantage through increased efficiency and by maximising added value through customer service, providing high levels of service at lower cost. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The marketing literature has recently been enhanced by the reconceptualisation of industrial innovation to include the possibility of this customer-active approach. But the accounts of customer-active innovation which have so far appeared confine the role of the user to the development of internally-applied process innovations, leaving their wider commercial exploitation entirely to manufacturers. This article presents a case study of the development of flexible manufacturing systems in a major British company and demonstrates the importance of recognising the active role of users in product innovation. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

It draws on the experience gained from a two year involvement in the design and implementation of a planning system for a large manufacturer, and reviews some of the literature on marketing and strategic planning. The focus is on the problems of managing the interface between strategic and marketing management, and the important role played by marketing information, the Chief Marketing Executive and the planning function in achieving effective and integrated strategic marketing planning. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

By-and-large this concentrates on organisational and management techniques to be applied within the enterprise. Based on a piece of empirical work carried out in a number of engineering-based companies, this paper suggests a range of organisational and managerial options extending beyond the boundaries of the firm. For those firms engaged in product developments which require the expertise of technical specialists choices have to be made about how much occupational control these specialists exert; how much managerial control should be exercised over them; how much of this expertise should be available in-house and how much bought-in; and what relations there should be with government in the training and development of these technical experts. This paper explores these options in the context of a study of engineering designers. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

It outlines the typical stages of the new product development process and then suggests how new product development in service organisations may differ because of the characteristics of services like intangibility and inseparability. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

It is the first attempt to relate some of the classifications used in the business literature to British demographic statistics. Trends in marriage, birth, divorce, death and female employment are examined to show how the structure of the family life cycle is altering. The implications of these changes for using the family life cycle in consumer research and market segementation analysis are considered and a revised family life cycle structure is proposed which increases coverage of the UK population to over 80% of households compared to the average 70% coverage offered by the other schemes. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

He argues that instead of investigating macro economic factors as a cause of the UK’s poor performance, the emphasis should be on the examination of factors within individual firms, for example the lack of commitment to marketing. The author comments on the relative dearth of qualitative studies into marketing effectiveness in the UK, and makes some specific suggestions for further research. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

However, this popularity has still not managed to reduce the misconceptions expressed in the general literature about its use. This article is an attempt to reduce some of these misconceptions. To achieve this, the underlying characteristics of the technique are discussed, followed by an examination of the many reasons, cited by researchers, for its use. This is then followed by a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages as well as the variants to be found in practice. Finally, the article examines a number of considerations that are based on the collective experience of various researchers and which, if followed, are said to provide a better chance of success. The article concludes that, contrary to the general perception that the technique is governed largely by subjectivity, it requires its user to give careful thought and planning to the dynamic process. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Quite simply the conventional model ignores the organisational and human realities facing the planner. This paper proposes an “illogical” but iterative model of strategic marketing planning which is driven by the managerial understanding of the environment and knowledge of what tactical imperatives exist and constrain implementation. The advantages of explicitly recognising this “illogical” aspect of the planning process lie in: Coping better with information demands made by executives in planning; allowing for psychological planning constraints and the obstacles created by the real nature of the manager’s job; and in gaining the implementation of strategic marketing plans, with all that this implies for organisational and cultural change. The argument leads to an agenda of issues to be considered by the executive responsible for managing the strategic marketing planning process. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

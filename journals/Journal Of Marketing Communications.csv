"The power of “Likes”: the effects of “Liked By” and number of likes cues on perceived descriptive norms and behavioral intention to receive the flu vaccine","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165187842&doi=10.1080%2f13527266.2023.2235753&partnerID=40&md5=b7bd5562490612435da37938ae24b1ba","Social media messages promoting vaccination are often presented with information showing (a) the number of Likes received (i.e., ‘number of Likes’ cue) and (b) whether such messages are liked by friends or followers of the recipients (i.e., ‘Liked by’ cue). This study examines if and how these cues influence vaccination intention by implementing an experiment with a 2 (‘Liked by’ cue: no vs. yes) × 2 (‘number of Likes’ cue: low vs. high) between-subjects factorial design with current flu immunization status as a measured moderator. Results from an experimental study (N = 182) showed that exposure to ‘Like’ cues including ‘Liked by’ cue and ‘number of Likes’ cue in a social media post led to favorable behavioral intention toward the flu vaccine through perceived descriptive social norms. The indirect effect of ‘Like’ cues on behavioral intention toward the flu vaccine through perceived normative perceptions was greater among participants without current immunization status while the direct effect of ‘Like’ cues on behavioral intention was not significant. Collectively, the results of this study offer important theoretical and practical implications for interactive health marketing communication endeavors on social media. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","flu vaccine; health information; Health marketing communications; social media virality metrics; social norm theory",""
"Multicultural advertising: Impact of consumers’ need to belong and brand use on self-brand connection and communal-brand connection","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136600743&doi=10.1080%2f13527266.2022.2099953&partnerID=40&md5=4dba66e25f25cbec7fd5254dba2e916e","The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of need to belong and brand use as an identity signal in multiethnic advertising compared to other advertising approaches. The results indicate that consumers’ need to belong has a positive direct relationship with self-brand connection and communal-brand connection for ads featuring ethnically mismatched models but not for ads featuring ethnically matched or multiethnic models. Additionally, brand use as an identity signal had a weak relationship with self-brand connection (with 90% significance) for the mismatched condition but not for the matched or multiethnic condition, and no significant relationship was found with communal-brand connection in any of the three conditions. Moreover, for all three conditions, self-brand connection (but not communal-brand connection) had a significant relationship with purchase intention. Marketing practitioners may benefit from this research by understanding how consumer traits influence consumer-brand relationships in reaction to three different advertising approaches (i.e., matched, mismatched, and multiethnic approach). © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","communal-brand connection; multicultural advertising; Need to belong; self-brand connection",""
"Unravelling relational dynamics between experiential value and customer engagement: Does customer gender matter?","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172071937&doi=10.1080%2f13527266.2023.2261946&partnerID=40&md5=7d0a0fb874005f9dd0fdcbb20191ee04","Considering the strategic significance and contemporary scholarly investigations into the characteristics and dynamics of experiential value and engagement, this study empirically investigates the relational dynamics between experiential value and customer engagement in a service setting. Using structural equation modeling, this study analyzed data collected from 355 customers of selected fine dine up-scale restaurants of North-Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The results corroborate multiple dimensions of experiential value such as aesthetics, service excellence, playfulness, and customer return on investment as critical drivers of customer engagement. The results further reveal a strong positive association between customer engagement and customers’ revisit intention and their willingness to pay a premium price. The moderation results reveal that the effects of service excellence and customer return on investment are moderated by gender, whereas the effects of aesthetics and playfulness remain invariant across males and females. The results were further validated by repeating the study on another sample set. This study contributes by suggesting experiential value and customer engagement as sustainable marketing approaches to service marketers interested in designing fine dine restaurants in ways that adequately attract customers, drive their revisit intentions, and encourage them to even pay more money. © 2023 The Author(s).

This research aims to address this important theoretical gap. We propose that in comparison with the use of revealed endorsing images, the use of concealed endorsing images can enhance ad appeals, which then help increase purchase intentions. However, this effect only happens when consumer confidence is low, and not when consumer confidence is high. Two studies reported in this research provide evidence to support these propositions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","concealed; confidence; Endorsing; experiment; images; revealed",""

Utilizing a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design, the study reveals that individuals with higher dietary restraint associate greater perceived healthfulness with food labels. Furthermore, this perception increases their intent to purchase products across all combinations of source credibility and GM status. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, there was no significant difference in the purchase intent for non-GM products from a low-credibility source compared to GM products from the same source. However, the purchase intent was higher for GM products from a low-credibility source than from a high-credibility source, and for non-GM products from a high-credibility source compared to GM products from the same source. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dietary restraint; perceived healthfulness; Product labeling; purchase intention; source credibility",""

With so-called electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) that reaches a much wider audience, consumers easily express opinions to and access others’ opinions on products or brands, and are frequently exposed to vast amounts of information. While past research separately focuses on the significance of eWOM for consumer opinion, and the effects of information overload on consumer opinion, the relationship between eWOM and information overload has been overlooked. Drawing from the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the present research investigates this relationship by comparing eWOM sentiment across different information levels. For the analysis, 8,213 tweets containing the keyword ‘Bitcoin’ are retrieved and scored for positive, and negative sentiments and polarity. The sentiment scores are then tested for their relationship with (1) the number of articles, and (2) the number of tweets on Bitcoins using the logistic regression models. We find strong evidence that information overload increases both eWOM negativity and polarity. The findings provide further insight for marketers in order to dedicate more resources to information management, and to prevent information overload on consumers. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bitcoin; Elaboration Likelihood Model; Electronic word-of-mouth; sentiment analysis; Twitter",""

Given the risks associated with reputation and sales, companies implement crisis response communication strategies to refrain audiences from forwarding content to others. Despite the positive effects of such strategies, the mechanism that underpins the effects are not yet analyzed in the literature. The current study proposes that in situations of potential online firestorms, brand attitude influences conative responses, including intentions to forward negative content to others. An apology is the response strategy most often implemented, despite others being mentioned in the literature. The current study evaluates how corrective actions compare with an apology in dealing with complaints, with the type of responses being proposed as a moderator of the effects of brand attitude. Results show that brand attitudes following exposure to a crisis response strategy have significant effects on refraining intentions to forward negative e-WOM. An apology is the preferred option as a response strategy in general. However, when specific triggers of complaint are analyzed, corrective actions and apology perform similarly.

Two studies were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of different label messages in different context formats (contextually incongruent commercial advertisements (ads) vs. contextually congruent public service announcements (PSAs); Study 1, N = 332) and different context-induced moods (positive vs. negative; Study 2, N = 334). Findings indicated that PSAs were more effective than ads in influencing individuals’ attitudes toward labels and behavioral change intention. Furthermore, health warning labels are generally more effective than ecolabels. The interactions between label types and context formats, as well as label types and context-induced moods, were also explored and discussed. The current study contributed to the scarce literature on warning label comparison and advanced a comprehensive understanding of warning labels and ecolabels, as well as their effectiveness.

Data was collected from two nations, Iran and the U.S. through an online questionnaire to examine whether consumers’ level of self-identification with global consumer culture (along with other factors) plays a key role in generating eWOM. Findings of this research are supportive of global consumer culture theory in that they suggest that there is a cross-national segment of luxury consumers who are influenced by similar factors both within the two countries and across the pooled sample from both countries. Specifically, we find that in addition to being exposed to global culture eWOM, materialistic and cosmopolitan, self-brand expression is important to this group and contributes to eWOM generation. Our findings suggest that appeals consistent with global consumer culture, can allow global luxury brands to enhance eWOM in a way such that these consumers help to promote their brands. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global; global consumer culture; luxury; materialism; social media; word of mouth",""

For this purpose, a conjoint experiment was adopted as a marketing analysis tool to detect consumers’ attitudes towards different attributes of orange marmalade. The analysis of the overall sample provided insights into the role of the considered attributes, that is, price, fibre claim, Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and organic certifications, in product differentiation and, consequently, the consumers’ interest in the characteristics of orange marmalade. Conjoint analysis was followed by a clustering investigation using Ward’s method to gather more information on the importance of the selected attributes and to group consumers according to their socio-demographic characteristics. The results highlighted the prominent role of price and organic attributes. On the other hand, PDO certification and the nutritional claim provided low positive utility, and they emerged as irrelevant factors in the consumers’ choices of marmalade. The findings provide useful marketing implications for producers to help them design new product characteristics and to better market jam and marmalade. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","conjoint analysis; functional foods; information theory; nutrition claim; Organic marmalade; PDO products",""

An experimental study was conducted to analyse whether two dimensions of brand coolness (popular and iconic) moderate the relationship between type of internet meme (utilitarian versus hedonic) and high-status. After conducting a pre-test, two internet memes were created for each condition, utilitarian and hedonic. In total, 428 completely answers were collected from an online MTurk panel, and the hypotheses were tested using moderation analysis. The results indicate that (i) hedonic brands are perceived as being high-status in the presence of both moderators (iconic and popular); (ii) utilitarian brands can be associated with high-status perceptions, if moderated by the popular dimension. Findings demonstrate that the popularity of the brand plays an important role in consumers perceptions.

Considering organizational scale, the impact was significant for small and medium-sized enterprises, but not for large ones. Contrary to our assumptions, attractive products positively affect turnover intentions. As large enterprises with diverse businesses commonly have an abstract purpose, an overarching purpose should be established and shared by all business domains and a hierarchical structure with sub-purposes should be created.

Several retailers have responded by offering halal products. Thereby, they also foster the inclusion of their Muslim customers as an act of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Yet, consumers are often sceptical regarding the motives of companies for CSR activities. This study addresses the question how the perceived fit between a company and its offering of halal products affects consumers’ cognitive and behavioural responses and how scepticism that the company offers halal products only for self-serving reasons impacts this effect. A total of 212 consumers in Austria completed an online survey. The results suggest that company-halal fit is a key factor in determining how consumers respond to a retail company’s initiative to offer halal food products. We found that a better perception of the company-halal fit results in a more favourable CSR image. This relationship is partially mediated by consumer scepticism about the company’s motives. Higher fit decreases scepticism about the company’s motives, while higher scepticism reduces the effect of company-halal fit on the CSR image.

This research develops a conceptual model to capture how perceived motivations and task-service fit influence brand engagement and enhance brand equity via branded apps. Data collected from 292 mobile app users show that utilitarian motivations positively impact task-service fit, that task-service fit has a positive impact on consumer brand engagement and brand equity, and that consumer brand engagement has a positive impact on brand equity. Conversely, hedonic motivations do not significantly influence task-service fit. This work provides a better understanding of the influence of task-service fit on brand equity via branded apps.

However, only a handful of studies focused on its ethical dilemmas. This experimental work examines the effect of sharenting–sharing content about one’s child on social media–in sponsored social media posts on the ethical perception and the evaluation of the posts. Results indicated that both student and parent respondents perceived the post featuring the child as less ethical when the post promoted an adult-related product. This effect was mediated by more negative ad and brand attitudes and was related to a lower purchase intent for the advertised product. It appears that sharenting in sponsored posts leads to negative ethical attitudes that diminish the advertising effectiveness of influencer marketing when the product is adult-related. However, we did not observe the same effect among parents when the advertised product is child-related. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advertising; ethical attitudes; influencer marketing; Sharenting; social media",""

Complementing DCM pursuits with social media influencers’ (SMIs) brand content can further enhance the ameliorating results. This study aimed to empirically assess DCM’s relationship with consumer brand engagement on social media and how SMI’s brand content moderates this relationship. Through a quantitative approach, the empirical data was purposively collected from 1022 respondents via a web-based survey questionnaire. The findings indicate that DCM campaigns with an information, entertainment, commercial, and emotional focus have positive relationships with consumer brand engagement, except when DCM campaigns have negative emotional elements. Moreover, the brand content of SMIs significantly moderates the relationship between DCM elements and brand engagement. However, DCM campaigns with negative emotional elements have a negative relationship on brand engagement when SMI is a moderator. This study is significant as it empirically tests the interplay among DCM, SMIs, and brand engagement on social media, contributing to the literature on this topic. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand engagement; DCM; Digital content marketing; influencer marketing; SMIs; social media influencers",""

However, this paper uses synergy to demonstrate how collaborative thinking can produce even greater value for IMC. Bringing together the insights of IMC leaders from the US, Europe, Asia and Australia, plus the collaboration of IMC academics in a thought-provoking ideation session, we harness the power of synergy to reimagine and reinvestigate IMC education. With all the changes in technology, business and consumers, it was felt that IMC needs to find a new direction and greater clarity of purpose. And perhaps this purpose is greater than communication alone. Maybe it is a management discipline. Or a fundamental part of university education as a core unit. Our vision for IMC was driven by its technology focus and customer-centricity. IMC is integrated, people-focused, and purposeful communication, based on management practice, and evidenced in academic research.

One of the most significant influences of digitalization on service outcomes is driven by technology-enabled services i.e. self-service technologies (SSTs). Despite continuous advancement of service delivery from traditional methods to modern SSTs, the technology-oriented interfaces differ in their level of complexity which may affect customer satisfaction. Two independent experiments were undertaken to observe customer satisfaction with telephone-based SSTs. Study 1 featured a 2 (Level of SST Complexity: High/Low) X 2 (Gender of Voice Assistant: Male/Female) between subjects design, while a follow-up study featured a 2 (Service Delivery Outcome: Success/Failure) X 2 (Gender of Voice Assistant: Male/Female) between-subjects factorial design. Results confirm the proposition that a higher level of SST complexity is more likely to lead to decreased customer satisfaction and intention to continue using the SST and this effect is more when the telephone-based SST uses a female voice assistant rather than a male voice assistant. Findings of the follow-up study suggest that customer dissatisfaction following a telephone-based SST failure is more likely with a male voice assistant rather than a female voice assistant. Results are critical for customer-centric firms that depend on effective implementation of SSTs. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Customer Satisfaction; Gender; MANOVA; Self-Service Technology; Service Failure; Voice Assistant",""

Several academic studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s to address the apparent friction or turf war between public relations and marketing. The discussion centered on whether public relations should be treated as a separate function or if it should serve as a supplement to marketing. Data was collected from 171 marketing and public relations professionals using the quantitative method. Overall, the findings suggest that despite their cooperation, there is still tension or disagreement between the two professions. The result means that the two functions are likely to have challenges cooperating with each other to achieve organisational objectives, especially, in situations where one is given a higher status than the other in the organisation. Theoretically, more studies need to be conducted from an African viewpoint, including how content marketing is shaping the relationship between the two.

Also, the impact of brand attitude and image on country’s brand equity is identified. However, perceived country brand quality and brand awareness/association are not enough to ensure positive outcomes for an international brand. Moreover, the roles of customers’ individual characteristics (gender, age, and income) in the relationship between country effects and international branding are examined. The results of multigroup analyses show that descriptions of people have a large effect on brand image among old male customers. In contrast, the aspirations of a country had a stronger effect on brand image among young women. This study highlights the importance of managing country image to increase the success of international brand management. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand equity; brand preference; country branding; Country image; international brand",""

A common way to show support for a cause is through a brand promise in which a business shares its intent to support, donate, or act in accordance with an advocacy issue. Grounded in consumer-brand relationship theory, we conducted an experiment with 620 U.S. adults to analyze how consumers perceive corporate social advocacy efforts aimed at reducing environmental injustice. We used a 4 × 2 between-subjects design to test how promise type (symbolic, experiential, philanthropic, or explicit), leadership congruence (congruent or incongruent), and social justice perceptions affected authenticity and purchase intentions. Results confirmed the importance of having leaders whose values align with company-endorsed causes, with conditional support for social justice perceptions and the use of explicit and philanthropic promises (e.g., taking action and donating a percent of sales). We discuss the implications of our findings for leading authentic corporate social advocacy initiatives and building dynamic brand consumer relationships. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Activism; corporate social advocacy; reputation; strategic communication; sustainability",""

Perceived physical anthropomorphism has a positive effect on ECA likeability and credibility. The perceived differences between a consumer’s subjective and actual age and perceived ECA age have a negative effect on ECA likeability. This effect is attenuated by an interaction effect between the subjective age difference and perceived non-physical anthropomorphism: for a given level of the subjective age difference, the more the ECA is perceived as having human emotions and motivations, the more positive the effect on ECA likeability is. ECA likeability and credibility lead to more positive attitudes towards the website and the brand.

A discrete choice experiment was used to analyze young Australian consumers’ preferences regarding white wine and a latent class model was estimated to take preference heterogeneity into account. We examine the relationship between consumers’ ethnocentrism and preferences for wine from a specific origin. Highly ethnocentric Australian wine consumers are found to strongly prefer Australian wines and to a lesser extent wine from New Zealand compared to otherwise identical French wine, confirming a country-of-origin effect. Carefully considering the information to include on wine labels helps to stimulate consumer demand in certain market segments. Producers can use information regarding consumer preferences for specific wine characteristics to put an attractive and profitable product on the market. For instance, Australian wines might have a domestic advantage over similar foreign wines, if this ‘country of origin’ is brought to the consumers’ attention. Hence, labeling wine as ‘Made in Australia’ is likely to increase the willingness to buy wines amongst a significant subgroup of Australian consumers aged 18–38. Adding other specific labels such as gold or silver medals to the bottle can also attract specific customer segments. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; consumer ethnocentrism; country-of-origin effect; discrete choice experiment; white wine; Young wine consumers",""

Drawing on the source credibility model, the study examined the influence of celebrity endorsements on voters’ choice of political party brands in Ghana. Attractiveness, trustworthiness, and expertise were conceptualised as a tri-component construct that influenced voters’ choices of endorsed political parties at the polls. Voters’ political salience was included in the model as a moderating variable, with voters’ age and gender as control variables. Leveraging scales from extant literature, data was collected from 1463 voters right after participating in the 2020 Ghanaian general elections using purposive sampling and the intercept mode.

Using George the Galapagos tortoise as a metaphor for the lack of replication research, it is argued that only by replicating research studies over time can solid theory be developed. For the most part, advertising and marketing communication research consists of non-replicated, one-shot, point-in-time experiments which, once accepted and published by a journal, becomes the litany of the academic community and is then deified by the citation process. The paper begins by reviewing the background of replication research in the marketing communication domain and applies it to current thinking and publication trends. Reasons for the lack of replication research are presented and some conclusions are drawn for those seeking to confirm or challenge existing research. An agenda is provided for the development and publication of replication research. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advertising and marketing communication; agenda; publication trends; Replication research; theoretical development",""

This is well documented in the traditional attitude-behaviour relationship, which is partly due to the exclusion of affective factors in its predictive model. Yet, an inclusive understanding of the antecedents of GCB is critical for effective green marketing communications. This study integrates both affective factor (e.g., emotion) and cognitive factor (e.g., knowledge) to better understand the antecedents of GCB. Data were obtained from 381 Malaysian respondents in major cities, and were analyzed using principal component analysis and structural equation modeling. The key findings of the study suggest consumers’ emotional affinity towards nature and environmental values have a strong direct positive influence on GCB, while the direct impact of knowledge is insignificant. These findings are consistent across genders. Thus, the use of moral and emotional appeal in green communications (e.g., advertising, packaging) appears to induce GCB. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Attitude-behaviour; emotional appeal; environmental sustainability; green marketing; marketing communications",""

Considering the increasing number of different types of personalization strategies that can be applied for personalization, the question rises whether consumer perceptions of these strategies differ when it comes to their knowledge about, and their perceived benefits and costs of these personalization strategies. A US national survey (N = 1,008) examined knowledge, benefits, and costs of OBA and SA. Whereas OBA has been extensively studied in the past, SA is a novel personalization strategy. Therefore, the current study updated what we know about OBA, provided new insights on SA, and was able to directly compare the two in terms of knowledge and perceptions. The results showed that consumers know more about online behavioural advertising than synced advertising. Furthermore, coding of open-ended questions provided further insights into perceived benefits and costs of the personalization strategies.

Interviewees recalled their most memorable celebrity-endorsed advertisements and explained the attributes that made the advertisements memorable. They were also asked to identify factors that marketers would consider in engaging a celebrity endorser and articulate the perceived effects of advertisements with celebrity endorsers. The source attractiveness and celebrity-brand fit theoretical models are able to explain interviewees’ recall of their most memorable celebrity endorsers. Advertising frequency also plays an important factor in advertising recall, which could be attributed to depreciation in cognitive ability and memory. However, when interviewees imagine themselves as brand marketers, a celebrity’s public moral image and civic responsibility become prevalent factors in selecting celebrity endorsers.

The objective of this article is to show examples illustrating that organisational listening on social media may take leaps from immature to mature mainly due to the pressure from stakeholders, not often as a strategic tool of integrated marketing communications (IMC) or public communications. The first example is from the late 2010s, when stakeholders were introduced to a direct route to brands made available through social media. Many unanswered customer questions suddenly became visible and were subsequently addressed. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic, as the second example, pressured organisations to respond to citizens’ urgent concerns. These snapshots of development suggest that what matters for organisational legitimacy is understanding stakeholders’ changing needs. This paper proposes that organisational listening–even in social media–should become a strategic function of organisations.

Nevertheless, several accounts pointing to some deficiencies of the ELM have ultimately emerged. Particularly, the ELM limitations paved the way for the introduction of an alternative model of persuasion, namely the unimodel. In this paper, by confronting these two competing persuasion models, we endeavor to bring about an answer to the ubiquitous question of whether the attitude change phenomenon is better explained by a single- or dual-process. The main outcomes of this confrontation are: (1) the unimodel cannot rectify the alleged conceptual limitations of the ELM, (2) the unimodel does not explain aspects of persuasion that cannot be allowed by the ELM, (3) the qualitative distinction between persuasion processes is very instrumental in understanding when and how attitude change occurs, (4) a single-process view cannot actually advance our understanding the persuasion phenomenon, and (5) the so-called conceptual limitations of the ELM are invalid. Accordingly, the article concludes in favor of the ELM as a major contribution to explaining attitude change and persuasion phenomena. © 2022 The Author(s).

Using the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework, this study developed a model to examine how SMM activities (SMMAs) affect dimensions of customer relationship quality (CRQ)–that is, commitment, trust, and satisfaction–and brand loyalty (BL). This study, which investigated the dimensions of CRQ as mediation effects between SMMAs and BL to telecommunications brands on Instagram, adopted structural equation modeling and obtained data from a sample of 290 Instagram users in Palestine who are telecommunications customers. The findings show that SMMAs positively affect the dimensions of CRQ and that SMMAs are a stronger predictor of commitment than trust and satisfaction. Additionally, SMMAs had a positive effect on BL. The results confirmed the significant effect of three components of CRQ on BL building. The results also revealed that dimensions of CRQ act as mediators between SMMAs and BL. The study contributes to the literature by examining the underlying mechanism of how SMMAs promote dimensions of CRQ and BL in the service industry. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand loyalty; customer relationship quality; Instagram pages; Social media marketing; social media marketing activities; telecommunications industry",""

These developments go hand-in-hand with a rise in concerns related to consumers’ privacy. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of increasing consumer knowledge of synced advertising (SA) on resistance through critical attitudes and perceived surveillance. In two online experiments, we found that increased SA awareness and knowledge generates more critical attitudes and a greater level of perceived surveillance, which leads to more resistance to a synced ad. For consumers without prior SA experience (e.g., through education, work), providing technical information on SA is the most effective in increasing SA knowledge (both objective and subjective knowledge), but personally relevant information could help increase confidence in SA knowledge (i.e., subjective knowledge). These results advance theories of persuasion knowledge, as well as the underlying mechanism of synced advertising effects on consumer empowerment. The results contribute to literacy programs by showing what type of information could help consumers make informed decisions about this new personalization strategy. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study adopts a less developed approach in previous studies and tries to analyse what attributes of a product or service are relevant when it comes to getting a good online assessment of consumers as well as to analyse if the competitive environment of the company also affects the ratings. Based on a sample of 1,870 Spanish hotels and using regression analysis, our results show that vertical and horizontal differentiation, age, and price are characteristics of a product that positively impact the online rating given by consumers. However, pricing of additional features can reduce the effect of horizontal differentiation on online rating due to the different value to consumers of those features. Additionally, the competitive environment also has an impact on the online rating and paradoxically, areas with a higher concentration of competitors allow companies to obtain a better evaluation if the competitors are not co-located very close to the company. These findings can support company marketers to manage consumer online reviews and help marketers in promoting a product. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","age; agglomeration; competition; differentiation; Online product review (OPR); price",""

The consideration of public relations practitioner perspectives has been limited to preferencing earned media and the pairing of complementary media types. Based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 25 public relations practitioners in Australia, nuanced perspectives on contemporary integrated practice were found. Of note, public relations practitioners’ media planning choices were influenced by considerations of and consequences for stakeholders beyond consumers, which led to a risk-based mindset for some practitioners.

Nevertheless, consumers often encounter technology-based food innovations with a certain degree of scepticism. To counteract this scepticism, information about the innovative product is often communicated. However, two elements must be taken into account to ensure that the given information does not reinforce the scepticism: first, the right amount of information and, second, the source of information and its credibility. In order to be able to implement these elements effectively in a communication strategy, this paper uses two online experiments and analyses of variance to investigate the impact of different amounts of information and different sources of information on consumers’ product evaluations (i.e., affective attitude, cognitive attitude, and behavioural intention). Study 1 found that more information does not always lead to better product evaluations. Furthermore, the results of study 2 show that independent or scientific sources of information are perceived as more credible and tend to lead to a higher product evaluation. Moreover, higher credibility measured by attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise leads to a significantly higher product evaluation. From these results, communication strategies can be designed that gain higher consumer acceptance for technology-based food innovations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credibility dimensions; food innovations; information source; Product evaluation; product information; source credibility",""

The findings reveal that despite media communications from government agencies and public bodies about the dangers of smoking and health risks, ignoring or defying such messages are linked to deeply embedded reasons of smokers’ social norms, cognitive factors and addiction to nicotine. Exploring dissonance behaviour in smokers provides in-depth insights into their feelings and attitudes towards smoking restrictions. Participants in the research sample were found to experience acts of social and cultural stigmatisation when smoking bans reinforce negative feelings of non-smokers toward smokers.

A 2 (message frame: gain vs. loss) X 2 (image valence: positive vs. negative) between-subjects randomized experimental study was conducted to address the proposed hypotheses. A total of 285 participants of the main study was recruited. This study found congruency between message framing and image valences affected consumers’ advertising and brand attitudes, and purchase intention. Consumers had positive advertising and brand attitudes toward gain-framing with positive image while they had negative advertising and brand attitudes toward loss-framing with negative image. However, for incongruent advertising, the effects of image valence diminished the effects of message framing. Specifically, regardless of message framing, positive images triggered positive advertising and brand attitudes while negative images lead to negative advertising and brand attitudes, and purchase intention. Last, this study found interesting results about issue involvement as a moderator. When consumers with low involvement were exposed to incongruent green advertising, image valence had stronger effects on their advertising and brand attitudes than message framing.

Using an interdisciplinary multi-method approach combining experimental and computational research approaches, findings demonstrate significant effects of the source trust factor on belief and retransmission intention of rumor-refutation.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of radio airplay on album sales, mediated by consumer social media engagement with music artists. Grounded in the cultural production model, as well as the literature on customer engagement and satiation, we propose several hypotheses. We analyze our unique dataset by structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that radio airtime has a bigger impact on album sales of lesser-known musicians than those of famous musicians. Social media engagement mediates the positive effect of radio airplay on album sales; this effect is moderated by the musician’s popularity such that famous musicians enjoy greater social media engagement compared to their lesser-known counterparts. These results have important managerial implications for positioning and channel strategies for lesser-known as well as for already famous musicians. Our findings contribute to the literature on music marketing, social media engagement, and satiation.

Companies are thus adopting an omnichannel strategy to offer multiple media and channels for use before, during, and after purchase–that is, during the customer journey. The success of this journey requires both effective integration of the company’s offline and online channels and strong consistency in communication terms. In this context, offering a smooth transition between touchpoints along the consumer journey to optimize consumers’ experience requires appropriate omnichannel integration. However, little is known about how to assess customer journey, despite the implications therein for companies’ performance and consumer reactions. To fill this gap, the present paper proposes and validates indicators to measure the extent to which controlled touchpoints are really integrated and oriented toward the consumer and provide a satisfactory customer journey. Focusing on corporate website, brand pages on social network sites, apps, and physical stores as fully controlled touchpoints, we offer an instrument to assess integration and customer orientation, as well as avenues for further extension. Application of the indicators comprising the instrument reveals that integration is improving and customer-centric approach is gaining attention, but still has room for improvement.

This paper argued that the market-oriented approach, the purposeful, coordinated, and strategic use of marketing communication media and tools contributed to the success of All Progressive Congress (APC) at the 2015 presidential polls. The evolution of voter-centric election campaigns indicates that marketing and communication professionals and strategies, rather than violence and electoral fraud, have dominated and will continue to dictate the outcomes of political elections in Nigeria. This study, therefore, reviewed the 2019 presidential election (the next election after the 2015 general election in Nigeria) to establish if the anticipated voter-centric election is evident. With experts interviews, direct observations, and secondary materials, we found that the 2019 presidential election was extremely monetised, violent, and fraught with all manners of electoral misconducts that are antithetical to the principles and practice of political marketing.

As limited or undeveloped PK makes people vulnerable to persuasion, it is crucial to understand which factors determine people’s dispositional PK of sponsored content. This study aims to (1) explore whether individual factors and medium type determine people’s levels of dispositional PK, and (2) identify subgroups with different levels of PK and estimate the prevalence of these groups. Results from a cross sectional survey (N = 614) show that need for cognition, education, age, medium usage, and medium type determine individual levels of conceptual and/or attitudinal PK. Thus, individual levels of dispositional PK of sponsored content depend on one’s ability and motivation to process information and one’s experience with sponsored content. Furthermore, based on a cluster analysis with three central components of dispositional PK (i.e., understanding tactic, self-reflective knowledge, and scepticism), we present four distinct groups: the Naïve (the largest group), the Critical Realists, the Uncritical Realists, and the Invulnerables.

To this date, the effect of tourism advertising on the respondents’ attitudes towards products originating from a particular country and the issue of whether it affects both dimensions of a country’s image (cognitive and affective) have not been studied. The present study responds to these two gaps by developing an extended model of the spillover effect. A sample of 138 Japanese students participated in a pre-post experiment to provide feedback before and after exposure to advertising. Research results indicate that the commercial have created a more positive attitude among respondents in all areas measured. The current study adds to the growing body of cross-disciplinary literature on country image. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","affective image; bounded rationality; cognitive image; country image; Japan; Poland; spillover effect",""

For this study, structural equation modeling was used to analyze the 1004 responses from BOP voters in West Bengal, India. Despite their strong networks and ties, the findings suggest that BOP communities do not vote for the political party helping (social capital) or representing (social representation) them. They do so while their social networks persuades them to engage in clientelistic and coercive pressures. The empirical model explaining the complex relationship of the need for social capital and representation, perceived persuasion, clientelism, and coercion will help stakeholders working with the BOP segment to get a more nuanced understanding of their voting behavior. This understanding will help them formulate programs and policies to improve the socio-economic conditions at the BOP. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Base of the Pyramid; perceived persuasion; social capital; social representation; Voting behaviour",""

The lack of a cohesive understanding and application of branded entertainment erodes its core value, which is to breakthrough clutter and connect with audiences through authentic narrative; thus, the potential for branded entertainment to achieve resonance is depleted. Brand resonance builds brands strategically. This exploratory study engaged the perceptions of globally recognized brand communication decision makers across six continents on defining branded entertainment. We conducted interviews with planners and creators of award-winning branded entertainment campaigns that were recognized by multiple Grand Prix and Gold wins at the world’s most respected advertising award shows.

The purpose of this research is to investigate how varying product visuals affect consumers’ selective exposure, and to what extent cognitive responses to the visual appearance of a product and attitudes toward a newly encountered brand can mediate such visual biasing effects. We demonstrate how consumers generate visual-based thoughts and choose to read reviews that support their newly formed beliefs and attitudes. In addition, we also investigate whether individual differences in the need for cognition moderate the influence of brand attitudes on selective exposure.

Structural equation modeling analysis of a sample of 499 bank customers indicates that low levels of SMA are not directly related to low levels of CSR but are positively and significantly related to low levels of regulative pressures and normative pressures. Also, low levels of regulative pressures and normative pressures are significantly related to low levels of CSR. Furthermore, the results indicate that low levels of CSR are negatively and significantly related to high levels of corporate hypocrisy.

However, Narrative Paradigm Theory suggests that consumers think narratively rather than argumentatively. Therefore, it is likely that story-form content may result in stronger narrative believability and purchase intention and that this effect may be influenced by different degrees of objective product knowledge. To investigate these outcomes, fact-based and story-form website content is used in an experiment featuring smart TVs. Participants are allocated to treatment groups and complete an identical questionnaire that captures objective knowledge, narrative believability, and purchase intention. MANCOVA via multivariate generalized linear modelling is employed to determine the effect of the treatment on the investigated outcomes.

This study aims to investigate the impact of these factors on consumers’ brand attitude and purchase intention in the car industry by uncovering the moderating role of brand origin and gender via a non-linear structural equation modelling approach. The survey approach is applied as the primary data collection method through which a total of 381 usable responses were obtained. Nonlinear structural equation modelling is employed to examine the hypothesized relationships among the latent variables. In addition, a synergic statistical approach is also applied to compare the proposed and rival models. Surprisingly, the study unveiled that the relationships between consumers’ need for uniqueness and consumer purchase intention are only significant at the moderate to high level, not at the lower level. The same effect is detected in the relationship between consumer brand identification and brand attitude. The outcomes of the multi-group analysis show that the hypothesized relationships among all variables vary across gender and brand origin. Furthermore, based on the statistical results and the theoretical argument presented, the rival model is accepted in favour of the initial proposed model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand attitude; brand origin; brand personality; consumer brand identification; consumers’ need for uniqueness; Non-linear relationships",""

In the present work, we undertake three empirical studies examining the interactive effect of unsponsored, user-generated content and accompanying social media user comments on readers’ vaccination-related decisions. Findings suggest that the influence of unsponsored content is an interactive function of the valence of the content, the valence of accompanying comments, and consumer perceptions of the commenter’s level of credibility.

The main purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) examine how ad model-viewer body size gap influences advertising evaluation and (b) investigate the roles of affect and comparison tendency during the persuasion process. We randomly assigned 358 female participants to one of three fictitious ads, each of which featured a model with a different body size: (a) thin, (b) normal, or (c) heavy. The results revealed that the participants were more likely to report positive attitude toward the ad, which tends to increase purchase intention, when they were exposed to ad models larger than their own body size. A modified direct effect moderation analysis showed that the effect of model-viewer body size gap on ad evaluation was mediated by affect and contingent upon the level of comparison tendency.

The increasing appearance of highly intrusive advertising formats resulted in an extraordinarily growth of ad blocking systems. To fight the economic costs of the ad blocker phenomenon, the most relevant agents of the industry have created a never seen Coalition for Better Ads including marketers, publishers, and agencies worldwide. This article analyses the experiments carried out by the Coalition to create Better Ads Standards establishing the limits of ad format intrusiveness to be implemented worldwide by means of self-regulation. Based on classical and current approaches to advertising ethics, this work explains that highly annoying ads should not only be banned for practical reasons but for overpassing ethical limits in terms of respect for the persuadee, equity of the persuasive appeal, and social responsibility for the common good. A basic exploratory replication study is presented to simulate further research on the ethical limits of intrusive advertising. Establishing which ad formats are allowed to continue and which ones should gradually disappear is such a relevant process for many stakeholders that it requires further discussion by consumers and scholars. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advertising ethics; advertising formats; intrusiveness; Online advertising; self-regulation; standards",""

Findings from an empirical study regarding the French luxury brand Hermes indicate that corporate identity is a significant predictor of which CSR practices consumers evaluate as important. As well that, consumer attitude mediates the latter effect. The current research thereby stresses the need for luxury brand managers to link CSR practices to corporate identity and to acknowledge how consumers’ attitude can affect this relationship. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer attitude; Corporate identity; corporate social responsibility practices; ethical luxury; sustainable luxury",""

The major objectives of the paper are to find out how the party framed itself ahead of its rivals and what their key messages were. A multi-theoretical approach gleaned from political advertising, de-colonial theory, and sign theory was used as a conceptual framework. In answering given objectives, the study used social semiotics and critical discourse analysis to unearth different narratives and messages the party was selling to the electorate. The study finds that ZANU-PF framed their presidential candidate as visionary while the party was promising the electorate an improved economic environment which was hinged on re-engaging the country’s former colonisers and erstwhile enemies, the West. The party also promised a socio-political environment where Zimbabweans regardless of race, ethnicity, and tribe can co-exist peacefully, a phenomenon which was foreign during Mugabe’s reign. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","billboards; elections; Political advertising; political communication; Zimbabwe",""

The study utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze 2357 pieces of primary data collected as samples from voters in Bangladesh. To prepare the questionnaire, authors created a pool of relevant items (through recent studies found in Google scholars) and tested the content validity through literature review, expert opinion of five academics, comments of three political scientists, and pilot study. Results of the study revealed that all political marketing dimensions of the model influence WOM sharing and WOM recommendation. The study also found a significant influence of external variables (media, internet, and technology) on WOM communication. Item-specific results found that in regards to political mix components, the ones that had the most influence on WOM communication were psychological cost if the candidate wins, image of the candidate as leader, using celebrities and icons in the campaigns, building election gates, and candidate’s modesty. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bangladesh; developing countries; multidimensional model; political marketing; Word of mouth communication",""

When consumers make decisions on retirement savings, they face trade-offs: when should they start saving, how much do they need to invest, and how much do they need to retire? Specifically, this study explored the effectiveness of a financial services advertisement stressing the investment process for retirement savings (that is, process framing) and a financial services advertisement emphasizing the outcome of investment (that is, outcome framing) in combination with gain and loss frames. The obtained data indicated that people in the process framing condition had a stronger tendency to choose the earlier saving option over the delay option when an ad was presented in terms of losses versus gains. In contrast, the advantage of gains (vs. losses) was found in the outcome framing condition. Some implications for strategic advertising messages to promote early retirement savings were discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","framing; Intertemporal choice; retirement financial services advertising; retirement product advertising",""

However, how to successfully transmit these elements through written content and a commitment to company stakeholders has been unclear until now. From the perspective of brand image delivery and using a content analysis methodology, this study performs an initial inquiry. By comparing two subsamples on two types of enterprises in the direct selling industry in China and keyword counting in five dimensions, it is found that domestic-funded enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises differ not only in their marketing organization of these brand intangible elements but also in their orientation of transmission. Although the study revealed that these intangible elements are mainly aimed toward employees and recruits, the sharpness of the wording in the content and the degree of keyword focus are different. This paper’s objective was to find the difference in these areas.

Drawing from the literature on authenticity and construal level theory, this study aims to investigate the role of perceived authenticity and message construal level in consumers’ evaluations of two types of organic food (fresh vs. processed). Two experiments were conducted among college students (N = 129, Study 1) and adults 18–70 (N = 249, Study 2). Our findings suggest that consumers’ evaluations of organic food are fully mediated by perceived authenticity of each organic food type. Specifically, compared to processed organic food, consumers perceive fresh organic food more authentic, which leads to more favorable attitudes and higher purchase intention. This research further demonstrates that the indirect effect of organic food type via perceived authenticity is moderated by construal level of marketing messages. That is, when messages are construed at a low level, consumers tend to have more positive attitudes and higher purchase intention toward fresh than processed organic food. By contrast, product type makes no difference when messages are construed at a high level.

This paper aims to close these gaps by focusing on two different research issues. First, it investigates the effects of sensory imagery on marketing-related key performance indicators (i.e., sensory perception, perceived product design, and attitude) using analysis of variance. Further, the paper examines underlying causal relationships between these potential market success factors by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings support the usefulness of sensory imagery in advertisements, as it appears to be a valuable approach to address specific senses and to positively affect consumer perception.

Through four regression analyses, the results showed that outsourcing the service moderates the relationship. Specifically, the higher the amount of advertising investment, the more it pays to outsource the service to an advertising agency in order to generate greater profit margin. But with a low investment value, it does not pay to outsource. This study helps to identify situations in which it pays to outsource digital marketing services to an advertising agency. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advertising agency; Digital marketing; financial performance; investment; outsourcing; small enterprise",""

Drawing on the dynamic capabilities theory, Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) can be considered as a source of competitive advantage. Enhanced by the effects of the appropriate strategic orientation, IMC may positively influence customer, market and financial performance. However, these proposals need further empirical analysis. Based on data from surveyed businesses in both developed and emerging economies (Spain and Belarus, respectively), the study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the relationships in the theoretical model. The results suggest that while market orientation has a direct relationship with IMC in both countries, the relationship between technology orientation and IMC can only be found in a developed economy. In addition, the potential of IMC for business advantage sustainability is verified; in a developed economy, however, the verification was for customer and market performance, but not for financial performance. Conversely, in an emerging economy only customer performance could be verified, despite IMC having an indirect relationship with financial performance in both types of economies. Thus, the economy type moderation effect analysis clearly supports the differences caused by the implementation of IMC in developed and emerging economies. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","IMC; inter-country analysis; organisational performance; strategic orientation",""

To fill this gap, our research investigates consumer perceptions of a branded VR experience of a university campus tour under different viewing conditions across two studies. In Study 1, we interviewed 17 participants who experienced the VR tour on Oculus Rift CV1. Emerging themes from the data revealed a sense of telepresence, enjoyment, and appreciation for going places not available to participants in real life. Study 2 employed an experimental design where participants viewed the same content using one of the three VR devices that varied in system immersion (smartphone, Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift DK2). Telepresence and its impact on recall and persuasion were measured. Results show that all three viewing conditions had equal capacity to create a sense of telepresence.

Boundary conditions to this message match/persuasiveness relationship do exist; in a high-involvement situation, messages that mismatch the functional underpinnings of an individual’s attitude may be more persuasive due to dissonance generation. This dissonance leads the individual into more deliberative processing of the message through the central route of the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Working within the physical fitness context, this study examines the functional matching concept in advertising communications. The findings show that individuals exposed to messages matching their functional profile do not deliberate further. Contrarily, when exposed to functionally mismatched messages, they deliberate more on the message to resolve the experienced dissonance.

Taiwan’s leading convenience store chains have even established an integrated marketing department to develop unique premium rewards and campaigns that seek to induce customers to spend more or switch from other retailers. However, research on premium attractiveness is relatively scarce despite its importance in determining the success of a premium promotion. This empirical study identifies the premium value hierarchy that drives attractiveness from the consumer’s perspective. It finds that epistemic value is the most important driver behind making a premium reward attractive, which in turn, raises customers’ brand attitude toward the retailer and purchase intention in the retailer’s stores. High premium value can also make a customer develop a positive brand attitude. By contrast, utilitarian, hedonic, and collecting values only indirectly affect a customer’s brand attitude via the epistemic value.

This study seeks to gain an in-depth understanding of CSR through qualitative interviews with young Saudi consumers using the conceptual framework of Carroll’s pyramid. This study reveals that young Saudi consumers recognise all four types of responsibility. However, they do not prioritise the types as Carroll does, and disagree with Carroll’s notion that economic responsibility is the foundational building block of CSR. The findings also reveal that Islamic values, expressed through philanthropy, must underpin any CSR practice. A proposed Islamic CSR pyramid has emerged from this study; it signifies that organisations should consider paying the Zakat to be an obligation, should always behave in an ethical manner and should prioritise societal interest over maximising shareholder values.

In more detail, this study introduces a series of measures capturing a branded app’s awareness and a key component of a branded app’s image–i.e., brand-attribute associations that make the app ‘mentally available’, or simply more likely to come to mind when deciding which app to download and/or use. These measures are then linked to market penetration to infer the overall strength or equity of a branded app. They are also considered in relation to app stickiness by comparing results for current users of the app vs. non-users of the app. The empirical outcomes of this study highlight that strong branded apps are simultaneously easy to recognise and mentally available.

The multitude of company websites within the global system present varying linguistic, cultural and communication characteristics, which determine different experiences depending on the local culture of the user. The design of culturally appropriate websites is viewed as essential to communication, mainly for marketing. This article therefore aims at analysing the impact of cultural characteristics on web design and marketing communication. China presents a vast market and internet population, with specific cultural characteristics, and for these reasons is the subject chosen for study. The study develops a methodology based on an adaptation of Hofstede’s and Hall’s cultural dimensions for purposes of analysing website content. The methodology makes it possible to measure the projection of underlying cultural characteristics in website design.The content analysis of 75 websites Chinese companies quoted on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets reveals that their design reflects local cultural characteristics. Furthermore, the analysis of the Chinese and English versions of the websites reveals that there the latter provide virtually no adaptation to an international clientele, particularly as concerns the indicators of Collectivism, Uncertainty Avoidance and Long Term Orientation. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese culture; cultural dimensions; Hofstede and Hall frameworks; Web marketing communication; website design",""

This study investigated if and how media choice between the two rival channels can influence consumers’ perceptions of a novel brand. 504 Swedish retail fashion customers participated in an experiment to evaluate the identical advertisement placed either in a national newspaper or on Facebook. The results revealed that advertising in a newspaper can have a positive effect on brand equity facets and purchase intention through brand personality perceptions of being competent, while advertising on Facebook have similar effects but through perceptions of being exciting. Besides some evidence that choice between traditional and new media affects brand personality this study is one of the first attempts to incorporate media channel choice into the broader customer-based brand equity framework. The results from this particular study suggest that media channel choice should be considered from a brand equity building perspective at least in the fashion category. This study shows that different media channels could complement each other strategically, as traditional media channels still can have valuable and unique contributions to brand building through brand personality perceptions, especially for brands striving to be perceived as competent. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Advertising; brand equity; brand image; brand personality; digital marketing; social media",""

Hinging on imagery, and led by Pinterest, Instagram, and WeHeartIt, a breed of social media is gaining ground by attracting millennials and females. Accordingly, there is a need to conceptualize social media mavenism in a way that deliberates the specificities of these media and theorize about its liaison with the behaviors related to social commerce and conducted by consumers on these media. In the qualitative investigation, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen regular users of Pinterest, Instagram, Etsy, WeHeartIt or Polyvore. The quantitative investigation consisted of 528 females that are regular users of Pinterest. The results supported our thesis that the social network’s utilitarian attitude, role in decision making, and digital virtual consumption generate the maven-like behavior by fueling three social commerce-related behaviors (network expansion, social privatization, and knowledge creation). Post-hoc analysis reveals that individual factors discriminate social media mavens or influencers, showing predictive validity. The results lay the groundwork for an action-based metric that entice practitioners to target online mavens by discerning the social commerce-related behaviors they conduct–behaviors that can be nurtured by enhancing the network’s attitudinal and experiential factors. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","knowledge sharing; online influencers; Pinterest; social commerce-related behaviors; Social media mavens; social media metrics",""

Data collected from a representative sample of online shoppers (N = 559) was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Findings reveal that shoppers’ experience is indirectly related to brand-related information sharing, and mediated by three TPB beliefs (attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavior control). These relationships were moderated by customer culture. The impact of attitude on information sharing was greater for collectivist shoppers, whereas the influence of subjective norms was stronger for individualist shoppers.

The difficulty of advertising to Millennials has also prompted the use of unbranded cause advertising, to increase awareness of issues championed by the brand, without triggering defensive persuasion-coping strategies. Chipotle combined both these trends when it produced a relatively unbranded piece of branded entertainment, Farmed and Dangerous, a four-episode sitcom that humorously dramatized the ethical issues raised by industrial farming. When the series ran on Hulu, an online television network, it increased sales for the Chipotle brand and won awards for its creators.

Although fear imagery has been the subject of extensive research, no previous neuroscientific studies have investigated brain correlates of fear imagery in print advertising. Using real sets of advertisements within a block design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) random effect model, this study investigated neural mechanisms associated with fear appeal in advertising. Results showed that, compared to other types of advertisements, fear imagery elicited increased activation in several brain areas associated with (i) contingency awareness such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), (ii) emotional appraisal such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and (iii) episodic retrieval of polymodal imagery such as the hippocampus and the precuneus. This result suggests that, contrary to other types of advertisements, fear appeal advertisements are dealt with in different brain pathways.

On self-report measures, consumers reported negative attitude and lower purchase intention when the brand was marketed to be luxurious. However, self-report measures were unable to capture any change in consumers’ emotions that underlie these negative responses. The psychophysiological methods suggest that consumers’ experience of anger (interest) underlies their negative (positive) responses toward the brand when it was marketed to be luxurious (non-luxurious).

Through introducing and testing motive attribution as a mediator, the study also offered some insight into the mechanism of the SKEP effect on Agreen-ad, i.e., consumers with higher SKEP will more likely attribute the green ad motive to for-profit marketing tactics rather than for-environment efforts, and that in turn will generate negative Agreen-ad.

In order to address this gap this paper draws on anthropological theory to establish a new category of advertising and brand marketing appeal, the liminoid appeal. Liminoid experiences are those in which constraints on personal and social identity are temporarily suspended and identity is opened up to transformational possibilities. Unlike the more widely noted liminal experiences, liminoid experiences are not dependent on ritual process and can be indulged in voluntarily, repeatedly, and for fun. The paper integrates a theoretical review with a selection of case exemplars to illustrate the novelty, salience and contribution of the liminoid appeal. We add the cautionary note that, while the liminoid appeal resonates powerfully with consumers because of its ostensibly liberatory and self-actualising potential, on a social level the proliferation of such appeals could contribute to rising social disharmony and psychological distress.

One technique, which has grown in popularity, is the use of drones to capture images within an advertisement. While drones are particularly familiar to military use, new regulations have allowed businesses and amateurs to easily obtain and use drones to create images. With that in mind, this study aims to provide evidence that the verticality of images, i.e., those produced by the drone, can affect information processing of advertising, specifically, angles at which the images are being produced having a greater effect on the viewer than images produced at ground level. We propose a theoretical framework which suggests that mental simulation plays a mediating role between the advertisement watched and Attitude towards the Advertisement (Aad). By creating our own stimuli to eliminate outside discrepancies and focus on images, we were able to carry out an online experiment in which 67 university students participated.

Consumers’ involvement with advertised products reduces their perceptions of intrusiveness and enhances their positive ad and brand eWOM intentions. Ad intrusiveness instead increases ad-skipping behaviour and hinders ad and brand dissemination.

Extant research has mainly studied how various eWOM characteristics such as valence, volume, and text-based eWOM content affect purchase behavior. This study, for the first time, has explored the role of mixed neutral WOM valence and rich eWOM content on online purchase intention. Initially, the qualitative analysis method was used to conduct in-depth interviews with experts-cum-online shoppers from different fields. Purposive sampling was used to select 14 experts and online shoppers from diverse fields. Inductive analysis was conducted to analyze the interview generated content. It helped in forming various codes and categories in explaining eWOM constructs. Content analysis was also used to analyze the importance of various factors in key constructs (themes) affecting online behavior. The finding from the content analysis confirmed that both mixed neutral eWOM and rich eWOM content positively affects online purchase intention.

The results of two experimental studies demonstrated that when a fair trade ad features a negative image and message (i.e., visual-written congruency), a concrete message results in greater consumer curiosity and willingness to pay a higher price for fair trade products relative to an abstract message. In contrast, when a negative image with a positive message (i.e., visual-written incongruency) is used, an abstract message increases consumer’s curiosity and willingness to pay a higher price. However, information type effects on consumers’ perceptions were not significant when a positive image appeared in the fair trade ad.

In seeking to stand out from their competitors, brands have started to use more creative, extraordinary, interactive, and nontraditional approaches in their advertisements. One of these approaches is ambient advertising, which involves the guerilla marketing activities and alters environmental elements that consumers interact with (e.g., pedestrian paths, bus stops) creatively and unexpectedly and renders these elements meaningful in terms of advertising. In ambient advertising literature, relationships between perceived surprise, attention toward the ad, attitudes toward the ad and brand, purchase intention, and mediation effect of attitude toward an unknown brand have not been hierarchically tested. In this study, the effectiveness of ambient advertising was evaluated based on a structural equation model and the data were collected from 194 consumers through cross-sectional survey method. The results revealed some statistically significant relationships.

We observe channel changing near the start and end of ad breaks, but no targeted second-message zapping emerged. Marketers might therefore continue to buy two ad units in particularly interesting shows. Interestingly, networks separated the two messages for one brand into early and late program segments. In some shows, this separation may influence the relative ratings of the two messages. For example, the first ad had higher ratings in some shows that followed a much more popular program on the same network. However, the second ad had higher ratings in some game and reality shows with strong audience build-up in late running time.

However, when companies launch line extensions, information of the new products positively or negatively affects consumer evaluations of the parent products in the same line, generating the so-called spillover effects. Through two experimental studies, the current research explores how marketers can employ appropriate communication strategies and message types in advertising to induce favourable spillovers or to avoid negative spillovers in product line extensions. Experiment 1 investigates the interaction between communication strategy and line extension type. Results reveal that for vertical high-end extensions and for horizontal line extensions, ads using relational strategy that focuses on the relatedness between products in the line increase consumer valuation of the parent product; for vertical low-end extensions, ads with elaboration strategy that stresses the uniqueness of the extensions avoid negative spillovers on parents. Experiment 2 further examines how message type moderates the spillover effects in elaboration ads. Results show that, compared with numerical messages, literal messages engender smaller valuation decreases on the parents and consequently alleviate undesirable spillover effects for most types of product line extensions. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advertising; consumer evaluation; experimental study; product line extension; spillover effect",""

Thus, little attention has been given to the consumer's view of what we consider to be the individual drivers, i.e., the ‘inner and outer self’ and how that impacts luxury consumption. This paper presents a framework of luxury and self, using concepts such as interdependent or outer, independent or inner, and a new concept of ‘digital self’. These appear as three levels of luxury consumption, i.e., conspicuous, individual, and interactive. The interdependent self is influenced by the external motives and leads to conspicuous luxury behavior. Individual self is affected by internal motives and thus influences individual luxury consumption. Digital self affects the networks of motive and relationships and thereby impacts interactive luxury consumption and behavior. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","India; levels of luxury consumption; purchase motives; qualitative studies; self-concept of consumers",""

Particularly, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has gained increasing importance within both public and private organizations, it being the subject of much investigation and debate among both researchers and practitioners. In this sense, discussion of CSR implications for consumer behavior has been a common topic in recent marketing literature, demonstrating in some cases, a link between CSR and positive responses by consumers and inconclusive effects in others. In the context of such controversy, experts call for further investigation about the consequences of CSR on consumer behavior. Within this line of research, the present paper analyzes the influence of motivations attributed to CSR practices in business settings on four stages of consumer decision-making process. For that purpose, it was conducted a survey study which reached a final sample of 400 Spanish consumers.

We find consistent effects. Being exposed to a higher volume of negative messages often depresses evaluations of the target, whereas being exposed to a higher volume of positive messages enhances evaluation of the sponsor. These effects are nuanced by recency effects: when a sequence ends on a negative message, regardless of its overall valence, evaluation of the target is depressed; similarly, negatively valenced sequences harm the target except when the sequence ends on a positive message. Backlash effects are unlikely, and no sequence simultaneously harms the target and promotes a positive evaluation of the sponsor.

Despite their growing adoption, few research efforts have been devoted to evaluate SNSs' concrete implications for the brands. The current study addresses this opportunity, proposing a model that evaluates the impact of users' participation in SNSs on brand awareness and brand attitude, the two main pillars of brand knowledge. The study focuses on brand like pages in Facebook, the most used SNSs platform for brands. An online quantitative survey with brand like page users of leading brands in Facebook was implemented. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to estimate the measurement model and structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed research hypotheses. The results identify a significant, positive and direct impact of users' participation on brand awareness. Brand attitude also substantially benefits from users' participation, but this relationship is mediated by brand awareness. The findings help to validate SNSs' significant role on building brand knowledge and to position users' participation at the core of brands' SNSs objectives. Furthermore, the study provides a practical research framework, easily adapted for monitoring purposes and managerial guidance. Future research directions are discussed. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand attitude; brand awareness; Facebook; social media; structural equation modelling",""

Results indicate that the young generation actively engages in interpreting brand integration in films and they were generally positive about it. Although interpretations of product placement are reported on an individual basis, this study suggests that culture may also affect how individuals perceive product placement.

Previous research on traditional media has shown that the surrounding context affects advertising effectiveness. Similarly, the context in a game may influence a player’s processing of brands advertised in that game. To examine the effects of contextual advertising in games, the present article affords two independent experiments investigating how positive and negative game contexts influence players’ memories and attitudes with respect to brands advertised via billboards in games. Drawing from literature on the limited capacity model, the authors demonstrate that positive and negative game contexts decrease brand memory since they require a high level of cognitive effort. The authors also find that varying a game context influence the perception of brands advertised in the game via the contextual priming mechanism and that positive contexts generate more positive brand attitudes than negative or neutral contexts. The findings have important implications for consumer researchers and marketers, as they indicate how contexts in games can be utilized to establish brand awareness and increase positive brand perceptions in contextual advertising using games. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contextual advertising; game context; In-game advertising",""

The findings reveal that corporate brand associations can be categorised into two categories–universal associations, which are influential in all the sectors, and sector-specific associations, which have a differential effect on consumers in different sectors. Thus, this study reveals that corporate branding is important to consumers in all the sectors, but a single corporate brand story does not work in all the sectors. Further, corporate associations do not always have a positive effect on the consumers; under certain circumstances, these might either have no effect or have a negative effect on the consumers. Finally, there are two routes by which corporate brand associations can influence consumers–by affecting their cognitive responses or by influencing their affective responses towards the company. The recognition of the important corporate brand associations in the three sectors, and the routes (cognitive or affective) through which these associations influence consumer choices would enable marketers to develop more sophisticated corporate communication strategies. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","affective corporate commitment; consumer product attitude; corporate brand associations; corporate branding; purchase intention",""

Path analysis was employed to examine the research model. The use of UGC was motivated by needs for information, entertainment, personal identity, and social interaction. While personality did not predict users' motives, their attitudes towards advertising in general explained individual motivation patterns to a large extent. It was consequently proposed and confirmed that users' motives mediate the influence of recipients' general attitude toward advertising on UGC usage. Results indicated a strong effective potential for UGC in online advertising: users view such content expressly to be influenced by others fulfilling their needs for information, personal identity and social interaction.

This is due to the differences in B2B OLCs in terms of multiple stakeholders and two-way information flows and differences in buyer behaviour. For researchers, the contribution is an embryonic model that will facilitate future conceptual development as well as empirical testing through a series of research propositions. A sequential decision-making framework, which identifies key implementation challenges, is provided for B2B managers. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","business-to-business marketing; integrated marketing communication; marketing communication framework; Online communities; social media",""

The various components of corporate identity are investigated and the results are presented in diagrammatic form in the proposed and updated corporate identity taxonomy. A qualitative exploratory approach was taken, comprising in-depth interviews with key informants involved in the implementation of corporate identity at a major UK university. The taxonomy illustrates communication, design, culture, behaviour, structure, industry and strategy as the main components of corporate identity. The study also demonstrates how and where issues of corporate identity are discussed within an organisation and how the results of these discussions are fed into management structure. As with any such exploratory case study, there are limits to the generalisability of the findings. Further research is required to ascertain whether the findings of this study also apply in other settings. The results will be helpful to communication professionals who deal with an organisation’s corporate identity, branding and communication and who aim to enhance the consistency of messages both written and visual within their organisation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate communication; Corporate identity management; corporate identity taxonomy; higher education sector",""

The perceived social value was found to influence attitude change favorably among young Korean consumers. The young American consumers tended to increase their attitudes and purchase intentions toward luxury brands if they perceived superior product quality. However, they were more likely to lower their purchase intention as they recognized conspicuous value of consuming luxury brands. On the other hand, the moderating effect of uniqueness and hedonic value was not found.

Customers’ expectations about the price and quality of products and services play an important role in their selection process. In online businesses, competition and price differences between suppliers is high, so discounts will attract different customers. As a result, discounts and the frequency and amount of purchases can lead to better understanding of customer behavior. Customer segmentation and analysis is essential for identifying groups of customers. Hence, this study uses a model based on RFM called RdFdMd, in which d is the level of discount used to analyze customer purchase behavior and the importance of discounts on customers’ purchasing behavior and organizational profitability. The CRISP-DM and k-mean algorithm were used for clustering.

This study explores the potential of packaging color for conveying CSR to consumers, focusing in particular on consumer packaged goods. For this purpose, a quantitative study was conducted on a representative sample of consumers (n = 2000) in the form of a structured questionnaire, administered using face-to-face interviews. Three different stimuli were created through fictitious images of a non-existent brand product. Only the color of the packaging varied, while all the other graphic elements were left unchanged. The results show that, despite the prevailing association of green with the concepts of sustainability and CSR, it is not the most suitable color to clearly and credibly convey a CSR message to consumers.

However, only few of the extant CBBE models emanate from the context of automotive brands. As such, this present study employs a qualitative approach using a semi-structured face-to-face interview among 11 informants, to explore the concept of CBBE in the context of automotive brands. Also, this study explores the role of social media communications in developing CBBE for automotive brands. The findings of this research demonstrate that CBBE is a valid concept which reflects consumers’ perception and mindset towards their knowledge, which are reflected through brand awareness, hedonic brand image, functional brand image, and brand sustainability of automotive brands.

Numerous organizations use online media for one-way communication to disseminate information, despite the affordances of the media platforms for two-way, dialogic communication. This article draws on two dominant interpersonal theories of computermediated communication—social information processing theory and the hyperpersonal model—to propose dialogic strategies that organizations can use to improve their online communication with their stakeholders. We illustrate the application of these principles through three stages of relationship building: initiating/ experimenting, intensifying, and integrating/bonding. The article integrates the applications within an overall dialogic communication strategy, and provides organizations and practitioners with a model with which they can engage stakeholders with dialogic methods via social media. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Computer-mediated communication; Dialogic communication; Organizational image; Organization–public relationship; Social media",""

In 2013, Kim proposed a conceptual framework for examining stakeholders’ evaluation of pre-crisis corporate advertising, using the inoculation and reactance theory. The framework, published in Journal of Marketing Communications, suggested that pre-crisis advertising can increase audience resistance towards negative news of an organization and decrease audience resistance towards future corporate advertisements from the organization. The present study expands on Kim’s work to develop the corporate crisis advertising (CCA) framework. In addition to the inoculation and reactance effects discussed in Kim’s model, CCA aims to discuss the effects of corporate advertising on improving organization’s prior reputation based on halo effect, and how post-crisis advertising messages can be evaluated based on crisis theories. Our proposed framework provides a comprehensive view of the use of corporate advertising both before and after a crisis and is useful for organizations to understand the impact of corporate advertising on stakeholders’ evaluation of the organization in a crisis situation.

The variables analysed are: source of complaint, type of offending advertiser, infraction of the law, breach of the code of conduct, complaint resolution, nature of the resolution, source of appeal and appeal resolution. Results show that multinationals are the companies that most often infringe the law and codes of conduct, and also that in many cases the complaints against them are dismissed.

Thus, links placed in the left region of an email newsletter have higher impact than those placed in the right region with links in the top-left region having highest impact.

The study examines (1) whether particular types of associations (corporate ability or corporate social responsibility associations) can be developed through CA- or CSR-based communication strategies, and (2) the relative effectiveness of these two association types at amplifying favorable consumer responses across three different industries (consumable goods, durable goods, and stigmatized goods). An experiment was conducted to test the proposed model with six Fortune 500 companies. The results demonstrate that communication strategies can effectively facilitate a particular type of association. Differing levels of association effectiveness were found within each industry. For the consumable goods industry, CA associations are found to be more effective than CSR associations. For the durable goods industry, CSR associations are more influential at enhancing consumer attitudes and purchase intent than CA associations, while CA associations have a larger impact on supportive communication intent. In the case of the stigmatized industry, CSR associations play a determinant role in fostering positive consumer responses.

Our study is aimed at clarifying how CB has been approached in the academic and practitioners' literature so far to identify the contribution of these different perspectives. To investigate the debate on CB, we adopted a systematic software-assisted content analysis, appropriate when the research aims are to disentangle multiple perspectives on a phenomenon. Software-aided content analysis allows a rigorous treatment of a text highlighting recurrent themes, their semantic links, co-occurrences and correspondences among lexical units. Our findings suggest that CB is a crucial crossroad between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ of a company acting as a ‘bridge’ among key intangibles and as an ‘inside–outside’ interface between company and stakeholders. The Thematic Analysis of Elementary Contexts highlights four clusters related to how CB and communication have been conceived. In discussing the findings, we propose integrated marketing communications (IMC) as a conceptual and managerial framework capable of making sense out of CB complexity and casting light on the complementarities between the often conflicting academic and practitioners' views on CB. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","communication; content analysis; corporate branding; intangible assets; integrated marketing communications",""

Drawing from both IMC and strategic management literature, the construct of SI is operationalised into a number of key factors and a well-cited management model, Fuchs' ‘integration valuator’ is explored as the starting point of a measurement tool for IMC. To do this, a Delphi study invites the scrutiny of an expert panel of world-leading IMC researchers and practitioners. The panel validated the model construction process, redefined overarching constructs and key factors with a high degree of consensus, supported a process measure, suggested a weighted evaluation measure and recognised the importance of developing such a measure. They delivered clear and consistent imperatives guiding model development. The result is a measure of SI that evaluates organisational proficiency and diagnoses the integration of IMC campaigns.

The results of a controlled laboratory experiment suggest that the benefits of social TV, principally its association with live TV and therefore less ad-avoidance, come at the cost of negative distraction effects. Like normal coviewing, social TV viewing distracts from ad-processing, reducing unaided recall and brand attitude favorability, compared to individual (solus) viewing. However, social TV messaging about ads improved brand attitude. Perceived creativity increased the likelihood of ad-related messaging. Social TV also has an additional source of distraction, multitasking, but in this study, multitasking did not further reduce ad-effectiveness compared to coviewing.

Based on a study conducted with 10 agencies and 5 advertisers, this article highlights how companies attempt to circumvent the law, revealing three major elements that agencies and advertisers mobilize while making the decision to do so, as well as details of how they get around the rules and manage the risks and costs of breaking them. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","agency–client relationship; justification; permission; regulation; transgression",""

The originality is that through this work both theory and practice of branding in NPOs will be better informed so that structures to support branding can be better managed. Factors considered important to branding were identified, particularly leadership, employee understanding and clear vision. It was interesting that respondents generally agreed that limited marketing budgets were not necessarily a major problem. The research also identified variables that contribute to a conceptual model of nonprofit brand management, experiential and emotional branding in particular being notable as offering possible platforms for differentiation.

A 2(product) × 2(label) × 3(information) mixed design was used to examine consumer perceptions and behavior intentions. Product category (environmentally neutral vs. environmentally harmful) was a within-subjects factor; the presence/absence of the carbon-neutral label and information (positive/negative/control) was both manipulated between-subjects factors. Results show that the presence of a carbon-neutral label in an advertisement, regardless of the type of product, leads to more favorable perceptions of company environmental concern.

The specific objectives of this paper were: (1) to address limitations of prevailing health behaviour theories, by identifying key determinants of health behaviour across the most commonly used health behaviour theories; (2) to identify source, consumer, channel, and message characteristics, in addition to executional/situational factors and attitudinal variables, which may influence health behaviour; and lastly, (3) to explain under which conditions (i.e. stage of change) these determinants and factors are likely to impact health behaviour change and maintenance. In doing so, four assumptions and several propositions are developed.

Despite the popularity of social advergames, little is known about the brand benefits of incorporating social features into games. Moreover, while creativity has been studied in the context of more traditional advertising, less is known about its effects on brand development in the context of advergames. Although advertising creativity, as characterized by novelty and relevance, has been shown to impact advertised brands, it is not clear how creativity interacts with advergame socialness to affect brand development. To address these gaps in the literature, this paper reports on three experimental studies that compare the brand effects of advergames that enable social interactions to advergames that are not social.

We gathered a sample of 493 commercials (featuring 907 characters) randomly selected out of two periods (January 2002–April 2003, n = 250 and January 2009–April 2010, n = 243) from a database containing all advertisements broadcasted on Belgian commercial television. A content analysis was carried out using a coding scheme based on existing literature. Content categories included gender of the characters, gender roles (i.e. parental, housekeeping and professional expert) and sexual objectification. Hypotheses predicted that men and women would be represented differently in television advertising, and that these differences would reflect traditional gender stereotypes. Moreover, due to regulatory changes, we hypothesize that these differences should decrease over time. Results are largely in accordance with the existing literature. Women tend to be depicted as younger and are portrayed more often within dependent roles as caregiving parent, housewife or as sexual objects than men. A longitudinal analysis of role portrayal changes across two periods within and between genders indicates little change in gender role portrayals in Belgian television advertising between 2002–2003 and 2009–2010. Despite social and regulatory changes, gender stereotypes in advertising seem to persist over time. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","advertising; content analysis; gender roles; longitudinal; stereotyping; television",""

However, few studies have compared the effectiveness of advertising alliances with traditional (single-brand) advertising. Thus, this study focuses on a specific type of brand beliefs – namely, brand personality – and compares the ability of advertising alliances and traditional advertising to strengthen positive traits and downplay negative traits for a real brand in need of image repair. The results show that the advertising alliance is considerably more effective in upgrading positive brand personality traits than single-brand advertising. Importantly, this superior effect remained one week after exposure. The choice of advertising strategy had no effect on negative brand personality traits.

The growing use of sponsorship-linked events reinforces the need to understand the potential of such leverage strategies, thus the findings contribute to the body of literature on effective sponsorship practices. Findings from semi-structured interviews with Sponsorship and Marketing Managers suggest a shifting orientation among sponsors towards the pursuit of relational objectives. The privileged access to consumers afforded through sponsorship allows sponsors to manufacture opportunities to create intimacy with customers through sponsorship-linked events in relaxed, comfortable environments; thus sponsorship-linked events are positioned as a rich environment to add value to consumer-brand interactions and achieve relational objectives. Hosting specifically designed events affords sponsors an increased modicum of control over consumer-brand experiences in sponsorship environments characterised by a lack of control over sponsored property actions. However, this control may be eroded by social media technologies, which facilitate consumer-consumer communication around sponsorship-linked events. Social media, however, is proposed as a useful tool to elicit consumer feedback, addressing the misalignment between current sponsorship evaluation practices and emergent relational objectives revealed in the empirical findings. Therefore, successfully activating the sponsorship-linked marketing space demands an integrated and strategic approach. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","events; marketing space; objectives; relational; sponsorship",""

I further suggest that this difference in cognitive styles will have implications for advertising effectiveness. In line with predictions, two experiments supported moderation effect of processing opportunity on behavioral intentions in responses to advertising. After viewing the ad in the conditions that allowed extensive elaboration on message arguments, females were more willing to engage in word-of-mouth (WOM) communication about the advertised product compared to males.

In a laboratory experiment, the web atmospherics of a museum website – conceived as high and low task relevant cues – are manipulated so as to assess their impact on attitude toward the website and attitude toward the brand. The findings indicate that low task relevant cues are associated not only with higher attitude toward the website but with more positive evaluations of the brand as well. Gender has a moderating effect on both relationships of interest: In the absence of low task relevant cues, males develop less favorable attitudes toward the site and the brand, while females' attitude remains consistent across both experimental conditions.

In addition, the results showed that consumers' mood state can also affect the processing mode consumers actually adopt while viewing an ad, and thus indirectly affect brand attitude. Positive mood state was shown to facilitate the induction of mental imagery processing, and at the same time distract detail-oriented analytical processing. As a result, evaluation of the ad was enhanced.

Information transparency on messages and source of messages were tested as external cues to influence consumers' brand schemas and SR message evaluations in a mixed method repeated measures online experiment using a national US consumer sample. Results from regression-based conditional process analyses indicated that increased congruity of consumers' schemas to the fact that brands are SR led to more favorable attitude toward brands' SR messages.

However, a clear understanding of its conceptual boundaries is still missing, which may better orient branding strategies. Our study is aimed at providing a comprehensive picture of AC, attempting to cast light on its distinctive conceptual dimensions. The study is designed according to a focused ethnography approach based on 15 in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of agency professionals. Transcripts were analysed following a discursive technique that systematically explores the ways in which the interviewees conceived of and articulated the concept of AC. Findings show that, although explicitly recognized as a central element in branding strategies, AC is ambivalently represented by advertising professionals, which uncovered a fragile perception of its implicit value. This reveals a limited unfolding of its potential, which is due to a lack of adequate conceptualization that has thwarted the development of strategic guidelines on how to conceive of, approach, and appraise this type of communication. Moreover, this shows a lack of maturity on the part of agency professionals who are still in need of proving themselves in the eyes of their clients as strategic partners. This proves to be detrimental to the potential expression of AC. Based on our evidence, we put forth a conceptualization that views AC as a relational hub, which can trigger multiple patterns of interaction dynamics according to a fuzzy network-based logic. This conception points to AC as a media-neutral communication form, which is inherently and practically lived and experienced by consumers, encapsulating and activating different interaction modes. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","ambient communication; consumer-brand relationships; guerrilla marketing; street marketing; unconventional communication",""

Depth of processing was posited to depend on the level of an individual's feelings of anger at the banks' reported behaviour before and during the crisis and on the degree to which a person had suffered financially as a consequence of the crisis. A number of hypotheses were developed on the basis of Nabi's (1999) cognitive functional model and were tested via a survey of 413 members of the public in Greater London. It was further hypothesised that, because media coverage of the banks' involvement in the crisis was largely hostile, many members of the public attributed blame for the crisis mainly to the banks, resulting in extensive feelings of anger and hence deeper cognitive processing. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anger; banking industry; global financial crisis; information processing; memory; reputation management",""

Employing a 2 × 3 full factorial design, congruence between the celebrity's image and the brand's image was varied (less vs. more congruent), along with the use of the celebrity's image (present, absent, non-celebrity models) to determine how schema congruity influences consumer's response to celebrity advertising. The results of a multivariate analysis of covariance analysis indicating lower levels of congruence between the celebrity's image and the brand's image led to greater advertising effectiveness compared to higher levels of congruence. Specifically, the means of the attitudinal dependent variables in the less congruent condition were significantly higher than the means in the more congruent condition. These effects were more pronounced when a celebrity's image was featured in the advertisement compared to when it was not featured.

This tension of axioms provides a point of direction for introducing the Pepsi Refresh Project as a case illustration of an alternative CRM practice that redefines CRM from company-driven to community-driven – and points towards relocating CRM from an overt to a covert brand and marketing communication strategy. CRM becomes a joint value- and identity-constructing practice transforming consumer criticism into brand involvement and community commitment. By reflexively merging theoretical and case insights, the contribution of the article lies in the revisiting of existing CRM theories in the context of connected, critical and empowered consumers and the subsequent outlining of what we suggest to be CRM 2.0. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cause-related marketing; critical consumers; dialogical reflexive methodology; marketing communication; Pepsi Refresh Project",""

These include researchers' personal judgments, focus groups, expert panels, and ratings scale approaches. However, there is still no generally accepted systematic evaluation or selection procedure. This paper details a simple but powerful method known as ‘best–worst scaling’ (BWS) to evaluate and select advertisements on criteria of interest. BWS represents an important new tool for advertising researchers, advertising agencies and their clients, communications scholars, and policy makers to evaluate and select advertisements. This paper achieves three ends. First, it critiques existing methods of advertisement evaluation. Second, it demonstrates that BWS has greater validity than existing methods. Third, this is the first paper to present a worked example of how to use BWS, and demonstrate its use in an advertisement evaluation context. Importantly, BWS is not restricted to evaluating advertisements – it can be used to evaluate any items on criteria of interest. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","advertisement evaluation and selection; advertising to children; best–worst scaling; research methods",""

This practice is based on the underlying assumption that an increase in incentives will lead to an increase in consumer response – an idea which has been at the core of traditional economic thinking for decades. Some psychologists have claimed, however, that under specific conditions an increase in incentives can reduce (rather than increase) one's willingness to perform the behavior which is being incentivized. If materialized, the possibility that extrinsic incentives may diminish consumer willingness to recommend a favorite brand could have important theoretical and practical consequences in the context of word-of-mouth or buzz marketing. This study tests that possibility in the context of an experiment about Apple computers, a favorite brand among US college students. Participants were asked to recommend the brand to a friend (1) in absence of any monetary reward and (2) for a small monetary incentive. Students who were promised a small monetary reward experienced a decrease in intrinsic motivation and wrote shorter recommendations than those who were not promised any incentives. Data also suggest that the quality of the recommendation may decrease when incentives are offered.

This research draws on literature on human information processing, schema congruity theory, and advertising effectiveness literature to investigate drivers of ambient advertising effectiveness under conditions of increasing advertising clutter and advertising literacy. We contend that schema incongruity as evoked by ambient advertising positively impacts advertising effectiveness. We develop a conceptual framework that suggests four antecedents of advertising schema incongruity – creativity, unexpectedness, engagement, and subtlety – and two moderating variables – perceived advertising clutter and advertising literacy. We further propose that advertising effectiveness on the level of consumers' mind-set variables will have an impact on sales in the long run.

In this study the authors argue that it is important to transcend demographic boundaries and to further segment demographic groups. A study with 13-15-year-old adolescents is used to prove that segmentation generates valuable insights for planning promotion of healthy eating. Four types of predictive segmentation models are compared - a one-segment model, an a-priori segmentation based on demographic variables, an a-priori segmentation based on behavioural variables and a post-hoc segmentation. The results of the study show that it is useful and also ethical to differentiate people using segmentation methods, since it facilitates reaching more vulnerable segments of society that in general resist change.

Researchers traditionally focus on the iconic representation of desire in advertising imagery. However, by drawing upon Lacan's theory of scopophelia, the author focuses on the dialectical implication of the spectator/consumer's psychic drives in the visual semiotics of advertising discourse. The consumer identifies with the brand discourse primarily by means of projective identification with the voyeuristic gaze of the camera referenced in the image, and only secondarily because of perceived parallels between consumer lifestyle and the content of the advertisement. By way of illustration, the author analyzes the positioning of consumer desire in homoerotic advertising for Calvin Klein and Dolce & Gabbana, which draws upon resistance discourses in contemporary art to hold the consumer in a passion play of alternative sexualities and subject positions. Though these campaigns deconstruct the conventional binary opposition of male voyeur/female object of the gaze, they have contributed to the broad popularity of these brands because the brand discourse - logo, product placement, and rhetoric - restores a conventional logic to these advertisements that would have been censored from the worlds of popular culture and fine art. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Advertising response; Brand semiotics; Consumer desire; Eroticism; Gender theory; Luxury advertising; Marketing hedonics; Projective identification; Psychic drives; Psychoanalysis",""

In this connection, health claims are used as communication tools conveying the health message of a product and further constituting the means of a brand's differentiation strategy. Brands carrying a health claim are thus expected to have an advantage over their counterparts. In this study, we aim to investigate whether health claims, with emphasis on the low-fat claims, can act as a means to improve the performance of brands and further enhance their loyalty levels. Based on stated preference data using a purchase intention scale (i.e. Juster Scale), a set of Brand Performance Measures (BPMs) are empirically estimated to describe the market structure of two dairy product categories and their respective sub-categories that were defined according to health-related attributes: (a) fat content; (b) enrichment; and (c) way of processing. Then, the Dirichlet model's fit to the empirical data is examined, leading to the theoretical estimation of loyalty measures. Findings suggest that, on average, brands with a low-fat claim perform better in the market compared with their high-fat counterparts. Moreover, in comparison with other health-related attributes the fat content attribute exhibits slightly higher loyalty, signifying the importance of the 'low-fat' claim as a means of communication. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Brand loyalty; Dirichlet; Health claims; Juster scale; Low-fat foods",""

Recent research has demonstrated the possibility of associating the three sub-dimensions of credibility with different categories of products, depending on whether these latter ones possess specific characteristics that are congruent with one or another sub-dimension. In line with this approach, results show that bearded endorsers are perceived to be more credible and to have a positive influence on purchase intention, but these effects occur only in relation to specific kinds of advertised products.

However, the literature is not conclusive on this point. This study adopts a new perspective, considering cause-brand fit as a moderator variable rather than a direct antecedent to consumer evaluations of CrM. Thus, the main objective of this research is to examine the moderator role of cause-brand fit in the influence of two corporate associations elicited in CrM (corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate ability (CA) associations) on brand attitude and two behavioural consumer responses (purchase intent and support to non-profit organisation (NPO)). For this, a theoretical model is proposed, and it is estimated with a sample of 595 Spanish consumers of insurance and personal hygiene and toiletries products. Results show that when consumers perceive high social cause-brand fit, the positive influence of CSR associations on the formation of brand attitude is amplified.

This study attempts to clarify this point by proposing a conceptual model for the determinants of advertising effectiveness in televised sporting events that incorporates both enduring and situational involvement factors. The results of this study reveal that enduring involvement is directly and indirectly, through situational involvement, associated with advertising effectiveness. Moreover, the findings show that individual factors of enduring and situational involvement operate differently and play a distinct role in affecting the nature of advertising processing. Overall, this study suggests that involvement with the program context should be conceptualized as a function of both enduring factors and situational states, and contrary to previous assertions advertisers should not be deterred from placing commercials in involving programs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","advertising effectiveness; enduring involvement; program context; situational involvement",""

In turn, eWOM influences readers' attitudes, intentions, and behavior. Manufacturers also hope to monitor and positively influence eWOM content, such as by supporting and building brand communities. But eWOM readers might doubt the credibility of information if it is mostly positive, and the usefulness of eWOM information depends on its credibility. This study offers an empirical and theoretical validation of how specific utilitarian and social functions of eWOM affect attitudes toward and intentions to read eWOM. In particular, trustworthiness is the most important credibility dimension; it affects both functions.

On the basis of the theoretical postulates of the Information Integration Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we propose that a cross-tool campaign that makes use of consistent messages is more effective in building brand images than a repetition strategy in which the consumer is exposed to the same message twice. To explore this research question, we conducted an experimental study with a sample of 198 individuals, and two communication tools (advertising and sponsorship) whose messages have been integrated using a consistency criterion.

We seek empirical generalisation by including a very broad range of audience member characteristics, multiple media types, two countries and three years of data in our analysis. We find that while there are some differences in the audiences that competing media deliver, these differences are largely inconsequential when (a) considered in light of the audience differentiation claims made by the media themselves and (b) that implicit in the audience targeting concept is the notion that media audiences are highly segmented.

The study employed a block design paradigm in which participants viewed five blocks of different real sets of advertisements arranged in four conditions: novel-congruent, repeated congruent, novel-Surrealistic and repeated Surrealistic. The results showed that, compared to other types of advertisements, Surrealistic imagery elicited greater activation in several brain areas including the parietal cortex (BA 1, 2, 3), the precuneus (Brodmann area (BA) 7), the lateral parietal cortex (BA 39/40), the prefrontal cortex (BA 6/9), the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45/46), the anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24), the insula (BA 13) and the amygdala. This result suggests that, compared to other types of advertisements, Surrealistic advertisements are processed in different functional brain pathways.

Compared to seemingly organic WOM, can disclosure of the agent-brand relationship benefit the brand if it occurs concurrently with the recommendation? What are the consequences if an agent fails to disclose and the consumer learns about the subterfuge later?

Participants with low NFC are easier to be persuaded by humorous commercials than participants with high NFC do. It is also found that repeated exposure to the same humorous commercial does not harm its persuasive effect. Male audiences regard humorous commercials as more persuasive while female audiences are the opposite.

Findings suggest that, irrespective of whether individuals are exposed to a personally nostalgic or historically nostalgic ad, responses of a personally nostalgic nature tend to predominate and are more influential in shaping brand attitudes. Attitudes toward the ad were shown to mediate this relationship for both nostalgia ad types.

This article develops a conceptual framework that adapts the persuasion knowledge model to consumers' views of in-game advertising. The propositions are tested in a content analysis of consumer comments about brands in videogames collected on 21 online forums. The results show that the interplay between knowledge types is reflected in gamers' comments about in-game advertising. The absence of persuasion knowledge is reflected in more positive comments about the practice, but consumers who express both topic and agent knowledge also express more positive views of it. A key finding is that, when all three knowledge types are activated, consumers express ambivalent thoughts about the practice, and ambivalence is actually more common than univalent or apathetic views.

If prior advertising strongly established a benefit claim in memory, then proactive interference effects inhibited the recall of subsequently advertised benefit claims unrelated in meaning. Additional analyses suggested that these interference effects appeared to be a result of difficulties with encoding the newly advertised claims. If the original benefit claim was not as strongly established in memory, however, then unaided recall of the subsequently advertised benefit claims was actually higher than if there had been no prior advertising at all. In fact, less accessible and memorable claims, whether they preceded or followed more accessible and memorable claims, enhanced recall of the stronger claims.

Three psychological processes are investigated to gain insight into the effectiveness of cross-media campaigns: forward encoding (i.e., the ad in the first medium primes interest in the ad in the second medium); image transfer (i.e., mentally replaying the ad previously viewed during exposure to the ad in the second medium); and multiple source perception (i.e., believing the brand is good and popular because of the amount of advertising). To identify the role of these processes, 219 participants were exposed to one of four media conditions (two cross-media conditions and two repeated media conditions). The results showed that two processes were present when participants were exposed to the cross-media combinations: forward encoding and multiple source perception. We also found support for the hypothesis that these two processes contributed to campaign results.

Three groups of participants received an unfamiliar herbal infusion.

The repertoire for advice-seeking talk includes five components: seeker's legitimacy, topic legitimacy, request formulation, solicitation of responders, and requested response framing. The repertoire for advice-giving includes four components: foundation of authority, advice framing, advice focus, and advice scheme. For each of these components in the two repertoires, we identify corresponding rhetorical methods that can be used in the conversation (over 30 methods in total).

Second, it explores whether the cultural dimensions of the two countries are related to the type of appeals being utilised by using the work of Albers-Miller (1996) who posited links between the advertising appeals identified by Pollay (1983) and individual cultural dimensions utilised in Hofstede's (2001) framework. Such an exploration has been undertaken for business advertising appeals previously but not consumer services. The results indicate first that English advertisements use more rational appeals than French advertisements, as predicted, but that both countries use more emotional appeals than rational for both utilitarian and experiential services. Second, that France, identified as having a higher Uncertainty-Avoidance dimension, makes greater use of the appeals linked with that dimension. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Advertising; Appeals; Culture; Services",""

Next, the paper determines whether the inoculation effect further reduces consumer resistance to corporate advertising during a crisis. Other factors that figure into the broader context of corporate crises are then discussed. These include four other types of external impacts on a crisis situation-the crisis, the corporation, the media, and individual differences.

However, if there are no differences in modality, it is unclear if mixed online-offline media usage can lead to cross-media synergies. The author draws from research on priming and two-factor theory of repetition to argue that varying information quantity on ads in different media leads to differences in ad processing at initial exposures, which impacts how information-processing capacity is allocated on retrieval vs. encoding activities on later exposures. This research compares the effect of combined online-offline media usage [Internet banner-print magazine-permission email (I-P-E) or email ad-print ad-Internet banner(E-P-I)] vs. single-media usage (I-I-I, E-E-E, and P-P-P) on aided and unaided brand information recall and brand attitude.

Based on a survey of about 170 members of MINI Cooper online brand communities, the findings of this study suggest that brand identification positively influences eWOM intention by way of brand loyalty and community identification. In addition, trust in peer community members was found as a significant mediator of the influence of community identification on eWOM intention. Taken together, both brand- and community-related dimensions are crucial in predicting eWOM intention among brand community members.

While advertising has long been accepted by American consumers as a necessary element of most mass communication, this research suggests that viewers of OTV programming do not regard advertising as a means to subsidize the cost of online content. Rather, young adults appear to regard advertising as an intruder in the OTV environment. Furthermore, the results indicate that Ducoffe's Advertising Value model (1995) does not predict attentiveness to advertising viewed within the OTV context.

The reduction in TV ads' effectiveness due to coviewing is equivalent to the loss from channel-change zapping, which reduces ad recall to 45%. More deleterious but less prevalent modes of digital video recorder-enabled ad avoidance are skip-button zapping, which reduces recall to 35%, and moderately fast zipping (× 8 fast forward), which reduces ad effectiveness almost entirely, leaving only 6% recall.

Although the media forms may be available, they do not interact until the consumer creates some type of interaction. Using a nationally projectable online sample of consumer-reported media usage in the USA, based on (a) the media forms consumed, (b) the amount of time spent with each consumed media form, (c) which accessed media forms are used in what combination, and (d) the reported influence of each media form on future purchases in eight broad product categories, we developed a new view of media synergy.

Stereotype theory explained results revealing how the incongruous narrator made the university appear significantly more attractive to mature students (aged over 29). Although this study identified positive results in using congruous advertising stimuli, it acknowledges the possible benefits of incongruous stimuli (e.g. in terms of attention gain and creative communication). © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Advertising; Age; Congruity; University; Voice",""

In particular, very little is known about the dynamics affecting consumer attention within two-way many-to-many mediated environments even though attention constitutes a critical step. Thus, we construct a conceptual framework that grounds consumer attention within a larger progression of behavioral responses to eWOM. We then conduct an experiment (n = 28) that isolates contextual antecedents of attention to positive, negative, and neutral WOM for both luxury and non-luxury brands within a social media platform. Using behavioral eye-tracking, we find that WOM message valence interacts with brand type to affect attention differently. Implications of these findings for facilitating eWOM are discussed with future research directions suggested. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","consumer attention; electronic word-of-mouth; eye-tracking; social media",""

To do so, we conducted an experiment in which we studied the effects of a combination of TV commercials and websites (TV commercial-website vs. website-TV commercial) for two different product categories. The results indicated a consistent interaction effect of media sequence and product involvement regarding two campaign targets: attitudes toward the ads and message evaluation. These interaction effects showed that while a TV commercial-website sequence was effective for informing consumers about both high- and low-involvement products, the website-TV commercial sequence was only suitable for informing consumers about high involvement products. The main conclusion is that the sequence of exposure is vital in cross-media campaigns. The study also demonstrates under which conditions this is particularly important. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","advertising; cross-media campaigns; order; product involvement; sequence",""

Results revealed that respondents formed positive attitudes toward apparel brand when the advertising message contained explicit information about environmentally friendly products. Attitude toward brand, subjective norm, attitude toward advertisement, eco-fashion involvement, and environmental commitment were strong predictors of intention to purchase an environmentally friendly apparel brand. Implications are that apparel marketers may build more positive attitudes toward brands by providing explicit information about environmentally friendly products in their marketing claims. This may be one way for marketers to attract college students who are interested in purchasing environmentally friendly products, but who are not fully committed to a green lifestyle. Further, marketers may be able to reach those who are less interested in purchasing environmentally friendly products by raising awareness and knowledge of the benefits associated with their products and brands, which may help to establish a sustainable market for eco-fashion. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","brand name; eco-fashion; environmentally friendly; message explicitness; purchase intention",""

Under the umbrella of CRM many companies choose to build partnerships specifically with education establishments. These activities are called In-School Marketing (ISM). This study explores parents' attitudes and behaviours towards ISM as key stakeholders in the process. It focuses specifically on how they assess the value of schemes, whether they have concerns about commercial involvement in their schools and how the diffusion of ISM has affected their expectations. The study found that parents were generally positive about commercial involvement in their schools. However, their attitudes and expectations of ISM were evolving and their evaluative criteria had become more complex. The key factors affecting their evaluation were the company's ethical reputation, perceived motivation for the involvement and approach taken. They were less concerned about detrimental effects on their children but this was mediated by their trust in the head teacher as gatekeeper. Key implications are that whilst parents are open to ISM, they are increasingly demanding that it is provided on their terms. Whilst sales promotional ISM schemes may have been acceptable and effective in the past, this may not be the case in future. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Cause-related marketing; Corporate communications; In-school marketing; Marketing to children",""

Traditional forms of scale development and a variety of experimental conditions are undertaken to develop and validate the scale. Statistical techniques include t-tests, correlation, regression, confirmatory factor analysis and a multitrait-multimethod matrix. This research fulfils a significant gap in the current knowledge as the current scales neither distinguish between the distinct types of nostalgia nor measure personal nostalgia as a response to advertising independently of other reactions. This is despite personal nostalgia being considered as a distinct form of nostalgia with a suggested differing influence on a number of important consumer behaviour responses. The scale has implications for researchers undertaking future studies exploring personal nostalgia's influence on consumer behaviour reactions. Nostalgia is also a commonly used and has effective advertising appeal, and this research provides practitioners with a parsimonious instrument to measure the level of personal nostalgia experienced as a result of advertising exposure. This assists in ensuring accuracy when predicting consumer reactions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","autobiographical memory; nostalgia; Personal Nostalgia Scale; scale development",""

Dependent variables were trustworthiness, brand attitude and purchase intent. Ads were created promoting consumer services from both high-trust and low-trust industries. Study 1 found the claim 'locally owned and operated' has no impact on attitudes and intentions as compared to relevant control.

As such, this coding instrument can serve as a starting point for future effectiveness research. To explore the cross-cultural relevance of brand placement, a content analysis of one week of prime time television programs broadcasted in Flanders was conducted to examine the differences in frequency and type of brand placements between scripted and non-scripted US and Flemish (Dutch-speaking Belgian) television programs. While no differences concerning frequency were observed, types of brand placement differed significantly between program genres and countries of origin. Flemish marketers more often place their brands in scripted programs, while American marketers seek out placement opportunities in non-scripted programs more often.

This paper looks into the extent of replacement of a number of off-line sources by search and postings in virtual communities on a general level and explores variations across different types of users of virtual communities as described by Kozinets (1999, European Management Journal). Results build on an empirical study (n = 103) carried out in virtual communities on the Internet. This study shows that virtual communities, to some extent, replace commercial sources such as sales personnel, brochures, and advertisements distributed by mail, but only replace primary reference groups as sources of product information to a very limited extent. For most sources, no differences in level of replacement were found across Kozinets' segments. Thus, the level of replacement seems to be largely unrelated to the social tie to the community and interest in the product class. The findings imply that the possibility for some types of commercial source to influence consumers during their decision process may be diminished. It seems especially important for retailing to consider new roles for sales personnel, and for marketers in general to consider whether consumer use of virtual communities should influence their communication mix and distribution strategy. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Consumer behaviour; Information search; Internet; Marketing communications; Virtual community; Word-of-mouth",""

It was found that more successful companies tended to use word of mouth proactively, and that it is an effective marketing tool for turbulent environments. Furthermore, chaos theory is shown as a good lens through which to view word of mouth. This paper is important because word of mouth has had little attention from the academic community, with the exception of electronic or Internet based word of mouth. Furthermore, it suggests an academic theory to underpin word of mouth that has not been considered before.

Subjects who were incidentally exposed to banner ads reported greater priming effects induced by implicit memory, more favorable Aad, and greater likelihood for the advertised brand to be included in a consideration set over no exposure to the ad.

The second experiment to assess the conditions conducive to incidental exposure examined two advertising strategies: format (animated vs. static) and placement (congruency vs. incongruency). Findings suggest that the level of congruency between an advertised product and Webpage content play significant roles in affecting consumers' responses to incidentally exposed banner ads. This paper examines the results of these two experiments before discussing the implications for the role of Web ads on brand building and directions for future research. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Attitude; Click-through; Consideration set; Incidental exposure; Memory; Web advertising",""

According to this model, integrating marketing communications involves mixing and matching different communication options to establish the desired awareness and image in the minds of consumers. The versatility of on-line, interactive marketing communications to marketers in brand building is also addressed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Brand building; Brand resonance; Customer-based brand equity; Integrated marketing communications; Interactive marketing communications",""

However, the conditions under which humor might be associated with offense in advertising had never been empirically explored, prior to the content analysis reported in this article. The findings of this study of consumer complaint adjudication reports, published by the Advertising Standards Authority of New Zealand, confirm that intentional humor is often present in advertisements audience members complain about. However, findings also suggest that audiences are (1) more offended by inherently offensive themes than anything else, and (2) when an intentionally humorous advertisement offends, it is likely because it is a certain type of humor that frequently includes an inherently offensive theme.","Advertising humor; Controversial products and services; Offensive advertising; Offensive themes and portrayals",""

In addition, there is a considerable amount of literature on the Hispanic consumer's attitude towards advertising. Prior research has focused on the Hispanic audience's preference for English language versus Spanish language advertisements and provided normative guidelines for advertisers. This paper analyses the content from advertisements in a Spanish language magazine and dual language (English-Spanish) magazine in order to determine whether they adhere to these normative guidelines. The findings suggest that media vehicle selection does play a part in determining the language content of an advertisement as well as the amount of copy used in English language and Spanish language advertisements. The results also suggest that the amount of advertisements that use a bilingual approach remains small, with advertisers preferring an either/or approach to language selection.","Bilingual; Code switching; Hispanic; Language",""

While this has produced some culinary triumphs, it has also produced heartburn in equal quantity. This paper seeks the perfect recipe for integrated marketing communication (IMC) education by asking a Delphi panel of IMC champions questions relating to the place of IMC in the university setting; the teaching, research and curriculum development issues and the future for IMC education. The panel draws a chaotic picture of IMC education and identifies some important obstacles to curriculum development. It also predicts a number of key challenges for the future, including turf wars; the lack of faculty experience and enthusiasm to embrace IMC and the desperate need to grow the IMC brand. But perhaps the greatest challenge is how to create a generalist education in a culture of specialisation that exists both in the university and in the workplace. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Curriculum development; Delphi study; Future of IMC education; IMC education; Obstacles to IMC curriculum",""

We contribute with two models that may help to explain how companies can best communicate about their CSR initiatives. Based on a reputation survey and two case studies of Danish corporate CSR frontrunners, first we develop an 'inside-out approach' to suggest how managers can manage their CSR activities to achieve favourable CSR reputation in a 'Catch 22' context. Employees appear as a key component in building trustworthiness as CSR communication is shown to evolve when taking an 'inside-out approach'. Second, we develop a CSR communication model with two CSR communication processes targeting different stakeholder groups: 'the expert CSR communication process' and 'the endorsed CSR communication process'.

Much of the research into IMC has focused on the consumer market, with little regard for the business-to-business environment. This paper introduces the case of the Tasmanian Light Shipbuilding Cluster and, in particular, the manner in which its reactionary response to global pressure impacted on its marketing communications processes, which resulted in the cluster becoming one of Australia's most successful industry clusters. The research suggests that cluster members' reactionary approach to marketing communications conventions supports the efficacy of IMC in business-to-business practice. The findings suggest that small business-to-business firms faced with global pressures exhibit a natural convergence towards a consistent communications approach.

As would be expected, participants' intent to vote for a candidate who uses negative political advertising is higher for a high-credibility candidate than for a low-credibility candidate.

However, highly involved participants do experience greater cynicism when a high-credibility candidate uses negative political advertising rather than when a low-credibility candidate uses such advertising.

Results revealed variability within and across these elements suggesting that offensiveness is subject to contextual influences. Specifically, products influence perceptions primarily in traditional media, and in the use of nudity, religious references and violence. Interestingly, product identification was shown to temper perceptions of offense; respondents who were not informed of a specific product often found advertising scenarios more offensive than those who were exposed to either a condom, beer, or hand soap scenario. Findings also revealed that 'other' media generate the highest overall offense levels and that religious and political values influence perceptions of offense. Contrary to popular belief, nudity and sex were not perceived as offensive, per se. Rather, offensiveness depended largely upon the level of congruency between advertising scenario elements. Overall, the study demonstrates that offensiveness is dependent upon many contextual variables both internal and external to the consumer.","Consumer perceptions; Media; Offensive; Product",""

This paper considers the content of one type of such communications, the annual report, and looks at how organisations are taking a focused stakeholder view of CSR rather than a wider view as would be expected from the ambiguity of definitions of the concept. Differences in reporting practices were found by an analysis of the annual and CSR reports of 28 FTSE4Good firms focusing on a variety of industries. Findings show that there is a significant difference between how organisations in different industries report on CSR consistent with a stakeholder view of CSR, and that this reporting follows for the most part the expectations of the CSR communications literature. It is suggested that firms report on CSR in line with what their key stakeholders expect, thus giving evidence for CSR reporting as another tool in the marketing communicators toolbox.","Annual reports; Corporate Social Responsibility; Stakeholder theory",""

Differences in the relationship between arousal and memory were explored for male and female participants. In general, females were found to exhibit higher memory levels than males. As a single combined group, subjects exposed to emotion arousing versus emotion neutral ad. stimuli exhibited no significant difference in memory. For the set of emotion neutral ad. stimuli, no difference in memory was found between sexes. However, retention was significantly higher for females than males for the set of emotion-arousing stimuli.

Yet prior to this study, the impact of multi-year sponsorship and attendance on a sponsoring brand have not been investigated. The study addresses this gap through the examination of field survey results obtained during an annual sporting event. Data from a sample of 1227 attendees suggest that multi-year attendance is associated with enhanced brand image and purchase intentions of an ongoing title sponsor's products. There are significant differences in attendees': (1) attitudes about the title sponsor and (2) increased likelihood of purchasing the sponsor's vehicles. Attitudes about the title sponsor were most favorable among spectators who attended the annual event multiple times and those who attended the event multiple times showed an increased likelihood of purchasing a new vehicle from the title sponsor. Advancing relationship theory, we find that consumers appreciate that the corporate brand contributes more to society than its primary business activities, and in turn, consumers indicate that they act on that appreciation.","Event marketing; Relationship marketing; Sponsorship",""

The study is timely and relevant to the field because it employs an empirical approach to addressing the heated controversy over the validity of the integrated marketing communications concept. This controversy is based upon doubt about the theoretical basis for integrated marketing communications and the lack of empirical research in the field identified in the integrated marketing communications literature. In an effort to address the conceptual validity controversy directly, the study adopted the first use of an experimental approach in the integrated marketing communications field. The results of the experiment suggest that messages employing some of the key aspects of an integrated marketing communications strategy (i.e. messages with a common theme that are executed across multiple media in a visually consistent manner) may prompt a stronger attitude towards the brand level than the same messages employing a more traditional strategy (executions with less visual consistency), although other dependent measures were not similarly impacted upon.

Therefore, the experiment presented here seeks to determine the effect that a controversial advertisement execution has on elaborative processing and brand message comprehension when potential contaminating influences are held constant in the controversial and non-controversial execution conditions. Results demonstrate that controversial advertisement executions increase elaboration (i.e. the number of cognitive responses and ratings of elaborative processing) regardless of the level of product involvement. A cross-over interaction reveals that higher product involvement subjects better comprehend a controversial advertisement execution, but lower product involvement subjects better comprehend a non-controversial advertisement execution. Comprehension results are consistent with the resource-matching perspective. The resource-matching perspective holds that there is an upside-down U-shaped relationship between processing outcomes and cognitive resources required to successfully process an advertisement execution, such that information processing is optimized when required resources match the resources that one has made available for advertisement processing.

The empirical results show strong support for the fact that persuading consumers to make an active commitment to a cause can serve as an important prerequisite for behavioural consistency (in terms of the willingness to buy a product). Further, the paper adds to the evidence on selfperception theory as an underlying mechanism for the effectiveness of the technique.

It does this through a focus on the web design aesthetics used in the web sites of small to large companies, and a comparison of these aesthetics with the preferences of target users. Web design contributes to services branding and a finding of a tendency of the majority of websites to employ what may be termed a 'male design aesthetic', and for men and women to have a differential preference as between the male and female design aesthetic, leads to a discussion of the appropriateness of previous service branding models. These earlier models discuss the role of internal staff in developing service branding values but neglect to consider the dissonance that may exist between the values of internal staff and the values of external customers. The article argues that only where the values of internal staff are congruent with those of external customers is it appropriate to model brand values around the preferences of internal staff. In those other cases where the brand values of internal staff do not span the complete range of aesthetic choices available, questions need to be asked about how best these external values can be reflected in the marketing and design of services targeted at customers. There are implications here for recruitment, promotion and training that are not currently reflected in existing services branding models, and which therefore, serve as an important addition to the services branding model.","Gender; Internal and external customers; Mirroring principle; Service branding; Web design",""

Our research reveals that users are emotionally attached to their mobile devices and that attachment is to a large degree attributable to a sense that the device is an essential part of life with a value that goes beyond simple communication. Those with a strong sense of attachment are more receptive to mobile adverts, however overall users generally find them irritating. It appears that advertisers have hitherto been insufficiently user-centric; responses are as important as the message yet there is a tendency to concentrate on what is being sent rather than how it is received. We conclude that consumer receptiveness might improve by targeting users who are strongly attached their mobile devices. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Consumer receptiveness; Emotional attachment; Mobile advertising; Mobile devices",""

Thus, this research empirically analysed the financial impact that winning a Clio Award for advertising has on publicly traded firms. Using the event study methodology, this paper extends the growing body of research that seeks to explain how specific events affect a firm's expected future earnings. The findings suggest that, for food manufacturers and retailers, winning one or more Clio Awards may result in positive cumulative abnormal returns. However, the results also suggest that there may be some negative connotations associated with Clio Awards that may be derived from the difficulties in determining the actual return on investment for specific advertising activities.","Advertising creativity; Event study; Financial performance",""

The paper describes the findings from a series of depth interviews with senior executives from leading advertising and public relations agencies. While the findings do indicate the presence of ongoing barriers to the adoption and usage of integrated solutions, these barriers are as much an issue to do with clients as with the agencies themselves. Nonetheless, there seems to be an issue concerned with remodelling working practices to accommodate new and seamless ways of working creatively across all promotional mix elements. Thus, while the principles of integrated marketing communications are sound, the actual mechanisms for application still need further work -in terms of both application and measurement, and the need for in-depth research. We also endorse and reiterate oft-repeated calls for research with client organizations.","Ad. agencies; Brand campaigns; Integrated marketing communications; PR agencies",""

This study empirically examines the influence of receptivity to advertising messages (RTAM) on desired shopping values and assesses whether this relationship is moderated by gender, age, and income. The structural model indicates that, compared to low-RTAM shoppers, high-RTAM shoppers tend to perceive each of the six value dimensions, (i.e. monetary cost saving, time cost saving, energy cost saving, post-sale customer support, engaging store environment, and personal leisure experience) as more important in making a retail patronage decision. Further analysis shows that the links from RTAM to monetary cost saving and to post-sale customer support are stronger for younger male shoppers. Another interesting finding is that the link from RTAM to monetary cost saving is stronger for high-income shoppers whereas the link from RTAM to engaging store environment is stronger for low- and middle-income shoppers. If retail advertisers are aware of the value dimensions that are crucial to the high-RTAM segment within specific target markets, they could achieve advertising goals more effectively and efficiently through tailored advertising messages. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Age; Gender; Income; Retail advertising; Shopping value",""

Although most research has examined the issue of positioning a new brand from a managerial perspective, there has been little research framing the important issue of positioning from the consumers' perspective or that looks at the ubiquitous problem of repositioning a familiar brand. In this paper, a framework is developed which suggests that a successful communication strategy aimed at repositioning a familiar brand is based on two factors: the learning of the new positioning and the inhibition of the old positioning. Evidence is provided to support the notion that a repositioning communication is most effective when interference of the old positioning, engendered by competitive interference, is paired with the learning of the new positioning.","Competitive interference; Repositioning",""

This paper overviews the transformation in media and describes the implications for integrated marketing communications (IMC) practice and scholarship. Digital media brings about infinite reproduction of content, consumer networking, user-generated content and an expansion of media from news and entertainment to almost any technology that has a digital interface with people. The role of media in marketing communications practices shifts from the execution of message strategies into an extension of consumer understanding. Media planning, the practice of allocating a media budget across a set of vehicles, will be replaced by a dynamic, automated process that serves ads based on information streams of consumer intentions and actions.

After a pilot study, the main study consisting of 478 respondents was conducted and a structural equation model was used to test the relationships between the constructs. The results suggest that envelope message and envelope characteristics based attribution does influence intent to open direct mail. Specific message appeals shown to influence significantly recipients' intention to open direct mail include messages that evoke the feelings of importance, non-price incentive, and gratitude. Additionally, personalized, standardized and official envelope characteristics also influence the recipient's intention to open the direct mail.

The two main avenues followed so far have focused on either making consumers change their food choices or improving the nutrition content of food products. Both avenues are said to have limitations since consumers often base their choices on heuristics that simplify their choices, such as brands. Therefore, branding is considered an important tool in communicating the value of health and contributing towards healthier food choices. However, branding a food product based on the value of health is not an easy practice as strategies employed may often fail to convey the value of health.

Perceptions of employees, students, journalists and professional colleagues were measured for each company. The reputations of the two companies were different in synchronization of perceptions of respondent groups for each company (one high and one low) and in their comparative scores from different respondent groups. The study discovered that two companies could be equally successful in performance while their reputations can be significantly different. The second significant theoretical implication of the study was the finding that a composite, aggregate measure of a corporate reputation can obscure as much as reveal perceptions of different valuing groups. The main practical implication of the study is that companies can achieve comparable performances despite having different personalities both in profile and in coherence.

This paper analyzes consumers' attitudes towards the two concepts. Methodology: This study used an online survey on a convenience sample of Internet users in Croatia and a telephone survey (CATI method) on a representative sample of Croatian citizens. Findings: Two main hypotheses researched in this paper are: consumers have a more positive attitude toward interactive marketing communication than toward one-way communication (H1); consumers have a more positive attitude toward relationship personalization than toward classical transactional relationship (H2). It was found that consumers do want interactive communication, but they are more rigorous about personalization. H1 was accepted, while H2 was accepted only for certain industries. Implications: These findings have implications for the direction of relationship development with consumers. They provide an insight into how consumers want to communicate with companies and organizations and what level of personalization they expect or require. In addition, the findings indicate what companies or organizations should do in order to draw consumers into interactive personalized relationships.","ICT; Interactivity; Marketing communications; Personalization; Relationship",""

Moreover, it was expected that social identification with the consumer of GM foods mediates the relationship between both regulatory fit and attitudes and regulatory fit and behavioural intentions. The results support our hypotheses by showing that communicated messages that are congruent (vs incongruent) with consumers' regulatory orientations enhanced social identification with the consumer of GM foods, which, in turn, positively affected attitudes and behavioural intentions. Management implications for designing informative messages regarding GM foods are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Attitudes; Behavioural intentions; Communication messages; Genetically modified foods; Regulatory fit; Social identification",""

Although many of these campaigns have directed consumers to use 'moderation' and/or 'drink responsibly', consumer interpretations of the messages has not been extensively researched. This study was undertaken to better understand how alcohol advertisements with socially responsible messages are discerned by consumers, and how this discernment may affect well-known advertising outcomes. Results indicate that alcohol moderation advertisements are perceived as being more ambiguous than product advertisements and that consumer's may perceive the advertiser's motive as self-serving. Together, these results suggest that using strategically ambiguous 'responsibility' messages may potentially negatively impact both the alcohol manufacturer's corporate credibility and consumer purchase intention.","Advertiser motives; Alcohol moderation advertising; Social responsibility",""

By using real slogans and brands, this study increases our understanding of how slogans work in the presence of several competing slogans and brands. It is found that mismatching of slogans and brands can be explained by the different memory processes used by consumers. The cued retrieval process generally leads to the correct brand being identified, whereas the constructive memory process is sensitive to memory distortions. However, constructive memory allows for a larger influence of the slogan on the brand than does cued retrieval. The study adds to research on slogans and on source identification. Suggestions on how to use slogans in a cluttered environment, such as creating annoying and irritating slogans or using variations of slogans, are given. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Brands; Competitive interference; Constructive memory; Slogans; Source identification",""

This paper investigates how the benefits obtained compared to those that may have been expected from a single sponsorship. While the sponsorship was very effective in creating awareness for NTL, ambivalent attitudes were found towards the company.

Internal marketing is an initiative adopted by the organizations studied in order to nourish a marketing orientation. The implementation approach shapes the nature and form of the internal marketing communications that organizations adopt. Even though UK retail banks intend to implement internal marketing effectively, in reality the current implementation approach appears to be counter-productive to the achievement of the core aims of the initiative. The core finding from this exploratory research suggests that there are substantial barriers to the successful implementation of internal marketing within the banks studied, barriers such as the focus on short-term sales goals, the lack of a formal and 'holistic' implementation approach and the creation of 'personnel discrimination' and negative internal competition.","Internal marketing; Internal marketing communications; Marketing orientation; Sales orientation",""

The findings are based on face-to-face interviews in mid-2001 in 24 large and small advertising agencies. This sample included all but four of the Scottish total. The respondents were individuals who either had a specific account planning remit or were senior managers who considered it to be one of their responsibilities. Analysis of transcripts of the interviews suggested four key factors determining how the principle is converted into practice and four distinct models of the account planner's role in the process. It also found that the expected 'conflict' between creative teams and those responsible for strategic planning was in fact seen as productive 'tension' and that pragmatic collaboration was feasible. However, there was conflict with the parallel discipline of media planning. Two future scenarios are discussed and the conclusion drawn that the discipline needs to pay as much attention to planning survival strategies for itself as it does to planning campaign strategies for its clients.

Unlike 'single-stage' models, which are frequently used by economists, in which manufacturers appear to sell directly to consumers or to deal with them through an inert distribution system, retailers in a dual-stage world neither buy nor sell as perfect competitors. Although in some industry structures advertising will raise prices to consumers, the welfare effects of advertising are far more benign in a dual-stage world. In intensively advertised categories consumers are more disposed to switch stores within brand than brands within store (just the opposite of relationships in categories where brand franchises are weak) causing there to be an inverse association between margins at the two stages. Thus, while intensive advertising will normally raise factory prices it will drive down retailer margins, often to the point that retail prices are below the levels that would be obtained if the industry were only lightly advertised. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Advertising Response Function; Dealer Support; Retail Gross Margin; Retail Penetration; Single- And Dual-STAGE Models",""

Functional product banner advertisements have higher initial click-throughs that quickly deteriorate and they have no effect through advertisement impressions.

It examines the performance of the code in terms of the number of complaints upheld and complaint by medium and product type and the voluntary response of advertisers. The findings suggest a weakening in the standard of advertising self-regulation in Australia, with fewer provisions in the Code of Ethics, a significantly fewer number of complaints upheld and no real power of enforcement.

As male product markets grow and gender roles in shopping become blurred, identifying male mavens could be a useful promotional tool. Sixty male and 78 female market mavens were identified from a survey of 455 German consumers, which differed only marginally in terms of age and education. The prime decision-making traits of male mavens differed from females and were related to brand consciousness, shopping avoidance/satisficing, impulsiveness, speedy fashion seeking, perfectionism, price–value consciousness, confused by overchoice and quality brand loyal. Implications and recommendations for marketers targeting male product markets in Germany are discussed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Gender Differences In Decision Making; Male Market Mavens; Word-OF-MOUTH Communication",""

This study applied two advertising constructs and their operationalizations which were developed in the USA: beliefs about advertising and attitudes towards advertising in general (AG). Specifically, this paper intends to determine whether the factor structure of these beliefs is similar to those in the USA and other South Asian countries. It also measures whether Taiwanese consumers' beliefs about advertising predict their AG. Six belief factors were extracted and they accounted for 56.5% of the variance. While the results from the factor analysis did not replicate the results from the USA and other South Asian countries perfectly, the similarities were large enough to conclude that the belief structure underlying AG is similar to these regions. By regression analysis, four of the six factors contributed significantly to the prediction of consumers' AG. Three out of four predictor factors matched those found in other Asian countries. These findings indicated that Taiwanese consumers had the same AG as those in five South Asian countries. These consistent findings provide a benchmark for future study on crossnational consumer beliefs about advertising and AG. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Attitudes Towards Advertising; Attitudes Towards Advertising In General; International Advertising; Questionnaire Survey; Taiwan",""

This preliminary study investigated the impact of a previously overlooked television context factor, the pre-commercial break announcement, during televised coverage of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games in the USA. Broadcast advertising is not part of the official Olympic sponsorship package and advertisers must negotiate television schedules in addition to sponsor fees. During the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the official US television network, NEC, included numerous pre-commercial break mentions spotlighting official sponsors as well as other advertisers who purchased commercial time during the event. This study investigated the impact of pre-break announcements on viewers' ability for distinguishing between official sponsors and regular programme advertisers. It was determined that these announcements do influence recall and increase the likelihood that any advertiser will be identified as a sponsor, thus compromising the value of an Olympic sponsorship.","Media effects; Sponsorships; Sponsorships value; Television advertising recall",""

Revenue maximization was operationalized pertaining to sponsorship. A survey instrument was sent to all sponsors of a Melbourne-based football club. The sponsors were grouped as location dependent and location independent based on the location of their head office and financial turnover achieved in the area around the sports facility. The survey collected information on three different steps in the sports consumption process including 'coming to the sports facility', 'being in and around the sports facility' and 'being serviced in the sports facility'. t-Tests were run for most items of the questionnaire in relation to location dependency. Indicative evidence was found in support of the general hypothesis. In particular, direct sales (turnover) in the area around a sports facility were found to be an important factor when considering the issue of location dependency. Smaller, lowspending sponsors with an important percentage of turnover in the area around the sports facility were less likely to move with the football club to a (remote) new facility. In relation to sponsors' objectives, it was found that the objectives of location-dependent sponsors are directed more towards direct sales (or product /brand related as defined elsewhere), whereas location-independent sponsor's objectives seemed to be indirectly related to sales (or corporation related and generation of media benefits as defined elsewhere). © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Distribution And Location; Facility Management; Sponsorship Retention; Sports Sponsorship",""

Based on information processing and related theories, three hypotheses were developed and tested. Using a survey approach, respondents' WOM communications were matched to a receiver and the evaluation of the communication was assessed for both groups. It was found that the giver and receiver of a WOM communication did not evaluate the message in the same way, even at the time of transmission.

Consumers and business people were observed unobtrusively while navigating the WWW. During a retrospective in-depth interview, the underlying motivations were probed and the respondent was confronted with video images of his/her own navigation behaviour. The analysis and interpretation of these two sources of data resulted in the development of a grounded theory of search and surf behaviour on the WWW by linking the behaviour and motivations with the visited websites. The following five behavioural search scenarios were discovered from the data: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.

Integrated marketing communications is not a new concept but the need to integrate a variety of often disparate promotional activities has taken on a new imperative over recent years. The fact that integration of marketing communications does take place is unquestionable but the degree of integration is often minimal. The need to strive for greater integration is considered inevitable by many, although the means by which such integration may be achieved is uncertain. This paper identifies and briefly describes four reasons for the problems encountered in achieving integration; in particular, concern is expressed over the current restrictive use of marketing communications language and taxonomy. It is suggested that a useful starting point to overcoming these problems is to review how we think about integration and a new way of conceptualizing the various aspects of integrated marketing communications is proposed. A 'mindscape of marketing communications' is offered to describe the marketing communications mix in a way which can better embrace its many and varied activities and encourage more integrative thinking about the use of its various elements. Significantly, the additional roles of customer contact management and database management are considered paramount in an era of integration.

The paper first considers this debate from the context of the burgeoning literature on this topic. The findings from an empirical study with parents of primary-age children in New Zealand are then presented. However, any kind of proposed relationship between obesity and advertising tends to be as much emotive as evidential, with for-and-against camps lined up to defend entrenched positions. However, it does seem fair to argue that, while advertising does present a problem in relation to food selection choice, many other issues, such as peer pressure, quality of life, in-school food services, nearby retail outlets and social class criteria, exacerbate the problem. Thus, easy solutions based on insufficient evidence that have failed to substantiate causal effects between advertising (ostensibly) directed at children and nutrition can be seen as inequitable and, thus, ineffective in their intended aims. Although here the paper considers the problem from a New Zealand perspective, the findings may have implications for research elsewhere in the world.","Advertising; Children; Marketing communications; Obesity; Policy",""

The findings show that Japanese multinational corporations are likely to localize their web communications through tailoring on-line creative strategies according to the target market. Domestically, soft sell approaches are used more than hard sell approaches in Japan, whilst the relation reverses in the USA. Spain equally weighs both approaches. Cross-culturally, while Japan tends to employ soft sell approaches more than the other countries, there is no significant difference across the three countries.

In this paper the evolution of DTCA is reviewed and the arguments surrounding it examined. The paper concludes that many of the criticisms levelled at DTCA have no empirical foundation and that opposition to DTCA wanes rapidly once it has become established. Overall, the benefits arising from DTCA outweigh the posited but largely unproven disadvantages thought to be associated with it. The regulatory approaches taken to DTCA are also evaluated and the Food and Drug Administration's implemented system is compared with the New Zealand self-regulatory operation. The paper suggests that a self-regulatory approach, complemented by parallel government monitoring, provides an efficient and responsive system that promotes responsible and ethical advertising. Countries currently reviewing DTCA would do well to examine and learn from the experiences of the New Zealand advertising industry.","Direct to consumer advertising; Prescription medicines",""

Furthermore, it appeared that the enhanced involuntary attention gained through the use of fast-paced advertisements comes in the form of attention directed towards the non-claim (advertisement executional) elements of an advertisement as opposed to the message-based (copy) elements of the advertisement.

In 10 years the proportion of the population claiming to be vegan or vegetarian doubled, while those identified as meat avoiders almost quadrupled with a further 40% now being classified as 'meat reducers' by Gallup. Means-End analysis was used for studying the underlying motivations of three groups: meat eaters, meat reducers and vegetarians. Health was found to be the central issue in food choice, but each group sought different terminal values. The view that meat reducers (and possibly even meat avoiders) are demivegetarians is challenged by the finding that their underlying motivations are similar to meat consumers and quite unlike those of vegetarians. Persuading meat reducers to adopt a vegetarian diet would require the difficult task of changing the enduring terminal values that they seek to attain through food choice behaviour. In contrast, persuading them to eat more meat would 'only' be a question of changing their beliefs about the healthiness of meat consumption.

It is argued that consumers from different cultures tend to have different construals of the self, which in turn influence their cognition, emotion, motivation and behaviour. It is proposed that cross-cultural differences in consumer responses to different advertising appeals may be explained by consumer C-S self-schema, rather than cultural orientation per se. The C-S construct can also be employed to segment the world market across cultures as well as within a culture.

To aid evaluation, a number of models have been developed. This paper critically analyses the most well-known and proposes a new context/objectives-driven model which combines aspects of previous models while refining and adding to them. Within this context, 25 UK award-winning public relations programmes were analysed in order to examine the types of evaluations they used. It was found that only 12 out of 103 evaluations used social science-based research methods for verifying their results. Fifty-one of the 103 evaluations measured programme impact with the other evaluations concentrated on programme outputs. The author found there were issues surrounding the framing of objectives which offered a partial explanation.

The purpose of this paper is to establish whether this theory is recognized and adopted in advertising practice. This is achieved by performing a content analysis. The results indicate that product advertisements contain more information than services, which indicates a discrepancy between advertising theory and practice.

If sufficiently positive, individuals devote additional processing effort to the advertisement and more detailed ad-related factors become the focus. Once processing ends after some or all of an advert has been taken in, an evaluation of whether or not the effort was actually worthwhile - designated as outcome advertising value (OAV) - should be a measurable outcome.

This study surveyed 700 Internet users and employed a lifestyle segmentation approach for categorizing consumers into three distinct lifestyle groups: 'experiencers', 'traditionalists' and 'self-indulgents'. Statistical analyses pointed out that all three groups differed from one another in several demographic characteristics. Moreover, the lifestyle clusters were found partly to predict Internet users' attitudes towards Internet advertising. The findings of the present study provide justifications for marketers to treat Internet users as a heterogeneous group. Furthermore, advertising researchers should be aware of the diversity of the Internet population in order to assess the effectiveness of Internet advertising better.","Attitudes towards Internet advertising; Cluster analysis; Factor analysis; Internet advertising; Lifestyle segmentation",""

Until the mid-1990s there were no foreign advertising agencies in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There were several local agencies, mostly connected with the media. Since 1996 several international agencies have entered the market. The process of transformation from underdeveloped and local level to international competition was stimulated by overall economic liberalization and by intensive growth of the media sector in the country. Today there are 23 agencies for advertising and marketing communications in the Bosnia-Herzegovina market and the overall annual turnover of the sector is US$15-20 million. The purpose of this paper is descriptive: to describe the rejuvenation of a national advertising industry following a period of war and economic destruction.

Recent models of the corporate identity management process have reflected the importance of communication in the management of corporate identity. Corporate communication has been regarded as being composed of three forms: management, marketing and organizational communication. Most organizations are structured such that management and organizational communication are closely aligned with the corporate identity of an organization. However, the conjunction between corporate identity and marketing communication is less discernible. It has been noted that the interaction between corporate and marketing communication is 'tentative and embryonic in nature'. The authors conducted empirical research, which explored the extent to which corporate identity was integrated into the marketing communication campaigns of these practitioners. The conclusions from this exploratory research suggest that there are substantial barriers to the successful integration of corporate identity with marketing communications. Barriers such as the importance of integration not being accepted by clients, the focus of marketing managers on short-term goals, too many people involved with managing the core message of corporate identity and an ad hoc approach towards marketing communication were important. Further research into structural and behavioural ways of overcoming these barriers could prove to be extremely valuable. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Corporate Communication; Corporate Identity; Imc; Marketing Communication",""

Studies of neuro-linguistic programming have indicated that each individual tends to have a preferred sensory representational system with which they will internally code these experiences. Market segments are comprised of individuals who, although possessing similarities across traditional segmentation bases, also have different preferred sensory modalities. Therefore, if consumers within any given target market segment do not all talk the same sensory language, marketers are failing to get their message across to everyone within that segment. This study is concerned with examining the efficacy of television advertising in communicating to those within a target group by exploring the links between the advertisements that 'speak' to them most and their preferred representational systems. It finds that participant reactions to those advertisements that they regarded as having the most effect were expressed predominantly in language relating to their preferred sensory representational systems. Furthermore, where participants with different representational systems chose the same advertisement as having the most effect, the reasons for their choice differed on a sensory basis.","Consumer behaviour; Neuro-linguistic programming; Sensory representational systems; Television advertising",""

The popularity of the Internet with consumers and businesses drives thousands of firms to promote their products and services using World Wide Web (known hereinafter as the Web) sites. Technology has created a competitive arena that enables exposure to consumers worldwide, who can now easily communicate with each other. This potential for exposure has dramatic implications for any business considering the Internet as a promotional vehicle. The growing popularity of Internet sites, where users may discuss their feelings about companies and products, allows an increased scrutiny of all aspects of business. If companies do not deal effectively with this scrutiny, brand equity is vulnerable to erosion. Therefore, all contingencies inherent in promotional efforts on the Internet must be weighed carefully.

While mention of the brand for an image attribute was positively related to future purchase, this relationship did not vary between attributes once brand and attribute size was taken into account. However, a positive relationship was found between the number of attributes associated with the brand and future purchase. This suggests that image attributes can be considered to be analogous to 'distribution' outlets in consumer memory. The more attributes the brand is associated with, the greater the likelihood the consumer will think of and therefore consider the brand for purchase and that the brand will be acceptable on any criteria used. Therefore, just as a manufacturer would aim to obtain a wide geographic distribution for a supermarket brand, perhaps brand managers should aim to obtain a wide mental 'distribution' for their brand by linking it to a wide range of attributes. The long-term aim is that the brand is salient for any number of attributes likely to be used by the consumer.","Actributes; Brand salience; Branding; Buyer behaviour; Positioning",""

If this latent activism reaches a critical mass, it will become a phenomenon that planners can no longer afford to ignore.

Brand awareness (memory) and brand liking are elements of customer mind set brand equity. The factors determining brand awareness and likeability are also determinants of the change in financial brand equity. In order to understand these factors, Signal Detection Theory is employed for finding the components of brand awareness and likeability. Signal Detection Theory has a strong tradition in psychology, but is under-represented in marketing and consumer behaviour. This study extended the concept of brand awareness to 'awareness sensitivity and bias' and the concept of 'brand likeability' to 'liking sensitivity and bias' using Signal Detection Theory. The effect of divided attention on the extended components was investigated in three laboratory experiments. It was found that, in the attended mode compared with the unattended mode, consumers perform better in preserving a favourable brand awareness and have a conservative reaction tendency. This effect of attention occurs in building brand awareness for short presentations, but not for long presentations.

This paper attempts to address this situation through an exploratory analysis of placement effects within a UK cinema audience. The quantitative approach allows insight into those key mediating variables which impinge upon the process. The results suggest that placements do increase levels of brand salience. Further, these levels may be significantly increased in individuals who like (or attend to) the film and who are high self-monitors. Prior exposure and product category familiarity provided less significant results but, on the whole, the implications for marketers are positive. Methodological issues are considered in the light of these results and directions for future research are suggested. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brands; Cinema Advertising; Placements; Salience; Self-MONITORING",""

A number of World Wide Web (WWW) sites have cropped up on the Internet, their specific aim being the fomenting of negative communication about companies: these are known as corporate complaint WWW sites. Little research has been conducted on negative on-line consumer-to-consumer articulations and the possible impact that these might have on consumers' perceptions and attitudes. This paper attempts to foster discussion on the use of the Internet in facilitating consumer-to-consumer communication, particularly negative communication. First, background information on corporate complaint WWW sites is provided. Then, a survey that was conducted in order to glean information on consumer knowledge of and responses to these kinds of WWW sites is discussed. The results indicate that, among the population used in this study, the awareness of corporate complaint WWW sites was moderate. However, when respondents were aware of them, they were likely to visit them. Social influence plays a role in influencing awareness and prompting visits to corporate complaint WWW sites. In addition, an individual difference factor, attitudes towards complaining, influenced the kinds of activities in which the respondents engaged when they visit corporate complaint WWW sites. Future research directions are proposed.","Consumer-to-consumer articulations; Corporate complaint WWW sites; Internet; Negative on-line communication; Word of mouth",""

US advertisers love the Super Bowl because it has reached an average television audience of over 120 million US viewers for the last 10 years. This manuscript examines the popularity of Super Bowl advertising during the 1990s. Every Super Bowl advertisement aired in the USA during the 10-year period 1990-1999 was video taped and viewed. In addition, USA Today's published Super Bowl advertisement likeability results were incorporated into the analysis. A total of 454 national advertisements were examined with regard to advertisement likeability. The impact of humour, advertisement length, animals, celebrities and product category type on advertisement likeability was assessed with the help of a comprehensive Super Bowl advertisement likeability model. It was hypothesized that each of these variables would be positively related to Super Bowl advertisement likeability. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that all these factors except the presence of celebrities had a strong significant impact on advertisement likeability scores.Based on these findings,this paper provides advertising strategy recommendations for future Super Bowl advertisers and marketing academics. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Advertisement Length; Advertisement Likeability; Animals; Celebrities; Humour; Super Bowl Advertising",""

Over one-third of older children from grade 4 understood that television stations carried advertising for money. Like children in the West, the main reason for liking and disliking commercials depended on their entertainment element. An understanding of television advertising, recall of brands from slogans and comprehension of advertising content were consistently related to the cognitive development of children.

However, when dealing with unacceptable advertising, advertisers in developed countries usually choose a self-regulatory approach in order to stave off government intervention. The recent breakdown of one of the world's longest established advertising self-regulatory programmes in Australia has reopened the 20-year-old debate concerned with enhancing understanding of such regulatory systems. This article presents a framework for assisting in improving the effectiveness of advertising self-regulation that is informed by both the literature and the key findings of an Australian study. The study used a mixed approach to data collection, including in-depth interviews with regulators, advertisers and public participants and historical analysis of more than 10 000 complaints over a period of 10 years. From this research three key concepts are developed for assisting industry and regulators concerned with regulating advertising in eliminating undesirable features of such systems in the future. The empirical work succeeds in making both a practical and theoretical contribution to advertising self-regulation specifically and industry regulation in general.","Acceptable advertising; Advertising regulation; Australia; Concept development; In-depth interviews; Qualitative data",""

These developments pertain to the possibilities of information technology (IT), in particular the Internet and other interactive media, more consumer power initiative and retailer power versus disintermediation. These changes have such important consequences for marketing communication that it is not unreasonable to speak of a 'paradigm shift' in marketing communication. The other papers in this special issue have the same paradigm-shift orientation. One paper argues that marketing communication in the next century will employ many channels and media and, what is even more important, that IT will give more power into the hands of the consumer. Another compares the use of the Internet by British and German businesses for exports to foreign markets. German businesses seem to adopt more structured approaches to the World Wide Web for their international marketing. A further paper discusses interactivity, conversation and the extended information search of human consumers. This paper also saw the development of 'artificial consumers', i.e. browsers and other search engines for information search on the Internet. For all of the papers, the conclusions are that as traditional marketing thinking and practice may become obsolete in the future, new ways of interacting with customers have to be found. These new ways will have considerable consequences for marketing theory. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Consumer Power; Disintermediation; Interactive Communication; Internet",""

Contrary to expectations, the advent of transnational television in South East Asia in particular has met with minimal response from multinational marketers and their advertising agencies operating in the countries under the satellite broadcast footprints. Utilizing qualitative methods this exploratory research on the advertising and broadcasting industries of Indonesia suggests that the domestic media scene, import regulations on programming and commercials, local cultures, level of affluence, agency-client structures and product categories are among the multiple factors influencing the strategic choice between domestic versus global advertising.

There are four major reasons for the loss of traditional advertising’s power. They are the proliferation of advertising-supported media, the increasing volume of commercial messages, the apparent lack of relevance ôf advertising messages and the rising ' consciousness and scepticism of the consumer about advertisers’ claims. It is acknowledged that the use of such hidden media methods helps consumer marketing companies to compensate for the diminishing power of traditional media advertising in the short term.

Therefore, a normative framework is proposed to guide the design of effective communication in product packaging. Based on Habermas' theory of communicative competence, the framework suggests that a set of norms (i.e. the norm of truthfulness, the norm of sincerity, the norm of comprehensibility and the norm of legitimacy) can guide the complex task of designing good product packaging. By following these normative guidelines, marketers can both aggressively position their package to attract and promote, while concurrently avoiding package communication that may be construed as duplicitous. The theory provides a useful benchmark against which both public policy makers and manufacturers can evaluate the level of distortion in labelling and packaging. Consumers should benefit in terms of a clearer depiction of the product offering in the market-place. Marketers adopting these guidelines should benefit from a reduction in the level of package-generated consumer cynicism and an increased potential for enhanced long-term customer relationships. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Communicative Competence; Packaging; Packaging Communication; Product Labelling",""

Identifying the underlying structure of the meaning of integrated marketing communications provides future researchers with a stronger conceptual basis on which to build a definition of integrated marketing communications, which, in turn, provides the foundation for measures which will more accurately determine how integrated marketing communications is used in practice. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Integrated Marketing Communications; Meaning; Quagmire",""

Simultaneously existing theories are challenged. This paper deals with three important presuppositions related to that statement: (a) marketers have separated production from consumption; (b) producers should control market communication; (c) consumers are human. Contemporary research in marketing seems to be focused on the consumers and their experiences, not so much on communication technology. We have also found arguments that consumption no longer can be seen as something separate from buying, post-purchase, etc. We present media in electronic commerce that carries technology elements of interactivity, conversation and extended information search. In a number of cases we demonstrate how interactive media replace producer-to-consumer communication with conversation. In addition we make it clear that such media is used for consumer-to-consumer conversations, sometimes without producer participation. Another important finding is that agent technology has created artificial consumers. We describe these new marketing actors and ask how they differ from human consumers. Our conclusion is that while some existing theories guide us, other theories will hinder us. Finally we propose a search for new theories, rather than ways to fit new problems into old solutions. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agents; Artificial Consumer; Conversation; Electronic Commerce; Interactivity; Internet",""

Some research has suggested that UK companies are neither managing their charitable activities professionally nor capitalizing on the marketing opportunities that corporate philanthropy (CP) provides. Conversely, anecdotal and informal survey evidence has emerged implying that British businesses are perhaps far more commercially orientated towards CP than might previously have been supposed. This paper presents the results of a survey of 281 UK corporate donors across a broad range of industries and companies with widely differing turnovers and numbers of employees. It is concluded that many respondent firms recognized clearly the marketing possibilities and advantages that accompany CP, particularly in the image-enhancement and overall public relations (PR) fields. A majority of the sample businesses located the CP function in a marketing or PR department and 40% stated that they considered CP when drafting marketing plans. The numerous contributions that CP can make to a firm's general promotional effort were confirmed, although the objectives set for CP were vague and the evaluation methods employed were inadequate. Procedures for integrating CP into a company's marketing communications mix need to be better structured, more formal and carefully monitored and controlled. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Altruism; Charities; Community Contributions; Corporate Philanthropy; Marketing Communications; Non-commercial Sponsorship; Public Relations",""

Affective responses, attitude towards the advertisement (Aad) and the brand (Ab) and the favourableness of advertisement-related cognitions were enhanced by the use of warmth although the intensity level (moderate versus high intensity) did not seem to matter. As far as humour was concerned, a high-intensity humorous appeal induced most favourable affective responses, Aad and advertisement-related cognitions, while a moderate level of humour was most conducive for a favourable Ab and brand-related cognitions. Significant interaction effects suggested that the most positive advertisement effects can be obtained by combining high levels of warmth with high levels of humour, while the most positive brand effects can be obtained by combining high levels of warmth and moderate levels of humour. Emotional executions of high intensity led to the most positive affective and cognitive reactions in the case of brands that are not top of mind and to the most positive cognitive reactions in the case where the respondent was a heavy user of the product category. In particular the intensity level of humour led to significant communication effects. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Advertising Effectiveness; Brand Awareness; Humour; Product Use; Warmth",""

Our findings suggest that while brands continue to play important roles for both firms and consumers, it is the way brands are interpreted, managed and communicated that may need rethinking. For each particular brand role to be properly fulfilled, different types of communication programmes are needed. In turn, effective communication strategies can be developed only if the role that the brand is expected to play is accurately specified, both inside the organization and when briefing advertising agencies. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brand communication; Branding; Role of brands",""

The key to this new 'integrated relationship -marketing communications' is rejection of the current competitive/exchange view of relationships generally held by marketing theory and practice, and the adoption of a more humanistic approach to marketing relationships.

Affect intensity refers to the strength of the emotions with which individuals respond to daily life events and affect-laden stimuli. The results showed that high affect intensity individuals experienced significantly more intense empathic emotions in response to emotionally charged advertising appeals, but not in response to non-emotional advertisements: Since affect intensity was significantly related to empathic emotions rather that cognitive empathy, regression analyses showed that it was the empathic emotions which served as the mechanism through which affect intensity influenced the desire to help. Finally, it was found that while high and low affect intensity individuals showed no significant differences in attitudes towards the advertisements, the arousal of stronger empathic emotions among high intensity individuals may have stimulated a stronger desire to help. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Affect intensity; Attitude towards the advertisement; Emotions; Empathy; Personality",""

The results of a national mail survey found many of these marketers using such key integrated marketing communication elements as multiple media, databases, individual-level consumer information and behavioural response measures in their media and message delivery practices. Few, however, were using these elements in a strategic or coordinated fashion.

The paper considers the arguments advanced in the marketing literature, in particular, for a growing convergence between these two disciplines and examines the recent emergence of the concept of ‘marketing public relations’. Here the paper takes as one starting point an article which identified a number of possible schematic representations of the relationship between the marketing and public relations functions and argues the case for a model of increasing convergence between them. The paper goes on to consider the more recent development of ‘marketing public relations’, examining the arguments advanced. The paper argues that from a public relations perspective, the concept of marketing public relations can be seen as an attempt by marketers to ‘hijack’ public relations, incorporating it as an extra element within the promotional mix in order to inform, persuade or remind existing and prospective customers of product or company benefits. It is argued that what some marketers have termed marketing public relations may be no more than the publicity element of public relations practice under a new guise - one perhaps more acceptable than publicity in the societally orientated firms of today. The paper explores two distinct schools of thought - re-examining the relationship between marketing and public relations from both perspectives. The paper suggests that the uneasy symbiosis between these two functions in practice, reflects to a large degree the ambiguity surrounding the relationship between these concepts within much of the literature. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Integrated marketing communications; Marketing public relations; Public relations",""

The recent hype about the Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW), and the National Information Infrastructure (NII) has increased the commercial potential of interactive advertising. In spite of this somewhat overrated optimism about interactive advertising, there lacks an empirical study on the effectiveness of interactive advertisements, as compared to advertisements that have appeared in traditional non-interactive media. The study used an experiment to investigate the effectiveness of interactive advertisements. One hundred and eight computer users from Taiwan, China and the USA watched both interactive and non-interactive advertisements featuring either a battery or a floppy disk. Three advertising effectiveness measures were tested: the attitude towards an advertisement (Aad), the attitude towards an advertised brand (Ab) and the time of exposure to each advertisement. The results indicate that the interactivity of an advertisement does not create a favourable attitude towards the advertisements and the advertised products. The subjects spent less time in an interactive advertisement than its non- interactive version. The insignificant differences between interactive and non-interactive advertising can be the result of several reasons. First, executional characteristics (such as interactivity) only play a limited role in enhancing advertising effectiveness. Second, traditional effectiveness measures failed to show the effects of interactivity. Third, factors such as the subjects' lack of interest in cybershopping, the characteristics of virtual stores and the experimental setting may also lead to these findings. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Advertising Effectiveness; Interactive Advertising; Internet",""

This growth has been fuelled by a demand ‘pull’ and a technology ‘push’. In terms of the former, market fragmentation and increasing individualism resulted in the demise of the mass market. Traditional communications media subsequently began to decline in effectiveness (while simultaneously experiencing escalating costs). Together these resulted in a demand for effectively targeted marketing communications. This demand was met by technological developments; in particular relational databases and desktop publishing (DTP) revolutionized direct marketing. Other, related developments, led to a growth in the depth and accuracy of information held on individual consumers. On the basis of the current trends evident within direct marketing media, the authors identify future prospects for the industry. These include greater integration of direct marketing within the communications mix, a trend towards direct response mechanisms, better targeting and subsequently rising costs. On this basis, successful direct marketers of the future will need to become more sophisticated in terms of encouraging dialogue with consumers and building relationships. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Database marketing; Direct marketing; Market fragmentation; Media effectiveness",""

The present research examines the memory effects of competitive ads that make similar claims (e.g. claims that particular detergents work well on coloured fabrics versus white fabrics). The findings for unfamiliar target brands show that competitive ads making similar claims produced more memory interference. However, target brand familiarity moderated the competitive interference produced by ads that made both similar and dissimilar claims.

"Communication channels in markets: A definition and conceptualization","1997","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3242873344&doi=10.1080%2f135272697345934&partnerID=40&md5=c2d2dac30a233808308ca74c37bc7204","The marketing mix taxonomy by classifying marketing communications according to how they are controlled by the marketer. The proposed definition of 'marketing communications' and 'communication channels' is customer-focused in contrast to the prevailing marketer-focused interpretations in the literature. This definition calls attention to the sources of information received by customers, some of which are only weakly controlled by the marketer. The control of communication channels is conceived in terms of five types-supervisory, contractual, agency, relational and informal. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Marketing Channels; Marketing Communications; Organizational Control; Promotion Mix; Strategic Alliances",""
"Does advertising produce sales today or sales tomorrow?","1995","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142568060&doi=10.1080%2f13527269500000001&partnerID=40&md5=f8b227df1c218d0c605d124b825f4a80","The traditional evaluation of advertising effects has been inefficient because of deficiencies in the research methods used. Sales measures taken at bi-monthly intervals have obscured short-term movements, many of which are driven by advertising. Psychological tracking, by concentrating on long-term changes, is not even relevant to short-term effects. Using the technique of pure single-source research, it is possible to demonstrate a powerful short-term sales effect from advertising, but this does not apply to all campaigns. Indeed some campaigns actually depress sales. Campaigns can also have a measureable long-term effect, but a short term effect is a precondition for this to happen, and the short-term boost is often lost and thus has no lingering effect. The research on which this article is based also demonstrates that a single exposure of an effective advertisement can trigger immediate sales, and that additional exposures immediately afterwards generate very few additional sales. This points to the unwisdom of the traditional policy of concentrating media expenditure into flights/bursts. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"The relationship between public relations and marketing in excellent organizations: Evidence from the IABC study","1998","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042877996&doi=10.1080%2f135272698345816&partnerID=40&md5=a2e23fa5795b6f7758de2bd97625f7b2","Our basic premise is that organizations are best served by the inherent diversity of perspectives provided by separate public relations and marketing functions. Theory developed in the IABC Excellence Project shows that public relations makes an organization more effective when it identifies strategic constituencies in the environment and then develops communication programmes to build long-term, trusting relationships with them. Participation in strategic management provides the integrating link for public relations in enhancing organizational effectiveness. To provide its unique contribution, however, public relations must be separate from other management functions. However, communication programmes should be integrated or coordinated by a public relations department and that department should have a matrix arrangement with other departments it serves. Therefore, we advocate integrated marketing communication of advertising and marketing public relations. We add that an integrated marketing communication programme should be coordinated through the broader public relations function. Data are presented from the Excellence study confirming that public relations is most excellent when it is strategic and when marketing does not dominate public relations. However, public relations was equally excellent when housed in a single department or in specialized communication departments. Beyond structure, we add that marketing communication theories, if applied by an integrated department, differ in important ways from public relations theory and that discussion and research are needed to resolve these differences and to integrate the theories into a broader communication theory. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Excellent Public Relations; Integrated Communication; Integrated Marketing Communication; Public Relations And Strategic Management; Structure Of Public Relations And Marketing Departments",""

However, there has been very limited research on the perceptions of advertising agency professionals faced with daily responsibility for developing effective advertisements. This potentially rich source of knowledge is tapped in this paper through a study of what the professionals perceive as the determinants of effective designs. The paper discusses results concerning a wide range of the variables comprising an advertisement and in an interpretation of the key findings it develops a prototype model for formulating an effective press advertisement. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agency perceptions; Press advertisements; Success elements",""
"Locating marketing within the corporate communication managing system","1998","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042917513&doi=10.1080%2f135272698345834&partnerID=40&md5=ff31e37ac8cc5c70042cb2ccf05e10dd","Where does expertise and responsibility for strategic business communication lie? Marketing and public relations vie for supremacy since both groups specialize in communication, using managed communications to pursue their respective objectives. Convincing arguments for one being subsumed by the other abound. A clarifying discussion of the often-confused vocabulary is the starting point for a review of the nature and role of marketing and public relations and how they are portrayed in respective textbooks. The emerging total management system of corporate communication and its relationship to marketing and public relations is placed in a framework for the integration of corporate strategy, organizational development, human resource management, public relations and marketing. Corporate communication has a dominant role in achieving organizational growth, by being concerned with learning, showing the corporation to itself and as a mode of organization for both external and internal environments. (The term corporation is consciously chosen in place of organization to connote a social collectivity.The term organization is retained for the outcome of the managerial process of organizing). Considerable attention has been afforded in the academic literature to debating the nature of the relationship between marketing and public relations. This paper deals with their respective roles within a corporate communication function and presents and supports an argument for the integration of marketing and public relations with strategic management as part of a disciplined corporate communications management strategy. This requires moving beyond traditional domain boundaries. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Corporate Communication; Integration; Marketing; Public Relations; Total Communication System",""

They ignore the interactive and structural aspects of communication in which formal and emergent networks become established through attempts to exchange information and seek mutual understanding. The underutilized technique of communication network analysis is crucial for understanding these structures of communication. This is nowhere more necessary than when marketing non-profit voluntary services to sensitive groups of people such as the bereaved. The largest bereavement organization in the UK is used as a case study to illustrate the complexities of the communications involved and to demonstrate the need for communication network analysis. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bereavement care services; Communication network analysis; Sensitive groups",""

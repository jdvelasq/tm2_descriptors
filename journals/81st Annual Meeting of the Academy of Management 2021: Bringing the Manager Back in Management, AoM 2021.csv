Building on upper echelons theory, we argue that increasing female board representation will lead firms to increase human capital development policies, though this relationship will ultimately diminish as boards accrue greater levels of gender diversity. We also predict that these policies will translate into greater firm efficiency as well as mediate the relationship between females on the board and firm efficiency. Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from 2007 to 2017, we find support for our arguments. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Efficiency; Board efficiency; Development policies; Firm efficiencies; Gender diversity; Human capital development; Upper echelons theories; Personnel

CSiR consists in organization's activities that violate moral standards, cause harm to stakeholders other than the observing employee, and in which the organization engages voluntarily and knowingly. Relying on experimental and field studies, we provide empirical evidence that CSiR elicits other-condemning and other-suffering moral emotions among employees. In turn, moral emotions trigger punishing behaviors against the organization and compensating behaviors towards the victim.

Yet, heavily affected by the influential dispositional perspective (e.g., the Five-Factor Model of personality traits), this stream of research has predominantly assumed the position that observed relationships between personality traits and work variables are interpreted as personality traits cause work variables, not the other way around. This is also the case for entrepreneurship research. It has primarily interpreted the relationships between personality traits and entrepreneurship as personality traits driving individuals to become entrepreneurs. Challenging this predominant view, the current research built upon recent theory and research in personality psychology and investigated whether become an entrepreneur will change one's personality traits over time. Adopting a role-based perspective and a quasi-experimental design with three wave longitudinal data, our research demonstrated that transitioning into entrepreneurship roles from employees resulted in decreases in agreeableness and increases in neuroticism. We did not observe significant changes attributed to becoming an entrepreneur in the other three Big Five personality traits: extraversion, conscientiousness and openness. This research complements the dominant dispositional perspective in entrepreneurship research and offer practical implications for employees, entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship training. We hope future research may integrate the selection effect of personality traits in changing entrepreneurship status and also the socialization effect of entrepreneurship experiences on altering who one is as a person (e.g., personality and identity). © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,'current; Big five; Five-factor model of personality; Longitudinal data; Personality traits; Role-based

While standards need to diffuse quickly to create perceptions of success (cognitive legitimacy) and hence often have incentives to set low entry barriers, they, at the same time, also have to ensure that participants do not greenwash and create impact (moral legitimacy). We unpack this paradox and show that its salience for standard setters differs depending on (a) the growth trajectory of a standard and (b) the perceived intensity of the demands underlying the paradox. We outline different response strategies that standard setters can use to cope with the paradox. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Cognitive legitimacies; Entry barriers; Greenwash; Growth trajectories; Response strategies; Standards setters

To address this gap, we draw insights from framing theory, adopt an issue-based approach to institutional fields, and trace longitudinally the framing work performed by actors in the UK construction sector. We reveal that field actors clustered their views on modern slavery around five constellations of frames that evolved over time.

Moreover, many theories predict that pure cooperation should often be perceived as unintelligent, adding a social-perception cost which seemingly compounds the original puzzle. In contrast, across eight studies we show that pure cooperation and related prosocial behaviors are (mis)perceived as signs of intelligence. Thus, observers' perceptions help explain rather than compound the puzzle of pure cooperation: pure cooperation is perceived as wise (not foolish) and produces a social-perception benefit (not a social-perception cost). © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Social dilemmas; Social perception

However, they often struggle with conflicting requirements from internal and external networks. We still have very limited knowledge regarding how subsidiaries can handle the conflicts. Through an in-depth case study of an MNE subsidiary, I found that the subsidiary handled three types of conflicts; the subsidiary adopted three type-specific mechanisms and two non-type-specific mechanisms; and these mechanisms were used for two different processes. This study reveals a sophisticated way of handling the conflicts by MNE subsidiaries while maintaining the relationships with internal and external network members. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Case-studies; External network; Internal network
HOW TO MINIMIZE JOB INSECURITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: THE ROLE OF PROACTIVE AND REACTIVE COPING OVER TIME,2021,"81st Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2021: Bringing the Manager Back in Management, AoM 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123482108&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2021.69&partnerID=40&md5=5f6017515ab38d46d12493db2a9a9be2,"Can workers minimize their experience of job insecurity through proactive coping? Contrary to our expectations, this 5-wave weekly survey study indicates that the answer to that question is no: multi-level path modelling results showed that, in the short term, proactive coping related to increased job insecurity at the within-person level. At the between-person level, results indicated that for workers with relatively few resources, proactive coping was even more strongly related to job insecurity. Combining our results with previous findings on proactive coping, we argue that positive outcomes of proactive coping may need more time to establish. This implies that prolonged proactive coping efforts are needed, despite the short-term discomfort. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Modeling results; Multilevels; Path models; Short term; Workers'

In this paper, we aim to address these issues that hinder the advancement of the passion literature. We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to infer entrepreneurial passion from multi-wave qualitative text data. By applying AI approaches (sentiment analysis and machine learning) to text data, we capture how different aspects of entrepreneurial passion change over time, and provide new insights into the changeable nature of passion in the specific context of social entrepreneurship. We hope that our work affords an ample foundation for future research-in passion and using AI-that are both theory-focused and practically useful. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Artificial intelligence; Analytic approach; Change-over time; Data analytics; Identifying methods; In contexts; Longitudinal data; Sentiment analysis; Social entrepreneurship; Text data; Sentiment analysis

TMTs with executives experiencing more temporal emoting are prone to fragmentation. Executives experiencing emotive syncing take initiatives to integrate their TMT-and thus foster integration.

These logics are not equally pronounced across initiatives. The salience of the logics affects initiatives' selective coupling with economic, social, and environmental sustainability and, hence, their triple-layered sustainability performance. We suggest that the performance-related selective coupling is driven by two mechanisms: leveraging experience and seeking legitimacy. An empirical analysis of 251 initiatives supports our arguments. In line with the theory of selective coupling, we further find that initiatives embedded in a market logic display better overall sustainability performance than those embedded in a social welfare logic. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Sustainable development; Coupling performance; Economic sustainability; Empirical analysis; Environmental sustainability; Institutional logic; Performance; Selective coupling; Social and environmental; Social sustainability; Sustainability performance; Smart city

Drawing on a four-year qualitative study of the ride-hailing industry, I describe how algorithms structure the work through segmentation at sites of human-algorithm interactions. While some research suggests that algorithms create a hyper-monitored management system that stifles autonomy; I find that this reconfiguration allows for more frequent, yet narrower, choice that generates consent. Yet due to the platform's ability to change algorithms at-will and the flexible work arrangement consent is more fragile than previously theorized. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Digital platforms; Management systems; Qualitative study

We take the sociotechnical system lenses and employ mixed-method analysis of a field intervention to study the machine-learning informed decision-making with interpreted models' outputs. Contrary to theory, our results suggest a small positive effect of explanations on confidence in the final decision, and a negligible effect on the decisions' quality. We uncover complex dynamic interactions between humans and algorithms, and the interplay of algorithmic aversion, trust, experts' heuristic, and changing uncertainty-resolving condititions. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Decision theory; Heuristic algorithms; Machine learning; Decisions makings; Final decision; Human-in-the-loop; Informed decision; Machine-learning; Method analysis; Mixed method; Model outputs; Real-world problem; Sociotechnical systems; Decision making

Our model shows that outcome-based contracts with counterfactual assessment are likely to be adopted when the number of treated subjects is small, when there is limited investment per treated subject, and contract sponsors are more experienced. © AoM 2021.All right reserved.",,Assessment technique; Counterfactuals; Formal modeling; Modeling approach; Rule based

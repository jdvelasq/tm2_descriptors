Transformational leadership and turnover: The roles of LMX and organizational commitment,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858425909&partnerID=40&md5=fb90b7929f9011f1aba306e8e7118052,"In this study, we developed a social exchange model to explicate the psychological process in which transformational leadership influences followers¡ withdrawal cognitions and their actual turnover over a 1-year period. The model was tested using a sample of 490 full-employees from a large telecommunication company in China. Hierarchical regression results provide support for the hypothesized model whereby transformational leadership influenced followers¡ withdrawal cognitions through the differential mediating effects of leader-member exchange (LMX), organizational commitment. Logistic regression results also support the model of transformational leadership and actual turnover behavior over time. Implications of our model for theory and practice are discussed and future research directions are outlined.",LMX; Transformational leadership; Turnover,Future research directions; Hierarchical regression; LMX; Logistic regressions; Mediating effect; Organizational Commitment; Psychological process; Social exchange; Telecommunication companies; Theory and practice; Transformational leadership; Turnover; Logistics

In a sample of 201 graduating business students, we found that each aspect of CSR, i.e., economic, legal, and ethical responsibility, had a unique effect on organizational attraction and probability of accepting offer. The participants also combined these three types of information in an interactive configural manner. Applicants with different ethical predispositions were affected by CSR to different extents.

Contracting capacity and performance in government: Nonlinear effects and the role of time,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863359215&partnerID=40&md5=a62547ec997cd9e5ed68cd64e1bbdca9,"Contracting-out has become a popular strategy in public service delivery, but it remains uncertain whether and how government can ensure contracting performance. As a result, a growing literature starts to emphasize the importance of governments' contracting capacities. Yet very few studies have empirically assessed how contracting capacities relate to contracting performance. This article identifies four types of contracting capacities in terms of agenda setting, contract formulation, contract implementation, and contract evaluation, relating them to three performance dimensions including cost, efficiency, and quality. Drawing from a manager survey, the article shows that the relationships between the capacities and the performance indicators are not always straightforward or linear, and the relationships are complicated by the role of time. The results suggest that contracting capacities have both benefits and costs, and the solutions.",Capacity; Contracting; Time,Benchmarking; Agenda settings; Benefits and costs; Capacity; Contracting; Contracting capacity; Nonlinear effect; Performance dimensions; Performance indicators; Public services; Time; Managers
Family control and stock market reactions to announcements of corporate venturing,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863379582&partnerID=40&md5=f6207d37ff724e37b5fe7e109d398000,"This study investigates whether family control affects the stock market reactions of new venturing. We found that with greater family control experienced more negative stock market reactions to venturing announcements. The results further indicated that the divergence of cash flow and voting rights was strongly and negatively correlated with announcement-period abnormal returns. The findings also indicated that institutional ownership had a significantly positive moderating effect suggesting that participation of institutional investors mitigated the negative influence of family control. The conclusions were robust under various measures of family control, and remained valid after controlling other influential factors for stock market reactions to venturing announcements.",,Investments; Abnormal returns; Cash flow; Corporate venturing; Influential factors; Moderating effect; Negative influence; Stock market; Commerce

This paper presents the first systematic empirical examination of how the legitimation of entrepreneurship at societal level dynamically shapes the entrepreneurial entry of individuals from different social strata. Analyzing a nationally representative life history data of the citizens of the People's Republic of China from 1978 to 1996, we find that high-status individuals (cadres and college-educated) are less likely to become private entrepreneurs before the field achieves full-fledged legitimacy, but they are faster in becoming private entrepreneurs as the field becomes more legitimate. We find that the entrepreneurial entry of individuals in regions with local entrepreneurial culture is less influenced by the regulative or cognitive legitimation processes at national level. Moreover, we find that cadres' entry into private entrepreneurship is amplified only by the regulative legitimation process at national level; Junior and senior high school graduates' entry into private entrepreneurship is amplified only by local entrepreneurial culture; college graduates' entry into the field is amplified by both the regulative and cognitive legitimation processes at national level and local entrepreneurial culture.

Beyond transaction efficiency: The effect of knowledge interdependence on firms' R&D scope decisions,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863376237&partnerID=40&md5=628f102ffae381ff261df778d08e1156,"Uncertainty has long been understood as a stimulus for firms to manage their boundaries, i.e., to define the scope of their activities. In the extant literature, however, predictions exists that firms would increase or decrease their scope of activities when facing uncertainty. To reconcile these conflicting positions, we propose a model in which the system-level knowledge property interdependence moderates the effect of technological uncertainty on firms' R&D scope decisions. To test our model empirically, we develop a new set of measures for knowledge interdependence and technological uncertainty, and collect 33 years of data (1967-2000) on patenting activity and firm boundary location from the automotive airbag industry. The results of our analysis suggest that firm boundary decisions for knowledge-intensive activities such as R&D tend to be more impacted by considerations of the underlying knowledge structure than transaction efficiency. We discuss the implications of these findings for managerial practice and future research.",Knowledge interdependence; Modularity; Technological uncertainty,Firm boundaries; Knowledge interdependence; Knowledge structures; Managerial practices; Modularity; System levels; Technological uncertainty; Industry

Conduits of innovation or imitation? Assessing the effect of alliances on the persistence of profits,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889720228&partnerID=40&md5=1f4b13480fad60f722642c635ce2af0d,"There has been growing interest in the determinants of sustainable competitive advantage-profits that are consistently above the average of a given industry for a certain period of time. We contribute to this debate by examining one particular factor that has been neglected in that literature: the extent of which firms engage in alliances with other actors. As it turns out, there are conflicting perspectives on how alliances might affect persistence. On the one hand, alliances provide firms with access to external resources and continuously innovate, thereby leading to increased persistence of competitive advantage. On the other hand, widespread use of alliances may be negatively associated with the ability to protect and develop internal resources. Thus, alliances may become conduits of knowledge leakage and imitation. Based on a sample of firms in the United States, we test these two competing views by observing the persistence of performance (in our case, return on assets) for firms exhibiting competitive advantage (profits above the norm) and disadvantage (profits below the norm). Our results support the positive view of alliances as mechanisms to sustain competitive advantage and escape from competitive disadvantage through improved access to external, valuable resources held by other firms.",Alliance; Competitive advantage; Persistence,Competition; Profitability; Alliance; Competitive advantage; External resources; Internal resources; Persistence; Return on assets; Industry
Disciplined project management: The key to process improvement program success,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863349129&partnerID=40&md5=788e173b5ed0aeeb6c98e200a3909000,"This research study is based on the premise that process improvement programs such as Six Sigma, Lean, and Lean Sigma are very important and deserve serious academic research, but that definitional problems make it very difficult to study any specific type of process improvement program. Therefore, this study defines two organizational level program management factors: Strategic Project Selection (SPS) and Disciplined Project Management (DPM). Guided by the internal fit theory, this research empirically examines both the direct effect of SPS and DPM on organizational performance and the impact of the fit between SPS and DPM on organizational performance. Using empirical data collected from 53 plants, this research reveals that at the organization level, SPS partially mediates the relationship between DPM and organizational performance. This insight contributes to both theory development and practice, suggesting that a viable strategy for a process improvement program's success is to focus on DPM in order to enhance SPS and ultimately achieve organizational performance.",Disciplined project management; Quality management; Strategic project selection,Quality management; Research; Work simplification; Academic research; Empirical data; Organizational levels; Organizational performance; Process Improvement; Program management; Project selection; Research studies; Six Sigma; Theory development; Project management

However, the prevailing theories of regulation tended to view the role of the state in regulatory change as neutral or passive. In this paper, we propose a state-centered approach to analyze how a state actively seizes political opportunities and mobilizes resources to influence regulatory change. By drawing from theories of social movements and political sociology, our empirical analysis of Taiwan's outward foreign direct investments (FDI) regulations in China from 1996 to 2001 shows that the ability of the Taiwanese state to sustain its FDI regulations in China across 37 industries depended upon its relative capacity in an industry, political party competition, resources of both industry proponents and opponents, and embeddedness between the state and industry.",Regulatory change; Social movements; The state,Industry; Embeddedness; Empirical analysis; Foreign direct investments; Political parties; Regulatory change; Social movements; The state; Competition

A growing number of empirical studies, however, have failed to support the theory's predictions, suggesting that density delay in its current form apparently does not apply to all populations in all conditions. Rather than discarding the theory altogether, we apply insights from the burgeoning literature on pre-entry ecologies to make sense of this empirical anomaly and use logical formalization to synthesize arguments of both theory fragments in a single, logically sound framework. Our results suggest that the nature of the density delay effect depends to a large extent on the chosen observation window, and, possibly, a confounding with the number of organizers concurrently present in the pre-entry stages. In addition, we derive a number of testable hypotheses that should strengthen research on both density delay and pre-entry ecologies.",Density delay; Formalization; Organizational ecology,Delay effects; Empirical studies; Failure rate; Formalization; Logical formalization; Observation window; Organizational ecology; Ecology

Emphasizing conceptual differences in affiliative OCBs, such as helping, compared to challenging OCBs, such as voice, we propose that voice is a function of more elaborate cognitive processes than helping. Extending this idea, our primary objective is to develop a conceptual model that explicates cognitive processes as antecedents to employee voice behavior. We draw on work in social psychology with an emphasis on dual process decision making theories (e.g., systematic vs. heuristic processing: see Smith & DeCoster, 2000, for a review) to guide our model. We aim to stimulate research on voice and other comparatively neglected forms of challenging OCB (e.g., personal initiative, taking charge) as well as research on decision processes that should enhance our ability to predict and encourage these important citizenship behaviors.",Cognitive processes; Organizational citizenship behavior; Proactive behavior/voice,Human resource management; Cognitive process; Conceptual model; Decision process; Dual process; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Primary objective; Proactive behavior; Social psychology; Cognitive systems

Based on panel data estimation of Korean and Chinese listed firms in high technology industries over four years, this study shows that innovation output (i.e. patent intensity) rather than innovation input (i.e. R&D intensity) contributed to firm financial performance. It also indicates that the innovation strategy developing the depth of innovation capability in a few specific technological fields may be the source of better performance in Korea, while diversified innovation capabilities over different technology fields might be having positive effects on firm performance in China. The empirical result on the moderating role of the scope of innovation capabilities shows that the effects of R&D investment on firm performance depend on appropriate innovation strategy determining the scope of innovation. This outcome suggests that, when R&D investment does not match the depth and diversity of innovation capabilities of firms and related strategies, this hampers the financial performance of firms. Finally, my empirical evidence documents that technologically related innovation efforts of other firms is a significant predictor of financial performance with the firms¡̄ own innovation efforts (e.g. in-house R&D).",,Finance; Industry; Patents and inventions; Chinese firms; Empirical analysis; Empirical evidence; Financial performance; Firm Performance; High technology industries; Innovation capability; Innovation strategy; Panel data estimation; Patent intensity; Spillover effects; Technology fields; Innovation
A longitudinal study of an innovation to enhance managers' engagement and organizational resources for safety,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863361303&partnerID=40&md5=871b20ec3a27f3e9342d81ba79bdc1e4,"Research provides little guidance about how managers can achieve the recommendation to improve their organizations' safety culture. We propose that exposing managers to the frontline work context will enhance the accuracy of their perceptions of their own engagement with patient safety and the adequacy of organizational resources for addressing safety hazards on the frontlines. More accurate managerial understanding of frontline safety will help align managers' and workers' perceptions, and may lead to more effective managerial action to improve patient safety. We tested hypotheses in a longitudinal study of an intervention implemented in 20 randomly selected US hospitals. We examined pre-post changes in alignment of manager and worker perceptions in 110 work areas exposed to the intervention compared to 925 untreated controls. Results provide partial support for an intervention effect. We found a 7.8 percentage point (66% relative) reduction in pretest and posttest differences between how senior managers and frontline workers viewed adequacy of organizational resources in intervention work areas in intervention hospitals relative to the same work areas in non-intervention hospitals (p<.05). Similar comparisons of differences in perceptions of managerial engagement with safety were not significant, but were in the expected direction. A reduction in perceptual differences about senior managers' commitment to patient safety signals a more shared understanding of the resources needed to ensure patient safety. Our research suggests that integrated interventions that expose senior managers to frontline work and workers' safety concerns may increase managers' awareness of safety risks and their commitment to resolving them.",Field experiment; Intervention; Safety,Accident prevention; Hospitals; Management; Managers; Occupational risks; Field experiment; Front-line workers; Frontline; Intervention; Longitudinal study; Managerial actions; Patient safety; Percentage points; Perceptual difference; Safety concerns; Safety culture; Safety hazards; Safety risks; Senior managers; Shared understanding; Untreated control; Human resource management

We simulate resulting population level abandonment patterns and find that in contrast to previous notions of regret accelerates abandonment processes, regret may systematically slow down abandonment bandwagon, especially when uncertainty about the adoption value of the innovation is high. Furthermore, simulation results suggest that the effect of regret on biased vicarious learning and abandonment processes is interdependent such that abandonment propensities decrease even if focal actors are not susceptible to the regret effect.",Abandonment; Biased sampling; Vicarious learning,Abandonment; Biased sampling; Decision makers; Over sampling; Population levels; Under-sampling; Vicarious learning

We obtained data on HPWS (rated by human resource managers), collective affective commitment (rated by president/vice-presidents), and collective OCB (rated by middle managers) from 454 firms. Structural equation modeling results largely supported the hypotheses. We discuss implications for theory and research on OCB.",HPWS; OCB; Social exchange,Managers; High Performance Work Systems; HPWS; Middle managers; OCB; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Organizational outcomes; Social exchange; Structural equation modeling; Rating
Should high performance work systems include diversity management practices?,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863357477&partnerID=40&md5=343630d02c7a4dc9fb6af0c95d543263,"In this article we expand the definition of high performance work systems to include diversity and equality practices. Using data gathered from 132 organisations in Ireland, we examine the impact of this new bundle of high performance HR practices on firm-level performance. Our results reveal that inclusive high performance management practices are positively associated with labour productivity and workforce innovation, and negatively associated with voluntary employee turnover. Diversity and equality management practices were found to add significantly to these relationships over and above the effects of a more traditionally defined system of high performance work practices. Our results are supportive of the International Labour Office (ILO) assertion that high-performing organisations are those that not only adopt the practices associated with traditional HPWS but also emphasise diversity and equality management.",,Employee turnover; High Performance Work Systems; Ireland; Management practices; Performance management; Work practices
Testing multilevel mediation using hierarchical linear models: Problems and solutions,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081763805&partnerID=40&md5=14816280c28fc3fc71d1dcc67aa10e87,"Testing multilevel mediation using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) has gained tremendous popularity in recently years. However, biases could arise when no centering or grand-mean centering is used in these models. This study first summarizes three types of HLM-based multilevel mediation models, and then explains that in two types of these models, biases are produced when using current procedures of testing multilevel mediation. A Monte Carlo study was conducted to illustrate that HLM applied to grand-mean-centered data can under- or overestimate true mediational effects.

This paper presents a theoretical model of a multinational corporation's workforce and the human resources architectures that are applied to that workforce. The proposed model suggests four groups of employees within MNCs: international careerists, core employees, transient employees and free agent employees. Using a case study approach with analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis, this study found support for the existence of an HR architecture for MNCs, based on geographic orientation and mobility, and commitment to the organisation. The resultant four types of employee groups were found to be distinct in their characteristics as demonstrated through an analysis of variance. Further investigation using discriminant function analysis demonstrated that several categories of variables were significant in differentiating the four groups: notably previous mobility experiences, organisational factors, HR factors and social identity and contact.",Expatriation; IHRM; International assignment,Discriminant analysis; Human resource management; Case study approach; Discriminant function analysis; Employee group; Expatriation; Four-group; Free agents; IHRM; International assignments; Multi-national corporations; New forms; Organisational factors; Social identity; Theoretical models; Architecture

Therefore, we integrate these three determinants to develop an integrative framework of HRM internal differentiation. In addition, we compare and contrast the HRM differentiated-configurations with HRM super- and basic-configurations to illustrate the linkages and differences between different levels of HRM configuration.

Without attempting to make grand ontological claims about OI, in this paper we advance embodied realism as an approach that recognizes both movement and stability in identity work. By means of an empirical analysis of one company's use of embodied metaphors - a method of identity work that exhibits the main tenets of embodied realism - to literally construct representations of its organizational identity, we demonstrate the relevance of embodied realism for OI and the effectiveness of embodied metaphors to surface key aspects of OI in practice.",Embodied metaphors; Embodied realism; Organizational identity,Embodied metaphors; Embodied realism; Empirical analysis; Organizational identity; Process view; Process-oriented approaches

TCE states that a supplier's investments in transaction-specific assets, such as dedicated plant and equipment, workforce with transaction-specific skills and the development of transaction-specific relationships, will lead to opportunistic behavior on the part of the manufacturers, providing an environment where behaviors intentionally designed to take advantage of the supplier will flourish. Because the supplier will not be able to redeploy those investments to a different manufacturer if the relationship is discontinued, the manufacturer will be motivated to capitalize on this vulnerability by employing behaviors such as seeking unfair price concessions, sharing proprietary information with competitors or other unethical behaviors. This study advances the application of TCE to the context of supply chain management by breaking investments in transaction-specific assets into investments in transaction-specific tangible assets, such as plant and equipment, and transaction-specific intangible assets, such as relationships and the development of human resources, in order to examine their impact on opportunistic behavior separately. These relationships are examined using a survey of 230 suppliers in the household appliances industry in China. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that there was a positive relationship between suppliers' investment in transaction-specific tangible assets and opportunistic behavior by the manufacturers that they serve, but that there was a negative relationship between suppliers' investments in transaction-specific intangible assets and opportunistic behavior by manufacturers.

My empirical context is the adoption of e-business practices among U.S. Manufacturing plants in early 2000. Using detailed data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures, I construct two different measures of leadership - a conventional one based on market share and a novel one based on productivity. I find evidence that market leadership is positively correlated with the use of innovative business processes, but that there is an important distinction between e-buying and e-selling. In e-buying, all measures of leadership are positively and robustly correlated with adoption. This empirical finding conforms to theoretical predictions by Athey and Schmutzler (2001) that leading firms will have incentives to invest in maintaining market dominance under oligopoly. By contrast in e-selling, only market share leadership has a positive (and noisy) effect on adoption. I hypothesize that the difference in how leadership affects the adoption of e-buying versus e-selling is consistent with stand-alone benefits of adoption that are increasing in output for both technologies, along with separate strategic benefits of adopting that arise in e-buying, where there may be more scope for leaders to use innovative processes to deter less-efficient rivals.",Information technology; Innovation; Technological change,Competition; Electronic commerce; Information technology; Sales; Business Process; Empirical findings; Innovative process; Manufacturing plant; Market leadership; Strategic benefits; Strategic investments; Technological change; Investments

Network plasticity and collaborative innovation: Processes of network reorganization,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088717115&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33650230&partnerID=40&md5=82674d4c55bdd67479582a2e57bed8e4,"While some research suggests that social networks, organizational behavior, and innovative outcomes influence each other in a co-evolutionary process, very few studies have explored these processes in detail because of the difficulties of collecting longitudinal network data. Using a multi-case, inductive study of eight technology collaborations between ten firms in the computing and communications industries, this paper examines the organizational processes that enable managers to influence network dynamics and generate collaborative innovations. Comparisons of successful and unsuccessful collaborations show that rather than leverage existing ties that span organizational boundaries, managers of successful collaborations prune networks of existing broker ties that are information bottlenecks in the emerging collaboration network. Second, rather than relying on spontaneous social processes to remake these networks, managers of successful collaborations begin to remake these networks by pairing actors with complementary knowledge across organizational boundaries, forming a loose lattice at the executive, manager, and engineering levels the binds the two organizations together. Third, once this loose lattice structure is in place, managers of successful collaborations encourage spontaneous formation processes such as homophily which increases the density of the boundary spanning network. By contrast, mangers of less successful collaborations either do not prune prior ties, fail to make new ties, or make new ties based on inappropriate criteria such as functional equivalence. Taken together, the combination of formal (pruning and pairing) and informal (encouraging homophily) processes reorganize the collaboration network to promote accelerated knowledge transfer and recombination. A primary contribution of the paper is an outline of an emerging paradigm that explains how organizations shape network dynamics to achieve important strategic objectives such as innovation. In contrast to structuralist and naturalist perspectives that dominate the literature, this perspective suggests that social network theory has a unique character in organizational contexts where formal processes such as pruning and pairing play an important role in network dynamics and supplement informal network processes in society at large. The key construct that distinguishes organizations in this emerging theory is network plasticity - that is, the capacity of managers to change social networks inside organizations to achieve organizational objectives.",Alliances; Innovation; Networks,Computation theory; Dynamics; Knowledge management; Networks (circuits); Social networking (online); Alliances; Co-evolutionary process; Collaborative innovation; Communications industry; Functional equivalence; Network reorganization; Organizational behavior; Organizational boundaries; Managers

We argue that performance is related to the project-entrepreneur's degree of centrality within the social network, and the project-entrepreneur's familiarity with the selected project-team as captured by the distribution of ties among its members. We test our hypotheses within the Hollywood Film Industry over the period 1992-2003. In this context the project entrepreneur is typically an independent producer whose main task is to identify suitable project (movie) opportunities and pursue them by assembling teams of free agents that best suit the project task. We measure project (movie) success in terms of commercial performance (movie box office receipts).

We draw on recent work in sociology and provide theoretical underpinnings why sequence matters and how interdependence between different sequences occurs. Using optimal matching techniques and clustering analysis, we empirically identify seven different sequence patterns. We conclude that firms' sequences of M&A's and alliances do not occur in infinite combinations, at least not with equal likelihood. We further establish the predictive validity of different sequences by testing their performance implications. We find that certain sequences are more likely to generate higher performance than others. However, such a relationship is largely contingent on firms' developmental stages.",Alliance; M&A; Temporal,Alliance; Clustering analysis; Developmental stage; Exploratory analysis; Optimal matching; Sequence patterns; Temporal
Meta-analyzing ownership concentration and firm performance in Asia: Towards a more fine-grained understanding,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858377626&partnerID=40&md5=b1fa3ffa3123f9c0ce766f4216938126,"We present a theory-building meta-analysis of the relationship between concentrated ownership and firm financial performance in Asia. At the cross-national level of analysis, we find a small but significant positive association between both variables. This finding suggests that in regions with less than perfect legal protection of minority shareholders, ownership concentration is an efficient corporate governance strategy. Yet, a focus on this aggregate effect alone conceals the existence of true heterogeneity in the effect size distribution. We purposefully model this heterogeneity by exploring moderating effects at the levels of owner identity and national institutions. In identity terms, we find that our focal relationship is stronger for foreign than for domestic owners, and also that pure 'market' investors outperform 'stable' or 'inside' owners whom are multiply tied to the firm. In terms of institutions, we find that a certain threshold level of institutional development is necessary to make concentrated ownership an effective corporate governance strategy. Yet we also find that strong legal protection of shareholders makes ownership concentration redundant and therefore inconsequential. Finally, in jurisdictions where owners can easily extract private benefits from the corporations they control, the focal relationship becomes weaker due to minority shareholder expropriation.",Asia; Corporate governance; Meta analysis,Industrial management; Shareholders; Societies and institutions; Asia; Corporate governance; Cross-national; Financial performance; Firm Performance; Institutional development; Legal protection; Meta analysis; Moderating effect; Theory building; Threshold levels; Industry

Community collaboratives are comprised of representatives from different organizations and agencies who meet regularly for the purpose of identifying and implementing strategies for improving their communityâ€™s response to a specific issue of public concern. This paper explores the role of problem frames and perceptions of problem frame alignment among members of community collaboratives. Specifically, this study uses an innovative combination of social network analysis methods and hierarchical linear modeling to explore how differences in the extent to which stakeholders view themselves as in alignment with other members and how much they are perceived to be in alignment by other members impacts the outcomes of the collaborative as a whole. Findings are based off of data from members of 48 different domestic violence community collaboratives. Results suggest that the presence of stakeholders who are perceived to be philosophically out of sync by other stakeholders with regards to their understanding of domestic violence but who do not acknowledge this apparent disconnect can negatively impact the effectiveness of the collaborative over and above the impact associated with the general degree of alignment in the collaborative. Implications of results for public and nonprofit organizations seeking to provide leadership in promoting the effectiveness of community collaboratives are discussed.",Community problem solving; Interorganizational collaboration; Problem frames,Nonprofit organization; Community problem solving; Degree of alignments; Domestic violence; Frame alignments; Hierarchical linear modeling; Inter-organizational; Interorganizational collaboration; Problem Frames; Alignment

Recent empirical research is beginning to challenge the distinction between these changes in contexts where one firm is both the producer and consumer of a new technology. Expanding on such work, this paper proposes a perspective that collapses the distinction between technological and organizational change and casts the evolution of work systems as a process of sociomaterial imbrication. To ""imbricate"" means to overlap in a regular pattern. An imbrication perspective suggests that the social and material agencies of work systems overlap and buttress one another to create changes in people's patterns of interaction and in artifacts' material features. The perspective suggests that one such change cannot be accounted for without an explanation of the other, and that attempts to categorize one type of change as ""organizational"" changes and another as ""technological"" fail to recognize the imbricated nature of work. The perspective also holds that changes in people's patterns of interaction and in artifacts' features occur simultaneously across periods normally demarcated as ""development"" and ""use"" and that in firms that are both producers and consumers of new tools, sociomaterial changes are not confined to such periods, but occur continuously within and across them. I describe this perspective by first outlining a theory of affordances, which explains how social and material agencies become intertwined through processes of translation. I then illustrate the perspective through the presentation of empirical data on the development and use activities occurring around an information technology to automate computer simulations of vehicle crashes at a large automobile company. I conclude by discussing ways in which a perspective on sociomaterial imbrication helps to advance theory and research on the relationship between technologies and organizing.",Organizational change; Social construction; Technological change,Automobile companies; Empirical research; Material features; Organizational change; Regular patterns; Social constructions; Technological change; Vehicle crashes; Accidents

Traditional research has associated ethical superiority with an analytic, rational decision making process and has suggested that emotions undermine ethics because they lead people to breach ethical principles such as the norm of impartiality. In contrast, this research suggests that rational decision making may actually license unethical behavior when it focuses attention on tangible monetary outcomes rather than internal affective reactions. Four experiments showed that rational decision making, whether it was primed through explicit strategic advice or implicit framing, increased cheating and decreased charitable donation. Another experiment confirmed the halo of rational decision making by showing that individuals in situations with conflicts of interest tended to trust rational rather than intuitive decision makers not to engage in unethical behaviors. These findings highlight that rational decision making can act as a double-edged sword, making it particularly important to consider contexts and individual emotions when evaluating the ethical implications of rationality.",Affect and emotion; Ethics; Individual decision making,Decision making; Experiments; Affect and emotion; Conflicts of interest; Decision makers; Ethical decision making; Ethical implications; Ethical principles; Ethics; Individual decision making; Rational decision making; Philosophical aspects

The results indicate the importance of differentiating between two types of international assignments: developmental (or learning-driven) and functional (or demand-driven) assignments. Depending on the type of assignment, assignees differ in the factors that push and pull them towards an international assignment; the perceived career advancement opportunities inside and outside the company; and the willingness to quit. While the vulnerability to turnover varies depending on the type of assignment, two sets of variables were found to play a key role in international assignees' willingness to leave, regardless of the assignment type: the perceived company-provided support, including the perceived effectiveness of repatriation practices; and the career advancement opportunities within the company relative to those available outside the company.

A growing body of recent literature points to positive effects at the level of the individual researcher: combining scientific productivity with involvement in patent activities seems feasible and might even lead to beneficial effects. While the occurrence of positive effects is getting more and more empirical support, questions can be raised about their origin: which dynamics are underlying the observation of academic inventors outperforming their colleague non-inventors? Based on a review of the literature two underlying phenomena are identified. First, cooccurrence effects might occur when publications and patents emerge simultaneously, acting as two different outcomes of one and the same research activity. Second, cross-fertilization dynamics might result in mutual beneficial effects over time. The extent to which both dynamics manifest themselves is tested quantitatively, using a panel dataset of engineering professors (n=151) from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium and the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. Results obtained in both settings corroborate the presence of both co-occurrence and cross-fertilization dynamics: involvement in patenting co-occurs with, is preceded by and stimulates scientific performance.

Our field study in a nanotechnology research setting explores the issue of the coexistence of multiple professional identities within a single group. Through the use of open interviews and diaries, we show how group members, who are physicists, chemists, engineers, and material scientists, first and foremost define themselves as researchers. Their interpretation of being a researcher differs, however, in terms of their vision of science, vision of a researcher's role in relationships, and vision of work. We provide a categorization of emerging professional identity profiles as 'factory worker', 'integrator', 'administrator', and 'lone rider'. Different meanings of being a researcher are mirrored in work practices, interaction patterns, and use of time. Unlike theoretical expectations on the potential for competition that multiple identities entail, few conflicts were recorded in the setting under study. We trace the lack of conflicts back to the following conditions: the availability of slack resources that decouple group members; the rotation of junior researchers across projects that weakens the boundaries between identity profiles; the perception of a shared group identity that encompasses values of each of the different identity profiles. We argue that, when the above conditions intervene, multiple identities not only can coexist over time, but even benefit organizational adaptability and favor the retention of temporary workers.",Conflict; Professional identity; Temporary workers,Conflict; Interaction pattern; Material scientists; Multiple identities; Nanotechnology research; Organizational adaptabilities; Professional identity; Temporary workers; Professional aspects

Developing the concept of program goal ambiguity and explaining federal program performance,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858414036&partnerID=40&md5=e794a9522e629d3f1cd6bc1826e248a5,"Despite being a major topic in public administration for many decades, evaluating the performance of governmental activities has received increased attention in recent years. As part of this trend, the Performance Assessment and Rating Tool (PART) was created by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in 2003 to assess the performance of federal programs. PART assesses program purpose and design, strategic planning, program management, program results (performance on strategic goals), and an overall performance rating that combines these four categories of indicators. Common performance measures for disparate government programs are rare, especially in the U.S. at the federal level, and PART scores provide comparable performance indicators. The availability of PART results for a very large number of federal programs (767 programs, for the present analysis) provides an opportunity for analysis of an important performance assessment initiative, and analysis of factors related to performance indicators for federal programs. The analysis reported here relates PART performance scores (program results), as well as other PART scores, to factors that should influence such performance indicators. These include measures of the programs' levels of goal ambiguity (as opposed to goal clarity) newly developed for this study, political content of the program, program size, program type (""direct"" versus ""third-party""), and program budget increases. Each of these variables shows a significant relationship to at least one of the PART categories. Newly developed measures of goal ambiguity (""target-specification goal ambiguity"", ""time-specification goal ambiguity"", and ""program evaluation ambiguity"") show the strongest and most consistent relations, negative relations, to PART scores. The analysis for program type shows that third-party programs consistently show lower PART scores than direct programs.

Hypotheses are derived from the framework and are tested using a sample of Spanish firms for the period 1995 to 2002.

Using the 2005 Standard & Poor's 500 firms over the years 1990-2005, statistically significant differences when comparing CEO exits after downsizings to CEOs who did not engage in downsizings were observed. CEO characteristics that increased the tendency to engage in downsizing also increased the probability of the CEO exiting after implementing the action. CEOs with less positional tenure were more likely to exit within five years of the downsizing actions than longer tenured CEOs. As CEO positional tenure increased, the likelihood of early exit from the organization substantially decreased when the downsizing action was executed. Increasing organizational tenure also decreased exit from the firm but not substantially. Short-tenured CEOs are most vulnerable to exiting their position after implanting the strategic decision to downsize, while longer tenured CEOs realize an inoculation against early exit after executing the strategic choice.",CEO exit; Downsizing; Strategic choice,Business cycles; CEO exit; Downsizing; Statistically significant difference; Strategic choice; Strategic decisions

This method can handle comprehensive organizational performance models with dozens of main (linear and non-linear) and (bivariate and higher-order) interaction effects, even with relatively small sample sizes. We develop a contingency logic tailored to international business, and anchoring on the role of international strategy. In so doing, we define seven categories of fit. For data about approximately 175 MNEs' subsidiaries we find evidence that supports international business' implicit assumption that international strategy matters.",Fit; International strategy,Bivariate; Fit; Higher order; Interaction effect; International business; International strategy; Organizational performance; Small Sample Size

First, it proposes a multi-level, multi-phase model of deliberate learning process that includes individual knowledge generation, group knowledge articulation, and unit knowledge codification. Second, workload is proposed as a moderator for the knowledge generation-knowledge articulation transition, while goal congruence is proposed as a moderator for knowledge articulation-knowledge codification transition. Third, the unit performance benefits of deliberate learning are realized by a mediation mechanism involving the three phases of frontline deliberate learning. Using multiple source data from a healthcare services setting, the proposed model is tested. The results suggest that (a) knowledge articulation mediates the effect of knowledge generation on knowledge codification, (b) knowledge codification mediates the effect of knowledge articulation on unit customer satisfaction, revenue, and efficiency, and (c) workload moderates the conversion of knowledge generation to knowledge articulation, and goal congruence moderates the conversion of knowledge articulation to knowledge codification.",Deliberate learning; Frontline; Service,Customer satisfaction; Health care; Moderators; Conceptual model; Customer interfaces; Deliberate learning; Frontline; Healthcare services; Knowledge codification; Learning process; Multi-level; Multiphase model; Multiple source; Performance benefits; Service; Service organizations; Three phasis; Learning systems

Such measures emerge in response to information asymmetries caused by existing measures of firm value that fail to serve the interests of a firm's stakeholders, broadly defined. They then become adopted through an iterative process of production and consumption. We argue that design decisions to employ existing valuation logics, those of quantification and simplification, enable entrepreneurs to measure complex organizational behavior and compare firms along common metrics. These design choices lead to easily understandable and consumable products that facilitate buy-in by stakeholders, firms, and the media. Sufficient buy-in, in turn, gives entrepreneurs the ground to claim the market position of 'information intermediary' in an organizational field. While 'enabling' greater market participation by reducing search costs for all parties in the resource exchange relationship, however, we argue that these measures also carry corresponding 'disabling' consequences that warrant cause for caution. We liken the creation and consumption of these measures to fast-food-filling, convenient, and cheap, but of questionable nutritional value, and potentially harmful if treated as a staple part of a diet.",Institutional change; Institutional entrepreneurs; Socially constructed markets,Commerce; Product design; Societies and institutions; Design decisions; Firm Performance; Firm value; Information asymmetry; Institutional change; Institutional entrepreneurs; Iterative process; Market position; Nutritional value; Organizational behavior; Search costs; Socially constructed markets; Industry
The impact of exogenous non-economic shocks on the global business environment: A cross-country analysis of the impact of september 11 th on muslim-populated countries,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858410087&partnerID=40&md5=c656f803346ec75ff27e7cc33b54c7e4,"The risks of operating multinational firms have generally been studied from the perspective of those factors that can be considered endogenous to a particular country or the economic system as a whole. However, global markets are not only subject to these endogenous factors, such as the liability of foreignness or the risk of expropriation, but also a series of exogenous factors, which generally come in the form of a non-economic shock, for instance the rise of global terrorist networks. Unlike the more traditional costs of operating abroad, the impact of non-economic shocks is more complex to recognize and can leave managers with information that lacks clarity or usefulness. When the source of these non-economic shocks can be isolated to an individual or group the event can have a socio-cultural spillover that harms foreign markets which may be linked with that source but had no role in the event's occurrence. Using the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 as the empirical context and a novel econometric approach, we find that the costs of operating in Muslim-populated countries increase above and beyond what can be explained by those endogenous economic, political, and social factors. Consistent with our theoretical model, our results suggest that a differential increase in costs of operations in particular foreign markets following an exogenous non-economic shock can be attributed to a manager's likelihood to categorize countries together and link them with the source of the shock.",Emerging economies; Global business environment; Political risk,International trade; Management; Terrorism; Cross-country analysis; Economic system; Emerging economies; Endogenous factors; Exogenous factors; Foreign markets; Global business; Global market; Multinational firms; Political risks; September 11; Social factor; Terrorist attacks; Terrorist networks; Theoretical models; Managers

While the current theoretical foundation of social identity theory suggests that attractiveness is derived from an organization's distinctiveness and status, this perspective is arguably appropriate to predicting identification among only a narrow subset of organizations and members. It does not account for the considerable role that organizational and individual identity variations play in determining which organizational characteristics members perceive as attractive. In this conceptual paper, I integrate extant work to outline an identity congruence framework of organizational identification highlighting the role that both organizational and member identity play in the identification process generally. I then use this framework to model multiple identity-specific paths to organizational identification by applying to it the lens of identity orientation. Specifically, I outline how variations in organizational and member identity orientation (individualistic, relational, and collectivistic) shape the social comparison content that members draw upon to assess organizational attractiveness. This analysis outlines how and why a wide array of organizations can secure identification and suggests that we may need to significantly broaden our understanding of organizational identification.",Individual identity; Organizational identification; Organizational identity,Identification process; Individual identity; Organizational attractiveness; Organizational characteristics; Organizational identifications; Organizational identities; Social identity theories; Theoretical foundations

The current paper comments on the role of these assumptions in traditional within-group agreement estimation, and focuses on one particular assumption made in the derivation of multi-item rwg(J): that internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) for climate scales is zero (LeBreton, James, & Lindell, 2005). We revisit LeBreton et al.'s derivation of the multi-item rwg agreement index, proposing an alternative set of derivations (and modified rwg agreement index) for use with reliable multi-item scales (where Cronbach's alpha > 0).

To remedy this gap, this study evaluated the impact of an MBA service-learning course on students' subsequent community service behaviors and attitudes. Community service attitudes and behaviors of students who completed the service-learning course over the last eleven years (n=117) were compared with a matched control group of MBA students (n=95) who did not complete the service-learning course. As was hypothesized, students who completed the MBA service-learning course (1) reported engaging in significantly more community service activities, (2) reported significantly more positive perceptions of the value of community service activities and non-profit arts/cultural organizations to the community, and (3) perceived service-learning opportunities in the MBA program significantly more positively than did students not completing the MBA service-learning course.

Many organizational reward systems are biased because organizations do not always tie pay closely to performance (Lawler, 1971). The current research theoretically and empirically identifies another important bias of distorted rewards, namely, the folly of rewarding A+, whiling only needing A. Specifically, we propose that because of biased perceptions of generalists, decision makers may overlook their real organizational needs and both recruit and overcompensate redundant personnel. Three studies demonstrate this judgment bias in the context of both corporate HR functions and the National basketball Association (NBA). Study 1 demonstrated that large companies assigned multiple functional duties to their HR specialists and inefficiently placed generalists in their workforce. Study 2 showed that NBA teams failed to tie three point specialists' salaries to their specialized expertise. Survey in Study 3 revealed a similar generalist bias among the basketball fans, who distinctly favored the all-around players even when their team was in need of three point shooters. The fans demonstrated a moderate improvement in their decisions, however, when they evaluated the specialist and the generalist separately.",Compensation; Distorted incentives; Judgment and decision making,Compensation (personnel); Sports; Decision makers; Distorted incentives; Judgment and decision makings; Large companies; National basketball associations; Reward systems; Decision making

Using longitudinal, ego-centric network data we study the advice, information, friendship, and role model networks 22 auditors and 15 promoted managers created during their first year on the job in order to identify factors determining the effective acquisition of task-relevant and organizational information and to develop strategies to promote successful integration. In addition, we follow the networks of 6 experienced managers as a comparison group. This study presents preliminary findings based on three of the four waves of data collection. We have found clear differentiation in the structure of the four types of networks. Each has a characteristic structure that reflects differentiation in purpose of the networks. These differences are not related to gender. We have also found that some efforts by OSC to proactively shape the structure of these four networks have not been instantiated in the structure of the resulting ego-nets.

In doing this we consider how a representation of a phenomena constructs our understanding of that phenomena and how context, in terms of a business association for sustainable development, is important in this construction process. We argue that such representations are constitutive of the way that business has come to 'know' and 'do' sustainable development and these constrain and enable particular actions and developments. Design/methodology/approach - Using a New Zealand-based study, this study draws on two main sources of materials: a corpus of written and presentational materials produced by a business association and eight of its members' first publicly available triple bottom line reports. The coding and analytic process involved a close interpretive examination of the documents to uncover meanings rather than document the volume of disclosure. The content of the reports and pronouncements is framed and analysed within a wider paradigmatic debate on sustainable development. Findings - The business association and its members' reports are shown to present a pragmatic and middle-way discourse on business and the environment. Through the use of rhetorical claims to pragmatism and action, the discourse suggests businesses are ""doing sustainability"". The association and its members are shown to present a narrow, largely economic and instrumental approach to the natural environment. Such a discourse we argue runs contrary to claims of reform and transformation, and instead reinforces the status quo of traditional interests of business-as-usual over the natural environment. Originality/value - This paper will be of value to researchers interested in business and sustainable development. By taking an interpretive approach and extending the analysis to a business association, we illustrate the ideological role communication plays in the organised construction of a dominant and potentially unassailable approach to the natural environment.

Given the mixed evidences of experience effect in international joint ventures, investigating the experience issue against non-equity alliances will yield a new insight on this topic. In contrast to previous studies most of which simply concentrate on quantity increase of alliance experience to address its benefits, we visit the issue with a finer picture, asking the question that if experience similarity enhances firm performance, and further, under what condition that such specific learning most influential. With 629 non-equity involved international alliances formed by US firms, our results basically confirm the benefits of prior experiences in ISAs. Experience in general, and that specific to activity type and partner¡s country are documented beneficial. However, such experiential learning is not equivalent which effect is greatly moderated by the level of alliance complexity. Experiences under great uncertainty, in terms of cooperations on techniques or/and with partners from developing countries, are found specifically imperative for alliance partnering firms.

The present study tested a theoretical framework that proposes three person-centered dimensions in the health care work environment are necessary for positive outcomes: (1) a climate for patient-centered care; (2) a climate for continuous quality improvement; and (3) a benevolent ethical climate. A work environment that includes higher levels of these climates is hypothesized to predict positive outcomes for staff, such as commitment, and engagement, and as well, positive outcomes for patients, such as patient safety. The model proposes that positive psychological states among care providers mediate relationships between the work environment and outcomes. As a preliminary test of the model, survey data from 252 clinical care providers working in a large urban hospital were analyzed. Structural equations modeling analyses found partial support for the model, in that care providers' psychological safety partially mediated the relationships between the work environment and care provider commitment. Direct relationships also existed between some of the work environment climates and care provider well-being and patient safety outcomes. Implications and limitations are discussed.",Patient centered care; Staff morale; Work environments,Employment; Health care; Hospitals; Continuous quality improvement; Patient-centered care; Psychological safety; Psychological state; Staff morale; Structural equations modeling; Theoretical framework; Work environments; Human engineering

Using both archival and survey data, the present paper directly tests Kerr's proposal by investigating whether, how and why highly visible behaviors are over-rewarded and less visible, but at least equally important behaviors are under-rewarded. The National Basketball Association (NBA) was chosen as the domain of this study because scoring is particularly vivid. In the NBA, both non-scoring performance and scoring performance are critical for winning games (Chatterjee, Campbell & Wiseman, 1994; Hofler & Payne, 2004). However, findings from four studies demonstrated that the scoring performance of NBA players was weighed more heavily than their non-scoring performance because of its vividness. Scorers were rewarded with higher salaries and received more support in the NBA All-Star balloting than defenders, even though they might not necessarily make more contribution than their teammates. This pattern of findings suggests that the vividness effect may lead to pronounced differences in people's judgments especially when they are overwhelmed with abundant real-world information with similar validity.",Compensation; Judgment and decision making; Vividness,Behavioral research; Compensation (personnel); Decision making; Campbell; Judgment and decision makings; National basketball associations; Real-world information; Scoring performance; Survey data; Vividness; Sports

We test the implications of the VC model for CV unit performance using a longitudinal database (combining survey, archival and survival data) on 95 CV units. Overall, adopting central elements the VC model was associated with higher CV unit performance. Critically, however, different elements of the VC model predicted strategic versus financial performance in CV units - the impact on financial dimensions of performance also being somewhat more pronounced. Specifically, horizontal autonomy, communication with the VC community, and relatedness of investments each positively influence the strategic performance of the CV unit. Likewise, behaving like a VC in terms of compensation, syndication centrality and relatedness of investments (inverted U shape) also positively influences the financial performance of the CV unit. In addition, survival of the CV unit was strongly associated with adopting the VC model (mediated, in part, by the enhanced performance of the CV unit when adopting the VC model).",Best practice; Corporate venture unit; Venture capital,Best practices; Corporate venture units; Corporate ventures; Financial performance; Inverted u shapes; Survival data; Venture Capital; Investments

In this study, we argue that investment analysts, through their reports and ratings, serve an important external monitoring role over corporate behavior. Therefore, we expect that investment analysts can influence the board's evaluation of the firm and its leadership. We find that board dismissal of the CEO occurs more frequently for firms with more negative investment analyst ratings, providing strong support for their external monitoring role.",Analysts; CEO dismissal; Governance,Analysts; CEO dismissal; Corporate behavior; External control; Governance; Investment analysts; Poor performance; Investments

To illustrate, this paper analyses the representation of Max Weber in management texts. Using a set of Foucauldian methods we find their representation of Weber over the past 30 years to be highly dubious, a reflection of a peculiar perspective that emerged in the middle of the 20th century, and driven more by a desire to justify the latest 'one best way' than an accurate reflection of anything that Weber actually said.

Using data from twenty student teams across three time periods, we found that diversity drives conflict, but the relationship is often curvilinear.

Change capabilities or cynicism?

An increasing rate and frequency of organizational change processes can lead to change fatigue and cynicism, but there is also some evidence that experience with change can generate more positive reactions to change. Drawing on four different studies of reactions to planned change, we probe how reactions to change are affected by previous experience with change. Our findings suggest that employees with limited change experience react stronger, more emotionally, and more actively to planned change as compared with employees that have been through many change processes. As organizational members gain experience with large-scale planned change, they use less effort to resist change and show more loyal but also more passive reactions to change. While we argue that experience with planned change can contribute in developing change capabilities and hence ultimately affect an organization's capacity for change, this requires that past experiences are positive and that managers have developed structural, procedural and interpersonal change management capabilities.",Change capabilities; Change experience; Reactions to change,Change capabilities; Change experience; Change management; Change process; Organizational change; Planned changes; Reactions to change; Personnel

At the same time, the fact remains that unless the contextual differences with developed economies are accounted for, researchers could misspecify research designs. The pace of evolution of 'context' in emerging economies, coupled with 'weak signals' emanating from sparsely distributed data points calls for the primacy of idiographic explanations, such as those afforded by the case study method. As case research links observations, experiences and underlying mechanisms, it allows the researcher to tackle problems associated with continuous transformation of institutional arrangements in emerging economies. In contrast, a researcher employing conventional survey research in such settings may not be alert to either the presence of unfamiliar contingencies or the operation of hitherto dormant mechanisms, resulting in low 'validity.' Furthermore, such survey research would have low 'reliability' due to low statistical power of the significance tests. With its potential for higher validity and higher reliability under such circumstances, we argue that the case study method is a more appropriate and powerful tool to capture rich data for theory building in emerging economies.",Case study method; Emerging economies; Research design,Surveys; Case study methods; Continuous transformations; Developed economies; Distributed data points; Emerging economies; Institutional arrangement; Research designs; Significance test; Reliability theory
Identity and reflexivity in research on women accountants,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088340143&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33649814&partnerID=40&md5=409df792a9c49422bf1437ca22135651,"This paper reviews research into the scarcity of women at the highest levels of accountancy. We argue that only by integrating the different stories can we fully understand the scarcity of women in all its complexity and insert it into the broader problematic of the professional's identity. Women's representation is not solely an issue relating to women, since stereotyped roles perpetuated at the social and organisational levels influence both male and female accountant identities. Moreover, raising the issue of the identity of the accountant leads us to raise the issue of the identity of the researcher. By exploring research designs, we elaborate on the nature of reflexivity in research, in particular on the interplay among different levels of interpretation (description, explanation, prediction and prescription, as described by Ahrens and Chapman, 2006) that is alternately ignored, claimed or rejected by accounting scholars addressing gender issues.",Gender; Reflexivity; Research,Gender; Gender issues; Organisational level; Reflexivity; Research designs; Research

The construct of societal or national culture, which seems likely to shape individuals' experiences of the work-family interface, has been generally unacknowledged in theories and research in the work-family literature. In this article, we offer guidelines for the development of culture-sensitive theories of work-family phenomena and for research to test such theories as they are developed. First, we review the few prior research attempts that have incorporated cultural considerations in some manner and identify cultural dimensions that are likely to influence the work-family interface. Next, we demonstrate how selected cultural dimensions may be incorporated into theories of work-family conflict and enrichment, two constructs that represent the negative and positive side of the work-family interface respectively, to make these theories more culture-sensitive. Finally, we offer an ambitious agenda for future theory and research to increase understanding of cultural influences on the work-family interface.",Careers; Cross-cultural issues; Work and family,Human resource management; Careers; Cross-cultural issues; Cultural dimensions; Cultural influences; National cultures; Work and family; Work-family conflict; Research

In addition, the market reacts more positively to positive surprises by celebrity firms than to positive surprises by high reputation firms.

Modelling interactions between sharks and manufacturers within a biform game, we show formally that the shark problem is more subtle from a theoretical managerial perspective and sustainable to policy changes in part. Patent extortion will remain a viable strategy in technologically crowded industries when sharks choose patents on inventions that (1) can be invented around rather easily before infringement, but (2) are sufficiently sophisticated to be upheld in court and (3) create significant mid-term switching costs for manufacturers after infringement.

Specifically, we use this notion to examine how a firm's decision to enter mimetically into a new market depends on the extent to which its competitors compete with each other. We argue that a firm is especially inclined to imitate its direct competitors if its rivals also compete directly with each other, out of a fear to become ""the odd one out."" This inclination is even stronger if the firm's rivals are engaged in multimarket competition with each other, which leads to non-aggressive behavior due to mutual forbearance. In contrast, a firm tends to shy away from following their competitors' market entry moves if these companies have an equivalent dependence on the segments they operate in, since this sets the stage for aggressive, cut-throat competition; in this case, firms are happy ""to be left behind."" We test our hypotheses in two distinct contexts, in both cases capturing the full population of firms in the industry: Chinese drug producers' entry into new product markets during the period 1993-2001 and Taiwanese PC hardware manufacturers' entry into new geographic markets in China during the period 1999-2005. We find strong support for our predictions in both contexts. Overall, the results highlight how a firm's (mimetic) behavior not only depends on how it relates to its competitors, but also on how these competitors relate towards each other. We discuss how future research might extend the concept of the structure of competition and how it might be applied to other aspects of organizational behavior.",Competition; Imitation; Market entry,Commerce; Industry; Geographic market; Imitation; Market entry; New product; Organizational behavior; PC hardware; Competition

The results indicate that managers emphasize the leader and entrepreneur roles. They perceive consultants to be most helpful in the execution of the monitor and entrepreneur roles. We find that individual-level factors such as gender, age, experience, and professional background are most important for explaining managerial role perception.",Management consulting; Managerial roles; Perception,Sensory perception; External consultants; Individual levels; Management consulting; Managerial roles; Professional backgrounds; Managers

Growth and switching options in foreign direct investment,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088715520&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33645116&partnerID=40&md5=a01634c829ecb001beaa4d832cc69683,"A real options view of foreign direct investments (FDI) has shed light in new directions on why and how firms invest internationally under unanticipated changes in macroeconomic factors. Although there is increasing interest over multinational corporation (MNC) flexibility under uncertainty, the current status of research is mixed. In this research, we endeavor to locate possible solutions for inconclusive past research. There are two different views on the real options value of international investments. One is the growth options view, noting that FDI carry great growth potential through foothold investments within host countries. Through such investments, MNCs can adapt to local environment in incremental ways over time. On the other hand, the switching options view indicates that FDI can flexibly shift value chain activities across countries under unanticipated fluctuations in exchange rate and/or demand across countries. It is important to note that the two views provide conflicting predictions on the same attributes of multinationality. For example, minority ownership increases growth options value, while majority or whole ownership increases switching options value. In addition, broader operations across many countries have been associated with switching options value, while deeper operations in a given country associated with growth options value. Without controlling for breadth of operations and level of ownership, the real options value of international investments can lead to inconclusive results by canceling out the value embedded in one type over another. This research addresses this issue. Based on a sample of Korean manufacturing firms, we find that during the uncertainty period of the Korean economic crisis (characterized by high exchange rate volatility), firms¡̄ international investments provided them with switching options rather than growth options. International investments were associated with growth options during pre-crisis periods, however.",Exchange rate; FDI; Real options,Switching; Exchange rate volatilities; Exchange rates; Foreign direct investments; International investments; Local environments; Manufacturing firms; Multinational corporations; Real Options; Investments

In an initial two-step study designed to assess social views of entrepreneur role, we inductively generated a comprehensive list of attributes associated with this role in each country. Drawing on those results, an independent sample of 471 individuals in the three countries assessed the extent to which these attributes fit their image of entrepreneurs. While several similarities existed in social views of the prototypical entrepreneur role, there were also meaningful differences, and the magnitude of endorsement of prototypical elements was significantly different across the three countries. We then conducted a second study in the three countries (n = 597) to extend the ideas and results from the first study to develop and validate a measure of aspired entrepreneur identity and assess its ability to predict nascent entrepreneurial behaviors of opportunity discovery, exploitation, and behavioral commitment. In all three settings, strength of aspired entrepreneurial identity was significantly associated with the extent to which the individual's self-description fit personally normative views of the entrepreneurial role. Identity strength was predictive of nascent entrepreneurial behaviors in all three nations. Structural equation modeling indicated that the entrepreneur identity measure we developed was equivalent across the three settings. Implications of the results for entrepreneurship theory were discussed.",Cross-cultural; Entrepreneur; Identity,Cross-cultural; Entrepreneur; Entrepreneurial behavior; Identity; Role-based; Structural equation modeling

To do so, we created the most comprehensive research methods taxonomy available to date, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, to categorize design, measurement, and data-analysis topics. Over the 10-year period, the most popular quantitative topics are surveys, temporal issues, and electronic/Web research (design), validity, reliability, and level of analysis of the dependent variable (measurement), and multiple regression/correlation, structural equation modeling, and multilevel research (analysis). The most popular qualitative topics are interpretive, policy capturing, and action research (design), surveys and reliability (measurement), and interpretive, policy capturing, and content analysis (analysis). Results also show several upward trends in the attention devoted to topics such as surveys and electronic/Web research, interpretive, and action research (design), level of analysis of the dependent variable and validity (measurement), and multilevel research (analysis).

Based on the neo-institutional theory and the learning model of risk taking, we hypothesize that a firm is more or less likely to conform to prevailing institutional pressures depending on how firms perceive the risks associated to conformity under performance gains or losses. We also hypothesize that a firm¡s status in a hierarchical structure can further moderate this process. We test these hypotheses using a sample of U.S. venture capital firms from 1990-2003. Our results show that a firm is more likely to conform to prevailing practices and norms in the area of both gains and losses, and that the conformity tendency is stronger in the area of losses than in the area of gains.

Specifically, we argue that the transferability of a tie from the parallel network to the focal network is affected by the attention that managers give to the parallel network as a whole or to the specific partners in that network.

Inter-firm ambidexterity in complementary competence domains: A study of UK biotech,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088715386&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33649958&partnerID=40&md5=2d18f32a78939ab1ccfde4ce5d22ebd9,"March (1991) argued that balancing exploration and exploitation is fundamental to firm profitability and survival. The theoretical and empirical interest in organisational ambidexterity has only recently been revived. This paper explores the potential to attain ambidexterity through cooperation, and contends that the complementary capabilities of partners are the basis for ambidextrous cooperative agreements. It is further argued that complementary competences facilitate the co-existence of established firms and new technology entrants in an industry. These propositions are supported by statistical analysis of 2,034 cooperative agreements in the UK biotechnology sector between 1991 and 2001. The findings have implications for the management of a firm's competence base and have important insights for industrial dynamics of the UK biotechnology sector.",Cooperative agreements; Exploitation; Exploration; Organisational ambidexterity,Natural resources exploration; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Biotechnology sectors; Cooperative agreements; Established firms; Exploitation; Firm profitabilities; Industrial dynamics; Organisational; Biotechnology

These characteristics involve the effective incorporation of the two general classes of outside consulting assistance (explorative assistance and exploitative assistance) into formally committed R&D funding sources (private R&D and public R&D) under specific product and technological innovation plans that simultaneously influence project performance. Specifically, we examine the main effects of private R&D and public R&D on project performance as well as the moderating effects of explorative assistance and exploitative assistance among the above variables. We employed both secondary data and questionnaire survey to collect data for testing our research hypotheses. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 91 R&D projects. The results indicate that private R&D and public R&D have different effects on project performance. Moreover, explorative assistance and exploitative assistance play as a moderator in affecting the relationship among private R&D, public R&D and project performance.

To fill that gap, this paper examines institutional factors impact the agglomeration patterns of foreign entrants. We theorize that institutional contexts characterized by collectivist cultures, as well as economic and political uncertainty, encourage foreign entrants to locate within existing geographic agglomerations. To test our hypotheses, we empirically examine the location patterns of 181 foreign plant investments made by 61 parent firms across 22 countries in the global semiconductor industry. The findings reveal that foreign entrants are more likely to agglomerate in host countries characterized by collectivist cultures and by political and economic uncertainty. Home country characteristics had very little impact on the agglomeration decision of the foreign entrants. These results enrich traditional literature on FDI location choice by suggesting that the decision to agglomerate is context-dependent. Moreover, when choosing a location within a given country, foreign entrants are more likely to adapt to characteristics of the host country.",Agglomeration; FDI; Location choice,Location; Semiconductor device manufacture; Societies and institutions; Context dependent; Economic uncertainty; FDI; Foreign direct investments; Foreign plants; Host countries; Institutional factors; Location choice; Semiconductor industry; Agglomeration

Results from empirical tests on a sample of Swiss publicly listed companies support this assertion, suggesting that firms manage the additional complexity of internationalization by increasing the degree of nationality diversity of top management teams and boards.

Focusing on organizational systems as nexuses of contracts, we show how coordination can be improved following diversification by shifting asset ownership to agents. We find support for this proposition using novel microdata on taxi firms from the Economic Census, which shows that firms respond to the need for coordination between business units, following diversification, by shifting away from leasing vehicles to drivers toward contracting with drivers who own their own vehicles. We then investigate a deeper implication of the theory, that if changes in (vertical) asset ownership are efficiency improving responses to (horizontal) diversification, then horizontal and vertical organizational changes should exhibit complementarities in firms' production functions. We find that firms are indeed more productive when they realign their asset ownership contracts more fully following diversification. The empirical tests control for firm fixed effects and are robust to controls for the joint determination of diversification, asset ownership and productivity. We interpret the evidence as providing support for a theory of efficient organizational adaptation in response to the challenges of diversification.",Asset ownership; Diversification; Organization,Societies and institutions; Asset ownerships; Diversification; Managerial resources; Organizational adaptation; Organizational change; Organizational system; Production function; Vertical contracting; Taxicabs

We test this argument in a sample of 640 US manufacturing firms from 1981-2006 and find, consistent with our theory, that financial acquirers are more likely to target firms that are poorly understood by the public market, that have lower rates of capital investment in the past, and that are underperforming.

Despite a large theoretical literature, there are few empirical studies on the success of vendor strategies to achieve lock-in. This paper uses a comprehensive database of transactions in two major product lines for a large enterprise software vendor to examine the use and success of pricing and product strategies to promote customer lock-in. Regarding pricing, the paper demonstrates that the vendor engages in significant ""bargain-then-ripoff"" pricing; customers completely new to it receive discounts that are nearly 50% greater than existing customers who are purchasing upgrades of a product. On the product side, one common lock-in strategy - the offering of broad product ""suites"" which span multiple product lines - appears to be of limited effectiveness. The vendor cannot limit its initial ""bargain"" to customers new to a product line, even if the customer has bought a different product the vendor previously, suggesting that lock-in is product-, not vendor-specific. Finally, not all customers get locked-in; I find that customers with high IT capabilities, which is highly correlated with financial performance, are likely to receive an ""initial bargain"" and then switch suppliers or use legacy systems, rather than pay locked-in rates. The ""best"" customers in terms of future revenue potential therefore avoid getting locked-in.",Innovation; Lock-in; Software,Computer software; Economics; Enterprise software; Legacy systems; Locks (fasteners); Sales; Empirical studies; Financial performance; Highly-correlated; Innovation cycles; Lock-in; Multiple product lines; Product strategy; Revenue potential; Costs

We explore the role of assumptions underlying knowledge creation within the field of organizational studies, and investigate how incompatible assumptions across subgroups may inhibit the generation of multidisciplinary knowledge. While organizational studies research commonly assumes dynamic open systems with recursive influence between environments and interactions, studies of micro-processes in organizations often assume implicitly that interactions among organizational members are closed systems. We suggest that this incompatibility between assumptions may inhibit knowledge sharing in organizational studies research. We empirically assess this assertion by analyzing studies of negotiation published in top peer-reviewed management, psychology, sociology, and industrial relations journals from 1990 to 2005. Our findings illuminate a continuum of open-systems to closed-systems assumptions underlying this micro-process research. Analysis of the rate of citation of the articles in our data set by non-negotiation organizational studies research reveals that open systems assumptions increase the likelihood that a negotiation article will be cited in organizational studies, after controlling for other known effects on citation rate, such as outlet, discipline, length, number of citations and methodology. Our findings suggest that multidisciplinary fields can enhance their knowledge sharing by attending to the compatibility of assumptions held by sub-groups within the field.",Communities of practice; Knowldege sharing; Negotiation,Industrial relations; Knowledge acquisition; Communities of Practice; Knowldege sharing; Knowledge creations; Knowledge workers; Knowledge-sharing; Microprocesses; Negotiation; Organizational studies; Knowledge management

In this paper we pursue what it means to be 'open' and what conditions this choice. Using the UK Innovation Survey Database 2005, we test different measures of 'openness' across a large data set and find that open innovation practices vary across firms and sectors, giving support to the view that openness is not strictly a choice for the firm but an outcome of capabilities, industrial organisation and wider innovation systems. Within the firm, design is revealed as a core capability that shapes open innovation practice, reflecting its role in innovation task partitioning. We confirm this in our robust findings that design is accorded higher importance by firms which have open innovation practices.",Design; Open Innovation; Task partitioning,Design; Business models; Core capabilities; Industrial organisation; Innovation system; Large datasets; Open innovation; Search patterns; Task partitioning; Statistical tests

The literature on strategic philanthropy suggests that such philanthropic behavior may be valuable because it can generate direct and indirect benefits to the firm, yet it is not known whether investors interpret donations in this way. We develop hypotheses linking the strategic character of donations to positive abnormal returns. Using event study methodology, we investigate stock market reactions to corporate donation announcements by 108 US firms made in response to Hurricane Katrina. We then use regression analysis to examine if our hypothesized predictors are associated with positive abnormal returns. Our results show that a number of factors moderate the relationship between donation announcements and abnormal stock returns.

BSR's raison d-être is to attract a corporate membership committed to improving their social performance collectively and individually. It consists of firms from many industrial sectors and addresses a variety of social issues with several mechanisms, including conferences, consulting, newsletters and facilitation of inter-firm cooperation. This distinguishes BSR from most business associations, which tend to focus on improving business competitiveness, political advocacy and public relations. In addition, most forms of corporate self-regulation for social issues typically address a narrow range of issues and industries with specific rather than diverse methods. BSR therefore represents an alternative instrument to both government regulation and voluntary self-regulation. Results show that BSR members tend to perform better in CSP strengths, but that they do not exhibit better performance in areas of CSP weaknesses. Thus, BSR might be an effective instrument for fostering innovative corporate social behavior, helping firms to differentiate themselves based on CSP. On the other hand, our results do not suggest that BSR helps businesses to address the weak aspects of their CSP as an alternative to stronger regulatory approaches.",Business associations; Corporate social performance,Deregulation; Public relations; Social aspects; Business associations; Corporate social performance; Diverse methods; Government regulation; Industrial sector; Social behavior; Social performance; Social responsibilities; Competition

By combining CSR and organizational change theories, this research underscores key CSR cultural integration phases and emphasizes the interplay among ideal-type theories of social change to provide an extensive explanation of organizational development toward CSR. Depending on the unit of analysis and timing in the organizational progress toward CSR, the primary framework we propose considers different approaches as helpful for understanding the rationale and processes at play behind the development of a CSR orientation. More especially, we underscore that organizational development toward CSR can be represented by a tri-motor theory where three of the four motors emphasized by Van de Ven and Poole (1995) - i.e. life-cycle, teleological and dialectical - operate interdependently according to the CSR cultural integration phase that characterizes the company. Together, these elements contribute to a compelling perspective on the implementation of a CSR orientation within organizations and provide extensive opportunities for further research and refined conceptualizations.",Corporate social responsibility; Organizational change; Organizational culture,Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Integration phase; Motor theories; Organizational change; Organizational cultures; Organizational development; Societal issues; Unit of analysis; Life cycle

Drawing on the work of Barley and Tolbert (1997), the paper develops a processual approach to institutionalization which emphasizes the interplay between local level adoption of innovations, and their field-level diffusion. This interplay is seen linked to the emergence of key mechanisms of institutionalization, including role specialization, boundary-spanning activities and the production of discourse. The paper develops this processual approach through an historical, multi-level account of the evolution and spread of Resource Planning systems innovation, from the 1960's to the present-day culminating in the current generation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. This empirical account allows us explore the coevolution of key institutionalizing mechanisms and relate them to the development of the technologies involved. In particular, the relationship between field-level shifts in technology and the expanding scope, and challenges, of their use at local level are analysed in terms of a process of disembedding and embedding organizational and technological forms of knowledge. The resulting analysis helps us to account for the apparent contradiction between the widespread acceptance of ERP systems innovation and the chronic problems experienced in the use of such innovation. It leads to the view that RP systems innovation has become institutionalized within business practice in part because of, and not despite, the frequent failures associated with its adoption.",ERP; Innovation; Institutionalization,Resource allocation; Adoption of innovations; Boundary spanning; Business practices; Current generation; Dis-embedding; Enterprise resource planning systems; Institutionalization; Resource planning system; Enterprise resource planning

Applying a psychological framework on the politics of emotion to the workplace, we examine the unique challenges female entrepreneurs face in managing the emotional landscape of their work relationships. We illustrate how the gendering of emotion shapes emotional displays and creates emotional double standards and double binds that create and sustain gender differences in power in work relationships. We argue that this process is amplified for female entrepreneurs and posit that male entrepreneurs can leverage emotion into power in ways that are unavailable to women. We then offer a model of an emotional episode, and drawing on the emotional intelligence, emotional learning and relational maintenance literatures, identify three core emotional competencies that female entrepreneurs can use to successfully navigate the emotional battlefields of their work relationships.

Suppliers particularly are confronted with manufactures' presettings related to product and process objectives, frame specifications, and target prices. We refer to those aspects as supply-chain rigidities towards innovation. This study aims to explore the complex setting for strategic impulses for innovation. We clarify how suppliers' innovation strategies and their hereby created internal capabilities cope with different degrees of supply-chain rigidity and support market success. A survey on 241 small and mid-sized companies in the high-tech sector reveals that a strategic design towards innovation increases market performance both directly and through the achievement of ""hard"" and ""soft"" innovation goals. Performance effects are dependent on the supply chain integration. A deliberate strategy seems suitable for high levels of supply chain rigidity, i.e. clear product/technology requirements and interfaces between the different tier-levels of the supply chain. An emergent strategy supports market performance through intra-firm innovation orientation under high ambiguity of supply chain requirements. Our results may assist firms in finding the right innovation planning with respect to their overall setting in the supply chain.",Innovation; Strategy; Supply chain,Commerce; Rigidity; Emergent strategies; Innovation strategy; Market performance; Performance effect; Strategic issues; Strategy; Supply chain requirements; Supply-chain integration; Supply chains

In contrast, this paper examines the time-consuming and costly - but more certain - process of technology development. We analyze the effect of imitation strategies and spillovers from technology leaders to technology followers on competitive dynamics. In particular, our model helps characterize competitive outcomes such as the rate of technology diffusion in an industry, the sustainability of technology-based competitive advantages, and relative financial performance. Our results challenge the widely accepted view that inter-firm spillovers are always beneficial to technology followers but detrimental to technology leaders. We show that leaders may have incentives to increase spillovers to induce followers to switch from concurrent to imitative technology development strategies. Conversely, follower firms may be worse off with more spillovers from technology leaders. With high spillovers, leaders expect to be imitated faster and have fewer incentives to develop a new technology, which delays its diffusion into the industry. Finally, we examine firms' differential motivations to invest in technology development capabilities. Our model derives testable relationships between important competitive and financial variables that are often empirically observable.",Imitation; Spillovers; Time-based competition,Competitive advantage; Financial performance; Imitation; Spillovers; Technology development; Technology diffusion; Technology followers; Time-based competition; Competition

In analyzing these two issues we controlled for key organizational characteristics (size, technological level, sector, service and globalization level). Data from 5,991 organizations in 21 countries were obtained for this study, using the database of CRANET (Cross-country HRM research). Data on cultural values were taken from the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness) study and assigned to the organizations respectively. Results showed that national values explained PA strategies, confirming all related study hypotheses. Generally, values such as power distance, future orientation, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism explained the use of different PA systems. Organizational characteristics were also related to PA. In addition, we found interactions between national values and PA programs on organizational outcomes that supported the study's hypotheses.

We juxtapose legal and psychological ownership to develop propositions regarding the forms and tactics of activism shareholders are likely to adopt.

Additionally, I focus on individuals affiliated with a common institution or focal individual who have come to identify themselves as ""family members."" This form of identification is separate from identification with a formal institution and persists through an individual's subsequent career positions at different institutions with different colleagues. Examples include individuals who worked at Fairchild Semiconductor who identified themselves as ""Fairchildren"" long after leaving Fairchild for positions at other organizations (Pollack, 1988). I utilize a network perspective to investigate recognized ""family"" groups of affiliated coaches in NCAA Division I Men's basketball. I propose that coaches affiliated with ""coaching families"" experience greater career opportunity and exhibit greater resiliency due to external image benefits and internal identity benefits derived from the use of family language. I first analyze all head coaching position changes (n=285) between 2001 and 2007 and find that recognition as a ""family member"" is a positive predictor of career advancement. I next analyze the subsequent career moves of all coaches that were fired (n=155) between 2001 and 2007 and find that ""family membership"" and network connectivity to other active coaches are positive predictors of a coach's exhibited career resiliency.",Family metaphor; Organizational identification; Social network analysis,Social networking (online); Career advancement; Career opportunities; Cognitive factors; Ego networks; Fairchild semiconductor; Family metaphor; Network connectivity; Organizational identifications; Sports

We discover that individual motivation to achieve group goals has a negative effect on the development of TMS in teams where both social identity and cohesion are low and do not direct the efforts of team members towards working together. Only when group identification, driven by social identity and cohesion, encourages team members to work together, does individual motivation stimulate the development of interdependent specialized structures of knowledge such as TMS. Moreover, findings show that, as predicted, TMS positively influence team performance.

In a large-scale study with 158 organizations, a total of 18,094 respondents provided data on their organizations' TFL climate, positive affective tone, and internal trust, and on employees' collective job performance within the respective organizations. Using robust data analytic techniques, we received empirical support for the hypothesized conceptual scheme, yielding a pattern of moderated mediation: Organizations' TFL climate indirectly enhances employees' collective job performance by fostering positive affective tone under conditions of high internal trust, but not under conditions of low internal trust. These findings corroborate the inherently affective nature of TFL prior research has emphasized, while also demonstrating that the performance consequences of such leadership may hinge on specific contextual factors such as the level of trust within organizations.",Positive affective tone; Transformational leadership; Trust,Personnel; Analytic technique; Contextual factors; Large-scale studies; Organizational levels; Performance effect; Positive affective tone; Transformational leadership; Trust; Boundary conditions

Following the conclusions from previous studies in developed economies, it takes a broad perspective in the sense that it follows a cross-functional approach, looking at finance, strategic planning, marketing, and operations management, as well as using market return as an indicator of value. The data was collected in a survey with senior managers and directors of European companies with subsidiaries in the Mercosur and Chile and then analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative part involves a two-stage regression analysis: the first stage time series regression calculates a foreign exchange exposure coefficient, and the second cross-sectional regression uses this coefficient as an independent variable against the answers from the survey. The qualitative analysis is based on the systematic approach of Grounded Theory. The results show that ten areas for decisions have impacted the firms' value as well as helped them to improve the efficiency of their hedging initiatives. These findings are intended to make contributions in the area of hedging exchange exposure, offering a new perspective in the context of emerging markets on the current literature on developed countries.",,Efficiency; Regression analysis; Surveys; Time series analysis; Cross-sectional regression; Developed countries; Independent variables; Multinational enterprise; Operations management; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Time-series regression; Commerce

The extant literature says they can be any of these. We surmise that this ambiguity reflects the modus operandi that content and processes of computer workarounds are under-theorized as post IT implementation phenomena. Recent research, though insightful, still casts computer workarounds as nominal and aggregate phenomena analyzing their antecedent conditions and their impact. This paper is an attempt to disentangle the black-box of computer workarounds focusing on their contents and processes as situated work practices using negotiated order as a conceptual framework. By making the workaround practices as well as their immediate upstream and downstream activities the focal unit of analysis, we disentangle the enactment of a computer workaround. Specifically we propose that some workarounds are based on an alternate negotiated order and may entail coordinated action. Thus, we extend the literature by positing that computer workarounds are social practices going beyond prior formulations of workarounds as ""hacks"" or ""tweaks"" by individual computer users. Our findings are based on a non-participant observer case study of a medication dispensing system in a teaching hospital.",Computer workarounds; Negotiated order; Situated practices,Computer workarounds; Conceptual frameworks; Coordinated actions; Dispensing systems; Medication systems; Negotiated order; Recent researches; Situated practices; Hospitals

In addition, work motivation was found to moderate the relationship between perceived training opportunities and organizational citizenship behaviors. The form of the moderation revealed a positive relationship for those with high intrinsic motivation.

Such dispersed teams are generally assumed to have lower performance than co-located teams because good teamwork is more difficult to achieve in a virtual workspace. In this paper, we hypothesize that this negative effect of dispersion not equally applies to all teams but rather is conditional on the level of teamwork quality. We address this research question using data from managers, team leaders, and team members pertaining to 81 software development teams with highly varying degrees of dispersion. Results suggest that teams with lower levels of collaboration quality, particularly task-related team processes, considerably suffer from dispersion. By contrast, dispersed teams with excellent teamwork are not only found to be less affected by dispersion but even can reach higher levels of effectiveness than co-located teams. Our results indicate that the effect of dispersion is conditional on task-related teamwork dimensions like mutual support, balance of contribution or formal communication, partly different to those commonly referred to as most important in a virtual context. As an explanation for this conditional effect of dispersion we suspect that virtual teams are able to leverage their functional and structural diversity if they manage to reach high levels of teamwork over distance. We found indications in our data providing support for this notion.",Dispersed teams; Team effectiveness; Teamwork,Budget control; Dispersions; Software design; Degrees of dispersions; Dispersed teams; Geographical locations; Levels of collaborations; Software development teams; Team effectiveness; Teamwork; Virtual collaboration; Human resource management

This has prompted a growing body of research into the determinants of CNA attitudes, most of which has focused on job and organizational factors. There is need for a better understanding of how non-work factors affect CNA attitudes, including the process by which they influence attitudes and the contingencies that moderate this process. This study contributes to knowledge in this area by investigating how work-family conflict (WFC) relates to job satisfaction and turnover intention among CNAs. It examines the role of burnout as a mediator in these relationships, and the moderating effects of supportive supervision and supportive coworkers. WFC was negatively related to job satisfaction and positively related to turnover intention. Burnout mediated both relationships. The effect of WFC on burnout was moderated by the level of supportive supervision perceived by CNAs. The implication for management practice is that the work demands experienced by CNAs can interfere with their family life and such spillover can lead to burnout, negatively affecting their attitudes toward work and the organization. Management can mitigate these negative effects through practices aimed at improving job-person fit and providing supervisory support and coping resources.",Certified nursing assistants; Work-family conflict; Work-related attitudes,Nursing; Certified nursing assistants; Management practices; Moderating effect; Organizational factors; Quality of care; Turnover intentions; Work-family conflict; Work-related attitudes; Job satisfaction

Furthermore, literature on creative cognition has largely paid attention to artifacts as outcomes of the creative processes. Although, both streams of literature present some insights on how artifacts can act as inputs to the dynamics of creativity, there seems to be a lack of systematic investigation in this respect. In this paper, building on an ethnographic study of a product design firm, I investigate more closely how artifacts are used during the creative process. The emerging findings highlight that a vast array of artifacts - ""visual tools"" ranging from pictures, magazines, and sketches, to samples of products, samples of materials, physical models, and videos used by designers to accomplish their tasks - can actively support, influence, and shape the generation, the development and the refinement of the ideas. More specifically, four main functions performed by artifacts are presented and discussed: (1) inspiration; (2) individual evaluation and refinement; (3) internal sharing, and (4) external alignment.",Creative cognition; Creativity; Organizational artifacts,Knowledge management; Creative cognition; Creative process; Creativity; Cross-organizational; Ethnographic study; Organizational artifacts; Physical model; Visual tools; Product design

Results from dyadic network data from 89 employees show that workflow dependence ties positively predict both helping and hindrance behaviors. Furthermore, people who are structurally equivalent in the workflow dependence network tend to engage in more helping behaviors toward each other, and this is accentuated when they also have positive affective ties with each other. This form of multiplex tie is also negatively related to hindrance behaviors. On the other hand, when workflow structural equivalence occurs in conjunction with negative affective ties, this form of multiplex tie is positively related to hindrance behaviors. Finally, positive affective ties positively predict interpersonal helping behaviors while negative affective ties are positively associated with hindrance behaviors. These results are discussed and implications for research and practice presented.",,Forecasting; Personnel; Dyadic network; Structural equivalence; Behavioral research

We move beyond current linkages between board member experiences and strategic change or a singular functional strategy to explore how prior board experience simultaneously affects the aggressiveness of multiple functional strategies. Drawing on the attention-based view and work in social psychology related to the optimism bias, we argue that differences between prior extra-and intra-industry board experience lead to systematic differences in board members' understanding and appraisal of aggressively pursuing various functional strategies. After addressing concerns of endogeneity, we find that prior intra-industry board experience leads to more aggressive investment and less aggressive market strategies, while extra-industry experience has the opposite effect. Based on attention-based view and optimism bias we argue these results are largely due to relevant prior experience sensitizing board members to the perils of certain aggressive functional strategies, while the lack of such relevant experience leads to overconfidence in obtaining the returns possible from other aggressive strategies.",Boards; Experience; Optimism bias,Attention-based views; Boards; Experience; Functional strategies; Industry experience; Market strategies; Optimism bias; Strategy formulations

The paper compiles and integrates theories that exist in different fields of social sciences (economics, business administration, psychology, sociology) in order to develop a more multi-facetted picture why so many MNCs are acting on an intra-regional level.

Increasing costs, stiffer competition, and anticipated tightening of budgets have created new levels of urgency among medical school deans and hospital CEOs to increase the efficiency of the clinical enterprise. This study models an AMC as a loosely coupled system and examines why interdisciplinary teams - comprising administrators, physicians, and nurses - struggle to successfully reengineer healthcare processes. Semi-structured interviews in an U.S. AMC were the basis for the development of a grounded theory framework. The findings suggest that: (a) the ambivalent culture of an AMC alternately supports and block reengineering, efforts, (b) improved patient outcomes must drive, and will result in, organizational efficiencies, (c) successful reengineering efforts share several common characteristics, and (d) good planning is important, but insufficient to drive change. The accompanying conceptual model suggests that the hospital-focused and patient-focused reengineering goals act as independent variables. The reengineering process is mediated by an iterative convergence of the sensemaking and meaning-arbitrage dyad that results in equifinal meaning. Subsequent actions result in organizational performance. The process is moderated by the psychological safety afforded to the team as well as the resources provided to implement the changes. Implications for both scholars and practitioners are presented.",Equifinal meaning; Reengineering; Sensemaking,Budget control; Competition; Efficiency; Health care; Hospitals; Academic medical centers; Equifinal meaning; Healthcare organizations; Loosely coupled systems; Organizational efficiency; Organizational performance; Semi structured interviews; Sensemaking; Reengineering
Board diversity and firm performance: An empirical investigation of the mediating effects of board processes and task performance,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088184468&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33625430&partnerID=40&md5=bf2941fa35fb534cd6ea05cd5ef6d834,"Empirical works on board diversity are still limited and the few existing studies provide mixed results as to whether board diversity has a positive or negative impact on firm level outcomes. This inconsistency of findings on the relationship between group diversity and organizational performance is due to the ambivalent nature of the concept and to the lack of studies investigating the intervening effects of board process and task performance. Following calls for understanding the effects of intermediate variables, this article empirically investigates the mediating roles of board processes and task performance in the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We have collected primary survey data from corporate boards of large companies. We have tested our hypotheses applying structural equation modeling. Our findings show that (i) board diversity can be a valuable resource in enhancing board task performance; (ii) board processes mediate the relationship between board diversity and task performance; (iii) board service performance has a positive effect on firm level performance. The paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of the effects of board characteristics on firm performance. It provides a partial explanation for mixed findings of previous research on the board composition - firm performance relationship by revealing the mediating effects of board processes and task performance.",Board diversity; Board processes; Board task performance,Board characteristics; Board diversity; Empirical investigation; Firm Performance; Organizational performance; Service performance; Structural equation modeling; Task performance

Analyzing the patentable outcomes of technology-based firms during the 1990s as a function of the adoption of these restrictions indicates that certain levels of protection from the threat of takeover increases the inventive productivity of research and development expenditures, in terms of both the quantity and quality of patents. The results extend and enrich previous research findings regarding corporate governance and innovation.",Governance; Innovation; Patents,Commerce; Productivity; Shareholders; Corporate control; Corporate governance; Governance; Levels of protections; Market mechanisms; Patents; Research and development expenditure; Technology-based firms; Patents and inventions

This moment is referred to in this article as 'gender fatigue'. At the same time there is evidence that gender discrimination is still a feature of today's organisations and therefore a relevant topic for organisational studies. In this article it is argued that the positions of gender fatigue and the sustained relevance of gender pose ideological dilemmas for organisational members. An ideological dilemma refers to how individuals navigate between different reality constructions. This is explored through how information communication technology workers make sense of gender discrimination. Instead of just denying gender discrimination, workers used a complex pattern through which gender discrimination was disavowed. ICT workers commonly accept that gender discrimination can happen but they deny that it is a dominant feature of their working life. Gender discrimination is presented as a single event that happened in the past and which could not happen again. Gender discrimination was also constructed as something that individual women have to overcome. Thereby the onus is on women to make gender discrimination invisible. Gender discrimination is then individualistic and not a systemic pattern in organisations. The article thus provides insight into how the ideological dilemma of gender discrimination is dealt with in a climate of gender fatigue in organisations.",Discourse analysis; Discrimination; Gender,Discourse analysis; Discrimination; Gender; Gender discrimination; Gender diversity; Gender equality; Information communication technology; Organisational study

Extending prior research that emphasizes learning benefits from alliance partners, it uncovers how technological diversity among partners in a firm's alliance portfolio exerts both positive and negative effects on the knowledge acquisition outcome. Based on a panel data of 200 alliance portfolios of 169 firms spread across four time periods, we find that after controlling for the firm's internal technological scope and its technological distance with the alliance portfolio members, technological diversity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with knowledge acquisition from the alliance portfolio. We analyze the knowledge outcomes of alliance portfolios by deploying a two-stage model, thereby accounting for the endogeneity in firms' choices to form technologically diverse portfolios. Our findings reveal that firms tend to form technologically diverse portfolios as a mechanism to offset a narrow internal technological scope. However, even for firms with a broad internal technological scope, technological diversity of the portfolio has a non-monotonic relationship with knowledge acquisition. These findings advance alliance research by integrating learning theories with the resource-based view that emphasizes the importance of intangible resources with limited fungibility, and by demonstrating the tradeoffs of technological diversity as firms build alliance portfolios.",Alliance portfolio; Knowledge acquisition; Learning theory,Knowledge acquisition; Alliance portfolio; Intangible resources; Inter-firm alliances; Learning Theory; Positive and negative effect; Resource-based view; Technological distance; Two stage model; Engineering education

This paper develops new measures of supply risk and investigates how attributes of purchased direct materials and their associated supply markets affect purchasing managers' perceptions of the supply disruption risk their firms face. While supply chain research has advocated the increased use of behavioral approaches to supply risk mitigation, these types of strategies, such as supplier development, cost management and supplier relationship management activities, lack broad empirical testing because of a lack of measures, definitions, and empirically testable theory in the area of supply risk. We draw from behavioral risk theory and operationalize two dimensions of supply risk: probability and magnitude of supply disruption. We then develop a nomological network of supply risk based in transaction cost economic and resource dependence theories, and examine a three-stage model in which the probability and magnitude of supply disruption mediate the relationships between supply market and product attributes and perceptions of overall supply risk. We then test our theoretical model by applying structural equation modeling techniques on survey response data obtained from a sample of ISM buyers and purchasing managers. Ultimately, we find strong empirical support for our operationalization of supply risk. Furthermore, by contrasting our mediated behavioral model with a direct effects model, we find that our theoretical model explains twice the variance in overall supply risk versus alternative models that ignore behavioral effects. Finally, our findings highlight the complementary nature of transaction cost and resource dependence theories and indicate the importance of studying supply disruption risk from a multi-theoretical perspective.",Supply chain management; Supply disruptions; Supply risk,Commerce; Costs; Managers; Research and development management; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sales; Behavioral approaches; Resource dependences; Structural equation modeling techniques; Supplier relationship managements; Supply disruption; Supply risk; Theoretical modeling; Transaction cost economics; Supply chain management

We focus on unemployed women in the far south-eastern EU corner, and use the theory of planned behaviour as a basis to develop and validate empirically, through group interviews and mail questionnaires, a conceptual framework for this research. Through this framework we suggest that the interactions of different factors related to perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, and women's attitudes influence the intentions of women to adopt FWAs and their career aspirations. We find that women's intentions to work under FWAs, and aspirations, differ depending on each FWA as well as the factors relevant to them. Moreover, results show that the institutional and normative characteristics of the southern regime have profound influence on women's actual control of the behaviour, i.e. adopting FWAs, and therefore raise issues for employers and policy-makers, who need to become actively involved in fully integrating women in the labour market.",FWAs; Intentions; Women,Employment; Conceptual frameworks; FWAs; Intentions; Mail questionnaires; Model development; Perceived behavioural controls; Theory of planned behaviour; Women; Surveys

As a result, countries with seemingly similar formal regulations have very different hazards for investors. Departing from traditional studies that have focused on formal regulations to understand the hazards to investors, this paper analyzes the extent of de facto protection on the location choices of Multinational Corporations. Investors' perceptions about the hazards that they face in a host country are modified by de facto protection although large multinational firms can overcome poor de facto protection in a host country. They are able to do so either by transferring learning on managing poor institutions across their international operations or by their ability to arbitrage international location differences. Using a panel of 162 firms from 16 home countries and their foreign investments in 45 host countries in the information services offshoring sector from 2001-2005, the empirical results show that MNC location choices are impacted by de facto protection of a host country. The effects are also moderated by the extent of a firm's multinational operations.",,Hazards; Information services; Investments; Laws and legislation; Location; Foreign investment; Host countries; International operations; Location choice; Multi-national corporations; Multinational firms; Off-shoring; Property right; Developing countries

Data were gathered from 345 employees from various domains, performance was assessed by peer ratings. Analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships for promotion focus. Individuals high on promotion focus reacted more positively to positive feedback and showed higher levels of task performance and innovation when frequency of positive feedback was high. Overall, our study shows that feedback sign is not uniformly related to affective and performance-related outcomes in all individuals, but the relationship is contingent on an individual's self-regulatory focus.",Feedback; Innovation; Self-regulatory focus,Affective reactions; Feedback signs; Field studies; Job performance; Regulatory focus; Self-regulatory focus; Task performance; Feedback

In ¬¬Study 2, we replicated the measurement model in a separate sample (n = 115) and investigated the association between the completeness of leader apology and the physical health of aggrieved employees.

Our findings are surprising. Using data on R&D spending as a proxy for long-term orientation, we find no evidence that family firms per se invest more resources in long-term projects than non-family firms. However, analyzing a sample of family firms only, we find that family management is positively related to a higher level of R&D spending, whereas family ownership seems to have a negative impact. We conclude that both incentive and entrenchment effects matter when considering the long-term orientation of a family firm. Our empirical analy-sis is based on a Bayesian approach, which so far has only been rarely used in strategy research.

We show that purely psychological explanations are insufficient to account for these patterns. The findings imply that institutionalization can happen even in extremely undersocialized conditions and even in synthetic markets designed for high economic efficiency.",Experiment; Institutionalization; Market,Efficiency; Experiments; Financial markets; Marketing; Behavioral economics; Economic efficiency; Experimental methodology; High-efficiency; Institutionalization; Micro-foundation; Perfect informations; Psychological explanation; Commerce
Profits and pay at large U.S. corporations,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088181613&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33660403&partnerID=40&md5=188cd3938f1e7782c6b9edc4ce172cd8,"How much do large corporations pay workers? And how do corporations pay workers - is their pay tied to the corporations' profits? Using firm-level data from 304 large U.S. corporations for the period of 1992-2005, I tested hypotheses on organizational factors that determine the level of pay and changes in pay for average workers in corporations. The results of the level of pay suggest that firms with greater profits do not necessarily pay workers more, contrary to what economists would expect. Consistent with the hypotheses drawn from organizational theories, firms managed by CEOs with functional backgrounds in finance, longer tenure at the job, or appointment from outside the organization tend to pay workers less. Regarding how changes in pay are related to changes in company profits, the results do not support the financial economists' argument; the pay-performance relationship is not stronger in firms in which top managers or institutional investors own a larger proportion of shares than in other firms in which managers have considerable discretion in controlling the organization. The results support the hypothesis that firms with CFOs have a closer pay-performance relationship.",CEO; Compensation; Corporation,Compensation (personnel); Industry; Investments; Managers; Institutional investors; Organizational factors; Organizational theory; Top managers; Profitability

To that end, we focus on a specific corporate activity, namely Corporate Venture Capital (CVC, describing minority equity investment by established firms in entrepreneurial ventures). The setting offers an opportunity to compare corporate practices to those of investment experts, the independent VCs. We observe disparity between the number of participants in venture capital syndicates that involve a corporate investor, and those that consist solely of independent VCs. The differences persist after controlling for numerous factors including CVC's objectives. The disparity shrinks substantially, however, for a subset of CVC programs that compensate their personnel using performance-pay (e.g. carried interest). We find a parallel pattern when analyzing the relationship between compensation and another investment practice, staging of investment. These empirical patterns provide direct evidence that compensation schemes critically shape the risk preferences of corporate personnel and hence affect the investment practices they undertake. We conjecture that the deviation from VCs' 'best practice' is due mainly to idiosyncratic corporate compensation schemes.",Entrepreneurship; Innovation incentives; Venture capital,Personnel; Compensation scheme; Corporate venture capital; Entrepreneurship; Equity investment; Innovation incentives; Parallel patterns; Venture Capital; Venture capitalists; Investments

We conceptualize uncertainty as a multidimensional construct, and focus our analysis on the entrepreneurs' likelihood of exploiting an opportunity by going forward with a new product launch given varying combinations of state, effect and response uncertainty. As conventional wisdom suggests, generally we find that the entrepreneurs' willingness to exploit declines moving from low to high levels of uncertainty. However, we also find that the 'type' of uncertainty matters; response uncertainty represents the most impactful impediment to opportunity exploitation. Further, we find evidence that the magnitude of the exploitation (i.e. small, incremental launch vs. broad, large-scale launch) significantly moderates the relationship between the entrepreneurs' willingness to act and uncertainty, suggesting that entrepreneurs may prefer uncertainty reduction strategies, to profit maximizing ones. We discuss implications and insights from our finding for both theory and practice.",Entrepreneurial decision-making; Opportunity; Uncertainty,Decision making; Conjoint analysis; Entrepreneurial action; Low-to-high; Opportunity; Product launch; Theory and practice; Uncertainty; Uncertainty reduction; Uncertainty analysis

However, there is little empirical evidence regarding the impact that volunteers make on hospital performance. Since the 1990s, hospitals in the United States have had a great deal of pressure to produce high quality care at minimum expense. These pressures have enhanced the benefits of using volunteers in a hospital setting. This study utilized multiple regression analysis to explore the impact of volunteers and the professionalism of the volunteer function on cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction in hospitals. Hospitals throughout the state of Florida were invited to participate in the study by completing a brief questionnaire about their volunteer programs. Performance indicators of volunteer cost savings and patient satisfaction scores for 50 Florida hospitals were analyzed using American Hospital Association and Agency for Health Care Administration data sets along with data obtained from a questionnaire. Results indicate that the use of volunteers offer significant cost savings to hospitals. Furthermore, the assignment of volunteers in patient settings can enhance a hospitalâ€™s patient satisfaction scores. Future research opportunities related to the impact of volunteers and volunteer professionalism on other performance measures as well as managerial implications are suggested.",Hospitals; Performance; Volunteerism,Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Health care; Regression analysis; Surveys; Hospital performance; Managerial implications; Multiple regression analysis; Patient satisfaction; Performance; Performance indicators; Research opportunities; Volunteerism; Hospitals

Novel technologies can disrupt existing structures and lead to the creation of new market categories, but sometimes technical novelty does not disturb the current system. When does technical novelty disrupt the market and lead to new organizational categories? I argue that this depends on whether the existing structure is more or less constraining to organizations. To the extent that categories constrain members, they also provide contrast within the environment. The combination of constraint and contrast makes existing categories less accommodating to novel invention. I propose that organizations that are both different in their knowledge creation and in constraining categories are likely to create a new category. However, for those that are inventing differently, being in a less constraining category will decrease the likelihood that a firm will attempt to create a new category. I study these ideas in the context of the software industry, for the years 1990-2002. I use patent data to identify novel invention, and create a data set using software press releases to identify market categorization. Results support hypotheses. Firms that are unique in their knowledge development are more likely to create or join new market categories only when the existing category structure is constraining. When existing categories lack constraint, technological difference does not make firms more likely to join new categories.",Categories; Innovation; Markets,Commerce; Marketing; Public relations; Software engineering; Categories; Data set; Existing structure; Knowledge creations; Knowledge development; Patent datum; Press release; Software industry; Patents and inventions

Survey data from 62 additional innovation teams in six other pharmaceutical firms are used, first, to test the measurement model using structural equation modeling, and second, to test the relationships between external learning activities and team performance using random effects regression models. Results show that contextual learning activities are positively associated with performance, as are vicarious learning activities when combined with internal learning activities. Vicarious learning activities in the absence of sufficient amounts of internal learning activities, on the other hand, can hurt team performance. The paper contributes by distinguishing between two kinds of external learning activities and showing that they put different demands on teams to be effective. This is important because it helps us better understand how teams engage effectively in learning activities across their boundaries.",Field study; Team learning; Team performance,Random processes; Regression analysis; Contextual learning; Field studies; Multi-method field study; Pharmaceutical firms; Structural equation modeling; Team learning; Team performance; Vicarious learning; Learning systems

Because employees are particularly sensitive to the breaking of implicitly-made promises (i.e., psychological contract breach), we explore measures that organizations can take to ameliorate employees' negative responses. We hypothesise that supervisory relationships, mentoring relationships, and role model relationships will moderate employee responses to such psychological contract breach. Our results indicate that supportive supervisory relationships and mentoring relationships reduce the negative relationship between breach and employee beliefs that the organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being. However, employees who maintained relationships with role models had lower perceived organizational support in response to psychological contract breach, possibly because they believe that role models' psychological contracts are fulfilled.

Findings demonstrated differences between European-Canadians and Chinese participants in the importance of contextual and individual variables in predicting feedback-seeking intentions. In particular, European-Canadians were motivated to seek feedback when it was positive versus negative (feedback valence), whereas Beijing Chinese participants did not prefer to seek either positive or negative feedback. Further, ego-defensiveness predicted the relationship between feedback valence and feedback-seeking intentions for European-Canadians, whereas the motive did not predict the relationship for any of the Chinese groups. Results indicated that both European-Canadians and Chinese participants were less likely to seek feedback when feedback seeking occurred in public; however defensive impression management was more predictive of the relationship between the publicness of feedback and feedback-seeking intentions for Chinese participants. Findings also revealed cultural differences in the propensity to seek feedback from different sources. Namely, European-Canadians were significantly more likely than Chinese participants to seek feedback from a supervisor versus a peer. Moreover, the relationship between feedback source and feedback-seeking intentions was predicted by power distance for both Chinese-Canadian (bicultural)and Beijing Chinese participants, whereas power distance did not predict this relationship for European-Canadians. Overall, these findings provide evidence for motivational differences in the propensity to seek performance feedback.

Political business cycle (""PBC"") theory suggests that incumbent politicians, particularly incumbent politicians with a left-wing orientation, have incentives to implement expansionary economic policies during election years even if such policies impair sovereign government finances and creditworthiness afterwards. Electoral rivalry and the PBC-related economic policies it prompts increases risk to firms, but strategy research suggests that this increase will be moderated due to rivalry among firms in the same DC market segment. We test hypotheses derived from this integrative theoretical framework with a sample of 458 ratings of sovereign government creditworthiness published by five major credit rating agencies for 18 DCs holding 35 presidential elections from 1987-2000. We find that: 1) agency ratings decrease during election years in DCs with left-wing incumbents; but 2) this electoral rivalry effect on risk diminishes as the number of agencies vying for DC rating business increases. Market rivalry among agencies and, perhaps, other firms doing business in DCs can negate risk effects related to electoral rivalry among politicians.",Developing countries; Elections; Sovereign risk,Commerce; Competition; Developing countries; Planning; Economic policies; Elections; Electoral politics; Market competition; Presidential election; Sovereign risks; Strategy research; Theoretical framework; Risk assessment

First, they make it attractive to join a network with a large installed base. Second, they make it attractive for network members to actively recruit new members. Despite indications that this ""peer effect"" can be more important for network growth than the installed-base effect, it has so far been largely ignored in the literature. We aim at closing this gap, using both survey data and a game-theoretical model. Comparing respondents' adoption of two distinct networks goods, we find that the peer effect matters strongly for small, but not for large networks. Results from model analysis support this finding. Under conservative assumptions, the increase in network size due to the peer effect is by an additive constant - which, for small networks, can amount to a large relative increase. The difference between small, local, and personal networks and large, global, anonymous networks thus arises endogenously from our model. In the duopoly case, we find that introducing the peer effect favors winner-take-all outcomes. We use the examples of the Internet services, Skype and eBay, for our empirical analysis and as illustration of our theoretical findings. Since many network goods give rise to small, local networks, our findings are highly relevant for the management of network goods and the social networks they can give rise to.",Network markets; Peer influence; Technology adoption,Game theory; Anonymous Networks; Empirical analysis; Game theoretical models; Internet services; Network externality; Network markets; Peer influence; Technology adoption; Commerce

Psychological change climate as a crucial catalyst of readiness for change,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085400061&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33661178&partnerID=40&md5=321fedf222ad0c2d2aea2b605c9f3f08,"The aim of this inquiry was to explore the relationship between psychological change climate (i.e. trust in top management, history of change, participation in decision making, and quality of change communication) and readiness for change. By means of a large scale survey administered in 53 Flemish public and private sector organizations, we collected in total 1,559 responses. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. A positively perceived change history, participation in decision making and high quality change communication had positive correlations with trust in top management. Trust in top management did not mediate the relationships between those three change climate dimensions and the outcome variables (i.e. emotional, cognitive and intentional readiness for change). In addition, it was found that history of change and quality of change communication shaped organizational members' emotional and cognitive readiness for change. The complex interplay between people's cognitions, feelings, and their intentions about organizational change confirms the need to consider readiness for change as a multidimensional construct. To conclude, this paper elaborates on how these findings match the extant literature on organizational development and change.",Context and process factors of change; Psychological change climate; Readiness for change,Behavioral research; Decision making; Context and process factors of changes; Organizational change; Organizational development; Positive correlations; Psychological change climate; Public and private sector; Readiness for change; Structural equation modeling; Climate change
Innovation tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Toward a collective paradox frame,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399945&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33649824&partnerID=40&md5=0caa01af0680685e1f989fe66bd599f9,"Coping with contradictory logics of exploration and exploitation demands organizational ambidexterity. While a mindset of experimentation and imagination fuels radical innovation, specialization and incremental improvements help leverage existing products, respectively. Yet most studies of ambidexterity investigate supportive structures and strategies, rather than underlying mindsets. Cognition research stresses that such tensions pose cognitive conflict, but rarely examines how actors frame tensions. To bridge this gap, we conducted an inductive study of five, ambidextrous firms. Examining the language of innovation throughout and across these leading product design firms, we identified two, robust patterns. First, actors embraced nested innovation tensions, valuing breakthroughs and profit, individuality and collaboration, and passion and discipline as synergistic and energizing. Second, a healthy fear seemed to revolve around dangers of single-mindedness. In sum, we theorize that a shared paradox frame may enable ambidextrous exploration and exploitation, and we pose directions for future research.",Cognition; Innovation; Organizational ambidexterity,Cognition; Exploration and exploitation; Incremental improvements; Organizational ambidexterity; Radical innovation; Robust patterns; Product design

Specifically, is our field so obsessed with theory that our research is incapable of adding value to practice, perhaps placing our very legitimacy at risk? As we approach the 50 year anniversaries of both the Academy of Management and the Ford and Carnegie foundation reports that spurred management to become a scientific discipline, the timing may be more than appropriate to examine this challenge. In this study, we test whether academic research adds value for the graduates of our business schools. Our findings from a 6 year sample of panel data of 155 major ranked business schools suggest that business school research generally enhances the long-term earnings prospects for students. However, significant curvilinearity characterized this relationship, such that the highest levels of research intensity may fail to add value for students. We conclude that balance in business school research activities may be warranted, and that a potential resolution to the challenge may be to offer businesses research benefits that are more direct such as more descriptive research on managerial processes, analysis of the potential causes of business failures, as well as prescriptive research on differentiation strategies.",Business schools; Rankings; Research,Plant shutdowns; Research; Academic research; Business schools; Differentiation strategies; Management journals; Management research; Rankings; Research activities; Scientific discipline; Students

The results indicate that persons in a situ-ational setting that allows them to hope that the partner will respond in a cooperative manner, show a higher degree of cooperation when communicating in a personal way and interacting with someone from their own group. Furthermore, external stimuli (communication and group membership) mainly affect individually-oriented persons (i.e. those who have a low degree of collective orientation).

This question has been identified as a central issue in entrepreneurship research (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000b). In this paper I use data from the emergence of the cable industry in Canada to theorize the social processes by which some early cable entrepreneurs came to recognize the opportunity to apply cable technology for the distribution of television services and how a subset proceeded to successfully transform the initial recognition into the creation of profit generating opportunities. The theorization of opportunity constitution frequently implies that it is a socially frictionless process. The analysis presented in this paper attempts to redress this oversight by introducing social processes into the conceptualization of opportunity. I argue that potential entrepreneurs must make a substantial investment in institutional work (Lawrence & Suddaby, 2006) to overcome the subjective, social and institutional barriers that impede the successful constitution of a new opportunity. Using the concepts of habitus, symbolic violence (Bourdieu, 1985; 1989; 1998) and structuration (Giddens, 1984) I theorize opportunity constitution as a social process. I conclude that opportunity recognition/creation is not an individual event but a multi-stage social process with at least a subjective moment and a moment of action, and in some cases, a collective moment and a public moment; a process that frequently unintentionally or intentionally de-institutionalizes the institutional and social structures of previously established fields.",Bourdieu; Entrepreneurship; Opportunity recognition,Bourdieu; Cable industry; Entrepreneurship; Institutional barriers; Opportunity recognition; Social process; Social structure; Substantial investments; Cables

A second sample of MBA students then judged the behaviors to identify similarities among the activities. Similar PWU activities grouped together in a matrix and we analyzed this matrix using multidimensional scaling techniques and cluster analysis to identity common dimensions among the PWU activities. The results suggest four clusters of PWU activities: work/family, hedonic, self-development, and citizenship. Using a third sample of web users, we confirmed the PWU cluster labels and corresponding definitions.

Does nationality matter in transnational teams?

Distinguishing person-based from position-based differences, we theorize that nationality differences impede knowledge seeking across cultures as well as geographies, due to biases that deter knowledge seeking from team members who are different. Beyond nationality differences, however, we propose that demographic differences and structural differences also create barriers to knowledge seeking within transnational teams. While prior research has examined diversity among transnational team members at the group level of analysis, we use hierarchical linear modeling to study 13,540 dyadic interactions among 2,059 members of 276 teams in a large multinational corporation. Our findings reveal that cultural, geographic, and demographic differences all matter, but that structural differences create the greatest barriers to knowledge seeking among team members. The results further show that working together on a previous team can mitigate the negative effects of member differences, indicating that increased mutual knowledge can reduce the biases that deter knowledge seeking. Our discussion emphasizes that formal organizational structure shapes collaboration more fundamentally than the distinctive cultural and geographic features of transnational teams that preoccupy most current studies, and we address additional implications for theory and research.",Knowledge sharing; Multinational organizations; Transnational teams,Dyadic interaction; Hierarchical linear modeling; Knowledge-sharing; Multi-national corporations; Multinational organizations; Organizational structures; Structural differences; Transnational teams; Population statistics

We follow the earnings evolution of former business owners using a longitudinal matched employer-employee data set, comparing experiences in business ownership with experiences in paid employment. In order to capture the effect of previous business owner experience on wages we apply three estimation strategies. First, we estimate wage levels equations pooling the yearly data. With this specification we capture the average effects of the regressors. However, the wage distribution can also play a role here. Therefore we use quantile regressions in order to capture the effects along the wage distribution. Finally, as we have longitudinal data, we use the fact that we can follow individuals to estimate a fixed effects equation. We find that ex-business owners face a 'wage penalty' when only individual variables are accounted; however, a wage premium emerges when the employing firm characteristics are considered. However, when we estimate the wage equation including the employee hierarchical position, the return for former business owner experience is lower than the return for employee experience. The fact that former business owners are disproportionately assigned to the top hierarchical levels and hold lower tenure shows that ex-business owners capture a wage premium through better career prospects.",,Commerce; Employment; Business owners; Business ownership; Career prospects; Estimation strategies; Hierarchical level; Longitudinal data; Quantile regression; Wage equation; Wages

We subsequently demonstrate that the market for this new technology evolved in a pattern that correlates with the theorization of the new technology, where theorization refers to widely held beliefs about the inherent benefits of this technology. Through analytical induction, we identify three types of continuities that seem to explain why the two markets, initially very similar, developed very differently in the two cases. They are technological continuity, resource continuity, and administrative continuity.

A dynamic theory of technology commercialization strategy,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087224449&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33622309&partnerID=40&md5=960ed3f00d4ff620c663a1e68172abc8,"A critical strategic decision facing a start-up firm with a technological innovation is how to access the financial resources and commercialization capabilities necessary to bring a product to market. The prior literature on commercialization strategy (Teece, 1986; Gans & Stern, 2003a) has focused on a one-off choice between contracting with an established firm to perform the commercialization activities and integrating downstream into the supply chain and commercializes its technology itself. It predicts that when the start-up firm has strong appropriability over its innovation but the established firms have tight control over the complementary assets the optimal arrangement is for the start-up firm to enter into a contracting (or licensing) arrangement with an established firm, relying on the latter to perform the commercialization tasks. However, while these conditions clearly prevail in the biopharmaceutical industry (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2000) and alliance arrangements are the predominant arrangement for commercializing this technology (Pisano, Shan, & Teece, 1988), the empirical evidence reveals that start-up biotech firms frequently increasingly seek to participate in the commercialization of the alliance product (known as co-development or co-promotion) and integrate downstream into marketing and distribution. In order to explain this pattern of arrangements, this paper develops a dynamic theory of technology commercialization strategy which introduces elements of organizational learning into the original theory of technology commercialization strategy. It argues that the start-up technology firms use their leverage in alliances with established product firms to acquire the specific knowledge about the downstream activities needed to build their own complementary assets. This in turn enables them to weaken the established firms' tight control over those assets and thereby appropriate more value from future innovations. It uses the theory to derive predictions for when a biotech firm is more likely to choose a hybrid arrangement, and tests these predictions on a dataset of 565 alliances between biotech and pharmaceutical firms from 1992-2006. The paper has implications not only for technology commercialization strategy, but also for our understanding of alliance arrangements and for industry dynamics.",Alliances; Biotech; Technology commercialization,Biotechnology; Commerce; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Statistical tests; Supply chains; Alliances; Biopharmaceutical industry; Biotech; Complementary assets; Organizational learning; Pharmaceutical firms; Technological innovation; Technology commercializations; Technology transfer
Chunky vs. Incremental growth: How to expand a search domain,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087223596&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33630402&partnerID=40&md5=67103df39298bcca30baeb6c8290410e,"As the number of interdependent decisions under a firm's purview grows, how should a firm structure this growth in order to reach high performance? For instance, should a component maker transform itself into a supplier of complex systems by slowly adding components one-by-one or by tackling the entire system in an integrated approach from the very beginning? This is but one instance of a general class of problems in design and strategy, in which decision makers need to find good solutions to a growing, complex set of decisions. To shed light on this problem, we use an agent-based simulation model to probe into the effects of growing a search domain in different ways. Our results make a case for growth by incremental steps: when dealing with a highly interdependent system, expanding a search domain step by step rather than in large chunks, or attempting to optimize an integrated system in its entirety, yields a distinct advantage in system performance. Furthermore, we find that it is more advisable to initially add larger chunks and then make small additions to a system, rather than starting small and adding larger chunks later.

What determines a ""good match"" between academic scientists and firms that seek to apply basic research for commercialization? To answer the question, this paper models firm-scientist alliance formation as an endogenous matching process driven by the synergy in knowledge-creation capabilities of the partners. The model is then applied to empirically investigate whether and when attributes such as knowledge breadth and depth, scientific and technological capabilities are complements or substitutes in knowledge creation. This study contributes to the management literature by introducing a model of alliance formation that explicitly addresses the endogeneity problem created by the self-selection of the partners into alliances. It also identifies the set of complementary capabilities required for a successful cross-organizational research relationship.",,Academic entrepreneurship; Academic scientists; Cross-organizational; Research collaborations; Technological capability; Technological opportunity; University research; University-industry research collaborations

As a result of this process, clusters of entrepreneurial activity tend to develop around a few strong parent firms. But do all spin-offs really stay close to home? In this article, we investigate which firms choose to stay nearby and which tend to leave. We test the predictive power of existing theories of location choice, and we develop a new theory particular to spin-off firms. We demonstrate that spin-off firms choose heterogeneous technological and market strategies, and we hypothesize that firms with more aggressive strategies have a greater need to maintain relationships that allow access to knowledge and facilitate coordination with complementors. We find supporting evidences of our arguments by analyzing the location and strategy decisions of intra-industry spin-offs in the disk drive industry.",Location; Spinoff; Strategy,Close proximity; Entrepreneurial activity; Location choice; Market strategies; Predictive power; Spinoff; Strategy; Strategy decision; Location

The present study, using a corporate governance lens, examines the impact of heterogeneous interests of owners on mergers and acquisitions outcomes. In particular we look at how overlapping ownership, i.e. when owners have a stake in both the acquiring and the target firms, impacts the M&A gains of the acquirer. The empirical results suggest that when more institutional owners of the acquiring firm simultaneously hold stock in the target company, acquiring firms are more likely to destroy shareholder value through M&A deals; this effect however is constrained by stronger board control.",Corporate governance; Institutional ownership; Mergers & acquisitions,Industrial management; Shareholders; Corporate governance; Institutional ownerships; Shareholder values; Mergers and acquisitions
A relational model of high performance work systems,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059559202&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33622315&partnerID=40&md5=9e853daaaae9e70e503f8fe209066217,"In this paper we explore a causal mechanism through which high performance work systems influence performance outcomes. We propose a model in which a particular type of high performance work system - a relational work system - enhances organizational performance by creating a framework that encourages the development of social capital between employees who perform distinct functions. In a nine-hospital study of patient care, we show that the adoption of a relational work system predicts high levels of social capital among doctors, nurses, physical therapists, social workers and case managers in the form of relational coordination, in turn predicting quality and efficiency outcomes for patients. Results suggest that this social capital model of high performance work systems is a promising counterpart to models that focus on employee skills or commitment, and further suggest the potential for relational work systems to recognize and support the interdependent nature of work.",High performance work systems; Relational coordination; Social capital,Employee skills; High Performance Work Systems; Organizational performance; Performance outcome; Relational coordination; Relational Model; Social capitals; Social workers; Human resource management

We examine how firms' ability to manage such changes depends on their governance strategies, their knowledge of components, and the nature of technological change. Using data on all firms in the DRAM industry across 12 technology transitions from 1974 to 2005, we find that vertically integrating into component production improves firms' ability to manage technology transitions. Although non-integrated firms have lower performance, this effect is muted by the firms' component knowledge. Moreover, the relative advantage of extending production vs. knowledge boundaries is determined by two factors. The first is the nature of technological change - integrated firms have a greater advantage over non-integrated firms when innovation is architectural than when it is incremental. The second is the degree of integration - non-integrated firms derive greater benefit from their knowledge of external components than do integrated firms. Our results clarify the conditions under which extending knowledge boundaries can be a substitute for extending production boundaries in managing technological change.",Firm boundaries; Innovation; Technological change,Competitive advantage; DRAM industries; External components; Firm boundaries; Knowledge boundaries; Product innovation; Technological change; Technology transition; Competition

A growing literature spanning multiple disciplines indicates most actors' selfish utility maximizing behaviors are bounded by norms of fairness. Rather than being purely self interested, people behave reciprocally by rewarding others' actions they deem fair and willingly incurring costs to punish those they deem unfair. Economists show that employers who are perceived distributionally fair by their employees generate comparatively more value due to the positively reciprocal behavior of those employees. The organizational justice literature distinguishes two additional types of fairness assessed by employees. Drawing from both of these bodies of work, we employ stakeholder theory to propose how perceptions of fairness result in reciprocity (1) extending to all stakeholders of the firm and (2) affecting value creation at the firm level.",Stakeholder theory; Value creation,Firm Performance; Multiple disciplines; Stakeholder theory; Strategic management; Value creation; Personnel

Researchers from one tradition emphasize its constructive role in improving performance. Those from a second dispute this and emphasize its destructive effects on outcomes like satisfaction. I argue that this divergence primarily reflects narrow theoretical conceptions of conflict by each that are easily reconciled. An integrative model is proposed which describes the transformation of conflict over time and source using Pondy's (1967) stage model and the task versus relationship conflict distinction (Jehn, 1995). Latent task conflicts are those substantive differences among team members that generate superior collective outcomes. These are imperfectly perceived by members, which in turn may generate perceptions of relationship conflict. Perceived conflicts have little effect on performance but important consequences for satisfaction. Initial empirical support for the model was strong. In a natural experiment, teams with genuine task conflicts outperformed those without. However, there was little correlation between actual and perceived conflicts, and by extension little correlation between perceived conflicts and performance. Perceived task conflicts were positively associated with perceived relationship conflicts. Controlling for the latter, perceived task conflicts were unrelated to team satisfaction and actually increased individual satisfaction. The results underscore the importance of multiple levels of analysis. Most important, they replicate and integrate the empirical findings of two diverse research traditions under a unified conceptual model.",Conflict; Experiment; Multilevel,Conflict; Destructive effects; Improving performance; Integrative modeling; Multilevel; Organizational conflict; Relationship conflicts; Research traditions; Experiments

With the product name providing a legitimacy shield, genre spanning helps reduce audience satiation and leads to higher performance of the product. In addition to the legitimacy shield function, the product name can also be manipulated to a certain extent and different naming strategies can be used to achieve distinctiveness. An analysis of film sequels released in the US market between 1982 and 2007 largely corroborated these propositions. The findings also indicate that the differentiation through genre spanning and naming strategies is more beneficial for the focal film sequel when the previous film in the same film series performs worse.",Film industry; Genre spanning; Naming strategies,Film industry; Genre spanning; Naming strategies; Product name; US markets

Using archival data from the motion picture effects industry, the study finds that overall experience, which reduces buyer uncertainty, appear to play a greater role in offshore supply relationships than shared experience between buyer and supplier. Major projects intended for global audiences are more likely to go offshore. Visual effects, which require close coordination with the rest of the project are less likely to be sourced from offshore than special effects, despite the fact that visual effects are more highly modular and more likely to be produced digitally.",Motion pictures; Offshore; Outsourcing,Motion pictures; Offshore oil well production; Outsourcing; Sales; Supply chains; Creative industries; Creative projects; Offshore; Offshore suppliers; Offshore supply; Shared experiences; Supply chain governances; Transaction cost economics; Costs

Moreover, the majority of academic CSR research focuses on evidences from developed countries, largely overlooking the cues from developing economies. Therefore, the addition of CSR viewpoints from an emerging economy can contribute invaluable insights to the growing body of scholarly work in this realm. This paper addresses this research gap by exploring CSR from an Indian perspective. Based on the Indian pharmaceutical industry, four case studies are complemented with 40 supplementary interviews with top management personnel within the industry. The results clearly suggest that the Indian perspective and practice of CSR differ significantly from the West. Three essential elements of the Western conceptualization of CSR - stakeholder pressure, environmental concerns and integration into core business are absent in India. Instead, the Indian CSR perceptions and practices seem to stem from the Gandhi's social trusteeship ideology, which perceives businesses as social development agents. The companies primarily focus their CSR activities on their employees, followed by the employees' families and the community. This finding adds to the debate of CSR conceptualization by highlighting the influence of the local context. This paper argues that the cultural heritage of corporate philanthropy and the current economic needs of social advancement shape the CSR practices in India. It thus calls for sensitivity to CSR's contextual idiosyncrasies, and opines against undifferentiated application of Western CSR concepts that ignore the local cultural context.",CSR; India,Economic and social effects; Corporate philanthropies; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Developed countries; Developing economies; Environmental concerns; India; Pharmaceutical industry; Stakeholder pressures; Human resource management

However, interpretation of this work is clouded by a long-standing critique of the institutional ecology approach - that its results are potentially biased by the failure to account for the endogeneity of public policy formation. This paper examines the implications of this critique for institutional ecology by explicitly modeling the potential endogeneity of state life insurance policy in the dynamics of the early American life insurance population. It finds strong evidence of endogeneity and demonstrates that the true effects of public policy on organizational populations are only evident when such endogeneity is accounted for.

Measuring SRBC as a differentiated concept, however, importantly clarified the relationship between religion and SRBC, by showing significant but opposing influences of religion on various types of SRBC. In particular, traditional religious executives contributed more to SRBC in terms of charity but less to SRBC with respect to the internal stakeholders, providing equal opportunities to minorities and women, and the ecological environment.",Business; Religion; Responsible,Business conduct; Ecological environments; Empirical research; Equal opportunity; Highly-correlated; Religion; Responsible; Industry

Calls have been made to study how firms change their capabilities, the issue that received less theoretical and empirical attention. The question we explore in this study is how do firms transform their capabilities through knowledge-intensive acquisitions? We focus on a specific capability as unit of analysis and employ the approach of theory building from multiple cases. We find that capability transformation involves a continuous iteration of knowledge leveraging and interest alignment mechanisms converging around a set of practices critical to capability, which we conceptualize as boundary practices. We generate propositions that suggest that knowledge leveraging and interest alignment mechanisms have a multiplicative joint effect on capability transformation mediated by the level of agreement about the boundary set of practices. The present study has implications to the literature on dynamic capabilities and to the broader literature on competitive advantage and resource-based view. By conceptualizing knowledge leveraging and interest alignment mechanisms and specifying their role in capability transformation, we contribute to developing a better link between the potential advantage derived from the availability of knowledge and how it translates into actual performance.

We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications.",Globally distributed teams; Offshoring; Work practice,Exploratory research; Globally-distributed teams; Grounded theory; Off-shoring; Professional identity; Qualitative study; Virtual works; Work practices; Human resource management

As a result, workplace communication is becoming fully mobile and essentially fully synchronous, enabling organization employees to remain connected to the workplace from any location, at any time. Prior researchers have examined the antecedents of technology adoption and use, but little empirical research has been done on the use of wireless email and telephony devices. We therefore conducted an organizational survey to investigate the situational and individual correlates of workplace connectivity behavior (CB). Data from 141 full-time working adults revealed that CB was significantly related to the distribution of a wireless email device by one's organization, organizational norms, and individual difference variables related to orientations around time and work, including polychronicity and role integration preference.",Polychronicity; Role integration preference; Technology,Empirical research; Hand held device; Individual Differences; Polychronicity; Role integration preference; Technology adoption; Workplace communication; Electronic mail

The research is based on a qualitative and inductive analysis of 73 semi-structured interviews with US and UK employees, in a multinational pharmaceutical company. This article offers a typology of the seven distinct outcomes of the initiatives that have been identified, as well as a decision tree to understand the processes by which the same set of initiatives impacts employees so differently. While the outcomes are positive for almost two thirds of the sample (loyalty, pride, calculated appreciation and use as management tools), some are negative (disappointment/resentment, obligation to stay), and one is neutral (indifference). The key factors explaining this broad range of outcomes are (a) awareness of the initiatives, (b) degree of need for them, (c) access to them, and (d) the employee's judgment of the employer. Although these findings are partially explained by theoretical frameworks currently applied in the work-life field, such as perceived organizational support, others clearly call for new theoretical foundations.",Commitment; Resilience; Work-life,Decision trees; Commitment; Perceived organizational supports; Pharmaceutical company; Resilience; Semi structured interviews; Theoretical foundations; Theoretical framework; Work life; Personnel

Situational factors have been the primary focus of burnout researchers, but personal factors impact perception of and reaction to situational factors. Accordingly, we advocate an interactionist model to provide a more comprehensive explanation of burnout among entrepreneurs. We hypothesized that conscientiousness compensates for neuroticism to enable self-employed entrepreneurs cope more effectively with constraints, thereby minimizing burnout. As expected, we found a significant three-way interaction among our three predictors. The strongest positive relationship between neuroticism and burnout was among low-conscientious entrepreneurs facing many constraints. We propose that coping is the central explanation behind this finding. Specifically, in the absence of conscientiousness, neurotic entrepreneurs cope less effectively with constraints and subsequently experience more burnout. However, if they also have conscientious characteristics, which are associated with productive coping styles, entrepreneurs can deal more effectively with constraints and more successfully avoid burnout. Past research suggests a strong relationship between personality and coping, particularly in high stress situations (Connor-Smith & Flachsbart, 2007). We extend these findings and suggest that personality interacts with the situation by determining coping strategies and subsequent burnout. Personality and situational factors should perhaps both be considered in burnout research and burnout-reduction interventions, particularly for self-employed entrepreneurs.",Burnout; Entrepreneur; Personality,Burnout; Coping strategies; Entrepreneur; Personality; Self employment; Situation modeling; Situational factors; Three-way interactions

As the intellectual property landscape has become more complex and characterized by patent thickets and ownership fragmentation and as patents are increasingly uncertain in scope and strength, scholars have argued over the detrimental impacts on follow-on innovation. Another argument highlights the positive effects of patenting on public research. These debates collide when we consider patents on human genes. Little evidence exists to adjudicate the pros and cons of gene patents even as U.S. Congressional Bills propose their ban. Using a sample of matched gene patents and papers we find that patenting impedes follow-on use of gene papers by 5-17%. The effect increases in the patent scope, thicket and with ownership fragmentation and disease association.

Initially presented as spontaneous and self-organizing processes, recent studies describe communities as amenable to manipulation and suggest a governance approach that balances autonomy and control. This paper presents a process model of governance in communities of practice, focusing on the question of how organizations combine different governance mechanisms for a balanced management of these emergent structures. Drawing on data from an inductive study of 16 communities in nine organizations, we reveal three governance patterns, each associated with different learning processes and representing a different path towards a balance between autonomy and control: (1) expanding communities focused on recombining bodies of knowledge supported by a governance pattern that achieves balance within multiple governance mechanisms; (2) leveraging communities dedicated to knowledge replication supported by a governance pattern that combines strong technical authority with low disciplinary authority; and (3) probing communities focused on exploring new knowledge supported by a governance pattern that replaces direct control with indirect nurturing of the community's routines. This paper contributes to organizational control theory by revealing the different governance patterns deployed to balance autonomy and control in communities of practice. It also contributes to organization learning and design theories by revealing different learning processes and the related organizational features that constitute the three types of communities of practice.",Communities of practice; Organizational control; Organizational learning,Knowledge management; Balanced management; Communities of Practice; Emergent structure; Governance mechanisms; Organization learning; Organizational controls; Organizational learning; Self organizing process; Control theory

Enhancing nurse job satisfaction: The importance of a servant leader orientation in health care management,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086492243&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33641731&partnerID=40&md5=de7775d7e99f10aad83d7b3e261cad30,"Ensuring a quality nursing workforce for the future in a time of increasing labor shortage and declining nurse satisfaction is a key challenge to the health care industry. Understanding what impacts job satisfaction is vital to solving the problem of nurse attrition (Fletcher, 2001). While many studies have examined nurse satisfaction at the individual level of analysis, this study empirically tests the impact of nurse managers' servant leadership orientation on nurse job satisfaction. Nursing is a unique occupation in that it requires both competence in professional service as well as compassion in patient caregiving. While many service occupations exist, nursing is one of the few to have such a high expectation of personal and relational care for the one that is served. We suggest that this element of care requires additional expectations of managers who supervise in-patient nursing staff. Statistical findings of this study provide evidence that behaviors and attitudes of the nurse manager do impact job satisfaction both individually and within the work group as a whole. Departments where managers had higher servant leadership orientation not only demonstrated significant positive impact on individual employee job satisfaction, but the managerial orientation also impacted group job satisfaction. In addition, there is some indication that this servant leader orientation might ultimately be an important predictor of higher unit productivity based on organizational measures such as personnel turnover and patient care.",Emotional labor; Job satisfaction; Servant leadership,Human resource management; Job satisfaction; Managers; Emotional labors; Health-care managements; Healthcare industry; Individual levels; Personnel turnover; Professional services; Servant leadership; Statistical finding; Nursing

Failures in cross-functional product development teams (CFPDTs) are often attributed to a team's inability to capitalize on their diversity. In this study we develop and test a model based on the representational gaps perspective (Cronin & Weingart, 2007; Weingart, Cronin, Houser, Cagan, & Vogel, 2005) to determine factors that promote or limit creativity in CFPDTs. In particular we examine how representational gaps and cognitive and affective integration in CFPDTs affect coordination and conflict, which in turn influence the novelty and usefulness of the products designed. Furthermore, we investigate when conflict resulting from the representational gaps stimulates or harms creativity. We test these relationships using a path analysis on data across two time periods from cross-functional product development student teams. Representational gaps, affective integration, and cognitive integration were found to collectively improve team creativity via task conflict, relationship conflict, and coordination. Representational gaps and cognitive integration largely influenced creativity through task conflict, coordination, and conflict management. Affective integration operated via its effect on relationship conflict and an interactive effect with cognitive integration on task conflict. Furthermore, the effects of conflict and coordination on creativity depended on the conflict management approach used by the group. We discuss these findings in detail and end by considering the implications for the management of cross functional teams engaged in potentially creative work.",Shared cognition; Team conflict; Team creativity,Integration; Product development; Regression analysis; Cross-functional teams; Functional diversity; Product development teams; Relationship conflicts; Representational gap; Shared cognition; Team conflict; Team creativity; Human resource management

To this end, the paper integrates two well-established yet largely unrelated notions about the inventive process. On the one hand, research has shown that knowledge circulates unevenly among the firms populating a field, forming an inter-organizational network of knowledge flows. On the other hand, firms continuously renew and transform the knowledge that flows through this network as a consequence of their knowledge absorption and knowledge generation activities. Bringing these views together allows us to present a more encompassing picture of the inventive process, and it yields a set of novel testable hypotheses. Based on a sample of companies operating in the semiconductor industry over the period 1976-2002, our hypotheses are corroborated.",Absorptive capacity; Inter-organizational networks; Technological invention,Absorptive capacity; Inter-organizational network; Inventive process; Knowledge absorptions; Knowledge flow; Knowledge generations; Semiconductor industry; Technological inventions; Semiconductor device manufacture

In contrast, we propose that dormant ties-i.e., former ties in which two parties have lost touch-can be a valuable source of knowledge if re-connected. Moreover, we predict that dormant ties that were once strong ties can combine the two benefits of weak ties (efficiency and novelty) with the two benefits of strong ties (solidarity and comprehension). Our research observes the effects of executives who consulted with their dormant ties about an important work project. The results indicate that executives spent considerably less time consulting with their reconnected dormant ties than with their current ties, yet rated usefulness as either comparable or better. Also, as predicted, dormant strong ties combined all four benefits of network ties. These results point to the value of dormant ties as an overlooked and largely untapped source of social capital.",Knowledge transfer; Social capital; Weak ties,Knowledge transfer; Network tie; Social capitals; Weak ties; Knowledge management

However, we found this to be a central managerial problem for organizations in the biopharmaceutical industry which engage in the drug discovery process. Because of the nature of their work, scientists tend to pace based on events whereas managers pace the organization based on time. Challenges arise when work needs to be coordinated among these different complex knowledge systems at distinct points in time. We develop a grounded theory on how coordination of event and time pacing can be achieved through three mechanisms: resource augmentation, bundling and routinization, and selling forward.",Drug discovery; Pacing; Time coordination,Managers; Biopharmaceutical industry; Distinct points; Drug discovery; Drug discovery process; Knowledge system; Pacing; Resource augmentation; Time coordination; Coordination reactions
How risk mediates the CSP-CFP relationship,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399649&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33649808&partnerID=40&md5=2ce03888453f3ae769affb86112f03e2,"What is the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP)? This empirical study uses bond market data to assess the relationship, arguing that if CSP is related to CFP it would be over the long-term, and that therefore long-term bonds are a more the suitable security to study rather than stocks. It is further proposed that CSP affects risk, and that it is risk that then affects the firm's financial performance. Thus risk is proposed to be an intermediary between CSP and CFP. Mediated regression is therefore used to assess the relationship between CSP (as measured by KLD) and CFP (as measured by the yield-to-maturity, YTM, on bonds). Risk is measured by the Moody's risk rating on a firm's long-term bonds, because it is a forward-looking measure and a long-term measure, and is therefore an appropriate measure of long-term future risk. Regression results show that the Moody's risk rating does fully mediate the relationship between KLD and YTM.

However, recent corporate scandals as well as mixed empirical findings about the impact of board structure highlight the fact that there is still much to learn. The purpose of this study is to incorporate the concept of board-level capabilities into research on corporate governance by proposing and developing the construct of director capabilities. Drawing upon a range of theoretical perspectives including human capital, information processing, and learning, we argue that, in order to understand board effectiveness, corporate governance research must go beyond its traditional focus on structural independence to also include directors' capabilities to monitor and participate in strategic decision making. Specifically, we argue that directors are able to contribute more effectively to the extent that they possess greater amounts of human capital, and that their ability to contribute is likely to be lowered by greater information processing demands posed by their home companies. We test our hypotheses using archival data on 650 firms randomly sampled from the Fortune 1000 over the years 2000 through 2003, which resulted in a unique data set on the human capital characteristics of more than 5700 corporate directors. By providing evidence in support of our hypotheses, this paper expands our understanding of the antecedents of board effectiveness.",Boards; Human capital; Information processing,Data processing; Decision making; Industrial management; Statistical tests; Board structures; Boards; Boards of directors; Corporate governance; Corporate scandals; Empirical findings; Human capitals; Strategic decision making; Personnel

This increase in narcissism has implications for both student classroom behavior and the manner in which we, as faculty, effectively teach and manage our classrooms. In the present paper, we discuss the personality trait of narcissism and its potential manifestations in the classroom. We then offer suggestions for management educators in dealing with more narcissistic students to overcome some of their counterproductive tendencies and increase their chances for success in the classroom.",Education; Narcissism,Education; Campbell; College students; Management education; Meta analysis; Narcissism; Personality traits; Students

The intervention activities generated a database of 1732 staff-identified safety concerns, which we analyzed for type of failure and frequency of occurrence. We also compared these staff-identified safety concerns with recommendations from national initiatives. The two most frequent categories of staff safety-concerns, equipment/supplies and facility issues, posed safety risks and diminished staff efficiency, but have not been priorities in national initiatives. Our study suggests an underutilized strategy for improving patient safety and efficiency: Leveraging front-line staff experiences with their work systems to identify opportunities for improvement. In contrast to the perceived tradeoff between safety and efficiency, fixing work systems can yield benefits for both. Thus, prioritizing improvement of work systems in general, rather than focusing more narrowly on specific clinical conditions, can increase safety and efficiency of hospitals.",Patient safety; Process improvement; Work systems,Efficiency; Hospitals; Patient treatment; Clinical conditions; Front-line staffs; Intervention activities; National initiatives; Patient safety; Process Improvement; Safety and efficiencies; Work system; Human resource management

Universities across the nation face a dilemma of generating a return on investments from the transfer of latent technologies that have potential commercial value, but are unfamiliar and difficult to evaluate. Recent perspectives in the technology transfer literature have suggested that university inventions are channeled to firms through transactions in an efficient market for patent protected intellectual property (Agarwal, 2001). This paper argues that this transaction model can be effective for non-latent technologies but suggests that a relational model of technology transplantation more effectively accounts for the process through which university technology managers identify and transfer latent technologies. An organizational ethnography is used to identify how latent technologies are defined and how this subclass of technologies is transferred through a four-phase process involving the following practices: access, extraction, representation, and orchestration. Implications of this relational model of technology transplantation for research and practice of technology transfer are discussed.",Managing innovation; Qualitative methods; University-industry interface,Investments; Patents and inventions; Technology transfer; Managing innovation; Qualitative method; Technological advances; Technology managers; Transaction model; Transfer of technology; University inventions; University-industry interfaces; Managers

We argue that corporate development activities will provide opportunities for learning resulting from experience spillovers, but also bring about considerable disruptions. Taking both these arguments into account, we postulate a U-shaped relationship between a firm's CDA experience and the likelihood of its ties ending in a given year. We find support for our proposed curvilinear relationship between CDA experience and likelihood of tie dissolution in a sample of 273 advertising agency-client ties. We also hypothesize and find empirically that the effects of different types of experience are not uniform. We examine differences between acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances and between horizontal and vertical CDA effects. We thus show that not all types of experience provide the same learning opportunities and disruptive potential for buyer-supplier ties.

Using a scenario-and-survey methodology with more than 100 managers enrolled in a MBA program, we found that ethical ideology and normative beliefs drive the intent to engage in misleading behavior and, when the intent is there, individuals are willing to follow through on the action. We also found that imposed pressure to perform further accentuates the effect of attitudes towards ethical behavior on the intention to mislead. Our findings indicated that board power has a significant effect on misleading intentions, albeit in a direction opposite to that hypothesized and, somewhat disturbingly, organizational ethical climate, firm size, and the type of firm ownership had no effect on individuals' willingness to mislead.

It is widely accepted that innovative companies have to pursue exploitative and explorative innovation activities at the same time, either in separated business units or integrated within a single business unit. However, research on the practical consequences of introducing and following the logics of ambidexterity in an organization is scarce. Following a case study-based approach, we develop a barriers approach to innovation based on an explorative study of 10 research and development projects in the automotive industry. By identifying specific barriers to an innovation project, it is possible to outline possible shortcomings of a given organizational structure. We are able to develop six main categories of barriers based on 152 descriptions of different barriers to innovation. Our findings show that projects in a separated research and development environment mainly experience problems in interdepartmental collaboration. Those projects in integrated research and development environments on the other hand, mostly suffer from a lack of motivation for explorative activities, while exploitative activities are preferred. Moreover, there seem to be fewer problems installing adequate structures for organizational ambidexterity compared to implementing these new structures in the mind of the innovators and top management.

An inability to identify and understand the relationship between valuable resources and firm performance is consequential because it constrains a firm's ability to replicate valuable capabilities and thereby extend its advantage but at the same time, offers a means of protecting those capabilities from imitation by external agents. Prior research has not resolved this causal ambiguity paradox and most recommendations involve adapting to a capability's position along a causal ambiguity paradox. Rather than assuming causal ambiguity is a feature of a firm's resource structure that must be accommodated, the authors propose viewing causal ambiguity as an attribute that can be deliberately managed and adjusted to overcome the paradox and achieve competitive advantage by influencing key sources of ambiguity. Sources of ambiguity that arise from the resource structure, from a firm's knowledge management practices, and from decision maker characteristics are explored. Three approaches to managing causal ambiguity are examined: (1) Lowering causal ambiguity but preserving inimitability through other factors; (2) reducing causal ambiguity in ways that are contextually dependent within the focal firm and therefore only visible within firm boundaries; and (3) managing replication and transfer strategies without reducing causal ambiguity. This analysis reframes the causal ambiguity paradox and offers avenues for future research that have been overlooked by prior perspectives and a menu of options for managers to consider.",Causal ambiguity; Inimitability; Resource-based view,Competition; Knowledge management; Causal ambiguity; Cause and effects; Competitive advantage; Firm Performance; Inimitability; Knowledge management practices; Resource-based view; Transfer strategies; Decision making

For women, negotiating assertively to attain better salary outcomes carries the risk of grave social costs. Hence, women tend to negotiate less assertively, attaining lower salaries, in order to avoid social sanctions or backlash for violating feminine gender stereotypes. Given this account, I hypothesize that the effect of gender on negotiation outcomes should be moderated by advocacy - whether a woman negotiates on her own behalf or another's behalf. Specifically, women should do worse than men only when negotiating on their own behalf. Other-advocacy attenuates the likelihood of social backlash for assertive behavior by moderating the extent to which assertive negotiating is incongruent with feminine gender stereotypes. Data from three studies found that women agree to worse outcomes and behave less competitively when negotiating on their own behalf, and that their unassertiveness is mediated by anticipation of social backlash.",Advocacy; Gender; Negotiations,Advocacy; Gender; Gender stereotypes; Negotiation outcomes; Negotiations; Social constraints; Social cost; Wages

Perfect storm: A cross-level study of transformational leadership during scandal-exacerbated decline,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086489128&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33658666&partnerID=40&md5=2bbd2e74294cf411f70670e6f2f8da99,"Although there have been studies of employee reactions to change as well as organizational decline, there have not been studies of employee reactions to management actions during scandal-exacerbated decline. We hypothesize that membership in a business unit experiencing scandal would have group level effects on the individual, while transformational leadership actions would have direct effects at the individual level. In analyzing more than 2800 employee survey responses, we used Hierarchical Linear Modeling to examine the effects of scandal at the group level as well as at the individual level. We extend transformational leadership theory (Burns, 1978; Bass, 1985; Bass & Avolio, 1994) by showing that the perception of higher levels of transformational leadership by the CEO correlates to higher levels of organizational commitment and stay intentions of employees - two critical outcomes for organizations facing the disengagement or voluntary turnover of employees during scandal-exacerbated decline Findings also show that membership in a business unit involved in scandal reduced individual commitment to the organization.",Organizational commitment; Scandal; Transformational leadership,Business units; Employee surveys; Hierarchical linear modeling; Individual levels; Organizational Commitment; Organizational declines; Scandal; Transformational leadership; Personnel
How entrepreneurs form relationships with other organizations: The securing of investments from venture capital and corporate investors,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087222567&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33649807&partnerID=40&md5=ddb10f046cd5c11faf2b4ae8ef93010e,"Although inter-organizational relationships are important for the success and survival of new organizations, there has been limited research on the strategies that entrepreneurs may use to form such relationships. Building on fine-grained field data from nine Internet security ventures receiving equity investments from venture capitalists and corporate investors, we induct a theoretical framework for the quick and successful formation of inter-organizational relationships. Specifically, we find that entrepreneurs successful in forming relationships: casually date potential partners for several months prior to the anticipated relationship (instead of approaching them seeking a relationship in the near-term), time their pursuit of relationships around proofpoints of progress (instead of around resource needs), motivate potential partners to make a relationship decision by establishing impending credible alternatives (instead of passively waiting for potential partners to make a relationship offer), and allocate their attention only after scrutinizing interest (instead of taking any professed interest at face value). This study contributes to the literature on inter-organizational relationship formation the insights that potential partners often use waiting as a primary uncertainty reducing mechanism to complement network ties and information signals, while entrepreneurs may use preemptive counter-waiting strategies to reduce the burden of this waiting. Accordingly, our findings suggest a duality to social capital that emphasizes both network ties as well as the complementary behaviors necessary to unlock the value of such ties.",Entrepreneurship; Inter-organizational relationships; Social networks,Social networking (online); Entrepreneurship; Equity investment; Information signals; Inter-organizational relationships; Internet security; Potential partners; Theoretical framework; Venture capitalists; Investments
Co-evolution of multiple networks,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086489772&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33631531&partnerID=40&md5=dfd19fa69761ae2fd9899db422b16a0b,"In this paper, we develop a theory of multi network co-evolution. We identify four patterns where two networks can co-evolve. After that we develop hypotheses regarding the centrality of a firm in alliance and scientific coauthorship networks. We test our hypotheses in the US biotechnology industry between 1990 and 2002 using a fixed effects negative binomial regression model. Our results suggest that the scientific and alliance networks co-evolve in a skewed type. As two networks are dominantly substitutable, the co-evolution is biased towards the less costly network - the scientific coauthorship network.",Interorganizational networks; Network evolution,Alliance networks; Co-authorship networks; Fixed effects; Inter-organizational network; Multiple networks; Negative binomial regression model; Network evolution; US biotechnology industry; Regression analysis
Ngos as multinationals: The implications of diversification,2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086489770&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33650245&partnerID=40&md5=cfb1a7d8a5e250f2e6449ae7dafe29f2,"Multinational nongovernmental organizations (MNGOs) have garnered increased attention within the field of international business primarily as influencers in a tripartite model. However, little is known about MNGOs as international actors in and of themselves. We examine the impact of geographic diversification on performance in MNGOs. Our results indicate that, while increases in the depth of international operations can ultimately result in positive performance, expanding the breadth of the organization produces a negative trend. The interaction effect of combining product with geographic diversification indicates an overall negative effect, but can vary significantly in both shape and direction depending on the type of interaction.",Diversification; NGO,Diversification; Interaction effect; International business; International operations; Nongovernmental organizations
"Using strategy tools in practice: An exploration of ""technologies of rationality"" in use",2008,"Academy of Management 2008 Annual Meeting: The Questions We Ask, AOM 2008",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087221991&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2008.33724572&partnerID=40&md5=2baa26e5af12c55bc907966763912ba9,"Recently there has been much debate about the usefulness of strategic management education and implicitly about strategy tools and frameworks. Yet, this debate is taking place in the absence of detailed knowledge about how, or indeed, whether, managers use the theoretical tools that they learn. This paper addresses this gap by taking a practice perspective to look at how strategy tools are mobilized inside organizations. Using illustrations from three vignettes of strategy tools in use, we explore how an actor's search for rationality and objectivity through the use of tools is actually a political, symbolic and socially interactive process. We provide a conceptual framework for analyzing strategy tools as key mediators of these contextual and political interests. We offer propositions associated with the functions of tools in use, the contextual factors that shape their use and the types of outcomes that can be examined using a practice lens on strategy making.",Strategy as practice; Strategy tools; Technologies of rationality,Conceptual frameworks; Contextual factors; Interactive process; Political interest; Practice perspectives; Strategic management; Strategy as practices

We focus on incidental emotions, emotions triggered by a prior experience that is irrelevant to the current situation. We find that people who feel incidental gratitude are more trusting and more receptive to advice than are people in a neutral emotional state, and that people in a neutral state are more trusting and more receptive to advice than are people who feel incidental anger. In our setting, greater receptivity to advice increased judgment accuracy. People who felt incidental gratitude were more accurate than were people in a neutral state, and people in a neutral state were more accurate than were people who felt incidental anger. Our results offer insight into how people use advice, and identify conditions under which leaders, policy makers, and advisors may be particularly influential.",Advice taking; Emotions; Trust,Advice taking; Current situation; Emotional state; Emotions; Neutral state; Policy makers; Prior experience; Trust; Felt

We evaluate our hypothesis using survival analysis to analyze longitudinal data on the career moves of IT professionals. As expected, we find that IT professionals respond to relative wage differences by making career transitions; moreover, we find that female IT professionals are more sensitive than male IT professionals to relative wage differences in their career transition behaviors.",Career; IT profession; Survival analysis,Bioinformatics; Career; Career mobilities; IT profession; IT professional; Longitudinal data; Survival analysis; Transition behavior; Utility theory; Wages

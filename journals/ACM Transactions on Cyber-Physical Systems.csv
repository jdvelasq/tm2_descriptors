Game Theory-Based Parameter Tuning for Energy-Efficient Path Planning on Modern UAVs,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146434025&doi=10.1145%2f3565270&partnerID=40&md5=89ca47b7fdc93a9a287a1127810c62b9,"Present-day path planning algorithms for UAVs rely on various parameters that need to be tuned at runtime to be able to plan the best possible route. For example, for a sampling-based algorithm, the number of samples plays a crucial role. The dimension of the space that is being searched to plan the path, the minimum distance for extending a path in a direction, and the minimum distance that the drone should maintain with respect to obstacles while traversing the planned path are all important variables. Along with this, we have a choice of vision algorithms, their parameters, and platforms. Finding a suitable configuration for all these parameters at runtime is very challenging because we need to solve a complicated optimization problem, and that too within tens of milliseconds. The area of theoretical exploration of the optimization problems that arise in such settings is dominated by traditional approaches that use regular nonlinear optimization techniques often enhanced with AI-based techniques such as genetic algorithms. These techniques are sadly rather slow, have convergence issues, and are typically not suitable for use at runtime. In this article, we leverage recent and promising research results that propose to solve complex optimization problems by converting them into approximately equivalent game-theoretic problems. The computed equilibrium strategies can then be mapped to the optimal values of the tunable parameters. With simulation studies in virtual worlds, we show that our solutions are 5-21% better than those produced by traditional methods, and our approach is 10× faster.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Game theory; parameter tuning; path planning; power model; UAVs,Energy efficiency; Game theory; Genetic algorithms; Nonlinear programming; Parameter estimation; Virtual reality; Efficient path planning; Energy efficient; Minimums distance; Number of samples; Optimization problems; Parameters tuning; Path-planning algorithm; Power modeling; Runtimes; Sampling-based algorithms; Motion planning
OD1NF1ST: True Skip Intrusion Detection and Avionics Network Cyber-attack Simulation,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146429808&doi=10.1145%2f3551893&partnerID=40&md5=44d520253ccb08f054171bf948130c81,"MIL-STD-1553 is a communication bus that has been used by many military avionics platforms, such as the F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, for almost 50 years. Recently, it has become clear that the lack of security on MIL-STD-1553 and the requirement for internet communication between planes has revealed numerous potential attack vectors for malicious parties. Prevention of these attacks by modernizing the MIL-STD-1553 is not practical due to the military applications and existing far-reaching installations of the bus. We present a software system that can simulate bus transmissions to create easy, replicable, and large datasets of MIL-STD-1553 communications. We also propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can identify anomalies and the precise type of attack using recurrent neural networks with a reinforcement learning true-skip data selection algorithm. Our IDS outperforms existing algorithms designed for MIL-STD-1553 in binary anomaly detection tasks while also performing attack classification and minimizing computational resource cost. Our simulator can generate more data with higher fidelity than existing methods and integrate attack scenarios with greater detail. Furthermore, the simulator and IDS can be combined to form a web-based attack-defense game. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",anomaly detection; avionics networks; Machine Learning; reinforcement learning; simulation software,Buses; Computer crime; Computer software; Cybersecurity; Fighter aircraft; Intrusion detection; Large dataset; Military applications; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Supersonic aircraft; Anomaly detection; Avionic networks; Cyber-attack simulation; Detection networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Machine-learning; MIL-STD-1553; Reinforcement learnings; Simulation software; Anomaly detection
DeResolver: A Decentralized Conflict Resolution Framework with Autonomous Negotiation for Smart City Services,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146427670&doi=10.1145%2f3529096&partnerID=40&md5=7cd16713625b2e4741a7c5747ad9ebb0,"As various smart services are increasingly deployed in modern cities, many unexpected conflicts arise due to various physical world couplings. Existing solutions for conflict resolution often rely on centralized control to enforce predetermined and fixed priorities of different services, which is challenging due to the inconsistent and private objectives of the services. Also, the centralized solutions miss opportunities to more effectively resolve conflicts according to their spatiotemporal locality of the conflicts. To address this issue, we design a decentralized negotiation and conflict resolution framework named DeResolver, which allows services to resolve conflicts by communicating and negotiating with each other to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement autonomously and efficiently. Our design features a two-step self-supervised learning-based algorithm to predict acceptable proposals and their rankings of each opponent through the negotiation. Our design is evaluated with a smart city case study of three services: intelligent traffic light control, pedestrian service, and environmental control. In this case study, a data-driven evaluation is conducted using a large dataset consisting of the GPS locations of 246 surveillance cameras and an automatic traffic monitoring system with more than 3 million records per day to extract real-world vehicle routes. The evaluation results show that our solution achieves much more balanced results, i.e., only increasing the average waiting time of vehicles, the measurement metric of intelligent traffic light control service, by 6.8% while reducing the weighted sum of air pollutant emission, measured for environment control service, by 12.1%, and the pedestrian waiting time, the measurement metric of pedestrian service, by 33.1%, compared to priority-based solution. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Hierarchical Planning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Smart and Connected Communities,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146421994&doi=10.1145%2f3502869&partnerID=40&md5=f7083f4df9948d803702dc97fb706181,"Resource allocation under uncertainty is a classic problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems. Consider emergency response, where urban planners and first responders optimize the location of ambulances to minimize expected response times to incidents such as road accidents. Typically, such problems involve sequential decision making under uncertainty and can be modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. The goal of the decision maker is to learn a mapping from states to actions that can maximize expected rewards. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been proposed to tackle such problems, scalability remains a challenge for real world use cases. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city level CPS problems for resource allocation. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then use Monte Carlo planning for solving the smaller problems and managing the interaction between them. Finally, we use data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency response. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Planning for Automated Vehicles with Human Trust,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146423377&doi=10.1145%2f3561059&partnerID=40&md5=a99bd913e46cf8d13f6654858ce76c5b,"Recent work has considered personalized route planning based on user profiles, but none of it accounts for human trust. We argue that human trust is an important factor to consider when planning routes for automated vehicles. This article presents a trust-based route-planning approach for automated vehicles. We formalize the human-vehicle interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model trust as a partially observable state variable of the POMDP, representing the human's hidden mental state. We build data-driven models of human trust dynamics and takeover decisions, which are incorporated in the POMDP framework, using data collected from an online user study with 100 participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We compute optimal routes for automated vehicles by solving optimal policies in the POMDP planning and evaluate the resulting routes via human subject experiments with 22 participants on a driving simulator. The experimental results show that participants taking the trust-based route generally reported more positive responses in the after-driving survey than those taking the baseline (trust-free) route. In addition, we analyze the trade-offs between multiple planning objectives (e.g., trust, distance, energy consumption) via multi-objective optimization of the POMDP. We also identify a set of open issues and implications for real-world deployment of the proposed approach in automated vehicles. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",automated vehicle; route planning; Trust,Automation; Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Markov processes; Multiobjective optimization; User profile; Vehicles; Automated vehicles; Human vehicle interactions; Markov decision model; Mental state; Model trusts; Partially observable Markov decision process; Route planning; State-variables; Trust; User's profiles; Energy utilization
Model-bounded Monitoring of Hybrid Systems,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129756876&doi=10.1145%2f3529095&partnerID=40&md5=3da64f2a22c2a429b9f25a569dd6dd14,"Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs) - the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms - one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra - and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",cyber-physical systems; hybrid automata; Monitoring,Automata theory; Continuous time systems; Embedded systems; Hybrid systems; Continuous-time signal; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Discrete-time signals; Hybrid automatons; Linear hybrid automata; Monitoring algorithms; Prior-knowledge; Sampling uncertainties; Target systems; Cyber Physical System
Cybersecurity Challenges in the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: An Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) Perspective,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140065068&doi=10.1145%2f3548691&partnerID=40&md5=aae96eebf76dfecff9acfcce34b20c12,"There has been significant interest within the offshore oil and gas industry to utilise Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS). There has also been a corresponding increase in cyberattacks targeted at oil and gas companies. Offshore oil production requires remote access to and control of large and complex hardware resources. This is achieved by integrating ICPS, Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, and IIoT technologies. A successful cyberattack against an oil and gas (O&G) offshore asset could have a major impact on the environment, marine ecosystem and safety of personnel. Any disruption to the world's supply of O&G can also have an effect on oil prices and the global economy. We describe the cyberattack surface within the oil and gas industry, discussing emerging trends in the offshore sub-sector and provide a historical perspective of known cyberattacks. We also present a case study of a subsea control system architecture typically used in offshore O&G operations and highlight potential vulnerabilities affecting the components of the system. This study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of attack vectors in a subsea control system. The analysis provided can be used to understand key vulnerabilities in such systems and may be used to implement efficient mitigation methods. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber security; industrial cyber-physical systems; Offshore oil and gas; SCADA systems security,"Access control; Cyber Physical System; Ecosystems; Embedded systems; Gas industry; Gases; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; SCADA systems; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Industrial cybe-physical system; Offshore oil; Offshore oil and gas; Oil and gas; Supervisory, control and data acquisition system security; System security; Cybersecurity"
Edge Computing for Cyber-physical Systems: A Systematic Mapping Study Emphasizing Trustworthiness,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141041347&doi=10.1145%2f3539662&partnerID=40&md5=1358fbc5e08bf93b2d3a7c663b39c1bd,"Edge computing is projected to have profound implications in the coming decades, proposed to provide solutions for applications such as augmented reality, predictive functionalities, and collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). For such applications, edge computing addresses the new computational needs, as well as privacy, availability, and real-time constraints, by providing local high-performance computing capabilities to deal with the limitations and constraints of cloud and embedded systems. Edge computing is today driven by strong market forces stemming from IT/cloud, telecom, and networking-with corresponding multiple interpretations of ""edge computing""(e.g., device edge, network edge, distributed cloud). Considering the strong drivers for edge computing and the relative novelty of the field, it becomes important to understand the specific requirements and characteristics of edge-based CPS, and to ensure that research is guided adequately, e.g., avoiding specific gaps. Our interests lie in the applications of edge computing as part of CPS, where several properties (or attributes) of trustworthiness, including safety, security, and predictability/availability, are of particular concern, each facing challenges for the introduction of edge-based CPS. We present the results of a systematic mapping study, a kind of systematic literature survey, investigating the use of edge computing for CPS with a special emphasis on trustworthiness. The main contributions of this study are a detailed description of the current research efforts in edge-based CPS and the identification and discussion of trends and research gaps. The results show that the main body of research in edge-based CPS only to a very limited extent consider key attributes of system trustworthiness, despite many efforts referring to critical CPS and applications like intelligent transportation. More research and industrial efforts will be needed on aspects of trustworthiness of future edge-based CPS including their experimental evaluation. Such research needs to consider the multiple interrelated attributes of trustworthiness including safety, security, and predictability, and new methodologies and architectures to address them. It is further important to provide bridges and collaboration between edge computing and CPS disciplines. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",cloudlet; critical systems; cyber-physical systems; dependability; Edge computing; fog computing; mobile edge computing; predictability; safety; security; trustworthiness,Augmented reality; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Fog computing; Industrial research; Mapping; Mobile edge computing; Network security; Real time systems; Cloudlet; Critical systems; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Dependability; Edge computing; Edge-based; Predictability; Security; Trustworthiness; Cyber Physical System
Plan B: Design Methodology for Cyber-Physical Systems Robust to Timing Failures,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141050961&doi=10.1145%2f3516449&partnerID=40&md5=ff92347e9c8bd7e1fb9539e1421f6457,"Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have timing constraints that must be met by the cyber components (software and the network) to ensure safety. It is a tedious job to check if a CPS meets its timing requirement especially when it is distributed and the software and/or the underlying computing platforms are complex. Furthermore, the system design is brittle since a timing failure can still happen (e.g., network failure, soft error bit flip). In this article, we propose a new design methodology called Plan B where timing constraints of the CPS are monitored at runtime, and a proper backup routine is executed when a timing failure happens to ensure safety. We provide a model on how to express the desired timing behavior using a set of timing constructs in a C/C++ code and how to efficiently monitor them at the runtime. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on three case studies: (1) the full software stack for autonomous driving (Apollo), (2) a multi-agent system with 1/10th-scale model robots, and (3) a quadrotor for search and rescue application. We show that the system remains safe and stable even when intentional faults are injected to cause a timing failure. We also demonstrate that the system can achieve graceful degradation when a less extreme timing failure happens. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber-physical systems; time-sensitive systems; worst-case execution time,Application programs; Autonomous agents; C++ (programming language); Design; Embedded systems; Multi agent systems; Radiation hardening; Timing circuits; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Design Methodology; Robust to timings; Runtimes; Sensitive systems; Time-sensitive system; Timing constraints; Timing failures; Worst-case execution time; Cyber Physical System

Scaling beyond Bandwidth Limitations: Wireless Control with Stability Guarantees under Overload,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141056252&doi=10.1145%2f3502299&partnerID=40&md5=89e7cb9caf368714cba490c4555835a9,"An important class of cyber-physical systems relies on multiple agents that jointly perform a task by coordinating their actions over a wireless network. Examples include self-driving cars in intelligent transportation and production robots in smart manufacturing. However, the scalability of existing control-over-wireless solutions is limited as they cannot resolve overload situations in which the communication demand exceeds the available bandwidth. This article presents a novel co-design of distributed control and wireless communication that overcomes this limitation by dynamically allocating the available bandwidth to agents with the greatest need to communicate. Experiments on a real cyber-physical testbed with 20 agents, each consisting of a low-power wireless embedded device and a cart-pole system, demonstrate that our solution achieves significantly better control performance under overload than the state of the art. We further prove that our co-design guarantees closed-loop stability for physical systems with stochastic linear time-invariant dynamics. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Yoneda Hacking: The Algebra of Attacker Actions,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141046051&doi=10.1145%2f3531063&partnerID=40&md5=57196455d747ce96467ff041cd4f5a64,"Our work focuses on modeling the security of systems from their component-level designs. Towards this goal, we develop a categorical formalism to model attacker actions. Equipping the categorical formalism with algebras produces two interesting results for security modeling. First, using the Yoneda lemma, we can model attacker reconnaissance missions. In this context, the Yoneda lemma shows us that if two system representations, one being complete and the other being the attacker's incomplete view, agree at every possible test, they behave the same. The implication is that attackers can still successfully exploit the system even with incomplete information. Second, we model the potential changes to the system via an exploit. An exploit either manipulate the interactions between system components, such as providing the wrong values to a sensor, or changes the components themselves, such as controlling a global positioning system (GPS). One additional benefit of using category theory is that mathematical operations can be represented as formal diagrams, helpful in applying this analysis in a model-based design setting. We illustrate this modeling framework using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cyber-physical system model. We demonstrate and model two types of attacks (1) a rewiring attack, which violates data integrity, and (2) a rewriting attack, which violates availability. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Cyber-physical Approach for Emergency Braking in Close-Distance Driving Arrangements,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141069295&doi=10.1145%2f3526117&partnerID=40&md5=259998920596d088f5626c7c0637b413,"In addition to fuel/energy savings, close-distance driving or platooning allows compacting vehicle flows and, hence, increasing throughput on congested roads. The shorter the inter-vehicle separation is in such settings, the more the benefits. However, it becomes considerably harder to guarantee safety, in particular, when braking in an emergency. In this article, we are concerned with this problem and propose a cyber-physical approach that considerably reduces the stopping distance of a platoon with inter-vehicle separations shorter than one vehicle length (i.e., 5 m) without sacrificing safety and independent of the road profile, i.e., whether on a flat road or in a downhill. The basic idea is to implement a cooperative behavior where a vehicle sends a distress message if it fails to achieve an assigned deceleration when braking in a platoon. This way, other vehicles in the arrangement can adapt their decelerations to avoid collisions. We illustrate and evaluate our approach based on detailed simulations involving high-fidelity vehicle models. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",brake-by-wire controllers; cooperative driving/braking; Emergency braking; intelligent transport systems (ITS); platoons,Behavioral research; Cyber Physical System; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic control; Vehicles; Brake-by-wire controller; Cooperative driving; Cooperative driving/braking; Cyber physicals; Emergency braking; Intelligent transport; Intelligent transport system; Physical approaches; Platoon; Transport systems; Roads and streets

The massive electronic health records (EHRs) are expected to be stored in the cloud, where the data are usually encrypted, and the encrypted data can be used for disease diagnosis. There exist some numeric health indicators, such as blood pressure and heart rate. These numeric indicators can be classified into multiple ranges, and each range may represent an indication of normality or abnormity. Once receiving encrypted IoT data, the CS maps it to one of the ranges, achieving timely monitoring and diagnosis of health indicators. This article presents a new approach to identify the range that an encrypted numeric value corresponds to without exposing the explicit value. We establish the sufficient and necessary condition to convert a range query to matchings of encrypted binary sequences with the minimum number of matching operations. We further apply the minimization of range queries to design and implement a secure range query system, where numeric health indicators encrypted independently by multiple IoT devices can be cohesively stored and efficiently queried by using Lagrange polynomial interpolation. Comprehensive performance studies show that the proposed approach can protect both the health records and range query against untrusted cloud platforms and requires less computational and communication cost than existing techniques. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",0-and 1-encoding; Internet-of-Things (IoT); range query; searchable encryption,Binary sequences; Blood pressure; Cryptography; Diagnosis; 0-and 1-encoding; Clinical application; Cloud platforms; Encodings; Health indicators; Health records; Internet-of-thing; Matchings; Range query; Searchable encryptions; Internet of things
Coordinated Charging and Discharging of Electric Vehicles: A New Class of Switching Attacks,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141065449&doi=10.1145%2f3524454&partnerID=40&md5=f940aea13d3fc790dff753a56f157f3e,"In this work, we investigate that the abundance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be exploited to target the stability of the power grid. Through a cyber attack that compromises a lot of available EVs and their charging infrastructure, we present a realistic coordinated switching attack that initiates inter-area oscillations between different areas of the power grid. The threat model as well as linearized state-space representation of the grid are formulated to illustrate possible consequences of the attack. Two variations of switching attack are considered, namely, switching of EV charging and discharging power into the grid. Moreover, two possible attack strategies are also considered (i) using an insider to reveal the accurate system parameters and (ii) using reconnaissance activities in the absence of the grid parameters. In the former strategy, the system equations are used to compute the required knowledge to launch the attack. However, a stealthy system identification technique, which is tailored based on Eigenvalue Realization Algorithm (ERA), is proposed in latter strategy to calculate the required data for attack execution. The two-area Kundur, 39-Bus New England, and the Australian 5-area power grids are used to demonstrate the attack strategies and their consequences. The collected results demonstrate that by manipulation of EV charging stations and launching a coordinated switching attack to those portions of load, inter-area oscillations can be initiated. Finally, to protect the grid from this anticipated attack, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework is proposed to detect and eliminate this attack even before being executed. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",charging stations; Electric Vehicle (EV); inter-area oscillations; support vector machine; switching attacks,Charging (batteries); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; State space methods; Switching; Attack strategies; Charging station; Coordinated charging; Cyber-attacks; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Inter-area oscillations; Power grids; Support vectors machine; Switching attack; Support vector machines

It offers promising perspectives for high reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety production process, but also makes the systems more complex and challenging for health assessment. To deal with these challenges, one needs to develop a robust approach to monitor and assess the system's health state. In this article, a practical and effective hybrid deep learning multi-task framework integrating the advantages of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to reflect the relatedness of remaining useful life prediction with health status detection process for complex multi-object systems in CPS environment is developed. The CNN is used as a feature extractor to compress condition monitoring data and directly extract significant spatiotemporal features from raw multi-sensory input data. The LSTM is used to capture long-term temporary dependency features. The advantages of the proposed hybrid deep learning framework have been verified on the popular NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. The experimental study compares this approach to the existing methods using the same dataset. The results suggest that the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model is superior to existing methods, including traditional machine learning and deep learning-based methods.

The advantage of these models is their ability to handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate representations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that the sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire state space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will likely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution. These conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for the safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or the feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control action to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD condition. In this article, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series OOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially across short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data distribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of multi-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for CPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference times. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single β-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent space sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive latent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most likely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset called nuImages.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber-physical systems; deep neural networks; disentanglement; mutual information gap; out-of-distribution; β-variational autoencoders,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Auto encoders; Condition; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Disentanglement; Information-gap; Mutual information gap; Mutual informations; Out-of-distribution; Β-variational autoencoder; Deep neural networks
Learning from Non-experts: An Interactive and Adaptive Learning Approach for Appliance Recognition in Smart Homes,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134881806&doi=10.1145%2f3491241&partnerID=40&md5=5643b296133e8e0b0a18e5ee00082c2a,"With the acceleration of Information and Communication Technologies and the Internet-of-Things paradigm, smart residential environments, also known as smart homes, are becoming increasingly common. These environments have significant potential for the development of intelligent energy management systems and have therefore attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. An enabling building block for these systems is the ability of obtaining energy consumption at the appliance-level. This information is usually inferred from electric signals data (e.g., current) collected by a smart meter or a smart outlet, a problem known as appliance recognition. Several previous approaches for appliance recognition have proposed load disaggregation techniques for smart meter data. However, these approaches are often very inaccurate for low consumption and multi-state appliances. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been proposed for appliance recognition. These approaches are mainly based on passive MLs, thus requiring pre-labeled data to be trained. This makes such approaches unable to rapidly adapt to the constantly changing availability and heterogeneity of appliances on the market. In a home setting scenario, it is natural to consider the involvement of users in the labeling process, as appliances' electric signatures are collected. This type of learning falls into the category of Stream-based Active Learning (SAL). SAL has been mainly investigated assuming the presence of an expert, always available and willing to label the collected samples. Nevertheless, a home user may lack such availability, and in general present a more erratic and user-dependent behavior. In this article, we develop a SAL algorithm, called K-Active-Neighbors (KAN), for the problem of household appliance recognition. Differently from previous approaches, KAN jointly learns the user behavior and the appliance signatures. KAN dynamically adjusts the querying strategy to increase accuracy by considering the user availability as well as the quality of the collected signatures. Such quality is defined as a combination of informativeness, representativeness, and confidence score of the signature compared to the current knowledge. To test KAN versus state-of-the-art approaches, we use real appliance data collected by a low-cost Arduino-based smart outlet as well as the ECO smart home dataset. Furthermore, we use a real dataset to model user behavior. Results show that KAN is able to achieve high accuracy with minimal data, i.e., signatures of short length and collected at low frequency.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Appliance recognition; stream-based active learning; user behavior,Advanced metering infrastructures; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Domestic appliances; Electric power measurement; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; Smart power grids; 'current; Active Learning; Adaptive learning; Appliance recognition; Interactive learning; Smart homes; Smart outlets; Stream-based; Stream-based active learning; User behaviors; Smart meters
A Framework for Identification and Validation of Affine Hybrid Automata from Input-Output Traces,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134882183&doi=10.1145%2f3470455&partnerID=40&md5=70cccae105cdced19cb98bb5bc1ea91f,"Automata-based modeling of hybrid and cyber-physical systems (CPS) is an important formal abstraction amenable to algorithmic analysis of its dynamic behaviors, such as in verification, fault identification, and anomaly detection. However, for realistic systems, especially industrial ones, identifying hybrid automata is challenging, due in part to inferring hybrid interactions, which involves inference of both continuous behaviors, such as through classical system identification, as well as discrete behaviors, such as through automata (e.g., L∗) learning. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework for inferring and validating models of deterministic hybrid systems with linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from input/output execution traces. The framework contains algorithms for the approximation of continuous dynamics in discrete modes, estimation of transition conditions, and the inference of automata mode merging. The algorithms are capable of clustering trace segments and estimating their dynamic parameters, and meanwhile, deriving guard conditions that are represented by multiple linear inequalities. Finally, the inferred model is automatically converted to the format of the original system for the validation. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by evaluating its performance in several case studies as implemented through a publicly available prototype software framework called HAutLearn and compare it with a membership-based algorithm.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",automata learning; Hybrid systems; system identification,Anomaly detection; Approximation algorithms; Automata theory; Clustering algorithms; Embedded systems; Inference engines; Learning systems; Ordinary differential equations; Religious buildings; Algorithmic analysis; Automata-based model; Automaton learning; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Dynamic behaviors; Fault identifications; Hybrid automatons; Input-output; System-identification; Hybrid systems
"On Modularity in Reactive Control Architectures, with an Application to Formal Verification",2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134880962&doi=10.1145%2f3511606&partnerID=40&md5=fe172329e71172116fe7deb8d0f77191,"Modularity is a central principle throughout the design process for cyber-physical systems. Modularity reduces complexity and increases reuse of behavior. In this article we pose and answer the following question: how can we identify independent ""modules""within the structure of reactive control architectures? To this end, we propose a graph-structured control architecture we call a decision structure and show how it generalizes some reactive control architectures that are popular in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics, specifically Teleo-Reactive programs (TRs), Decision Trees (DTs), Behavior Trees (BTs), and Generalised Behavior Trees (k-BTs). Inspired by the definition of a module in graph theory [16] we define modules in decision structures and show how each decision structure possesses a canonical decomposition into its modules, which can be found in polynomial time. We establish intuitive connections between our proposed modularity and modularity in structured programming. In BTs, k-BTs, and DTs the modules we propose are in a one-to-one correspondence with their subtrees. We show we can naturally characterize each of the BTs, k-BTs, DTs, and TRs by properties of their module decomposition. This allows us to recognize which decision structures are equivalent to each of these architectures in quadratic time. Following McCabe [26], we define a complexity measure called essential complexity on decision structures, which measures the degree to which they can be decomposed into simpler modules. We characterize the k-BTs as the decision structures of unit-essential complexity. Our proposed concept of modules extends to formal verification, under any verification scheme capable of verifying a decision structure. Namely, we prove that a modification to a module within a decision structure has no greater flow-on effects than a modification to an individual action within that structure. This enables verification on modules to be done locally and hierarchically, where structures can be verified and then repeatedly locally modified, with modules replaced by modules while preserving correctness. To illustrate the findings, we present an example of a solar-powered drone completing a reconnaissance-based mission using a decision structure. We use a Linear Temporal Logic-based verification scheme to verify the correctness of this structure and then show how one can repeatedly modify modules while preserving its correctness, and this can be verified by considering only those modules that have been modified.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Behavior trees; formal verification; modularity,Decision trees; Embedded systems; Forestry; Motion planning; Polynomial approximation; Solar energy; Behaviour Trees; Canonical decomposition; Control architecture; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Design-process; Modularity; Reactive control architectures; Reuse; Teleo-reactive programs; Formal verification
Collaborative Rover-copter Path Planning and Exploration with Temporal Logic Specifications Based on Bayesian Update Under Uncertain Environments,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134877178&doi=10.1145%2f3470453&partnerID=40&md5=e44a69ad1eb7aa6d99d8741c07be51ee,"This article investigates a collaborative rover-copter path planning and exploration with temporal logic specifications under uncertain environments. The objective of the rover is to complete a mission expressed by a syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) formula, while the objective of the copter is to actively explore the environment and reduce its uncertainties, aiming at assisting the rover and enhancing the efficiency of the mission completion. To formalize our approach, we first capture the environmental uncertainties by environmental beliefs of the atomic propositions, under an assumption that it is unknown which properties (or, atomic propositions) are satisfied in each area of the environment. The environmental beliefs of the atomic propositions are updated according to the Bayes rule based on the Bernoulli-type sensor measurements provided by both the rover and the copter. Then, the optimal policy for the rover is synthesized by maximizing a belief of the satisfaction of the scLTL formula through an implementation of an automata-based model checking. An exploration policy for the copter is then synthesized by employing the notion of an entropy that is evaluated based on the environmental beliefs of the atomic propositions, and a path that the rover intends to follow according to the optimal policy. As such, the copter can actively explore regions whose uncertainties are high and that are relevant to the mission completion. Finally, some numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bayesian-based decision making; Collaborative motion planning; temporal logics; uncertain environments,Computer circuits; Decision making; Model checking; Rovers; Specifications; Temporal logic; Atomic propositions; Bayesian; Bayesian-based decision making; Collaborative motion planning; Decisions makings; Linear temporal logic; Motion-planning; Temporal logic formula; Temporal logic specifications; Uncertain environments; Motion planning

Specifically, cyber-physical systems are being increasingly applied in smart-homes to support independent and healthy aging. Due to the growing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in the senior population, a key application in this domain is the detection of cognitive issues based on sensor data. In this article, we propose a novel cyber-physical system for cognitive assessment in smart-homes. Cognitive evaluation relies on clinical indicators characterizing symptoms of dementia based on the individual's movement patterns. However, recognizing these patterns in smart-homes is challenging, because movement is constrained by the home layout and obstacles. Since different abnormal patterns are characterized by undulatory-like trajectories, we conjecture that frequency-based locomotion features may more effectively capture these patterns with respect to traditional features in the spatio-temporal domain. Based on this intuition, we introduce novel feature extraction techniques and adopt state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for short- and long-term cognitive evaluation. Our system includes a user-friendly interface that enables clinicians to inspect the data and predictions. Extensive experiments carried out with a real-world dataset acquired from both cognitively healthy seniors and people with dementia show the superiority of our frequency-based features. Moreover, further experiments with an ensemble method show that prediction accuracy can be enhanced by combining features in the frequency and time domains.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cognitive assessment; healthcare; location data mining; smart-home,Automation; Data mining; Embedded systems; Frequency domain analysis; Health care; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Population statistics; Time domain analysis; Cognitive assessments; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Frequency domains; Healthcare; Location data; Location data mining; Locomotion analysis; Seamless integration; Smart homes; Cyber Physical System
ASHRAY: Enhancing Water-usage Comfort in Developing Regions using Data-driven IoT Retrofits,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134876379&doi=10.1145%2f3491242&partnerID=40&md5=9f521938fca4ecc20ce23e8f203893de,"In developing countries, majority of the households use overhead water tanks to have running water. These water tanks are exposed to the elements, which usually render the tap water uncomfortable to use, given the extreme subtropical weather conditions. Externally weatherproofing these tanks to maintain the groundwater temperature is short-lived, and only results in a marginal (0.5°C-1°C) improvement in tap water temperature. We propose Ashray, an IoT-inspired, intelligent system to minimize the exposure of water to the elements thereby maintaining its temperature close to that of the groundwater. Ashray learns the water demand patterns of a household and pumps water into the overhead tank only when necessary. The predictive, machine learning based, approach of Ashray improves water comfort by up to 8°C in summers and 3°C in winters, on average. Ashray is retrofitted into existing infrastructure with a hardware prototyping cost of $27, whereas it can save up to 16% on water heating costs, through reduction in natural gas consumption, by leveraging groundwater temperature. Moreover, we also consider a transiently-powered Ashray, which uses the energy harvested from the ambient environment, and propose an intermittent data pipeline to improve its prediction accuracy. The transiently-powered Ashray is suitable for long-term deployment, requires minimal maintenance and delivers approximately the same performance. Ashray has the potential to improve the thermal comfort and reduce energy costs for millions of households in developing countries.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",machine learning; Water comfort; water usage forecasting,Developing countries; Groundwater; Heating; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Natural gas; Water tanks; Data driven; Developing regions; Exposed to; Groundwater temperatures; Machine-learning; Running waters; Tap water; Water comfort; Water usage; Water usage forecasting; Machine learning
Fog-supported Low-latency Monitoring of System Disruptions in Industry 4.0: A Federated Learning Approach,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131055104&doi=10.1145%2f3477272&partnerID=40&md5=32de68a5f697cb53dd12fbcf00569bb4,"Industry 4.0 is based on machine learning and advanced digital technologies, such as Industrial-Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical-Production-Systems, to collect and process data coming from manufacturing systems. Thus, several industrial issues may be further investigated including, flows disruptions, machines' breakdowns, quality crisis, and so on. In this context, traditional machine learning techniques require the data to be stored and processed in a central entity, e.g., a cloud server. However, these techniques are not suitable for all manufacturing use cases, due to the inaccessibility of private data such as resources' localization in real time, which cannot be shared at the cloud level as they contain personal and sensitive information. Therefore, there is a critical need to go toward decentralized learning solutions to handle efficiently distributed private sub-datasets of manufacturing systems.In this article, we design a new monitoring tool for system disruption related to the localization of mobile resources. Our tool may identify mobile resources (human operators) that are in unexpected locations, and hence has a high probability to disturb production planning. To do so, we use federated deep learning, as distributed learning technique, to build a prediction model of resources locations in manufacturing systems. Our prediction model is generated based on resources locations defined in the initial tasks schedule. Thus, system disruptions are detected, in real time, when comparing predicted locations to the real ones, that is collected through the IoT network. In addition, our monitoring tool is deployed at Fog computing level that provides local data processing support with low latency.Furthermore, once a system disruption is detected, we develop a dynamic rescheduling module that assigns each task to the nearest available resource while improving the execution accuracy and reducing the execution delay. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem of tasks rescheduling, before solving it using the meta-heuristic Tabu search. The numerical results show the efficiency of our schemes in terms of prediction accuracy when compared to other machine learning algorithms, in addition to their ability to detect and resolve system disruption in real time.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",federated learning; fog computing; Industry 4.0; IoT; locations; system disruption prediction; Tabu search; tasks rescheduling,Data handling; Deep learning; Fog; Fog computing; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Location; Monitoring; Production control; Tabu search; Disruption predictions; Federated learning; IoT; Low latency; Mobile resource; Monitoring tools; Prediction modelling; Real- time; System disruption prediction; Task rescheduling; Industry 4.0
The Lord of the Ring Road: A Review and Evaluation of Autonomous Control Policies for Traffic in a Ring Road,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124035902&doi=10.1145%2f3494577&partnerID=40&md5=a5781a781b00cf331fd51e3346536192,"This study focuses on the comprehensive investigation of stop-and-go waves appearing in closed-circuit ring road traffic wherein we evaluate various longitudinal dynamical models for vehicles. It is known that the behavior of human-driven vehicles, with other traffic elements such as density held constant, could stimulate stop-and-go waves, which do not dissipate on the circuit ring road. Stop-and-go waves can be dissipated by adding automated vehicles (AVs) to the ring. Thorough investigations of the performance of AV longitudinal control algorithms were carried out in Flow, which is an integrated platform for reinforcement learning on traffic control. Ten AV algorithms presented in the literature are evaluated. For each AV algorithm, experiments are carried out by varying distributions and penetration rates of AVs. Two different distributions of AVs are studied. For the first distribution scenario, AVs are placed consecutively. Penetration rates are varied from 1 AV (5%) to all AVs (100%). For the second distribution scenario, AVs are placed with even distribution of human-driven vehicles in between any two AVs. In this scenario, penetration rates are varied from 2 AVs (10%) to 11 AVs (50%). Multiple runs (10 runs) are simulated to average out the randomness in the results. From more than 3,000 simulation experiments, we investigated how AV algorithms perform differently with varying distributions and penetration rates while all AV algorithms remained fixed under all distributions and penetration rates. Time to stabilize, maximum headway, vehicle miles traveled, and fuel economy are used to evaluate their performance. Using these metrics, we find that the traffic condition improvement is not necessarily dependent on the distribution for most of the AV controllers, particularly when no cooperation among AVs is considered. Traffic condition is generally improved with a higher AV penetration rate with only one of the AV algorithms showing a contrary trend. Among all AV algorithms in this study, the reinforcement learning controller shows the most consistent improvement under all distributions and penetration rates. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automated vehicle; car-following model; reinforcement learning; ring road,Behavioral research; Fuel economy; Learning algorithms; Longitudinal control; Reinforcement learning; Roads and streets; A-RINGS; Automated vehicles; Autonomous control; Car-following modeling; Control policy; Penetration rates; Performance; Ring roads; Stop-and-go waves; Traffic conditions; Controllers
Detection and Mitigation of Sensor and CAN Bus Attacks in Vehicle Anti-Lock Braking Systems,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124049292&doi=10.1145%2f3495534&partnerID=40&md5=0e85fba58937cdf936ad04ff76166445,"For a modern vehicle, if the sensor in a vehicle anti-lock braking system (ABS) or controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and the driver's life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate, and no method can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack (SA) and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation that considers the real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of attack) by minimizing errors between the predicted vehicle states and the measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from the measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for a vehicle ABS. We conducted the first real SA experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our simulation results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect SA and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also that our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates the attack's effects on a vehicle ABS. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",attack detection; attack mitigation; CAN bus attack; sensor attack; Vehicle ABS,Anti-lock braking systems; Braking; Control system synthesis; Equations of state; Friction; Locks (fasteners); Attack detection; Attack mitigation; Braking controller; Controller area network bus attack; Controller-area-network bus; Detection methods; Mitigation strategy; Sensor attack; Vehicle anti-lock braking system; Vehicle state; Vehicles

However, this separation of concerns can lead to long debugging and integration phases. This is because assumptions made about the implementation platform during the design phase - e.g., related to timing - might not hold in practice, thereby leading to unacceptable control performance. In order to address this, several control/architecture co-design techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of design flows using commercial tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that implements such a co-design method using commercially available design tools in an automotive setting, with the aim of minimally disrupting existing design flows practiced in the industry. The goal of such co-design is to jointly determine controller and platform parameters in order to avoid any design-implementation gap, thereby minimizing implementation time testing and debugging. Our setting involves distributed implementations of control algorithms on automotive electronic control units (ECUs) communicating via a FlexRay bus. The co-design and the associated toolchain Co-Flex jointly determines controller and FlexRay parameters (that impact signal delays) in order to optimize specified design metrics. Co-Flex seamlessly integrates the modeling and analysis of control systems in MATLAB/Simulink with platform modeling and configuration in SIMTOOLS/SIMTARGET that is used for configuring FlexRay bus parameters. It automates the generation of multiple Pareto-optimal design options with respect to the quality of control and the resource usage, that an engineer can choose from. In this article, we outline a step-by-step software development process based on Co-Flex tools for distributed control applications.

This is precisely the contribution of this article.Our Wireless Control Bus (WCB) exploits carefully orchestrated network-wide floods of concurrent transmissions to minimize overhead during quiescent, steady-state periods, and ensures timely and reliable collection of sensor readings and dissemination of actuation commands when an ETC triggering condition is violated. Using a cyber-physical testbed emulating a water distribution system controlled over a real-world multi-hop wireless network, we show that ETC over WCB achieves the same quality of periodic control at a fraction of the energy costs, therefore unleashing and concretely demonstrating its full potential for the first time. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",concurrent transmissions; Event-based control; wireless sensor and actuator networks,Concurrency control; Networked control systems; Quality control; Queueing theory; Reliability theory; Wireless sensor networks; Concurrent transmission; Control bus; Event-based control; Event-triggered controls; Multi-hops; Network stack; Real-world; Wireless control; Wireless networked control systems; Wireless sensors and actuator networks; Water distribution systems

Although increasing the temperature setpoint is a rule-of-thumb approach to reducing the cooling energy usage, the tenants may have different mentalities and technical constraints in accepting higher temperature setpoints. Thus, supporting distinct temperature setpoints is desirable for a co-location data center in pursuing higher energy efficiency. This calls for a new cooling power attribution scheme to address the inter-room heat transfers that can be up to 9% of server load as shown in our real experiments. This article describes our approaches to estimating the inter-room heat transfers, using the estimates to rectify the metered power usages of the rooms' air handling units, and fairly attributing the power usage of the shared cooling infrastructure (i.e., chiller and cooling tower) to server rooms by following the Shapley value principle. Extensive numeric experiments based on a widely accepted cooling system model are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed cooling power attribution scheme. A case study suggests that the proposed scheme incentivizes rational tenants to adopt their highest acceptable temperature setpoints under a non-cooperative game setting. Further analysis considering distinct relative humidity setpoints shows that our proposed scheme also properly and inherently addresses the attribution of humidity control power. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Co-located data centers; cooling power attribution; heat and moisture transfer,Cooling; Energy efficiency; Humidity control; Temperature; Co-located; Co-located data center; Colocations; Cooling power; Cooling power attribution; Datacenter; Heat and moisture transfer; Location data; Power usage; Temperature setpoints; Game theory

They should be aware about the state and environment of the building. This is achieved by developing a sensing system that senses different interesting factors of the building, called as ""facets of sensing.""Depending on the application, different facets need to be sensed at various locations. Existing approaches for sensing these facets consist of deploying sensors at all the places so they can be sensed directly. But installing numerous sensors often aggravate the issues of user inconvenience, cost of installation and maintenance, and generation of e-waste. This article proposes how intelligently using the existing information can help to estimate the facets in cyber-physical systems like buildings, thereby reducing the sensors to be deployed. In this article, an optimization framework has been developed, which optimally deploys sensors in a building such that it satisfies BMS requirements with minimum number of sensors. The proposed solution is applied to real-world scenarios with cyber-physical systems. The results indicate that the proposed optimization framework is able to reduce the number of sensors by 59% and 49% when compared to the baseline and heuristic approach, respectively. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",building management system (BMS); Sensor placement; smart buildings,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Building management system; Heuristics approaches; Optimization framework; Real-world scenario; Sensing systems; Sensor placement; System requirements; Intelligent buildings
Continuous Operator Authentication for Teleoperated Systems Using Hidden Markov Models,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123980860&doi=10.1145%2f3488901&partnerID=40&md5=104239e80c242b49bd6197b68b22e43f,"In this article, we present a novel approach for continuous operator authentication in teleoperated robotic processes based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). While HMMs were originally developed and widely used in speech recognition, they have shown great performance in human motion and activity modeling. We make an analogy between human language and teleoperated robotic processes (i.e., words are analogous to a teleoperator's gestures, sentences are analogous to the entire teleoperated task or process) and implement HMMs to model the teleoperated task. To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve 70% (VR experiment) and 81% (JIGSAWS dataset) continuous classification accuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of detecting an impersonation attack in real-time. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

They are composed of an Internet of Things (IoT), people, and physical content. They differ from traditional computer systems in that their cyber-physical nature ties intimately with the users and the built environment. The impact of ill-programmed applications in such spaces goes beyond loss of data or a computer crash, risking potentially physical harm to the space and its users. Ensuring smart space safety is therefore critically important to successfully deliver intimate and convenient services surrounding our daily lives. By modeling smart space as a highly dynamic database, we present IoT Transactions, an analogy to database transactions, as an abstraction for programming and executing the services as the handling of the devices in smart space. Unlike traditional database management systems that take a ""clear room approach,""smart spaces take a ""dirty room approach""where imperfection and unattainability of full control and guarantees are the new normal. We identify Atomicity, Isolation, Integrity and Durability (AI2D) as the set of properties necessary to define the safe runtime behavior for IoT transactions for maintaining ""permissible device settings""of execution and to avoid or detect and resolve ""impermissible settings.""Furthermore, we introduce a lock protocol, utilizing variations of lock concepts, that enforces AI2D safety properties during transaction processing. We show a brief proof of the protocol correctness and a detailed analytical model to evaluate its performance. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",pervasive computing; Smart spaces; transactions,Automation; Database systems; Information services; Intelligent buildings; Safety engineering; Ubiquitous computing; Built environment; Cyber physicals; Digital services; Physical nature; Smart homes; Smart space; Space use; Traditional computers; Transaction; Users' experiences; Internet of things
Roadrunner+: An Autonomous Intersection Management Cooperating with Connected Autonomous Vehicles and Pedestrians with Spillback Considered,2022,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123983792&doi=10.1145%2f3488246&partnerID=40&md5=716cf21a3d704740e09e039611b3ce06,"The recent emergence of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enables the Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) system, replacing traffic signals and human driving operations for improved safety and road efficiency. When CAVs approach an intersection, AIM schedules their intersection usage in a collision-free manner while minimizing their waiting times. In practice, however, there are pedestrian road-crossing requests and spillback problems, a blockage caused by the congestion of the downstream intersection when the traffic load exceeds the road capacity. As a result, collisions occur when CAVs ignore pedestrians or are forced to the congested road. In this article, we present a cooperative AIM system, named Roadrunner+, which simultaneously considers CAVs, pedestrians, and upstream/downstream intersections for spillback handling, collision avoidance, and efficient CAV controls. The performance of Roadrunner+ is evaluated with the SUMO microscopic simulator. Our experimental results show that Roadrunner+ has 15.16% higher throughput than other AIM systems and 102.53% higher throughput than traditional traffic signals. Roadrunner+ also reduces 75.62% traveling delay compared to other AIM systems. Moreover, the results show that CAVs in Roadrunner+ save up to 7.64% in fuel consumption, and all the collisions caused by spillback are prevented in Roadrunner+. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",autonomous intersection management; Connected autonomous vehicles; cooperation; pedestrian; spillback,Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Traffic signals; Autonomous intersection managements; Autonomous pedestrians; Autonomous Vehicles; Connected autonomous vehicle; Cooperation; Down-stream; High-throughput; Management systems; Pedestrian; Spillback; Autonomous vehicles
Model-driven per-panel solar anomaly detection for residential arrays,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116024105&doi=10.1145%2f3460236&partnerID=40&md5=134fc1d324498faa4c48b336f2cdcdf5,"There has been significant growth in both utility-scale and residential-scale solar installations in recent years, driven by rapid technology improvements and falling prices. Unlike utility-scale solar farms that are professionally managed and maintained, smaller residential-scale installations often lack sensing and instrumentation for performance monitoring and fault detection. As a result, faults may go undetected for long periods of time, resulting in generation and revenue losses for the homeowner. In this article, we present SunDown, a sensorless approach designed to detect per-panel faults in residential solar arrays. SunDown does not require any new sensors for its fault detection and instead uses a model-driven approach that leverages correlations between the power produced by adjacent panels to detect deviations from expected behavior. SunDown can handle concurrent faults in multiple panels and perform anomaly classification to determine probable causes. Using two years of solar generation data from a real home and a manually generated dataset of multiple solar faults, we show that SunDown has a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.98% when predicting per-panel output. Our results show that SunDown is able to detect and classify faults, including from snow cover, leaves and debris, and electrical failures with 99.13% accuracy, and can detect multiple concurrent faults with 97.2% accuracy.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Obligations, permissions, and prohibitions are distinct from a system's mission, and are a necessary part of specifying advanced, adaptive AI-equipped systems. They need a dedicated deontic logic of obligations to formalize them. Most existing deontic logics lack corresponding algorithms and system models that permit automatic verification. We demonstrate how a particular deontic logic, Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU) [23], is a suitable starting point for formalizing the obligations of autonomous systems like self-driving cars. We demonstrate its usefulness by formalizing a subset of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) in DAU; RSS is an industrial proposal for how self-driving cars should and should not behave in traffic. We show that certain logical consequences of RSS are undesirable, indicating a need to further refine the proposal. We also demonstrate how obligations can change over time, which is necessary for long-term autonomy. We then demonstrate a model-checking algorithm for DAU formulas on weighted transition systems and illustrate it by model-checking obligations of a self-driving car controller from the literature.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",autonomous vehicles; Deontic logic; dominance act utilitarianism; model checking; responsibility-sensitive safety,Accident prevention; Computer circuits; Embedded systems; Model checking; Philosophical aspects; Algorithm model; Algorithmics; Automatic reasoning; Autonomous Vehicles; Deontic Logic; Dominance act utilitarianism; Formal framework; Formalisation; Models checking; Responsibility-sensitive safety; Autonomous vehicles

But the lack of interpretability for deep learning models has led to potential security holes. Recent research has found that deep neural networks are vulnerable to well-designed input examples, called adversarial examples. Such examples are often too small to detect, but they completely fool deep learning models. In practice, adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning. With the continuous development of deep learning applications, adversarial examples for different fields have also received attention. In this article, we summarize the methods of generating adversarial examples in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing and study the applications of adversarial examples.

How to train your quadrotor: A framework for consistently smooth and responsive flight control via reinforcement learning,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115996994&doi=10.1145%2f3466618&partnerID=40&md5=2c3e393139a5892a755cae5b47d5ca0c,"We focus on the problem of reliably training Reinforcement Learning (RL) models (agents) for stable low-level control in embedded systems and test our methods on a high-performance, custom-built quadrotor platform. A common but often under-studied problem in developing RL agents for continuous control is that the control policies developed are not always smooth. This lack of smoothness can be a major problem when learning controllers as it can result in control instability and hardware failure.Issues of noisy control are further accentuated when training RL agents in simulation due to simulators ultimately being imperfect representations of reality - what is known as the reality gap. To combat issues of instability in RL agents, we propose a systematic framework, REinforcement-based transferable Agents through Learning (RE+AL), for designing simulated training environments that preserve the quality of trained agents when transferred to real platforms. RE+AL is an evolution of the Neuroflight infrastructure detailed in technical reports prepared by members of our research group. Neuroflight is a state-of-the-art framework for training RL agents for low-level attitude control. RE+AL improves and completes Neuroflight by solving a number of important limitations that hindered the deployment of Neuroflight to real hardware. We benchmark RE+AL on the NF1 racing quadrotor developed as part of Neuroflight. We demonstrate that RE+AL significantly mitigates the previously observed issues of smoothness in RL agents. Additionally, RE+AL is shown to consistently train agents that are flight capable and with minimal degradation in controller quality upon transfer. RE+AL agents also learn to perform better than a tuned PID controller, with better tracking errors, smoother control, and reduced power consumption. To the best of our knowledge, RE+AL agents are the first RL-based controllers trained in simulation to outperform a well-tuned PID controller on a real-world controls problem that is solvable with classical control.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Dynamic bicycle dispatching of dockless public bicycle-sharing systems using multi-objective reinforcement learning,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116049596&doi=10.1145%2f3447623&partnerID=40&md5=31fd1b961d728f5656311d0c4de3f560,"As a new generation of Public Bicycle-sharing Systems (PBS), the Dockless PBS (DL-PBS) is an important application of cyber-physical systems and intelligent transportation. How to use artificial intelligence to provide efficient bicycle dispatching solutions based on dynamic bicycle rental demand is an essential issue for DL-PBS. In this article, we propose MORL-BD, a dynamic bicycle dispatching algorithm based on multi-objective reinforcement learning to provide the optimal bicycle dispatching solution for DL-PBS. We model the DL-PBS system from the perspective of cyber-physical systems and use deep learning to predict the layout of bicycle parking spots and the dynamic demand of bicycle dispatching. We define the multi-route bicycle dispatching problem as a multi-objective optimization problem by considering the optimization objectives of dispatching costs, dispatch truck's initial load, workload balance among the trucks, and the dynamic balance of bicycle supply and demand. On this basis, the collaborative multi-route bicycle dispatching problem among multiple dispatch trucks is modeled as a multi-agent and multi-objective reinforcement learning model. All dispatch paths between parking spots are defined as state spaces, and the reciprocal of dispatching costs is defined as a reward. Each dispatch truck is equipped with an agent to learn the optimal dispatch path in the dynamic DL-PBS network. We create an elite list to store the Pareto optimal solutions of bicycle dispatch paths found in each action, and finally get the Pareto frontier. Experimental results on the actual DL-PBS show that compared with existing methods, MORL-BD can find a higher quality Pareto frontier with less execution time.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",bicycle dispatching; Bicycle-sharing systems; intelligent transportation; multi-objective reinforcement learning; Pareto optimality,Bicycles; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Dynamics; Economics; Intelligent systems; Multi agent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Reinforcement learning; Trucks; Bicycle dispatching; Bicycle sharing; Bicycle-sharing system; Intelligent transportation; Multi objective; Multi-objective reinforcement learning; Pareto-optimality; Parking spot; Public bicycle sharing systems; Sharing systems; Embedded systems

To ensure security to the computer systems in an industrial environment, it is required to build effective intrusion detection systems to monitor the cyber-physical systems (e.g., computer networks) in the industry for malicious activities. This article aims to build such intrusion detection systems to protect the computer networks from cyberattacks. More specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised machine learning approach that combines the K-Means algorithm with the Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in industrial big data scenarios. Since our objective is to build the intrusion detection system for the big data scenario in the industrial domain, we utilize the Apache Spark framework to implement our proposed model that was trained in large network traffic data (about 123 million instances of network traffic) stored in Elasticsearch. Moreover, we evaluate our proposed model on the live streaming data and find that our proposed system can be used for real-time anomaly detection in the industrial setup. In addition, we address different challenges that we face while training our model on large datasets and explicitly describe how these issues were resolved. Based on our empirical evaluation in different use cases for anomaly detection in real-world network traffic data, we observe that our proposed system is effective to detect anomalies in big data scenarios. Finally, we evaluate our proposed model on several academic datasets to compare with other models and find that it provides comparable performance with other state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",IForest-KMeans; Isolation Forest; K-Means; large industrial dataset; streaming data,Anomaly detection; Cyber attacks; Embedded systems; Forestry; Intrusion detection; K-means clustering; Large dataset; Machine learning; Network security; Anomaly detection; Cyber-attacks; Iforest-kmean; Intrusion Detection Systems; Isolation forest; K-means; Large industrial dataset; Network traffic; Streaming data; Computer crime
RAP: A software framework of developing convolutional neural networks for resource-constrained devices using environmental monitoring as a case study,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116006545&doi=10.1145%2f3472612&partnerID=40&md5=dac53573210f5629abceda6d0e44958e,"Monitoring environmental conditions is an important application of cyber-physical systems. Typically, the monitoring is to perceive surrounding environments with battery-powered, tiny devices deployed in the field. While deep learning-based methods, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are promising approaches to enriching the functionalities offered by the tiny devices, they demand more computation and memory resources, which makes these methods difficult to be adopted on such devices. In this article, we develop a software framework, RAP, that permits the construction of the CNN designs by aggregating the existing, lightweight CNN layers, which are able to fit in the limited memory (e.g., several KBs of SRAM) on the resource-constrained devices satisfying application-specific timing constrains. RAP leverages the Python-based neural network framework Chainer to build the CNNs by mounting the C/C++ implementations of the lightweight layers, trains the built CNN models as the ordinary model-training procedure in Chainer, and generates the C version codes of the trained models. The generated programs are compiled into target machine executables for the on-device inferences. With the vigorous development of lightweight CNNs, such as binarized neural networks with binary weights and activations, RAP facilitates the model building process for the resource-constrained devices by allowing them to alter, debug, and evaluate the CNN designs over the C/C++ implementation of the lightweight CNN layers. We have prototyped the RAP framework and built two environmental monitoring applications for protecting endangered species using image- and acoustic-based monitoring methods. Our results show that the built model consumes less than 0.5 KB of SRAM for buffering the runtime data required by the model inference while achieving up to 93% of accuracy for the acoustic monitoring with less than one second of inference time on the TI 16-bit microcontroller platform.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",convolutional neural network design; Cyber-physical system; end-device inference; environmental monitoring application; monitoring endangered species; neural network software framework; resource-constrained devices,Application programs; Conservation; Convolution; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Monitoring; Multilayer neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network design; End-device inference; End-devices; Endangered species; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental monitoring application; Monitoring applications; Monitoring endangered species; Neural network designs; Neural network software; Neural network software framework; Resourceconstrained devices; Software frameworks; Embedded systems
Deep learning to predict the feasibility of priority-based ethernet network configurations,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116040506&doi=10.1145%2f3468890&partnerID=40&md5=bb03a868ec88eac11ce207f03f6c8306,"Machine learning has been recently applied in real-time systems to predict whether Ethernet network configurations are feasible in terms of meeting deadline constraints without executing conventional schedulability analysis. However, the existing prediction techniques require domain expertise to choose the relevant input features and do not perform consistently when topologies or traffic patterns differ significantly from the ones in the training data. To overcome these problems, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) prediction model that synthesizes relevant features directly from the raw data. This deep learning model possesses the ability to exploit relations among flows, links, and queues in switched Ethernet networks and generalizes to unseen topologies and traffic patterns. We also explore the use of ensembles of GNNs and show that it enhances the robustness of the predictions. An evaluation on heterogeneous testing sets comprising realistic automotive networks shows that ensembles of 32 GNN models feature a prediction accuracy ranging from 79.3% to 90% for Ethernet networks using priorities as the Quality-of-Service mechanism. The use of ensemble models provides a speedup factor ranging from 77 to 1,715 compared to schedulability analysis, which allows a far more extensive design space exploration.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",design space exploration; graph neural network; Machine learning; schedulability analysis; time-sensitive networking,Deep learning; Ethernet; Forecasting; Interactive computer systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Real time systems; Topology; Design space exploration; Ethernet networks; Graph neural networks; Network configuration; Priority-based; Real - Time system; Schedulability analysis; Time-sensitive networking; Topology patterns; Traffic pattern; Graph neural networks

However, to use deep neural networks in practice, novel approaches are needed, e.g., for testing. In this work, we focus on the question of how to test deep learning-based visual perception functions for automated driving. Classical approaches for testing are not sufficient: A purely statistical approach based on a dataset split is not enough, as testing needs to address various purposes and not only average case performance. Additionally, a complete specification is elusive due to the complexity of the perception task in the open context of automated driving. In this article, we review and discuss existing work on testing DNNs for visual perception with a special focus on automated driving for test input and test oracle generation as well as test adequacy. We conclude that testing of DNNs in this domain requires several diverse test sets. We show how such tests sets can be constructed based on the presented approaches addressing different purposes based on the presented methods and identify open research questions.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-N-Flying (LNF), a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on the fly, and allows autonomous Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)s managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UASs as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining (1) learning-based decision-making and (2) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UASs on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds) and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1% in the worst case, improving to near 0% in more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",Collision avoidance; Model Predictive Control; neural network; robustness; temporal logic; unmanned aircraft systems,Collision avoidance; Computer circuits; Convex optimization; Decision making; Integer programming; Learning systems; Model predictive control; Motion planning; Robustness (control systems); Air traffics; Collisions avoidance; Decentralised; Manned aircraft; Model-predictive control; Neural-networks; On-the-fly; Robustness; Unmanned aircraft system; Urban air; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
Meta-learning to improve unsupervised intrusion detection in cyber-physical systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107883153&doi=10.1145%2f3467470&partnerID=40&md5=f6a9de8ec72d09efde4bf0b56afebb81,"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classifiers rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to provide functionalities that system architects are often willing to integrate into critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). However, such algorithms may misclassify observations, with potential detrimental effects on the system itself or on the health of people and of the environment. In addition, CPSs may be subject to threats that were not previously known, motivating the need for building Intrusion Detectors (IDs) that can effectively deal with zero-day attacks. Different studies were directed to compare misclassifications of various algorithms to identify the most suitable one for a given system. Unfortunately, even the most suitable algorithm may still show an unsatisfactory number of misclassifications when system requirements are strict. A possible solution may rely on the adoption of meta-learners, which build ensembles of base-learners to reduce misclassifications and that are widely used for supervised learning. Meta-learners have the potential to reduce misclassifications with respect to non-meta learners: however, misleading base-learners may let the meta-learner leaning towards misclassifications and therefore their behavior needs to be carefully assessed through empirical evaluation. To such extent, in this paper we investigate, expand, empirically evaluate, and discuss meta-learning approaches that rely on ensembles of unsupervised algorithms to detect (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs. Our experimental comparison is conducted by means of public datasets belonging to network intrusion detection and biometric authentication systems, which are common IDSs for CPSs. Overall, we selected 21 datasets, 15 unsupervised algorithms and 9 different meta-learning approaches. Results allow discussing the applicability and suitability of meta-learning for unsupervised anomaly detection, comparing metric scores achieved by base algorithms and meta-learners.

Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, data communications between the drones and the ground devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This article develops BloothAir, which is a secure multi-hop aerial relay system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected autonomous drones. For encrypting the BLE communications in BloothAir, a channel-based secret key generation is proposed, where received signal strength at the drones and the ground devices is quantized to generate the secret keys. Moreover, a dynamic programming-based channel quantization scheme is studied to minimize the secret key bit mismatch rate of the drones and the ground devices by recursively adjusting the quantization intervals. To validate the design of BloothAir, we build a multi-hop aerial relay testbed by using the MX400 drone platform and the Gust radio transceiver, which is a new lightweight onboard BLE communicator specially developed for the drone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that the BloothAir system achieves a significantly lower secret key bit mismatch rate than the key generation benchmarks, which use the static quantization intervals.

In residential, rehabilitation, and clinical settings, sensor nodes can be attached to the body of a patient for long-term and uninterrupted monitoring of vital biomedical signals. Likewise, in industrial settings, workers as well as mobile robots can carry sensor nodes to augment their perception and to seamlessly interact with their environments. Nevertheless, such applications require reliable communications as well as high throughput. Considering the primary design goals of the sensing platforms (low-power, affordable cost, large-scale deployment, longevity, operating in the ISM band), maintaining reliable links is a formidable challenge. This challenge can partially be alleviated if the nature of link quality fluctuation can be known or estimated on time. Indeed, higher-level protocols such as handover and routing protocols rely on knowledge of link quality fluctuation to seamlessly transfer communication to alternative routes when the quality of existing routes deteriorates. In this article, we present the result of extensive experimental study to characterise link quality fluctuation in mobile environments. The study focuses on slow movements (<5 km h-1) signifying the movement of people and robots and transceivers complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 specification. Hence, we deployed mobile robots that interact with strategically placed stationary relay nodes. Our study considered different types of link quality characterisation metrics that provide complementary and useful insights. To demonstrate the usefulness of our experiments and observations, we implemented a link quality estimation technique using a Kalman Filter. To set up the model, we employed two link quality metrics along with the statistics we established during our experiments. The article will compare the performance of four proposed approaches with ours. © 2021 ACM.",Handover; Link quality fluctuation; Mobility; Wireless links; Wireless sensor networks,Bioelectric phenomena; IEEE Standards; Industrial robots; Mobile robots; Mobile telecommunication systems; Patient rehabilitation; Radio transceivers; Higher-level protocols; Industrial settings; Large-scale deployment; Link quality estimations; Mobile environments; Mobile wireless sensor network; Movement of peoples; Reliable communication; Sensor nodes
TPrune: Efficient Transformer Pruning for Mobile Devices,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111643729&doi=10.1145%2f3446640&partnerID=40&md5=df9ea30b88c6ec5c42b198b676ed4af2,"The invention of Transformer model structure boosts the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks to an unprecedented level. Many previous works have been done to make the Transformer model more execution-friendly on resource-constrained platforms. These researches can be categorized into three key fields: Model Pruning, Transfer Learning, and Efficient Transformer Variants. The family of model pruning methods are popular for their simplicity in practice and promising compression rate and have achieved great success in the field of convolution neural networks (CNNs) for many vision tasks. Nonetheless, previous Transformer pruning works did not perform a thorough model analysis and evaluation on each Transformer component on off-the-shelf mobile devices. In this work, we analyze and prune transformer models at the line-wise granularity and also implement our pruning method on real mobile platforms. We explore the properties of all Transformer components as well as their sparsity features, which are leveraged to guide Transformer model pruning. We name our whole Transformer analysis and pruning pipeline as TPrune. In TPrune, we first propose Block-wise Structured Sparsity Learning (BSSL) to analyze Transformer model property. Then, based on the characters derived from BSSL, we apply Structured Hoyer Square (SHS) to derive the final pruned models. Comparing with the state-of-the-art Transformer pruning methods, TPrune is able to achieve a higher model compression rate with less performance degradation. Experimental results show that our pruned models achieve 1.16×-1.92× speedup on mobile devices with 0%-8% BLEU score degradation compared with the original Transformer model. © 2021 ACM.",Embedded software; Mobile computing; Model pruning; Neural machine translation; Neural networks; Real-time system,Computer aided language translation; Holmium compounds; Transfer learning; Convolution neural network; Machine translations; Model compression; Performance degradation; Real mobile platforms; Structured sparsities; Transformer modeling; Transformer models; Learning systems

While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400-500 Mhz and 800-900 Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions. © 2021 ACM.",Deep learning; IDS; IoT; Software-defined radio; Wireless security,Efficiency; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Large dataset; Multilayer neural networks; Communication bands; Communication technologies; Detection and diagnosis; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Modulation technologies; Wireless communications; Wireless technologies; Radio communication

Failures in these components may jeopardise the mission of the system. Therefore, identifying the minimal set of critical CPS components that is most likely to fail, and prevent the global system from accomplishing its mission, becomes essential to ensure reliability. In this article, we present a novel approach to identifying the Most Likely Mission-critical Component Set (MLMCS) using AND/OR dependency graphs enriched with independent failure probabilities. We address the MLMCS problem as a Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We translate probabilities into a negative logarithmic space to linearise the problem within MaxSAT. The experimental results conducted with our open source tool LDA4CPS indicate that the approach is both effective and efficient. We also present a case study on complex aircraft systems that shows the feasibility of our approach and its applicability to mission-critical cyber-physical systems.

VIoLET: An Emulation Environment for Validating IoT Deployments at Large Scales,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111654378&doi=10.1145%2f3446346&partnerID=40&md5=43a8f26809fc73afa4b8fc34021543f8,"Internet of Things (IoT) deployments have been growing manifold, encompassing sensors, networks, edge, fog, and cloud resources. Despite the intense interest from researchers and practitioners, most do not have access to large-scale IoT testbeds for validation. Simulation environments that allow analytical modeling are a poor substitute for evaluating software platforms or application workloads in realistic computing environments. Here, we propose a virtual environment for validating Internet of Things at large scales (VIoLET), an emulator for defining and launching large-scale IoT deployments within cloud VMs. It allows users to declaratively specify container-based compute resources that match the performance of native IoT compute devices using Docker. These can be inter-connected by complex topologies on which bandwidth and latency rules are enforced. Users can configure synthetic sensors for data generation as well. We also incorporate models for CPU resource dynamism, and for failure and recovery of the underlying devices. We offer a detailed comparison of VIoLET's compute and network performance between the virtual and physical deployments, evaluate its scaling with deployments with up to 1, 000 devices and 4, 000 device-cores, and validate its ability to model resource dynamism. Our extensive experiments show that the performance of the virtual IoT environment accurately matches the expected behavior, with deviations levels within what is seen in actual physical devices. It also scales to 1, 000s of devices and at a modest cloud computing costs of under 0.15% of the actual hardware cost, per hour of use, with minimal management effort. This IoT emulation environment fills an essential gap between IoT simulators and real deployments. © 2021 ACM.",Cloud computing; Distributed systems; Edge computing; Emulation; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Scalability; Virtual environment,Application programs; Cloud computing costs; Compute resources; Computing environments; Evaluating software; Failure and recoveries; Internet of Things (IOT); Management efforts; Simulation environment; Internet of things

Specifically, we consider a classification problem where system behaviors are described using formulae of Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Given a finite set of pairs of system traces and labels, where each label indicates whether the corresponding trace exhibits some system property, we devised a decision-tree-based framework that outputs an STL formula that can distinguish the traces. We also extend this approach to the online learning scenario. In this setting, it is assumed that new signals may arrive over time and the previously inferred formula should be updated to accommodate the new data. The proposed approach presents some advantages over traditional machine learning classifiers. In particular, the produced formulae are interpretable and can be used in other phases of the system's operation, such as monitoring and control. We present two case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms: (1) a fault detection problem in an automotive system and (2) an anomaly detection problem in a maritime environment. © 2021 ACM.",Anomaly detection; Classification; Decision trees; Formal methods; Impurity measure; Logic inference; Online learning; Signal temporal logic; Specification mining; Supervised learning,Anomaly detection; Computer circuits; Decision trees; E-learning; Fault detection; Learning systems; Automotive Systems; Execution trace; Fault detection problem; High level description; Maritime environment; Monitoring and control; Online learning; System behaviors; Temporal logic

Among the available model languages, the synchronous dataflow paradigm, as implemented in languages such as MATLAB Simulink or ANSYS SCADE, has become predominant in critical embedded system industries. Both of these frameworks are used to design the controller itself but also provide code generation means, enabling faster deployment to target and easier V&V activities performed earlier in the design process, at the model level. Synchronous models also ease the definition of formal specification through the use of synchronous observers, attaching requirements to the model in the very same language, mastered by engineers and tooled with simulation means or code generation. However, few works address the automatic synthesis of MATLAB Simulink annotations from lower-level models or code. This article presents a compilation process from Lustre models to genuine MATLAB Simulink, without the need to rely on external C functions or MATLAB functions. This translation is based on the modular compilation of Lustre to imperative code and preserves the hierarchy of the input Lustre model within the generated Simulink one. We implemented the approach and used it to validate a compilation toolchain, mapping Simulink to Lustre and then C, thanks to equivalence testing and checking. This backward compilation from Lustre to Simulink also provides the ability to produce automatically Simulink components modeling specification, proof arguments, or test cases coverage criteria. © 2021 ACM.",Equivalence checking; Formal verification; Model-based design; Simulink; Translation validation,Data flow analysis; Equivalence classes; Formal specification; MATLAB; Automatic synthesis; Compilation process; Equivalence testing; Model specifications; Model- based designs; Synchronous Dataflow; Synchronous models; Systems applications; Embedded systems
Using Machine Learning for Dependable Outlier Detection in Environmental Monitoring Systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108140216&doi=10.1145%2f3445812&partnerID=40&md5=23c9c08382496337d25aedab7e5ebe34,"Sensor platforms used in environmental monitoring applications are often subject to harsh environmental conditions while monitoring complex phenomena. Therefore, designing dependable monitoring systems is challenging given the external disturbances affecting sensor measurements. Even the apparently simple task of outlier detection in sensor data becomes a hard problem, amplified by the difficulty in distinguishing true data errors due to sensor faults from deviations due to natural phenomenon, which look like data errors. Existing solutions for runtime outlier detection typically assume that the physical processes can be accurately modeled, or that outliers consist in large deviations that are easily detected and filtered by appropriate thresholds. Other solutions assume that it is possible to deploy multiple sensors providing redundant data to support voting-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new methodology for dependable runtime detection of outliers in environmental monitoring systems, aiming to increase data quality by treating them. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to model each sensor behavior, exploiting the existence of correlated data provided by other related sensors. Using these models, along with knowledge of processed past measurements, it is possible to obtain accurate estimations of the observed environment parameters and build failure detectors that use these estimations. When a failure is detected, these estimations also allow one to correct the erroneous measurements and hence improve the overall data quality. Our methodology not only allows one to distinguish truly abnormal measurements from deviations due to complex natural phenomena, but also allows the quantification of each measurement quality, which is relevant from a dependability perspective. We apply the methodology to real datasets from a complex aquatic monitoring system, measuring temperature and salinity parameters, through which we illustrate the process for building the machine learning prediction models using a technique based on Artificial Neural Networks, denoted ANNODE (ANN Outlier Detection). From this application, we also observe the effectiveness of our ANNODE approach for accurate outlier detection in harsh environments. Then we validate these positive results by comparing ANNODE with state-of-the-art solutions for outlier detection. The results show that ANNODE improves existing solutions regarding accuracy of outlier detection. © 2021 ACM.",Aquatic monitoring; Data quality; Dependability; Machine learning; Neural networks; Outlier detection,Anomaly detection; Complex networks; Machine learning; Neural networks; Patient monitoring; Predictive analytics; Environmental conditions; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental monitoring system; External disturbances; Machine learning techniques; Measurement quality; Measuring temperature; Sensor measurements; Statistics

Long-term, stealthy attacks such as Stuxnet can be described as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here, we extend our previous work on hypergames and APTs to develop hypergame-based defender strategies that are robust to deception and do not rely on attack detection. These strategies provide provable bounds - and provably optimal bounds - on the attacker payoff. Strategies based on Bayesian priors do not provide such bounds. We then numerically demonstrate our approach on a building control subsystem and discuss next steps in extending this approach toward an operational capability. © 2021 ACM.",Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical security; Game theory; Optimal control,Embedded systems; Network security; Robust control; Attack detection; Bayesian priors; Building control subsystems; Cyber-attacks; Hypergame; Operational capabilities; Optimal bounds; Remote monitoring and control; Computer crime

These various models are necessary because of the coupled physical and computational dynamics present in cyber-physical systems. However, to date the different model views of cyber-physical systems are largely related informally, which raises issues with the degree of formal consistency between those various models of requirements, system behavior, and system architecture. We present a category-theoretic framework to make different types of composition explicit in the modeling and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which could assist in verifying the system as a whole. This compositional framework for cyber-physical systems gives rise to unified system models, where system behavior is hierarchically decomposed and related to a system architecture using the systems-as-algebras paradigm. As part of this paradigm, we show that an algebra of (safety) contracts generalizes over the state of the art, providing more uniform mathematical tools for constraining the behavior over a richer set of composite cyber-physical system models, which has the potential of minimizing or eliminating hazardous behavior. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Applied category theory; Contracts; Systems modeling,Algebra; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Semantics; Categorical semantics; Computational dynamics; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Mathematical tools; Model and analysis; State of the art; System architectures; System behaviors; Cyber Physical System

Services provided by ride-sharing systems such as taxis, mobility-on-demand autonomous vehicles, and bike sharing systems are popular. This paradigm provides opportunities for improving transportation systems' performance by allocating ride-sharing vehicles toward predicted demand proactively. However, how to deal with uncertainties in the predicted demand probability distribution for improving the average system performance is still a challenging and unsolved task. Considering this problem, in this work, we develop a data-driven distributionally robust vehicle balancing method to minimize the worst-case expected cost. We design efficient algorithms for constructing uncertainty sets of demand probability distributions for different prediction methods and leverage a quad-tree dynamic region partition method for better capturing the dynamic spatialoral properties of the uncertain demand. We then derive an equivalent computationally tractable form for numerically solving the distributionally robust problem. We evaluate the performance of the data-driven vehicle balancing algorithm under different demand prediction and region partition methods based on four years of taxi trip data for New York City (NYC). We show that the average total idle driving distance is reduced by 30% with the distributionally robust vehicle balancing method using quad-tree dynamic region partitions, compared with vehicle balancing methods based on static region partitions without considering demand uncertainties. This is about a 60-million-mile or a 8-million-dollar cost reduction annually in NYC. © 2021 ACM.",average idle distance; Distributionally robust vehicle balancing; dynamic region partition; uncertain demand sets,Cost reduction; Metadata; Optimization; Taxicabs; Vehicle performance; Balancing algorithms; Demand prediction; Demand uncertainty; On-demand systems; Prediction methods; Robust optimization; Transportation system; Uncertain demand; Probability distributions

It has recently gained considerable attention in the automotive industry, where it was successfully applied to master the distribution of software applications on multi-core electronic control units. However, the LET abstraction in its conventional form is only valid within the scope of a single component. With the recent introduction of System-level Logical Execution Time (SL LET), the concept could be transferred to a system-wide scope. This article improves over a first paper on SL LET, by providing matured definitions and an extensive discussion of the concept. It also features a comprehensive evaluation exploring the impacts of SL LET with regard to design, verification, performance, and implementability. The evaluation goes far beyond the contexts in which LET was originally applied. Indeed, SL LET allows us to address many open challenges in the design and verification of complex embedded hardware/software systems addressing predictability, synchronization, composability, and extensibility. Furthermore, we investigate performance trade-offs, and we quantify implementation costs by providing an analysis of the additionally required buffers. © 2021 Owner/Author.",composability; data flow determinism; distributed execution platform; Embedded software; logical execution time; real-time programming models; time determinism,Application programs; Computer programming; Economic and social effects; Electronics industry; Embedded systems; Comprehensive evaluation; Electronic control units; Embedded hardware/software systems; Introduction of systems; Logical execution time; Performance trade-off; Programming abstractions; Software applications; Verification

Current wireless communication technologies are incapable of meeting the communication requirements of range and bounded delays needed for the control of WA-CPSs. To solve this problem, we use a Control Communication Co-design approach for WA-CPSs, that we refer to as the C3 approach, to design a novel Low-Power Wide Area (LPWA) MAC protocol called Ctrl-MAC and its associated event-triggered controller that can guarantee the closed-loop stability of a WA-CPS. This is the first article to show that LPWA wireless communication technologies can support the control of WA-CPSs. LPWA technologies are designed to support one-way communication for monitoring and are not appropriate for control.

Composable Finite State Machine-based Modeling for Quality-of-Information-aware Cyber-physical Systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100391354&doi=10.1145%2f3386244&partnerID=40&md5=a3abd05d68420ad850f4919bd20b6ed6,"Time plays a major role in the specification of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) behavior with concurrency, timeliness, asynchrony, and resource limits as their main characteristics. In addition to timeliness, the specification of CPS needs to assess and unambiguously define its behavior with respect to the other Quality-of-Information (QoI) properties: (1) Correctness, (2) Completeness, (3) Consistency, and (4) Accuracy. Very often, CPS need to handle these QoI properties, and any combination thereof, multiple times when performing computation and communication processes. However, a model-driven and systematic approach to specify CPS behavior that jointly considers combined QoI aspects is possible but missing in existing methodologies. As the first contribution of this work, we provide an extension to an established model of computation (MoC) based on ""Functions driven by Finite State Machine""(FunState) to enable a model-driven composition mechanism to create CPS behavior specifications from reusable components. Second, we present a novel set of design patterns to illustrate the modeling of QoI-aware CPS specifications that can be applied in several state-of-the-art Electronic System Level (ESL) methodologies. The time semantics of the MoC are formalized using the tagged-signal-model, and the presented model-driven approach enables the composition of multiple design patterns. The main benefits of the presented model-driven approach and design patterns to create CPS specifications are as follows: (a) reduce modeling effort, errors, and time through the reuse of known recipes to re-incurring tasks and allow to automatically generate repetitive control flows based on extended Finite State Machines; (b) increase system robustness and facilitate the creation of holistic QoI management allowing to unambiguously define system behavior for scenarios with single/multiple QoI requirement violations in different models of computation; (c) dynamically validate timing behavior of system implementations to enable a multi-objective optimization of nonfunctional properties that influence CPS timing. We demonstrate the aforementioned benefits through the modeling and evaluation of an infrastructure-assisted automated driving case study using Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) communications to distribute QoI critical road environment information. © 2021 Owner/Author.",cyber-physical systems; design patterns; moc; model of computation; model-driven design; performance; quality-of-information; Time; timeliness,Automobile electronic equipment; Computer aided software engineering; Cyber Physical System; Finite automata; Multiobjective optimization; Semantics; Specifications; System theory; Vehicle to infrastructure; Behavior specifications; Composition mechanisms; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Electronic system level; Extended finite state machine; Non functional properties; Quality of information; Quality of informations (QoI); Embedded systems

To maximize the service efficiency of the in-motion wireless chargers, we must properly coordinate the traffic of the EVs to avoid the generation of congestion at the charger lanes and on the road segments to them. In this article, we propose WPT-Opt, a game-theoretic approach for optimizing in-motion wireless charging efficiency, minimizing EVs' driving time to the charger, and avoiding traffic congestion at the charger lanes to fulfill this task. We studied a metropolitan-scale dataset of public transportation EVs and observed the EVs' spatial and temporal preference in selecting chargers, competition for chargers during busy charging times, the relationship between vehicle density and driving velocity on a road segment, the normal distribution of travel time of road segments, and the fact that vehicles have similar frequently driven trajectories. Based on the observations, a central controller estimates the vehicle density of the road segments by measuring the vehicles' trajectory travel time, the friendship among the vehicles, and the vehicles' routing choice given the presence of charger lanes. Then, we formulate a non-cooperative Stackelberg game between all the EVs and the central controller, in which each EV aims at minimizing its charging time cost to its selected target charger, while the central controller tries to maximally avoid the generation of congestion on the way through the in-motion wireless chargers. Our trace-driven experiments on SUMO demonstrate that WPT-Opt can maximally reduce the average charging time cost of the EVs by approximately 200% during different hours of a day. © 2021 ACM.",EV driving velocity optimization; game theory; Wireless power transfer,Charging time; Controllers; Efficiency; Electric vehicles; Game theory; Normal distribution; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Wireless power transfer; Charging efficiency; Driving velocity; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Non-cooperative; Public transportation; Stackelberg Games; Trace driven experiments; Vehicle density; Wireless charging
Security in centralized data store-based home automation platforms: A systematic analysis of nESt and hue,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100321464&doi=10.1145%2f3418286&partnerID=40&md5=53ab45ad9a7ced04aaa8fcceb4b5c153,"Home automation platforms enable consumers to conveniently automate various physical aspects of their homes. However, the security flaws in the platforms or integrated third-party products can have serious security and safety implications for the user's physical environment. This article describes our systematic security evaluation of two popular smart home platforms, Google's Nest platform and Philips Hue, which implement home automation “routines” (i.e., trigger-action programs involving apps and devices) via manipulation of state variables in a centralized data store. Our semi-automated analysis examines, among other things, platform access control enforcement, the rigor of non-system enforcement procedures, and the potential for misuse of routines, and it leads to 11 key findings with serious security implications. We combine several of the vulnerabilities we find to demonstrate the first end-to-end instance of lateral privilege escalation in the smart home, wherein we remotely disable the Nest Security Camera via a compromised light switch app. Finally, we discuss potential defenses, and the impact of the continuous evolution of smart home platforms on the practicality of security analysis. Our findings draw attention to the unique security challenges of smart home platforms and highlight the importance of enforcing security by design. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Lateral privilege escalation; Overprivilege; Routines; Smart home,Access control; Ambient intelligence; Access control enforcements; Physical environments; Security analysis; Security challenges; Security implications; Semi-automated analysis; Systematic analysis; Systematic security; Automation
User Placement and Optimal Cooling Energy for Co-working Building Spaces,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100389708&doi=10.1145%2f3432818&partnerID=40&md5=a09533bfaa12ccd82c977939cefb2fe7,"Increasing real estate and other infrastructure costs have resulted in the trend of co-working offices where users pay as they use for individual desks. Co-working offices that provide personalized comfort need to address users with potentially widely varying thermal comfort preferences. Providing personalized comfort in cabins separated by physical partitions with neighboring thermal zones or open-plan offices with a single actuator has received attention in the literature. In this article, the problem of minimizing user discomfort in open-plan co-working offices with multiple actuators while being cognizant of the energy consumed is considered. Specifically, the decision problems of assigning users to desks based on their thermal preferences and jointly controlling the multiple actuators are addressed. The non-linearities in the underlying thermodynamic constraints and the seating decision together make the problem computationally hard. A two-step heuristic that addresses these issues is presented. First, using a model that accounts for spatiooral thermodynamics, a one-time assignment of users to desks is performed that reduces the thermal resistance faced by the HVAC systems to provide the preferred comfort levels. Next, the setpoints are decided for all actuators to jointly minimize user discomfort by optimization and model-predictive control. Further, scalability is addressed by clustering user preferences and the associated HVAC actuators' setpoints for the cases where a large number of actuators may be present in the room. © 2021 ACM.",Co-working space; HVAC energy; temperature control; thermal comfort; user seating,Actuators; Climate control; Model predictive control; Office buildings; Optimization; Thermodynamics; Clustering users; Decision problems; Infrastructure costs; Number of actuators; Open-plan offices; Single actuators; Thermal preferences; Thermodynamic constraints; HVAC
A Differentially Private Incentive Design for Traffic Offload to Public Transportation,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100401260&doi=10.1145%2f3430847&partnerID=40&md5=a71a7290ff10ae89f6af99cc35163045,"Increasingly large trip demands have strained urban transportation capacity, which consequently leads to traffic congestion and rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, we focus on achieving sustainable transportation by incentivizing passengers to switch from private cars to public transport. We address the following challenges. First, the passengers incur inconvenience costs when changing their transit behaviors due to delay and discomfort, and thus need to be reimbursed. Second, the inconvenience cost, however, is unknown to the government when choosing the incentives. Furthermore, changing transit behaviors raises privacy concerns from passengers. An adversary could infer personal information (e.g., daily routine, region of interest, and wealth) by observing the decisions made by the government, which are known to the public. We adopt the concept of differential privacy and propose privacy-preserving incentive designs under two settings, denoted as two-way communication and one-way communication. Under two-way communication, passengers submit bids and then the government determines the incentives, whereas in one-way communication, the government simply sets a price without acquiring information from the passengers. We formulate the problem under two-way communication as a mixed integer linear program and propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. We show the proposed approach achieves truthfulness, individual rationality, social optimality, and differential privacy. Under one-way communication, we focus on how the government should design the incentives without revealing passengers' inconvenience costs while still preserving differential privacy. We formulate the problem as a convex program and propose a differentially private and near-optimal solution algorithm. A numerical case study using the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data source is presented as evaluation. The results show that the proposed approaches achieve a win-win situation in which both the government and passengers obtain non-negative utilities. © 2021 ACM.",differential privacy; incentive design; Intelligent transportation system,Approximation algorithms; Convex optimization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Image segmentation; Integer programming; Polynomial approximation; Traffic congestion; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Individual rationality; Mixed integer linear program; Near-optimal solutions; Performance measurement system; Polynomial time approximation algorithms; Sustainable transportation; Transportation capacity; Two way communications; Privacy by design
Extending Signal Temporal Logic with Quantitative Semantics by Intervals for Robust Monitoring of Cyber-physical Systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100404375&doi=10.1145%2f3377868&partnerID=40&md5=d804c23235095af36da694b22b0ed76f,"Monitoring is the core procedure of runtime verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and provides an evaluation of a signal with respect to a given specification. For formally specifying requirements with time constraints for CPS, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a well-known specification language with powerful semantics. However, with existing semantics of STL it is not feasible to monitor signals with spatial deviation and time delay. Therefore, we introduce STL with Quantitative Interval Semantics to solve this problem. Based on this newly developed semantics, we derived an algorithm called RoMoTeS (Robust Monitoring for Temporal Specifications) to monitor a signal with finite length with respect to an STL formula. It provides a real-valued interval for every point in time, which contains all possible signed distances between the deviation polytope determined by the measured data point (exposed to deviation and delay) and the permissive space specified by an STL specification. Furthermore, it is proven that no satisfaction is reported when the signal is potentially falsifying such a specification. Finally, an automatic transmission controller model was used as a case study to show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed algorithm. © 2021 ACM.",monitoring; runtime verification; Signal temporal logic,Computer circuits; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Semantics; Specification languages; Specifications; Automatic transmission; Controller models; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Robust monitoring; Run-time verification; Spatial deviation; Temporal specification; Time constraints; Temporal logic
Taming the State-space Explosion in the Makespan Optimization of Flexible Manufacturing Systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100442203&doi=10.1145%2f3426194&partnerID=40&md5=4c91fca77d8c827451acac22162d94bf,"This article presents a modular automaton-based framework to specify flexible manufacturing systems and to optimize the makespan of product batches. The Batch Makespan Optimization (BMO) problem is NP-Hard and optimization can therefore take prohibitively long, depending on the size of the state-space induced by the specification. To tame the state-space explosion problem, we develop an algebra based on automata equivalence and inclusion relations that consider both behavior and structure. The algebra allows us to systematically relate the languages induced by the automata, their state-space sizes, and their solutions to the BMO problem. Further, we introduce a novel constraint-based approach to systematically prune the state-space based on the the notions of nonpermutation-repulsiveness and permutation-attractiveness. We prove that constraining a nonpermutation-repulsing automaton with a permutation-attracting constraint always reduces the state-space. This approach allows us to (i) compute optimal solutions of the BMO problem when the (additional) constraints are taken into account and (ii) compute bounds for the (original) BMO problem (without using the constraints). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by optimizing an industrial wafer handling controller. © 2021 ACM.",Flexible manufactoring systems; formal specification; makespan optimization; max plus linear systems,Algebra; Automata theory; Flexible manufacturing systems; NP-hard; Optimization; Robots; Constraint-based; Inclusion relation; Makespan; Optimal solutions; State-space explosion; Wafer handling; Aerospace industry
TangleCV: A distributed ledger technique for secure message sharing in connected vehicles,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100301944&doi=10.1145%2f3404500&partnerID=40&md5=259b1070a013c068d5df9ddd3d8d8fd7,"Connected vehicles are set to define the future of transportation; however, this upcoming technology continues to be plagued with serious security risks. If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph-based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy. The standard deviation of error measurements for nodes experiencing tampering attack is around 60% higher as compared to nodes that do not experience such an attack. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blockchain; Connected vehicles; Directed acyclic graph; IOTA; Security; Tangle,Blockchain; Data Sharing; Directed graphs; Graphic methods; Computational costs; Cumulative weight; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Error measurements; Protection mechanisms; Standard deviation; Timing constraints; Vehicular networks; Vehicles
Decentralized firmware attestation for in-vehicle networks,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100299272&doi=10.1145%2f3418685&partnerID=40&md5=d4668fd0cb1708d6d0a38110c2645121,"Today's vehicles are examples of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) controlled by a large number of electronic control units (ECUs), which manage everything from heating to steering and braking. Due to the increasing complexity and inter-dependency of these units, it has become essential for an ECU to be able to ensure the integrity of the firmware running on other ECU's to guarantee its own correct operation. Existing solutions for firmware attestation use a centralized approach, which means a single point of failure. In this article, we propose and investigate a decentralized firmware attestation scheme for the automotive domain. The basic idea of this scheme is that each ECU can attest to the state of those ECU's on which it depends. Two flavors of ECU attestation, i.e., parallel and serial solution, were designed, implemented, and evaluated. The two variants were compared in terms of both detection performance (i.e., the ability to identify unauthorized firmware modifications) and timing performance. Our results show that the proposed scheme is feasible to implement and that the parallel solution showed a significant improvement in timing performance over the serial solution. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Attestation; Communication system security; ECU; Firmware; Integrity,Embedded systems; Firmware; Automotive domains; Centralized approaches; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Detection performance; Electronic control units; In-vehicle networks; Inter-dependencies; Parallel solutions; Control systems
Assessing the severity of smart attacks in industrial cyber-physical systems,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100287513&doi=10.1145%2f3422369&partnerID=40&md5=e4ede3ec054bddb6e1c6b6b610d09360,"Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) are heterogeneous inter-operating parts that can be physical, technical, networking, and even social like agent operators. Incrementally, they perform a central role in critical and industrial infrastructures, governmental, and personal daily life. Especially with the Industry 4.0 revolution, they became more dependent on the connectivity by supporting novel communication and distance control functionalities, which expand their attack surfaces that result in a high risk for cyber-attacks. Furthermore, regarding physical and social constraints, they may push up new classes of security breaches that might result in serious economic damages. Thus, designing a secure ICPS is a complex task, since this needs to guarantee security and harmonize the functionalities between the various parts that interact with different technologies. This article highlights the significance of cyber-security infrastructure and shows how to evaluate, prevent, and mitigate ICPS-based cyber-attacks. We carried out this objective by establishing an adequate semantics for ICPS's entities and their composition, which includes social actors that act differently than mobile robots and automated processes. This article also provides the feasible attacks generated by a reinforcement learning mechanism based on multiple criteria that selects both appropriate actions for each ICPS component and the possible countermeasures for mitigation. To efficiently analyze ICPS's security, we proposed a model-checking-based framework that relies on a set of predefined attacks from where the security requirements are used to assess how well the model is secure. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we model, analyze, and evaluate the ICPS security on two real use cases. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Artificial intelligence; Countermeasures; CPS; Cyber-security; Formal methods; Knowledge; Multi-criteria selection; Probabilistic verification; Reinforcement learning; Smart attacks,Automation; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Model checking; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Automated process; Distance control; Economic damages; Industrial infrastructure; Multiple criteria; Security breaches; Security requirements; Social constraints; Computer crime
Safe and private forward-trading platform for transactive microgrids,2021,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100307601&doi=10.1145%2f3403711&partnerID=40&md5=e571ec1fea754757da27e36d49c00aa8,"Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

IoT connects billions of devices that collect data from the physical environment, which are pre-processed at the edge and then forwarded to processing services at the core of the infrastructure, on top of which cloud-based applications are built and provided to mobile end users. IoT comes with important advantages in terms of applications and added value for its users, making their world smarter and simpler. These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters untrusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blockchain; Internet of Things; Trustworthiness,Blockchain; Data acquisition; Health risks; Privacy by design; Trusted computing; Adaptation process; Cloud-based applications; Critical domain; Data collection; Internet of Things (IOT); Physical devices; Physical environments; Single decision; Internet of things

ICS are found in, among others, critical infrastructures such as water treatment plants, water distribution systems, and the electric power grid.

An experimental study was conducted with replay attacks launched on an operational water distribution (WADI) plant to understand under what conditions an attacker/attack can remain undetected while stealing water. A detection method, based on an input-output Linear Time-invariant system model of the physical process, was developed and implemented in WADI to detect such attacks.

Offering this kind of service requires accessing the physical position of users together with the access authorizations, i.e., who is authorized to access what information. However, these physical positions and authorizations are sensitive information that have to be kept secret from any adversary, including the service providers. As far as we know, the problem of offering location-based services in mobile social networks with a revocation feature under collusion assumption, i.e., an adversary colludes with the service provider, has not been studied. In this article, we show how to solve this problem in the example of range queries. Specifically, we guarantee any adversary, including the service provider, is not able to learn (1) the physical position of the users, (2) the distance between his position and that of the users, and (3) whether two users are allowed to learn the distance between them. We propose two approaches, namely, two-layer symmetric encryption and two-layer attribute-based encryption. The main difference between them is that they use, among other encryption schemes, symmetric and attribute-based encryption, respectively. Next, we prove the secrecy guarantees of both approaches, analyze their complexity, and provide experiments to evaluate their performance in practice. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Over these networks, people usually create content, a skillful worker profile, and provide services that are normally watched and used by other users, thus developing a social network among people termed as the Internet of People. Malicious users could also utilize such platforms for spreading unwanted content that could bring catastrophic consequences to a social network provider and the society, if not identified on time. The use of trust management over these networks plays a vital role in the success of these services. Crowd-sensing people or network users for their views about certain content or content creators could be a potential solution to assess the trustworthiness of content creators and their content. However, the human involvement in crowd-sensing would have challenges of privacy preservation and preventing intentional assignment of the fake high score given to certain user/content. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel trust model that evaluates the aggregate trustworthiness of the content creator and the content without compromising the privacy of the participating people in a crowdsource group. The proposed system has inherent properties of privacy protection of participants, performs operations in the decentralized setup, and considers the trust weights of participants in a private and secure way. The system ensures privacy of participants under the malicious and honest-but-curious adversarial models. We evaluated the performance of the system by developing a prototype and applying it to different real data from different online social networks. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Content rating; Crowdsourcing; Privacy-preserving system; Trustworthiness,Privacy by design; Catastrophic consequences; Content creators; Internet technology; On-line social networks; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Trust aggregations; Social networking (online)
MC-Safe: Multi-channel Real-time V2V Communication for Enhancing Driving Safety,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095974211&doi=10.1145%2f3394961&partnerID=40&md5=86c11fa85542fd62594165b1d796f41f,"In a Vehicular Cyber Physical System (VCPS), ensuring the real-time delivery of safety messages is an important research problem for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication. Unfortunately, existing work relies only on one or two pre-selected control channels for safety message communication, which can result in poor packet delivery and potential accident when the vehicle density is high. If all the available channels can be dynamically utilized when the control channel is having severe contention, then safety messages can have a much better chance to meet their real-time deadlines. In this article, we propose MC-Safe, a multi-channel V2V communication framework that monitors all the available channels and dynamically selects the best one for safety message transmission. During normal driving, MC-Safe monitors periodic beacons sent by other vehicles and estimates the communication delay on all the channels. Upon the detection of a potential accident, MC-Safe leverages a novel channel negotiation scheme that allows all the involved vehicles to work collaboratively, in a distributed manner, for identifying a communication channel that meets the delay requirement. MC-safe also features a novel coordinator selection algorithm that minimizes the delay of channel negotiation. Once a channel is selected, all the involved vehicles switch to the same selected channel for real-time communication with the least amount of interference. Our evaluation results both in simulation and on a hardware testbed with scaled cars show that MC-Safe outperforms existing single-channel solutions and other well-designed multi-channel baselines by having a 23.4% lower packet delay on average compared with other well-designed channel selection baselines.  © 2020 ACM.",Cyber-physical system; real-time communication; V2V networks,Accidents; Embedded systems; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Vehicles; Available channels; Communication delays; Coordinator selection; Evaluation results; Negotiation schemes; Real-time communication; Research problems; V2V communications; Vehicle to vehicle communications

This raised public awareness about the possibility of similar attacks against other industrial targets-including critical infrastructure. In this article, we use hypergames to analyze how strategic perturbations of sensor readings and calibrated parameters can be used to manipulate a system that employs optimal control. Hypergames form an extension of game theory that enables us to model strategic interactions where the players may have significantly different perceptions of the game(s) they are playing. Past work with hypergames has focused on relatively simple interactions consisting of a small set of discrete choices for each player. Here, we apply single-stage hypergames to larger systems with continuous variables. We find that manipulating constraints can be a more effective attacker strategy than manipulating objective function parameters. Moreover, the attacker need not change the underlying system to carry out a successful attack-it may be sufficient to deceive the defender controlling the system. It is possible to scale our approach up to even larger systems, but this will depend on the characteristics of the system in question, and we identify several characteristics that will make those systems amenable to hypergame analysis.  © 2020 ACM.",advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical security; game theory; optimal control,Cyber Physical System; Game theory; Security of data; Continuous variables; Cyber-Physical securities; Hypergame analysis; Industrial control systems; Objective functions; Public awareness; Strategic interactions; Underlying systems; Control systems

In this article, we propose a novel approach to design controller that (i) guarantees the safety of nonlinear physical systems, (ii) enables safe system restart during runtime, and (iii) allows the use of complex, unverified controllers (e.g., neural networks) that drive the physical systems toward complex specifications. We use abstraction-based controller synthesis approach to design a formally verified controller that provides application and system-level fault tolerance along with safety guarantee. Moreover, our approach is implementable using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) processing unit. To demonstrate the efficacy of our solution and to verify the safety of the system under various types of faults injected in applications and in the underlying real-time operating system (RTOS), we implemented the proposed controller for the inverted pendulum and three degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) helicopter.  © 2020 ACM.",abstraction-based control; Cyber-physical systems; fault-tolerance; full system restart; nonlinear systems,Commercial off-the-shelf; Complex networks; Computer operating systems; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Flight control systems; Safety engineering; Controller synthesis; Critical environment; Design controllers; Embedded control systems; Nonlinear physical systems; Real time operating system; Software fault tolerances; Three degrees of freedom; Embedded systems
Self-aware Power Management for Maintaining Event Detection Probability of Supercapacitor-powered Cyber-physical Systems,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095968619&doi=10.1145%2f3375407&partnerID=40&md5=0b4e5294fbdba21ec6dcb44702352676,"In this article, the self-aware power management framework is investigated for maintaining event detection probability of supercapacitor-powered cyber-physical systems, with a radar network system as an example. Maintaining the event detection probability of the radar network is decomposed as a problem of controlling the quality of service of each network node. Then a power management method based on model predictive control and particle swarm optimization is proposed for tracking the reference quality of service of each node while satisfying the operation constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through three simulation studies that cover both single node and network scenarios. In addition, to support the proposed power management method, an online state of charge prediction method is developed for the supercapacitor. The online prediction method adopts a supercapacitor model that describes both the ohmic leakage and charge redistribution phenomena and uses online model updating to more accurately capture the supercapacitor behavior and estimate the stored energy.  © 2020 ACM.",cyber-physical system; power management; radar network; Supercapacitor,Battery management systems; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Model predictive control; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Probability; Quality of service; Tracking radar; Charge redistribution; Management frameworks; Online prediction; Operation constraint; Power management method; Prediction methods; Simulation studies; Super-capacitor modeling; Supercapacitor

CAVs approaching an intersection can exchange information with the infrastructure or each other to schedule their cross times. By avoiding unnecessary stops, scheduling CAVs can increase traffic throughput, reduce energy consumption, and most importantly, minimize the number of accidents that happen in intersection areas due to human errors. We study existing intersection management approaches from following key perspectives: (1) intersection management interface, (2) scheduling policy, (3) existing wireless technologies, (4) existing vehicle models used by researchers and their impact, (5) conflict detection, (6) extension to multi-intersection management, (7) challenges of supporting human-driven vehicles, (8) safety and robustness required for real-life deployment, (9) graceful degradation and recovery for emergency scenarios, (10) security concerns and attack models, and (11) evaluation methods.

As localization plays an increasingly safety-critical role, location systems must be able to identify and eliminate faulty measurements to prevent dangerously inaccurate localization. In this article, we consider the range-based localization problem and propose a method to detect coordinated adversarial corruption on anchor positions and distance measurements. Our algorithm, Gordian, rapidly finds attacks by identifying geometric inconsistencies at the graph level without requiring assumptions about hardware, ranging mechanisms, or cryptographic protocols. We give necessary conditions for which attack detection is guaranteed to be successful in the noiseless case, and we use that intuition to extend Gordian to the noisy case where fewer guarantees are possible. In simulations generated from real-world sensor noise, we empirically show that Gordian's trilateration counterexample generation procedure enables rapid attack detection even for combinatorially difficult problems.  © 2020 ACM.",approximate graph embedding; noisy sensor network localization; satisfiability modulo convex optimization; Secure localization; semidefinite programming; semidefinite relaxation; structural rigidity,Anomaly detection; Embedded systems; Safety engineering; Context aware applications; Cryptographic protocols; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Enabling technologies; Faulty measurements; Formal reasoning; Range-based localizations; Secure localization; Graph algorithms

Despite the success of WSANs for monitoring applications, feedback control poses significant challenges due to data loss and stringent energy constraints in WSANs. Holistic control adopts a cyber-physical system approach to overcome the challenges by orchestrating network reconfiguration and process control at run time. Fundamentally, it leverages self-awareness across control and wireless boundaries to enhance the resiliency of wireless control systems. In this article, we explore efficient holistic control designs to maintain control performance while reducing the communication cost. The contributions of this work are five-fold: (1) We introduce a holistic control architecture that integrates Low-power Wireless Bus (LWB) and two control strategies, rate adaptation and self-triggered control; (2) We present heuristics-based and optimal rate selection algorithms for rate adaptation; (3) We design novel network adaptation mechanisms to support rate adaptation and self-triggered control in a multi-hop WSAN; (4) We build WCPS-RT, a real-time network-in-the-loop simulator that integrates MATLAB/Simulink and a physical WSAN testbed to evaluate wireless control systems; (5) We empirically explore the tradeoff between communication cost and control performance in holistic control approaches. Our studies show that rate adaptation and self-triggered control offer advantages in control performance and energy efficiency, respectively, in normal operating conditions. The advantage in energy efficiency of self-triggered control, however, may diminish under harsh physical and wireless conditions due to the cost of recovering from data loss and physical disturbances.  © 2020 ACM.",cyber-physical systems; Industrial wireless control; multi-hop mesh network; network reconfiguration; network-in-the-loop simulation; rate adaptation,Control systems; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Low power electronics; Real time systems; Control architecture; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Industrial automation; Monitoring applications; Network re-configuration; Normal operating conditions; Physical disturbance; Self-triggered controls; Wireless sensor networks

In recent years, this has primarily taken the form of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques that eliminate some MDP components for the purpose of reducing computational requirements. In this work, we show that recent advancements in Compact MDP Models (CMMs) provide sufficient cause to question this trend when designing wireless sensor network nodes. In this work, a novel CMM-based approach to designing self-aware wireless sensor nodes is presented and compared to Q-Learning, a popular RL technique. We show that a certain class of CPS nodes is not well served by RL methods and contrast RL versus CMM methods in this context. Through both simulation and a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that CMM methods can provide significantly better runtime adaptation performance relative to Q-Learning, with comparable resource requirements.  © 2020 ACM.",adaptation; LTE-M; Markov decision processes; reinforcement learning; self-awareness,Embedded systems; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Computational requirements; Dynamic adaptations; Markov Decision Processes; Prototype implementations; Reinforcement learning techniques; Resource requirements; Structured learning; Wireless sensor node; Sensor nodes

The increasing number of devices will make it infeasible to control each one individually. It will also be infeasible to prepare each of them for every imaginable rapidly unfolding situation. Therefore, we must increase the autonomy of future Cyber-physical Systems. Making these systems self-aware allows them to reason about their own capabilities and their immediate environment. In this article, we extend the idea of the self-awareness of individual systems toward networked self-awareness. This gives systems the ability to reason about how they are being affected by the actions and interactions of others within their perceived environment, as well as in the extended environment that is beyond their direct perception. We propose that different levels of networked self-awareness can develop over time in systems as they do in humans. Furthermore, we propose that this could have the same benefits for networks of systems that it has had for communities of humans, increasing performance and adaptability.  © 2020 ACM.",artificial intelligence; autonomous systems; collaborative systems; networked self-awareness; Self-aware systems,Cyber Physical System; Immediate environment; Individual systems; Real-world; Self awareness; Self-aware; Embedded systems
Pattern-based Interactive Configuration Derivation for Cyber-physical System Product Lines,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095974793&doi=10.1145%2f3389397&partnerID=40&md5=d74415436f385f59bbef496e6054c9d6,"Deriving a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) product from a product line requires configuring hundreds to thousands of configurable parameters of components and devices from multiple domains, e.g., computing, control, and communication. A fully automated configuration process for a CPS product line is seldom possible in practice, and a dynamic and interactive process is expected. Therefore, some configurable parameters are to be configured manually, and the rest can be configured either automatically or manually, depending on pre-defined constraints, the order of configuration steps, and previous configuration data in such a dynamic and interactive configuration process. In this article, we propose a pattern-based, interactive configuration derivation methodology (named as Pi-CD) to maximize opportunities of automatically deriving correct configurations of CPSs by benefiting from pre-defined constraints and configuration data of previous configuration steps. Pi-CD requires architectures of CPS product lines modeled with Unified Modeling Language extended with four types of variabilities, along with constraints specified in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Pi-CD is equipped with 324 configuration derivation patterns that we defined by systematically analyzing the OCL constructs and semantics. We evaluated Pi-CD by configuring 20 CPS products of varying complexity from two real-world CPS product lines. Results show that Pi-CD can achieve up to 72% automation degree with a negligible time cost. Moreover, its time performance remains stable with the increase in the number of configuration parameters as well as constraints.  © 2020 ACM.",configuration derivation; object constraint language; product configuration; Product line engineering,Cyber Physical System; Dynamics; Semantics; Unified Modeling Language; Configurable parameter; Configuration parameters; Configuration process; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Interactive process; Multiple domains; Object Constraint Language; Embedded systems

By bringing together the two established fields of cyber-physical systems and self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet managed autonomy, which is a main requirement for many emerging and future applications and technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are situated in a physical environment and constrained in their resources, and they understand their own state and environment and, based on that understanding, are able to make decisions autonomously at runtime in a self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How can we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii) What are effective infrastructures for implementing self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be required to engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We review each of these challenges in some detail and emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a continual introspection of its own state to sensibly balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples of cyber-physical systems that may benefit from self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very different systems nevertheless have similar characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable environmental dynamics, high expectations on their reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we highlight the need for research on above listed topics.  © 2020 ACM.",cyber-physical systems; development processes; guarantees; organizational infrastructure; resource-sensitive; Self-awareness; situatedness; subjectivity; verification,Embedded systems; System-on-chip; Comprehensive assessment; Development process; Effective infrastructures; Environmental dynamics; Future applications; Multi processor system on chips; Physical environments; Self-aware systems; Cyber Physical System
Efficient Multi-Factor User Authentication Protocol with Forward Secrecy for Real-Time Data Access in WSNs,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085501834&doi=10.1145%2f3325130&partnerID=40&md5=f1b947a15d00fdb22888da6ed296aecd,"It is challenging to design a secure and efficient multi-factor authentication scheme for real-time data access in wireless sensor networks. On the one hand, such real-time applications are generally security critical, and various security goals need to be met. On the other hand, sensor nodes and users' mobile devices are typically of a resource-constrained nature, and expensive cryptographic primitives cannot be used. In this work, we first revisit four foremost multi-factor authentication schemes (i.e., those of Amin et al. (JNCA'18), Srinivas et al. (IEEE TDSC'18), Li et al. (JNCA'18), and Li et al. (IEEE TII'18)) and use them as case studies to reveal the difficulties and challenges in designing a multi-factor authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks correctly. We identify the root causes for their failures in achieving truly multi-factor security and forward secrecy. We further propose a robust multi-factor authentication scheme that makes use of the imbalanced computational nature of the RSA cryptosystem, particularly suitable for scenarios where sensor nodes (but not the user's device) are the main energy bottleneck. Comparison results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme. As far as we know, it is the first two-factor authentication scheme for real-time data access in WSNs that can satisfy all 12 criteria of the state-of-the-art evaluation metric under the harshest adversary model so far. © 2020 ACM.",Cyber-physical systems; forward secrecy; node capture attack; truly multi-factor security; wireless sensor networks,Cryptography; Network security; Sensor nodes; Adversary modeling; Cryptographic primitives; Evaluation metrics; Multi-factor authentication; Real time data access; Real-time application; Two factor authentication; User authentication protocols; Authentication
UACFinder: Mining Syntactic Carriers of Unspecified Assumptions in Medical Cyber-Physical System Design Models,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085528761&doi=10.1145%2f3375405&partnerID=40&md5=532ad3a1e2e40af1c5c3278d8081235f,"During the system development process, domain experts and developers often make assumptions about specifications and implementations. However, most of the assumptions being taken for granted by domain experts and developers are too tedious to be documented by them. When these unspecified assumptions are violated in an environment in which the system operates, failures can occur. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical device recall database, medical device recalls caused by software failures are at an all-time high. One major cause of these recalls is violations of unspecified assumptions made in medical systems. Therefore, it is crucial to have tools to automatically identify such unspecified assumptions at an early stage of the systems development process to avoid fatal failures. In this article, we present a tool called Unspecified Assumption Carrier Finder (UACFinder) that uses data mining techniques to automatically identify potential syntactic carriers of unspecified assumptions in system design models. The main idea of this tool is based on the observation we obtained from our earlier analysis of software failures in medical device recalls caused by unspecified assumptions. We observed that unspecified assumptions often exist in medical systems through syntactic carriers, such as constant variables, frequently read/updated variables, and frequently executed action sequences. Therefore, we develop the UACFinder to automatically find these potential unspecified assumption syntactic carriers rather than unspecified assumptions themselves. Once the UACFinder identifies the potential unspecified assumption syntactic carriers, domain experts and developers can validate whether these syntactic carriers indeed carry unspecified assumptions. We use a simplified cardiac arrest treatment scenario as a case study to evaluate the UACFinder in mining potential syntactic carriers of unspecified assumptions. In addition, we invite a medical doctor to validate unspecified assumptions carried by the mined syntactic carriers. The case study demonstrates that the UACFinder is effective in helping to identify potential unspecified assumptions from system design models. © 2020 ACM.",data mining; Medical cyber-physical systems; statechart models; syntactic carriers; unspecified assumptions,Cyber Physical System; Data mining; Embedded systems; Systems analysis; Action sequences; Food and Drug Administration; Medical cyber physical systems; Medical doctors; Medical systems; Software failure; System development process; Systems development process; Syntactics
A Multilabel Fuzzy Relevance Clustering System for Malware Attack Attribution in the Edge Layer of Cyber-Physical Networks,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085504201&doi=10.1145%2f3351881&partnerID=40&md5=27f4c1986777a7842846aa9142e3cc7a,"The rapid increase in the number of malicious programs has made malware forensics a daunting task and caused users' systems to become in danger. Timely identification of malware characteristics including its origin and the malware sample family would significantly limit the potential damage of malware. This is a more profound risk in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), where a malware attack may cause significant physical damage to the infrastructure. Due to limited on-device available memory and processing power in CPS devices, most of the efforts for protecting CPS networks are focused on the edge layer, where the majority of security mechanisms are deployed. Since the majority of advanced and sophisticated malware programs are combining features from different families, these malicious programs are not similar enough to any existing malware family and easily evade binary classifier detection. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel multilabel fuzzy clustering system for malware attack attribution. Our system is deployed on the edge layer to provide insight into applicable malware threats to the CPS network. We leverage static analysis by utilizing Opcode frequencies as the feature space to classify malware families. We observed that a multilabel classifier does not classify a part of samples. We named this problem the instance coverage problem. To overcome this problem, we developed an ensemble-based multilabel fuzzy classification method to suggest the relevance of a malware instance to the stricken families. This classifier identified samples of VirusShare, RansomwareTracker, and BIG2015 with an accuracy of 94.66%, 94.26%, and 97.56%, respectively. © 2020 ACM.",CPS; cyber-physical systems; Edge layer; fuzzy classification; instance coverage; Internet of Things; IoT; malware classification,Classification (of information); Cyber Physical System; Damage detection; Embedded systems; Static analysis; Binary classifiers; Clustering system; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Fuzzy classification methods; Malware families; Physical damages; Security mechanism; Timely identification; Malware

Integrating Security in Resource-Constrained Cyber-Physical Systems,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085498050&doi=10.1145%2f3380866&partnerID=40&md5=e926df6e9eb4bb59a3bb2a9621be16a7,"Defense mechanisms against network-level attacks are commonly based on the use of cryptographic techniques, such as lengthy message authentication codes (MAC) that provide data integrity guarantees. However, such mechanisms require significant resources (both computational and network bandwidth), which prevents their continuous use in resource-constrained cyber-physical systems (CPS). Recently, it was shown how physical properties of controlled systems can be exploited to relax these stringent requirements for systems where sensor measurements and actuator commands are transmitted over a potentially compromised network; specifically, that merely intermittent use of data authentication (i.e., at occasional time points during system execution), can still provide strong Quality-of-Control (QoC) guarantees even in the presence of false-data injection attacks, such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Consequently, in this work, we focus on integrating security into existing resource-constrained CPS, in order to protect against MitM attacks on a system where a set of control tasks communicates over a real-time network with system sensors and actuators. We introduce a design-time methodology that incorporates requirements for QoC in the presence of attacks into end-to-end timing constraints for real-time control transactions, which include data acquisition and authentication, real-time network messages, and control tasks. This allows us to formulate a mixed integer linear programming-based method for direct synthesis of schedulable tasks and message parameters (i.e., deadlines and offsets) that do not violate timing requirements for the already deployed controllers, while adding a sufficient level of protection against network-based attacks; specifically, the synthesis method also provides suitable intermittent authentication policies that ensure the desired QoC levels under attack. To additionally reduce the security-related bandwidth overhead, we propose the use of cumulative message authentication at time instances when the integrity of messages from subsets of sensors should be ensured. Furthermore, we introduce a method for the opportunistic use of the remaining resources to further improve the overall QoC guarantees while ensuring system (i.e., task and message) schedulability. Finally, we demonstrate applicability and scalability of our methodology on synthetic automotive systems as well as a real-world automotive case-study. © 2020 ACM.",Cyber-physical systems security; mixed integer linear programming; quality-of-control; real-time scheduling,Actuators; Authentication; Bandwidth; Computer crime; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Integer programming; Quality control; Real time control; Cryptographic techniques; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Design time methodology; False data injection attacks; Man in the middles (MITM); Message authentication; Message authentication codes; Mixed integer linear programming; Network security

Although these systems are critical to ensuring the efficiency and safety of our airspace, they are also increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats that could potentially lead to reduction in capacity and/or reorganization of traffic flows. In this article, we model various cyber threats to ATC systems and analyze how these attacks could impact the flow of aircraft through the airspace. To perform this analysis, we consider a model for wide-area air traffic based on a dynamic queuing network model. Then we introduce three different attacks (Route Denial of Service, Route Selection Tampering, and Sector Denial of Service) to the ATC system and explore how these attacks manipulate the sector flows by evaluating the queue backlogs for each sector's outflows. Furthermore, we explore graph-level vulnerability metrics to identify the sectors that are most vulnerable to various flow manipulations and compare them to case-study simulations of the various attacks. The results suggest that Route Denial of Service attacks have a significant impact on the target sector and lead to the largest degradation to the overall air traffic flows. Furthermore, the impact of Sector Denial of Service attack impacts are primarily confined to the target sector, whereas Route Selection Tampering impacts are mostly confined to certain aircraft. © 2020 ACM.",air traffic control system; cyber physical system; cybersecurity; Dynamic queuing network,Aircraft; Aviation; Denial-of-service attack; Flow graphs; Queueing theory; Service industry; Wide area networks; Air traffic control (ATC); Air traffic flows; Denial of Service; Different attacks; Flow manipulation; Information and Communication Technologies; Queuing network model; Vulnerability metrics; Air traffic control

In such networks, secure resource sharing functionality is accomplished by incorporating trust schemes. Current solutions adopt peer-to-peer technologies that can cover the large operational area. However, these systems fail to capture some inherent properties of VANETs, such as fast and ephemeral interaction, making robust trust evaluation of crowdsourcing challenging. In this article, we propose MobileTrust - a hybrid trust-based system for secure resource sharing in VANETs. The proposal is a breakthrough in centralized trust computing that utilizes cloud and upcoming 5G technologies to provide robust trust establishment with global scalability. The ad hoc communication is energy-efficient and protects the system against threats that are not countered by the current settings. To evaluate its performance and effectiveness, MobileTrust is modelled in the SUMO simulator and tested on the traffic features of the small-size German city of Eichstatt. Similar schemes are implemented in the same platform to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, MobileTrust is deployed on a typical embedded system platform and applied on a real smart car installation for monitoring traffic and road-state parameters of an urban application.

These new roles, complementing the more traditional personal assistance and telemetry/tracking ones, open new perspectives in their integration in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures such as e-payment, health care monitoring, and emergency systems, as well as in their usage as remote control facilities in smart services. Users can access their IoT devices at any time from any place through smartwatches. We argue that this new scenario calls for a strengthened and more resilient authentication of users on these devices, despite their limitations in terms of dimensions and hardware constraints that may considerably affect the usability of security mechanisms.

Due to resource-constrained sensing devices, IoT infrastructures use Edge datacenters (EDCs) for real-time data processing. EDCs can be either static or mobile in nature, and this article considers both of these scenarios. Generally, EDCs communicate with IoT devices in emergency scenarios to evaluate data in real-time. Protecting data communications from malicious activity becomes a key factor, as all the communication flows through insecure channels. In such infrastructures, it is a challenging task for EDCs to ensure the trustworthiness of the data for emergency evaluations. The current communication security pattern of ""communication before authentication"" leaves a ""black hole"" for intruders to become part of communication processes without authentication. To overcome this issue and to develop security infrastructures for IoT and distributed Edge datacenters, this article proposes a user-centric security solution. The proposed security solution shifts from a network-centric approach to a user-centric security approach by authenticating users and devices before communication is established. A trusted controller is initialized to authenticate and establishes the secure channel between the devices before they start communication between themselves. The centralized controller draws a perimeter for secure communications within the boundary. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the proposed security model show that it not only secures the communication infrastructure but also improves the overall network performance. © 2020 ACM.",authentication; distributed edge networks; Internet of Things; perimeter-based security; secure channel,Authentication; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Internet of things; Trusted computing; Centralized controllers; Communication infrastructure; Experimental evaluation; Internet of thing (IOT); Mission critical applications; Network-centric approach; Real-time data processing; Security infrastructure; Network security
Anomaly Detection Based on RBM-LSTM Neural Network for CPS in Advanced Driver Assistance System,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085514447&doi=10.1145%2f3377408&partnerID=40&md5=d66cc81dcf670e668bce679d78f24fe5,"Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is a typical Cyber Physical System (CPS) application for human-computer interaction. In the process of vehicle driving, we use the information from CPS on ADAS to not only help us understand the driving condition of the car but also help us change the driving strategies to drive in a better and safer way. After getting the information, the driver can evaluate the feedback information of the vehicle, so as to enhance the ability to assist in driving of the ADAS system. This completes a complete human-computer interaction process. However, the data obtained during the interaction usually form a large dimension, and irrelevant features sometimes hide the occurrence of anomalies, which poses a significant challenge to us to better understand the driving states of the car. To solve this problem, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on RBM-LSTM. In this hybrid framework, RBM is trained to extract general underlying features from data collected by CPS, and LSTM is trained from the features learned by RBM. This framework can effectively improve the prediction speed and present a good prediction accuracy to show vehicle driving condition. Besides, drivers are allowed to evaluate the prediction results, so as to improve the accuracy of prediction. Through the experimental results, we can find that the proposed framework not only simplifies the training of the entire neural network and increases the training speed but also greatly improves the accuracy of the interaction-driven data analysis. It is a valid method to analyze the data generated during the human interaction. © 2020 ACM.",Anomaly detection; LSTM; RBM; RNN,Anomaly detection; Automobile drivers; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Long short-term memory; Vehicles; Anomaly detection frameworks; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Driving conditions; Driving strategy; Feed back information; Human interactions; Hybrid framework; Prediction accuracy; Advanced driver assistance systems
On Hiddenness of Moving Target Defense against False Data Injection Attacks on Power Grid,2020,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085514955&doi=10.1145%2f3372751&partnerID=40&md5=2461585541998343e97566f2ac8b1fdb,"Recent studies have exploited moving target defense (MTD) for thwarting false data injection (FDI) attacks against the state estimation (SE) by actively perturbing branch parameters (i.e., impedance or admittance) in power grids. To hide the activation of MTD from attackers, a new strategy named hidden MTD has been proposed by the latest literature. A hidden MTD can increase the defender's chance to detect FDI attacks and avoid the attacker from inferring new branch parameters. However, by using an MTD-confirming detector like the bad data detection (BDD) checker in SE, we observe that it is still possible for the attacker to detect this hidden MTD when the power flows change with time. To uncover the insight of MTD's hiddenness, we study the conditions needed for achieving a hidable MTD. We find that the hiddenness of MTD is closely related to the branch perturbations, system topology, and attacker's knowledge. From the attacker's perspective, we prove that an MTD can be detected by the attacker only if he/she knows the previous parameters of a set of branches that forms a circle and the measurements corresponding to those branches after MTD. But once the attacker has full knowledge of branch parameters before MTD and has obtained all measurements after MTD, it is proved that we can never achieve a hidable and effective MTD. From the defender's perspective, since it is impossible to know the attacker's capability, we cannot determine whether a constructed MTD is hidable or not by purely depending on the MTD design. To address this issue, we propose that, by protecting a basic set of measurements, we always can achieve a hidable and effective MTD regardless of the changes of power flows, the attacker's knowledge, and the branch perturbations. Furthermore, we validate our findings with the IEEE standard test power systems. © 2020 ACM.",false data injection attack; hidable MTD; Power system state estimation,Electric load flow; IEEE Standards; Network security; Parameter estimation; Bad data detections; False data injection; False data injection attacks; Moving target defense; New branches; Power flows; Standard tests; System topology; Electric power transmission networks

The high penetration of these power electronic-interfaced energy resources has resulted in weaker power grids and an increase in cyberattack surface. The implementation of frequency regulation in these new resources - particularly in wind generators - is on the rise. This article investigates how malicious controllable loads can threaten the integrity of frequency-regulating wind generators. Adopting a user-centric approach and benefiting from small-signal analyses, the article shows for the first time how these wind generators can be the target of attackers. Effective methods to enhance system resilience are sought by mitigating the attack risk in the extended end-users, wind generators. The article models and explores how proper tuning and design of the physical system can improve cyber-physical security. The work also extends the user-centric method to the physical layer of smart grids.

Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS). As implementations, we instantiate how to use our proposals to outsource small- or large-scale data through distinct CPS, respectively. Additionally, a blockchain with proof-of-discrete-logarithm (B-PoDL) is instantiated to help improve our performance. Last, as demonstrated by our evaluations, our proposals are secure, efficient, and economic for users to implement while outsourcing their data via CPSs. © 2020 ACM.",blockchain; Chameleon hash; hybrid data outsourcing; signcryption,Efficiency; Embedded systems; Outsourcing; Cloud servers; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Data outsourcing; Designated receivers; Discrete logarithms; Large scale data; Outsourcing model; User-centric; Digital storage

The applications are implemented on distributed cyber-physical systems that use IEEE Time-sensitive Networking (TSN). TSN is the product of an IEEE effort to bring deterministic real-time capabilities to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet. TSN supports the convergence of multiple traffic types, i.e., critical, real-time, and regular “best-effort” traffic within a single network: Time-triggered (TT), where the messages are transmitted based on static schedule tables, Audio-video Bridging (AVB), for dynamically scheduled messages with a guaranteed bandwidth and bounded delays, and Best Effort (BE), for which no timing guarantees are provided. The HRT messages have deadlines, whereas we capture the quality-of-service for the SRT messages using “utility functions.” Given the network topology, the set of application messages, including their routing, and the set of available AVB classes, we are interested in determining the traffic type of each message, such that all the HRT messages are schedulable and the total utility for the SRT messages is maximized. We propose a Tabu Search-based metaheuristic to solve this optimization problem.

RAS represents a partnership between a smart home, a robot, and software agents. When smart home residents perform activities, RAS senses their movement in the space and identifies the current activity. RAS tracks activity steps to detect omission errors. When an error is detected, the RAS robot finds and approaches the human with an offer of assistance. Assistance consists of playing a video recording of the entire activity, showing the omitted activity step, or guiding the resident to the object that is required for the current step. We evaluated RAS performance for 54 participants performing three scripted activities in a smart home testbed and for 2 participants using the system over multiple days in their own homes. In the testbed experiment, activity errors were detected with a sensitivity of 0.955 and specificity of 0.992. RAS assistance was performed successfully with a rate of 0.600.

Wireless communication has become a crucial part of the infrastructure of many cyber-physical applications. Many of these applications are real-time and also mixed-criticality, in that they have components/subsystems with different consequences of failure. Wireless communication is inevitably subject to levels of external interference. In this article, we represent this interference using a criticality-aware fault model; for each level of temporal interference in the fault model, we guarantee the timing behaviour of the protocol (i.e., we guarantee that packet deadlines are satisfied for certain levels of criticality). Although a new protocol, AirTight is built upon existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4. A prototype implementation and protocol-accurate simulator have been produced. This article develops a series of schedulability analysis techniques for single-channel and multichannel wireless Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Heuristics are specified and evaluated as the starting point of design space exploration.

While there are many benefits that TCPSs have to offer, a major challenge that needs to be addressed to enable their proliferation is their vulnerability to cyber attacks. In this article, we demonstrate, using laboratory prototypes of TCPSs, how the approach of Dynamic Watermarking can secure them from arbitrary sensor attacks. Specifically, we consider two TCPSs of topical interest: (i) an adaptive cruise control system and (ii) a system of self-driving vehicles tracking given trajectories. In each of these systems, we first show how cyber attacks on sensors can compromise safety and cause collisions between vehicles in spite of the presence of a collision avoidance module in the system. We then apply the approach of DynamicWatermarking and demonstrate that it detects attacks with ""low"" delay. Once an attack is detected, the controller can take appropriate control actions to prevent collisions, thereby guaranteeing safety in the sense of collision freedom. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Autonomous transportation systems; Cyber-physical systems; Cybersecurity; Driver assist systems; Dynamic Watermarking; Intelligent transportation systems; Secure control,Adaptive cruise control; Antennas; Automobile safety devices; Computer control; Computer crime; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Intelligent systems; Network security; Real time systems; Truck transportation; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Watermarking; Autonomous transportation system; Cyber security; Driver assists; Intelligent transportation systems; Real time computing; Real-time communication; Sensing technology; Transportation sector; Adaptive control systems
Reliable communication and latency bound generation in wireless cyber-physical systems,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075640949&doi=10.1145%2f3354917&partnerID=40&md5=de83ad2d28e3f7d777c0a729bb06926c,"Low-powerwireless communication has been widely used in cyber-physical systems that require time-critical data delivery. Achieving this goal is challenging because of link burstiness and interference. Based on significant empirical evidence of 21 days and over 3.6 M packet transmissions per link, we propose both routing and scheduling algorithms that produce latency bounds of the real-time periodic streams and accounts for both link bursts and interference. The solution is achieved through the definition of a new metric Bmax that characterizes links by their maximum burst length, and by choosing a novel least-burst-route that minimizes the sum of worst-case burst lengths over all links in the route. With extensive data-driven analysis, we show that our algorithms outperform existing solutions by achieving accurate latency bound with much less energy consumption. In addition, a testbed evaluation consisting of 48 nodes spread across a floor of a building shows that we obtain 100% reliable packet delivery within derived latency bounds.We also demonstrate how performance deteriorates and discuss its implications for wireless networks with insufficient high-quality links. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Design and implementation of secret key agreement for platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical systems,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075638537&doi=10.1145%2f3365996&partnerID=40&md5=eb9a229e9050216e505ac74b918a1739,"In a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (PVCPS), a lead vehicle that is responsible for managing the platoon's moving directions and velocity periodically disseminates control messages to the vehicles that follow. Securing wireless transmissions of the messages between the vehicles is critical for privacy and confidentiality of the platoon's driving pattern. However, due to the broadcast nature of radio channels, the transmissions are vulnerable to eavesdropping. In this article, we propose a cooperative secret key agreement (CoopKey) scheme for encrypting/decrypting the control messages, where the vehicles in PVCPS generate a unified secret key based on the quantized fading channel randomness. Channel quantization intervals are optimized by dynamic programming to minimize the mismatch of keys. A platooning testbed is built with autonomous robotic vehicles, where a TelosB wireless node is used for onboard data processing and multihop dissemination. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that CoopKey achieves significantly low secret bit mismatch rate in a variety of settings. Moreover, the standard NIST test suite is employed to verify randomness of the generated keys, where the p-values of our CoopKey pass all the randomness tests.We also evaluate CoopKey with an extended platoon size via simulations to investigate the effect of system scalability on performance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Crossroads+: A time-aware approach for intersection management of connected autonomous vehicles,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075638662&doi=10.1145%2f3364182&partnerID=40&md5=e6e18b2728b6ae0ec8d98e15548986cd,"As vehicles become autonomous and connected, intelligent management techniques can be utilized to operate an intersection without a traffic light. When a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) approaches an intersection, it shares its status and intended direction with the IntersectionManager (IM), and the IM checks the status of other CAVs and assigns a target velocity/reference trajectory for it to maintain. In practice, however, there is an unknown delay between the time a CAV sends a request to the IMand the moment it receives back the response, namely, the Round-Trip Delay (RTD). As a result, the CAV will start tracking the target velocity/reference trajectory later than when the IM expects, which may lead to accidents. In this article, we present a time-aware approach, Crossroads+, that makes CAVs' behaviors deterministic despite the existence of the unknown RTD. In Crossroads+, we use timestamping and synchronization to ensure that both the IM and the CAVs have the same notion of time. The IM will also set a fixed start time to track the target velocity/ reference trajectory for each CAV. The effectiveness of the proposed Crossroads+ technique is illustrated by experiments on a 1/10 scale model of an intersection with CAVs.We also built a simulator to demonstrate the scalability of Crossroads+ for multi-lane intersections. Results from our experiments indicate that our approach can reduce the position uncertainty by 15% in comparison with conventional techniques and achieve up to 36% better throughputs. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

TOP: Optimizing vehicle driving speed with vehicle trajectories for travel time minimization and road congestion avoidance,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075630942&doi=10.1145%2f3362162&partnerID=40&md5=ecc5e8dc2c19963672a6fb0f9d6b307a,"Traffic congestion control is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems. Previous works optimize vehicle speed for different objectives such as minimizing fuel consumption and minimizing travel time. However, they overlook the possible congestion generation in the future (e.g., in 5 minutes), which may degrade the performance of achieving the objectives. In this article, we propose a vehicle Trajectory-based driving speed OPtimization strategy (TOP) to minimize vehicle travel time and meanwhile avoid generating congestion. Its basic idea is to adjust vehicles' mobility to alleviate road congestion globally. TOP has a framework for collecting vehicles' information to a central server, which calculates the parameters depicting the future road condition (e.g., driving time, vehicle density, and probability of accident). Based on the collected information, the central server also measures the friendship among the vehicles and considers the delay caused by red traffic signals to help estimating the vehicle density of the road segments. The server then formulates a noncooperative Stackelberg game considering these parameters, in which when each vehicle aims to minimize its travel time, the road congestion is also proactively avoided. After the Stackelberg equilibrium is reached, the optimal driving speed for each vehicle and the expected vehicle density that maximizes the utilization of the road network are determined. Our real trace analysis confirms some characteristics of vehicle mobility to support the design of TOP. Extensive trace-driven experiments show the effectiveness and superior performance of TOP in comparison with other driving speed optimization methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

The emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,we introduce a novel and configurable systemlevel framework to identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral characteristics.We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include accuracy values between 95% and 99% for the different attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Low-power wireless communication technology is preferred for its low cost, small form factor, and flexibility, especially if the devices support multi-hop communication. Thus far, however, feedback control over multi-hop lowpower wireless networks has only been demonstrated for update intervals on the order of seconds. To fill this gap, this article presents a wireless embedded system that supports dynamic mode changes and tames imperfections impairing control performance (e.g., jitter and message loss), and a control design that exploits the essential properties of this system to provably guarantee closed-loop stability for physical processes with linear time-invariant dynamics in the presence of mode changes.

Modeling and optimization for self-powered non-volatile IoT edge devices with ultra-low harvesting power,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075725529&doi=10.1145%2f3324609&partnerID=40&md5=ad5c60babb3760537ec13e69907003e4,"Energy harvesters are becoming increasingly popular as power sources for IoT edge devices. However, one of the intrinsic problems of energy harvester is that harvesting power is often weak and frequently interrupted. Therefore, energy harvesting powered edge devices have to work intermittently. To maintain execution progress, execution states need to be checkpointed into the non-volatile memory before each power failure. In this way, previous execution states can be resumed after power comes back again. Nevertheless, frequent checkpointing and low charging efficiency generate significant energy overhead. To alleviate these problems, this article conducts a thorough energy efficiency analysis and proposes three algorithms to maximize the energy efficiency of program execution. First, a non-volatile processor-aware task scheduling algorithm is proposed to reduce the size of checkpointing data. Second, a tentative checkpointing avoidance technique is proposed to avoid checkpointing for further reduction of checkpointing overhead. Finally, a dynamic wake-up strategy is proposed to wake up the edge device at proper voltages where the total hardware and software overhead is minimized for further energy efficiency maximization. The experiments on a real testbed demonstrate that, with the proposed algorithms, an edge device is resilient to the extremely weak and intermittent power supply and the energy efficiency can be achieved more than 2× higher than the fundamental baseline and 1.5× higher than the state-of-the-art technique. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Edge devices; IoT; Non-volatile processor; Transient computing,Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Scheduling algorithms; Wakes; Edge devices; Efficiency maximization; Energy efficiency analysis; Hardware and software; Modeling and optimization; Non-volatile; State-of-the-art techniques; Task-scheduling algorithms; Internet of things

Our proposal illustrates the unique cyber-physical properties that sensor devices can leverage for their cyber-security. While traditional attestation algorithms exchange digital challenges between devices authenticating each other, our work instead proposes challenges that manifest physically in the field of view of the camera (e.g., a QR code in a display). This physical (challenge) and cyber (verification) attestation mechanism can help protect systems even when the sensors (cameras) and actuators (a display, infrared LEDs, color light bulbs) are compromised. In this article, we consider skillful adversaries that can capture the correct challenges (our system is sending) and can re-create them in the response to try fooling our verification system, and we propose new algorithms to detect these powerful attackers. Also, we introduce new visual challenges that make harder for anti-forensics attackers to succeed, and we present experimental results showing how our system is robust against a variety of attacks ranging from naive attacks to more sophisticated anti-forensics attackers. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Socially aware path planning for a flying robot in close proximity of humans,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075672468&doi=10.1145%2f3341570&partnerID=40&md5=3205b8b4a9475e305605da248a8e707d,"In this article, we present a preliminary motion planning framework for a cyber-physical system consisting of a human and a flying robot in vicinity. The motion planning of the flying robot takes into account the human's safety perception.We aim to determine a parametric model for the human's safety perception based on test data. We use virtual reality as a safe testing environment to collect safety perception data reflected on galvanic skin response (GSR) from the test subjects experiencing a flying robot in their vicinity. The GSR signal contains both meaningful information driven by the interaction with the robot and also disturbances from unknown factors. To address the issue, we use two parametric models to approximate the GSR data: (1) a function of the robot's position and velocity and (2) a random distribution. Intuitively, we need to choose the more likely model given the data.When GSR is statistically independent of the flying robot, then the random distribution should be selected instead of the function of the robot's position and velocity.We implement the intuitive idea under the framework of hidden Markov model (HMM) estimation. As a result, the proposed HMM-based model improves the likelihood compared to the Gaussian noise model, which does not make a distinction between relevant and irrelevant samples due to unknown factors. We also present a numerical optimal path planning method that considers the safety perception model while ensuring spatial separation from the obstacle despite the time discretization. Optimal paths generated using the proposed model result in a reasonably safe distance from the human. In contrast, the trajectories generated by the standard regression model with the Gaussian noise assumption, without consideration of unknown factors, have undesirable shapes. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Hidden Markov model; Human-robot interaction; Optimal path planning,Electrophysiology; Embedded systems; Flight paths; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hidden Markov models; Human robot interaction; Motion planning; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Safety testing; Trellis codes; Virtual reality; Galvanic skin response; Gaussian noise model; Optimal path planning; Parametric modeling; Parametric models; Random distribution; Spatial separation; Time discretization; Robot programming
Accounting for reliability in unacknowledged time-constrained WSNs,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075721535&doi=10.1145%2f3241746&partnerID=40&md5=3a082254aa9eb8092312007f5dc6ba7f,"Wireless sensor networks typically consist of nodes that collect and transmit data periodically. In this context, we are concerned with unacknowledged communication, such as where data packets are not confirmed upon successful reception. This allows reducing traffic on the communication channel-neither acknowledgments nor retransmissions are sent-and results in less overhead and less energy consumption, which are meaningful goals in the era of the Internet of Things. However, packets can be lost, and hence we do not know how long it takes to convey data from one node to another, which hinders any form of real-time operation and/or quality of service. To overcome this problem, we propose a medium access control protocol, which consists of transmitting each packet at a random instant butwithin a specified time interval fromthe last transmission. In contrast to existing approaches from the literature, the proposed medium access control can be configured to meet reliability requirements-given by the probability that at least one data packet reaches its destination within a specified deadline-in the absence of acknowledgments. We illustrate this and other benefits of the proposed approach based on detailed OMNeT++ simulations. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Energy efficiency; Media access control; Reliability; Unacknowledged communication; Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Quality of service; Reliability; Sensor nodes; Technology transfer; Wireless sensor networks; Data packet; Media access control; Medium access control protocols; Real-time operation; Reliability requirements; Retransmissions; Time interval; Transmit data; Medium access control

For many such systems (e.g., edge computing in the Industrial Internet of Things), it is desirable to enforce such constraints within a common middleware service (e.g., during event processing). In this article, we introduce CPEP, a new real-time middleware for cyber-physical event processing, with (1) extensible support for complex event processing operations, (2) execution prioritization and sharing, (3) enforcement of time consistency with load shedding, and (4) efficient memory management and concurrent data processing.We present the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of CPEP and show that it can (1) support complex operations needed by many applications, (2) schedule data processing according to consumers' priority levels, (3) enforce temporal validity, and (4) reduce processing delay and improve throughput of time-consistent events. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Industrial Internet of Things,Data handling; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Middleware; Multitasking; Complex event processing; Complex operations; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Empirical evaluations; Middleware services; Physical conditions; Tight integrations; Cyber Physical System
Design and analysis of delay-tolerant intelligent intersection management,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066016080&doi=10.1145%2f3300184&partnerID=40&md5=6c9c63c8bf5669d0248345ed6d996310,"The rapid development of vehicular network and autonomous driving technologies provides opportunities to significantly improve transportation safety and efficiency. One promising application is centralized intelligent intersection management, where an intersection manager accepts requests from approaching vehicles (via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication messages) and schedules the order for those vehicles to safely crossing the intersection. However, communication delays and packet losses may occur due to the unreliable nature of wireless communication or malicious security attacks (e.g., jamming and flooding), and could cause deadlocks and unsafe situations. In our previous work, we considered these issues and proposed a delay-tolerant intersection management protocol for intersections with a single lane in each direction. In this work, we address key challenges in efficiency and deadlock when there are multiple lanes from each direction, and propose a delay-tolerant protocol for general multi-lane intersection management. We prove that this protocol is deadlock free, safe, and satisfies the liveness property. Furthermore, we extend the traffic simulation suite SUMO with communication modules, implement our protocol in the extended simulator, and quantitatively analyze its performance with the consideration of communication delays. Finally, we also model systems that use smart traffic lights with various back-pressure scheduling methods in SUMO, including the basic back-pressure control, the capacity-aware back-pressure control, and the adaptive max-pressure control.We then compare our delay-tolerant intelligent intersection protocol with smart traffic lights that use the three back-pressure scheduling methods, in the case of a network of interconnected intersections. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significant outperforms the smart traffic lights under normal operation (i.e., when the communication delay is not too large). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Autonomous intersection; Back-pressure control; Connected and autonomous vehicles; Cyber-physical security; Smart traffic lights; Timing attack; V2X; Vehicular network,Adaptive control systems; Autonomous vehicles; Efficiency; Pressure control; Scheduling; Side channel attack; Street traffic control; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Communication messages; Cyber-Physical securities; Intelligent intersection; Intersection managements; Smart traffic; Vehicle-to-infrastructure; Vehicular networks; Wireless communications; Delay tolerant networks
Designing a controller with image-based pipelined sensing and additive uncertainties,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075726601&doi=10.1145%2f3326067&partnerID=40&md5=1521fd6573ef4946b15e888e08c4f622,"Pipelined image-based control uses parallel instances of its image-processing algorithm in a pipelined fashion to improve the quality of control. A performance-oriented control design improves the controller settling time with each additional processing resource, which creates a resources-performance trade-off. In real-life applications, it is common to have a continuous-time model with additive uncertainties in one or more parameters that may affect the controller performance and the aforementioned trade-off.We present a robustness analysis framework for performance-oriented pipelined controllers with additive model uncertainties.We present a technique to obtain discrete-time uncertainties based on the continuous-time uncertainties for given uncertainty bounds. To benchmark such uncertainty bounds for a real system, we consider uncertainties in one element of the system, potentially caused by multiple uncertain parameters in the model. Robustness and its impact in the trade-off analysis are studied. We also provide a robustness-oriented pipelined controller design that takes into account the benchmarked uncertainties. Our results show that in performance-oriented designs, the tolerable uncertainties for a pipelined controller decrease when increasing the number of pipes. In robustness-oriented designs, the controller robustness is enhanced with each newly added pipe. We show the feasibility of our technique by implementing a realistic example in a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Image-based control; LQR tuning; Particle swarm optimization; Pipelined sensing control; Robustness analysis; Trade-off analysis,Additives; Continuous time systems; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Quality control; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Traction (friction); Uncertainty analysis; Discrete time uncertainty; Image processing algorithm; Image-based control; Performance oriented control; Performance-oriented designs; Robustness analysis; Sensing controls; Trade-off analysis; Controllers
A predictive framework for dynamic heavy-duty vehicle platoon coordination,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074896008&doi=10.1145%2f3299110&partnerID=40&md5=5e349955f6380b7d80a255e86f4205a9,"This article describes a system to facilitate dynamic en route formation of heavy-duty vehicle platoons with the goal of reducing fuel consumption. Safe vehicle platooning is a maturing technology that leverages modern sensor, control, and communication technology to automatically regulate the inter-vehicle distances. Truck platooning has been shown to reduce fuel consumption through slipstreaming by up to 10% under realistic highway-driving conditions. To further benefit from this technology, a platoon coordinator is proposed, which interfaces with fleet management systems and suggests how platoons can be formed in a fuel-efficient manner over a large region. The coordinator frequently updates the plans to react to newly available information. This way, it requires a minimum of customization with respect to the logistic operations.We discuss the system architecture in detail and introduce important underlying methodological foundations. Plans are derived in computationally tractable stages optimizing fuel savings from platooning. The effectiveness of this approach is verified in a simulation study. It shows that the coordinated platooning system can improve over spontaneously occurring platooning even under the presence of disturbances. A real demonstrator has also been developed. We present data from an experiment in which three vehicles were coordinated to form a platoon on public highways under normal traffic conditions. It demonstrates the feasibility of coordinated en route platoon formation with current communication and on-board technology. Simulations and experiments support that the proposed system is technically feasible and a potential solution to the problem of using vehicle platooning in an operational context. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Platooning; Road freight transport,Adaptive cruise control; Fleet operations; Freight transportation; Fuel economy; Fuels; Communication technologies; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Driving conditions; Fleet management system; Heavy duty vehicles; Platooning; Road freight transport; System architectures; Vehicle to vehicle communications

However, a residential cyber-physical system is different from a common cyber-physical system since it directly involves human interaction, which is full of uncertainty. The existing solutions could be effective for performance enhancement in some cases when no inherent and dominant human factors are involved. Besides, the rapidly rising interest in the deployments of cyber-physical systems at home does not normally integrate with energy management schemes, which is a central issue that smart homes have to face. In this article, we propose a cyber-physical-system-based energy management framework to enable a sustainable-edge computing paradigm while meeting the needs of home energy management and residents. This framework aims to enable the full use of renewable energy while reducing electricity bills for households. A prototype system was implemented using real-world hardware. The experiment results demonstrated that renewable energy is fully capable of supporting the reliable running of home appliances most of the time and electricity bills could be cut by up to 60% when our proposed framework was employed. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber-physical system; Energy management; Human interaction; Renewable energy; Scheduling,Automation; Behavioral research; Cyber Physical System; Domestic appliances; Embedded systems; Energy management; Intelligent buildings; Scheduling; Computing paradigm; Energy management schemes; Home energy managements; Human interactions; Management frameworks; Performance enhancements; Renewable energies; Use of renewable energies; Energy management systems
SafeWatch: A wearable hand motion tracking system for improving driving safety,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074887704&doi=10.1145%2f3360323&partnerID=40&md5=856b611e38838e22213538244c3aaf4d,"Driving while distracted or losing alertness significantly increases the risk of traffic accident. The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) systems for smart driving hold the promise of significantly reducing road accidents. In particular, detecting unsafe hand motions andwarning the driver using smart sensors can improve the driver's alertness and skill. However, due to the impact of the vehicle's movement and the significant variation across different driving environments, detecting the position of the driver's hand is challenging. This article presents SafeWatch-a system based on smartwatches and smartphones that detects the driver's unsafe behaviors in a real-time manner. SafeWatch infers driver's hand position based on several important features, such as the posture of the driver's forearm and the vibration on the smartwatch. SafeWatch employs a novel adaptive training algorithm that keeps updating the training data set at run-time based on inferred hand positions in certain driving conditions. The evaluation with 75 real driving trips from six subjects shows that SafeWatch has a high accuracy over 97.0% for both recall and precision in detection of the unsafe hand positions when the condition lasts for more than 6.0s, as well as over 97.1% recall and over 91.0% precision in detection of the unsafe hand movements when it lasts for more than 2.5s. The relative position of the hand to the steering wheel also reveals some detailed driving habits, like the type of steering method. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Inertial measurement unit; Ubiquitous computing,Accidents; Automobile drivers; Automobile steering equipment; Internet of things; Motion analysis; Motor transportation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Tracking (position); Ubiquitous computing; Wearable computers; Wearable sensors; Adaptive training algorithm; Driving environment; Hand motion tracking; Important features; Inertial measurement unit; Internet of Things (IOT); Recall and precision; Training data sets; Palmprint recognition

Hence, in this work, we investigate the security risk of organizations with respect to different adversarial models of physical movement behavior. We study the case in which an intrusion detection mechanism is in place to alert the system administrator when users deviate from their normal movement behavior.We then analyze how different user behaviors may present themselves as different levels of threats in terms of their normal movement behavior within a given building topology. To quantify the differences in movement behavior, we define a WeightTopo metric that takes into account the building topology in addition to themovement pattern.We demonstrate our approach on a railway system case study and showhowcertain user roles, when abused by attackers, are especially vulnerable in terms of the physical intrusion detection probability. We also evaluate quantitatively how the similarity between an attacker's movement behavior and a user's movement behavior affects the detection probability of the evaluated intrusion detection system.

In this work, we discuss data integrity threats to balise transmission modules and use highfidelity simulation to study the risks posed by data integrity attacks. To mitigate such risk, we propose a practical two-layer solution: At the device level, we design a lightweight and low-cost cryptographic solution to protect the integrity of the location information; at the system layer, we devise a secure hybrid train speed controller to mitigate the impact under various attacks.

Mobility on Demand (MoD) services such as Uber and Lyft have revolutionized the transportation infrastructure, enabling new solutions for passengers. Shared MoD services have shown that a continuum of solutions can be provided between the traditional private transport for an individual and the public mass transit-based transport, by making use of the underlying cyber-physical substrate that provides advanced, distributed, and networked computational and communicational support. In this article, we propose a novel shared mobility service using a dynamic framework. This framework generates a dynamic route for multi-passenger transport, optimized to reduce time costs for both the shuttle and the passengers and is designed using a new concept of a space window. This concept introduces a degree of freedom that helps reduce the cost of the system involved in designing the optimal route. A specific algorithm based on the Alternating Minimization approach is proposed. Its analytical properties are characterized. Detailed computational experiments are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach and are shown to result in an order of magnitude improvement in the computational efficiency with minimal optimality gap when compared to a standard Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming-based algorithm. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Alternating minimization; Clustering; Dynamic routing; Mixed integer quadratically constrained programming; Mobility on demand; Shared mobility; Smart cities; Space window,Computer programming; Cost reduction; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Distributed computer systems; Dynamic routing algorithms; Integer programming; Smart city; Travel time; Alternating minimization; Clustering; Dynamic routing; On demands; Quadratically constrained programming; Computational efficiency

Engineers are facing significant challenges in designing test environments that are more complex than ever. We propose a test framework that allows one to automatically generate various virtual road environments from the path and behavior specifications. The path specification intends to characterize geometric paths that an environmental object (e.g., a roadway or a pedestrian) needs to be visualized or move over. We characterize this aspect in the form of constraints of 3-Dimensional (3D) coordinates. Then, we introduce a test coverage, called an area coverage, to quantify the quality of the generated paths in terms of how diverse of an area the generated paths can cover. We propose an algorithm that automatically generates such paths using an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. However, the behavioral specification intends to characterize how an environmental object changes its mode over time by interacting with other objects (e.g., a pedestrian waits for a signal or starts crossing). We characterize this aspect in the form of timed automata. Then, we introduce a test coverage, called an edge/location coverage, to quantify the quality of the generated mode changes in terms of how many modes or transitions are visited. We propose a method that automatically generates many different mode changes using a model-checking. To demonstrate the test framework, we developed the right-turn pedestrian warning system in intersection scenarios and generated many different types of pedestrian paths and behaviors to analyze the effectiveness of the system. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Autonomous vehicle; Connected vehicle; SMT solver; System safety; Test coverage; Test generation; Test specification; Timed automata; Virtual prototyping,Automata theory; Model checking; Pedestrian safety; Specifications; Virtual prototyping; Virtual reality; Smt solvers; System safety; Test coverage; Test generations; Test specifications; Timed Automata; Autonomous vehicles

In this article, taking human activities and interactions with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) into consideration,we propose a human behavior learning system based on Channel State Information (CSI) utilizing a series of algorithms for data analysis and processing. Aiming to recognize a set of gestures, our system is designed based on the observation that different gestures have different effects on signals and specific gesture signals have a unique energy spectrum. Specifically, an improved Linear Discriminant Analysis Algorithm (I-LDA) is devised to reduce the dimension of human behavior signals. Additionally, behaviors are learned by Logistic Regression Algorithm (LRA). Bandwidth ratios in an energy spectrum are selected as features to eliminate the impact of speed differences on results. The system is based on commercial off-The-shelf WiFi devices and we conduct a large number of experiments in a typical indoor environment to evaluate its performance.

However, the generated text does not always address users' concerns as they are generally too technical to be understood by ordinary users. Moreover, different users have varied linguistic preferences that do not match the text. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an innovative scheme to help users avoid malware and privacy-breaching apps by generating security descriptions that explain the privacy and security related aspects of an Android app in clear and understandable terms. We implement a prototype system, PERSCRIPTION, to generate personalised security-centric descriptions that automatically learn users' security concerns and linguistic preferences to produce user-oriented descriptions.

In this article, we formally define view correctness in terms of soundness and completeness and establish theoretical bounds for the ability to verify view correctness. Moreover, we present an architecture for an online view detection and verification process that uses the information available locally to a vehicle.

3A distributed tensor-Train decomposition method for cyber-physical-social services,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075653824&doi=10.1145%2f3323926&partnerID=40&md5=8850da61ff75141812159201e86ee90b,"Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) integrating the cyber, physical, and social worlds is a key technology to provide proactive and personalized services for humans. In this paper, we studied CPSS by taking humaninteraction-aware big data (HIBD) as the starting point. However, the HIBD collected from all aspects of our daily lives are of high-order and large-scale, which bring ever-increasing challenges for their cleaning, integration, processing, and interpretation. Therefore, new strategies for representing and processing of HIBD become increasingly important in the provision of CPSS services. As an emerging technique, tensor is proving to be a suitable and promising representation and processing tool of HIBD. In particular, tensor networks, as a significant tensor decomposition technique, bring advantages of computing, storage, and applications of HIBD. Furthermore, Tensor-Train (TT), a type of tensor network, is particularly well suited for representing and processing high-order data by decomposing a high-order tensor into a series of low-order tensors. However, at present, there is still need for an efficient Tensor-Train decomposition method for massive data. Therefore, for larger-scale HIBD, a highly-efficient computational method of Tensor-Train is required. In this paper, a distributed Tensor-Train (DTT) decomposition method is proposed to process the high-order and large-scale HIBD. The high performance of the proposed DTT such as the execution time is demonstrated with a case study on a typical form of CPSS data, Computed Tomography (CT) image data. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Computerized tomography; Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Digital storage; Cyber physicals; Decomposition methods; High order tensors; Humaninteraction; Key technologies; Personalized service; Processing tools; Tensor decomposition; Tensors

Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian process for short-term load forecasting using combined transportation and electricity data,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074885393&doi=10.1145%2f3300185&partnerID=40&md5=b9bd427eb7a157d96596f507b377b002,"Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) where different sensors and devices record the cyber and physical indicators of the city systems. The collected data are used for improving urban life by offering services such as accurate electric load forecasting, and more efficient traffic management. Traditional monitoring for electricity and transportation networks generally do not provide full observability due to their limited coverage as well as high implementation and maintenance costs. For example, continuous traffic data collection is mostly limited to major highways only in big cities, whereas local roadways are usually covered once or twice a year. Also, there are no high-fidelity and real-time electric monitoring systems in all parts of power distribution networks. Combining the limited data from each of the urban systems together (e.g., electricity, transportation, environment, etc.) provides a better picture of the energy flow in a city. Furthermore, a city should be considered as a collection of the layers of tangled infrastructure networks, which connects people, places, and resources. Therefore, the study of traffic or electricity consumption forecasting should go beyond the transportation and electricity networks and merge with each other and even with other city networks such as environmental networks. As such, this article proposes a Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian Process model that employs the most informative spatiotemporal interdependency among different interconnected networks (in this case, electricity, transportation, and weather). The proposed load forecasting method is compared with other state-of-the-art methods using real-life data obtained from the City of Tallahassee in Florida. Results show that the proposed Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian Process model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian process; Electric load forecasting; Spatiotemporal dependencies; Traffic load forecasting,Bayesian networks; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Electric power plant loads; Embedded systems; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Real time systems; Urban transportation; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Electricity consumption forecasting; Gaussian Processes; Power distribution network; Short term load forecasting; Spatio-temporal dependencies; State-of-the-art methods; Traffic load forecasting; Electric load forecasting

It was conceived for cyber-physical systems that require real-Time sensing and actuation, like active flow control on aircraft wing surfaces. XDense communication and distributed processing capabilities are designed to enable complex feature extraction within bounded time and in a responsive manner. In this article, we tackle the issue of deterministic behavior of XDense. We present a methodology that uses traffic-shaping heuristics to guarantee bounded communication delays and the fulfillment of memory requirements.

Such information can be captured for various purposes, such as diagnostics, fleet management, and analytics. Although monitoring individual parameters can be useful for some applications, monitoring distinct combinations of parameters can reveal more complex and higher-level states that may give useful information. Existing monitoring systems either lack user configurability and control or present simple user interfaces thatmake it difficult to monitor and collate different parameters to observe high-level vehicle states. In this work, we present TruckSTM, a novel application that realizes user-defined states from messages seen in the embedded networks of medium and heavy duty vehicles and displays state transitions on an interactive user interface. We begin by symbolically formulating some of the in-vehicle networking concepts and formally defining the concept of operational states and state transitions. We then elaborate on the operations performed by TruckSTM in mapping network-obtained vehicle parameters to states that can be defined in standard JSON format. Finally, we evaluate TruckSTM's asymptotic performance and present the results for the worst-case scenario and demonstrate that in a real world scenario such high level state visualization constraints of an operational truck. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automotive networks; Operational state; SAE J1939; Transition; Visualization,Fleet operations; Flow visualization; Seats; Trucks; User interfaces; Visualization; Asymptotic performance; Automotive networks; In-vehicle networking; Interactive user interfaces; Operational state; SAE J1939; Transition; Worst case scenario; Interface states
CSIP: A synchronous protocol for automated vehicles at road intersections,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074196618&doi=10.1145%2f3226032&partnerID=40&md5=65ac5146a3cc116a6011dc4251145dbf,"Intersection management is one of the main challenging issues in road safety because intersections are a leading cause of traffic congestion and accidents. In fact, more than 44% of all reported crashes in the U.S. occur around intersection areas, which, in turn, has led to 8,500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year. With vehicles expected to become self-driving, the question is whether high throughput can be obtained through intersections while keeping them safe. A spatio-temporal intersection protocol named the Ballroom Intersection Protocol (BRIP) [8] was recently proposed in the literature to address this situation. Under this protocol, automated and connected vehicles arrive at and go through an intersection in a cooperative fashion with no vehicle needing to stop, while maximizing the intersection throughput. Though no vehicles run into one another under ideal environments with BRIP, vehicle accidents can occur when the self-driving vehicles have location errors and/or control system failure. In this article, we present a safe and practical intersection protocol named the Configurable Synchronous Intersection Protocol (CSIP). CSIP is a more general and resilient version of BRIP. CSIP utilizes a certain inter-vehicular distance to meet safety requirements in the presence of GPS inaccuracies and control failure. The inter-vehicular distances under CSIP are much more acceptable and comfortable to human passengers due to longer inter-vehicular distances that do not cause fear.With CSIP, the inter-vehicular distances can also be changed at each intersection to account for different traffic volumes, GPS accuracy levels, and geographical layout of intersections. Our simulation results show that CSIP never leads to traffic accidents even when the system has typical location errors, and that CSIP increases the traffic throughput of the intersections compared to common signalized intersections. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Autonomous vehicles; Intelligent transportation systems; Intersection management; Mobile robots; Synchronization; Vehicular networks,Autonomous vehicles; Highway administration; Highway traffic control; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Man machine systems; Mobile robots; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Synchronization; Systems engineering; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Control system failures; Intelligent transportation systems; Intersection managements; Intersection protocols; Safety requirements; Signalized intersection; Synchronous protocols; Vehicular networks; Accidents
Publish or drop traffic event alerts?quality-aware decision making in participatory sensing-based vehicular CPS,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064759707&doi=10.1145%2f3321480&partnerID=40&md5=db6ff9a4159a6d9b3f28714de33776d8,"Vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS), among several other applications, may help address an everincreasing challenge of traffic congestion in large cities. Nevertheless, VCPS can be hindered by information falsification problem, resulting due to the wrong perception of a traffic event or deliberate faking by the participating vehicles. Such information fabrication causes the re-routing of vehicles and artificial congestion, leading to economic, safety, environmental, and health hazards. Thus, it is imperative to infer truthful traffic information in real-time to restore the operational reliability of the VCPS. In this work, we propose a novel reputation scoring and decision support framework, called Spoofed and False Report Eradicator (SAFE), which offers a cost-effective and efficient solution to handle information falsification problem in the VCPS domain. The framework includes humans in the sensing loop by exploiting the paradigm of participatory sensing, a concept of a mobile security agent (MSA) to nullify the effects of deliberate false contribution, and a variant of the distance bounding mechanism to thwart location-spoofing attacks. A regression-based model integrates these effects to generate the expected truthfulness of a participant's contribution. To determine if any contribution is true or false, a generalized linear model is used to transform the expected truthfulness into a Quality of Contribution (QoC) score. The QoC of different reports is aggregated to compute user reputation. Such reputation enables classification of different participation behaviors. Finally, an Expected Utility Theory (EUT)-based decision model is proposed that utilizes the reputation score to determine if event-specific information should be published or dropped. To evaluate the SAFE framework through experimental study, we used both simulated and real data to compare its reputation-based user segregation performance with stateof- the-art frameworks. Experimental results exhibit that SAFE captures the fine differences in participants' behavior through the quality and quantity of participation, and the accuracy of their informed location. It also significantly improves operational reliability through publishing the information of only legitimate events. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automated decision making; Information falsification; Participatory sensing; Reputation; Vehicular cyber-physical system,Automobile manufacture; Cost effectiveness; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Health hazards; Human computer interaction; Mathematical transformations; Automated decision making; Decision support framework; Expected utility theory; Generalized linear model; Information falsification; Operational reliability; Participatory Sensing; Reputation; Traffic congestion
Determining Timing Parameters for the Code Generation from Platform-Independent Timed Models,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075489467&doi=10.1145%2f3230711&partnerID=40&md5=23e0628aae81515c05188bce0fc0bc41,"Safety-critical embedded systems often need to meet dependability requirements such as strict input/output timing constraints. To meet the timing requirements, the code generation (e.g., C code) from timed models needs to determine the timing parameters that indicatewhen the code has to perform I/Owith its platform.We propose a novel framework to determine such timing parameters from platform-independent timed models. Our framework involves two transformations. The first transformation systematically extends the platformindependent model by explicitly modeling input/output processing (e.g., sampling or interrupt-based) and the code invocation (e.g., periodic or aperiodic) mechanisms. Then, we verify if the resulting platform-specific model meets the timing requirements. In the case that the resulting model does not satisfy the timing requirements, we apply the second transformation to compensate the platform delay via adjusting the timing parameters at the code level. We formulate the adjustment mechanism using integer linear programming. If such an adjustment is feasible, generating the code with the new timing parameters guarantees the implemented system to meet the timing requirements. We validate our framework with case studies running on Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) infusion pump platforms. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Code generation; Medical device; Platform-independent models; Platform-specific models; Real-Time embedded systems; Timed automata,Codes (symbols); Embedded systems; Integer programming; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Timing circuits; Code Generation; Medical Devices; Platform independent model; Platform specific model; Real-time embedded systems; Timed Automata; C (programming language)
Human-interaction-aware adaptive functional safety processing for multi-functional automotive cyber-physical systems,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488522&doi=10.1145%2f3337931&partnerID=40&md5=4adff4981aded21e39208ae912f1bf0f,"The functional safety research for automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS) has been studied in recent years; however, these studies merely consider the change in the exposure of the functional safety classification and assume that the driver’s controllability in the functional safety classification is always fixed and uncontrollable. In fact, the driver’s controllability is variable during the runtime phase, such that the execution process of safety-critical automotive functions is a human-interaction-aware process between the driver and ACPS. To adapt to the changes in the driver’s controllability, this article studies the human-interaction-aware adaptive functional safety processing for multi-functional ACPS in two main phases. In the design phase, where the driver’s controllability is fixed at the highest level (i.e., C3), we obtain the approximate optimal priority sequence of safety-critical functions without exhausting all sequences by proposing the refined exploration method. In the runtime phase, where the driver’s controllability level is variable (i.e., C0, C1, C2, or C3), we propose the human-interaction-aware task remapping method to autonomously respond to the change of the driver’s controllability. Examples and experiments confirm that the proposed adaptive functional safety processing can reduce overall task redundancy of safety-critical automotive functions while meeting their functional safety requirements, shorten the overall response time of safety-critical automotive functions, and increase the slack time for non-safety-critical automotive functions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",And Phrases: Automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS); Functional safety; Human-interaction-aware,Controllability; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; And Phrases: Automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS); Design phase; Execution process; Exploration methods; Functional Safety; Human interactions; Multi-functional; Safety-critical functions; Safety engineering

As a result, asymmetric network delays caused by either network congestion or malicious packet delays can cause significant synchronization errors. This article exploits sinusoidal voltage signals of an alternating current (AC) power grid to limit the impact of the asymmetric network delays on these clock synchronization protocols. Our extensive measurements show that the voltage signals at geographically distributed locations in a city are highly synchronized. Leveraging calibrated voltage phases, we develop a new clock synchronization protocol that we call Grid Time Protocol (GTP), which allows direct measurement of one-way packet transmission times between its slave and master nodes, subject to an analytic condition that can be easily verified in practice. The direct measurements render GTP resilient against asymmetric network delays under this condition. A prototype implementation of GTP maintains sub-millisecond synchronization accuracy for two nodes tens of kilometers apart in the presence of malicious packet delays. The result has been demonstrated for both Singapore and Hangzhou, China. Simulations driven by real network delay measurements between Singapore and Hangzhou under both normal and congested network conditions also show the synchronization accuracy improvement by GTP. We believe that GTP is suitable for grid-connected distributed systems that are currently served by NTP but desire higher resilience against unfavorable network dynamics and packet delay attacks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Clock synchronization; Power grid; SECURITY,Electric impedance measurement; Internet protocols; Mechanical clocks; Message passing; Network security; Synchronization; Voltage measurement; Accuracy Improvement; Clock Synchronization; Network time protocol; Packet transmissions; Power grids; Prototype implementations; SECURITY; Synchronization error; Electric power transmission networks

Therefore, in this article, we propose a crowdsensing-based cyber-physical system for drone surveillance. The proposed system, CSDrone, utilizes surveillance data captured and sent from citizens’ mobile devices (e.g., Android and iOS devices, as well as other image or video capturing devices) to facilitate jointly drone detection and tracking.

Energy-efficient ECG signal compression for user data input in cyber-physical systems by leveraging empirical mode decomposition,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488391&doi=10.1145%2f3341559&partnerID=40&md5=0708cea04f2c4082761d7a2705194698,"Human physiological data are naturalistic and objective user data inputs for a great number of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Electrocardiogram (ECG) as a widely used physiological golden indicator for certain human state and disease diagnosis is often used as user data input for various CPS such as medical CPS and human–machine interaction. Wireless transmission and wearable technology enable long-term continuous ECG data acquisition for human–CPS interaction; however, these emerging technologies bring challenges of storing and wireless transmitting huge amounts of ECG data, leading to energy efficiency issue of wearable sensors. ECG signal compression technique provides a promising solution for these challenges by decreasing ECG data size. In this study, we develop the first scheme of leveraging empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on ECG signals for sparse feature modeling and compression and further propose a new ECG signal compression framework based on EMD constructed feature dictionary. The proposed method features in compressing ECG signals using a very limited number of feature bases with low computation cost, which significantly improves the compression performance and energy efficiency. Our method is validated with the ECG data from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and compared with existing methods. The results show that our method achieves the compression ratio (CR) of up to 164 with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.48% and the average CR of 88.08 with the RMSE of 5.66%, which is more than twice of the average CR of the state-of-the-art methods with similar recovering error rate of around 5%. For diagnostic distortion perspective, our method achieves high QRS detection performance with the sensitivity (SE) of 99.8% and the specificity (SP) of 99.6%, which shows that our ECG compression method can preserve almost all the QRS features and have no impact on the diagnosis process.

National-scale traffic model calibration in real time with multi-source incomplete data,2019,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488663&doi=10.1145%2f3300186&partnerID=40&md5=c20f0809049e4daf6f84b1d68b714038,"Real-time traffic modeling at national scale is essential to many applications, but its calibration is extremely challenging due to its large spatial and fine temporal coverage. The existing work is focused on urban-scale calibration with complete field data from single data sources (e.g., loop sensors or taxis), which cannot be generalized to national scale because complete single-source field data at national scale are almost impossible to obtain. To address this challenge, in this article, we design MultiCalib, a model calibration framework to optimize traffic models based on multiple incomplete data sources at national scale in real time. Instead of simply combining multi-source data, we theoretically formulate a multi-source model calibration problem based on real-world contexts and multi-view learning. In particular, we design (i) convex multi-view learning to integrate multi-source data by quantifying biases of data sources, and (ii) context-aware tensor decomposition to infer incomplete multi-source data by extracting real-world contexts. More importantly, we implement and evaluate MultiCalib with two heterogeneous nationwide vehicle networks with 340,000 vehicles to infer traffic conditions on 36 expressways and 119 highways, along with four cities across China. The results show that MultiCalib outperforms baseline calibration by 25% on average with the same input data. Based on the proposed national-scale traffic model calibration, we design a novel dispatching framework integrated with our speed calibration model where we guide a vehicular fleet among national-scale highways with a routing strategy to reduce general traveling time. The results show that a routing strategy based on MultiCalib outperforms a routing strategy based on a state-of-the-art traffic model by 45% on average. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Online load tracking is the problem of monitoring an individual electrical load's energy usage in software by analyzing the building's aggregate smart meter data. Load tracking differs from the well-studied problem of load disaggregation in that it emphasizes per-load accuracy and efficient, online operation rather than accurate disaggregation of every building load via offline analysis. In essence, tracking a particular load creates a virtual power meter for it, which mimics having a networked-connected power meter attached to the load, but notably does not require tracking every other load as well. We propose PowerPlay, a model-driven system for performing accurate, high-performance online load tracking. Our results from applying the system to real-world energy data demonstrate that PowerPlay (i) enables efficient online tracking on low-power embedded platforms, (ii) scales to thousands of loads (across many buildings) on server platforms, and (iii) improves per-load accuracy by more than a factor of two compared to a state-of-the-art load disaggregation algorithm. Our results point to the potential of replacing physical energy meters by “virtual” power meters using a system like PowerPlay. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are predominately implemented using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However, more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL), which has had success in other applications, such as robotics. Yet previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with state-of-the-art RL algorithms-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Proximal Policy Optimization. To investigate these unknowns, we first developed an open source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then used our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Model-based quantitative evaluation of repair procedures in gas distribution networks,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059442347&doi=10.1145%2f3284037&partnerID=40&md5=01c272ab878a72a5702b14aff213750d,"We propose an approach for assessing the impact of multi-phased repair procedures on gas distribution networks, capturing load profiles that can depend on time for different classes of users, suspension of activities during non-working hours, and random execution times depending on topological, physical, and geographical characteristics of the network. The problem is characterized through a semi-formal specification based on artifacts of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is then translated into a formal model based on stochastic time Petri nets. The solution method interleaves fluid-dynamic analysis of the gas behavior and stochastic analysis of the time spent in the repair process, decoupling complexities and making stochastic analysis almost insensitive to the network size and topology. Hence, our approach turns out to be applicable to real scale cases, notably computing the optimal time of day to start the repair procedure. Moreover, by encompassing general (non-Markovian) distributions, the approach enables effective fitting of durations. © 2018 held by the owner/author(s).",Gas distribution networks; Low pressure risk; Performability measures; Repair procedures; Stochastic durations,Fluid dynamics; Gases; Markov processes; Modeling languages; Petri nets; Repair; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Topology; Gas distribution network; Low pressures; Performability; Quantitative evaluation; Semi-formal specification; Stochastic analysis; Stochastic durations; Systems modeling languages; Stochastic systems
Inferring smart schedules for dumb thermostats,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068775040&doi=10.1145%2f3226031&partnerID=40&md5=a3eceecd8c9eae48a12cd073645f33f6,"Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for over 50% of a typical home's energy usage. A thermostat generally controls HVAC usage in a home to ensure user comfort. In this article, we focus on making existing ""dumb"" programmable thermostats smart by applying energy analytics on smart meter data to infer home occupancy patterns and compute an optimized thermostat schedule. Utilities with smart meter deployments are capable of immediately applying our approach, called iProgram, to homes across their customer base. iProgram addresses newchallenges in inferring home occupancy from smart meter datawhere (i) training data is not available and (ii) the thermostat schedule may bemisalignedwith occupancy, frequently resulting in high power usage during unoccupied periods. iProgram translates occupancy patterns inferred from opaque smart meter data into a custom schedule for existing types of programmable thermostats, e.g., 1-day, 7-day, and so on. We implement iProgram as a web service and show that it reduces the mismatch time between the occupancy pattern and the thermostat schedule by a median value of 44.28min (out of 100 homes) when compared to a default 8am-6pm weekday schedule, with a median deviation of 30.76min off the optimal schedule. Further, iProgram yields a daily energy savings of 0.42kWh on average across the 100 homes. Moreover, the schedules generated from iProgram converge to optimal schedules within a couple of weeks for most homes.We also show that homeowners having multiple HVAC zones can utilize iProgram and potentially increase unconditioned times of less occupied parts of their homes by 70%. Utilities may use iProgram to recommend thermostat schedules to customers and provide them estimates of potential energy savings in their energy bills. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Energy efficiency; HVAC control; Occupancy detection; Scheduling,Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Potential energy; Scheduling; Thermostats; Web services; Customerbase; Energy bills; HVAC control; Occupancy detections; Optimal schedule; Programmable thermostats; Training data; User comforts; Smart meters

The proprietary nature of Z-Wave devices makes it difficult to determine their security aptitude. While there are a variety of open source tools for analyzing Z-Wave frames, inspecting non-volatile memory, and disassembling firmware, there are no dynamic analysis tools allowing one to inspect the internal state of a Z-Wave transceiver while it is running. In this work, a memory introspection capability is developed for three Z-Wave devices containing a ZW0301, a Z-Wave transceiver system-on-chip. In all three devices, the firmware image is modified to include the memory introspection capability by hooking an existing data exfiltration mechanism used by the device. The memory introspection capability is applied to determine how nonces are generated by Z-Wave devices to prevent replay attacks. Through a combination of static and dynamic analysis, the nonce generating algorithm is found to be based on a nonce round key that updates every secure frame transaction. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Firmware modification; Internet of Things; Volatile memory introspection; Z-Wave,Firmware; Internet of things; Office automation; System-on-chip; Transceivers; Automation services; Data exfiltration; Dynamic analysis tools; Non-volatile memory; Open source tools; Static and dynamic analysis; Transceiver system; Volatile memory; Digital storage

This article first realizes a cyberphysical avatar that integrates three key technologies: Body-compliant control, neuroevolution, and real-time constraints. Body-compliant control is essential for operator safety, because avatars perform cooperative tasks in close proximity to humans; neuroevolution (NEAT) enables ""programming"" avatars such that they can be used by non-experts for a large array of tasks, some unforeseen, in an unstructured environment; and real-time constraints are indispensable to provide predictable, bounded-time response in human-avatar interaction. Then, we present a study on the tradeoffs between three design parameters for robotic task systems that must incorporate at least three dimensions: (1) the amount of training effort for robot to perform the task, (2) the time available to complete the task when the command is given, and (3) the quality of the result of the performed task. A tradeoff study in this design space by using the imprecise computation as a framework is to perform a common robotic task, specifically, grasping of unknown objects.

Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators.

However, such devices also pose serious privacy concerns due to the personal nature of the data being collected. In this article, we present an algorithm for aggregating data in a distributed manner that keeps the data on the devices themselves, releasing only sums and other aggregates to centralized operators. We offer two privacy-preserving configurations of our solution, one limited to crash failures and supporting a basic kind of aggregation; the second supporting a wider range of queries and also tolerating Byzantine behavior by compromised nodes. The former is quite fast and scalable, the latter more robust against attack and capable of offering full differential privacy for an important class of queries, but it costs more and injects noise that makes the query results slightly inaccurate. Other configurations are also possible. At the core of our approach is a new kind of overlay network (a superimposed routing structure operated by the endpoint devices). This overlay is optimally robust and convergent, and our protocols use it both for aggregation and as a general-purpose infrastructure for peer-to-peer communications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Anonymous aggregation; Data mining; Overlay networks; Smart meters,Aggregates; Data mining; Data privacy; Electric power transmission networks; Overlay networks; Smart meters; Compromised nodes; Differential privacies; Distributed query; Mobile health application; Peer-to-peer communications; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Routing structures; Distributed computer systems

Regrettably, this new trend results in new security challenges that can put the safety and privacy of the automotive CPS and passengers at great risk. In addition, automotive wireless communication security is constrained by strict energy and performance limitations of electronic controller units and sensors. As a result, the key generation and management for secure automotive CPS wireless communication is an open research challenge. This article aims to help solve these security challenges by presenting a practical key generation technique based on the reciprocity and high spatial and temporal variation properties of the automotive wireless communication channel. Accompanying this technique is also a key length optimization algorithm to improve performance (in terms of time and energy) for safety-related applications constrained by small communicationwindows. To validate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted simulations alongside real-world experiments with vehicles and RC cars.

TORUS: Scalable requirements traceability for large-scale cyber-physical systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068598748&doi=10.1145%2f3203208&partnerID=40&md5=d59882b6df0668b9d7409c4b75c32c61,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) contain intertwined and distributed software, hardware, and physical components to control complex physical processes. They find wide application in industrial systems, such as smart grid protection systems, which face increasingly complex communication and computation needs. Due to the scale and complexity of the interactions that occur within CPS, tracing requirements through to the system components and software code that implement them is often hard. Existing requirements management systems do not scale well, and traceability is difficult to implement and maintain in highly heterogeneous systems. However, the information trace that links provide is crucial for supporting testing and certification activities in safety-critical environments such as smart grids. The well-formed models of power systems provided by the IEC 61850 standard and the software design structure provided by the IEC 61499 Function Blocks standard can be leveraged to automate many traceability operations. We present Traceability of Requirements Using Splices (TORUS), a novel traceability framework for the development of large-scale safety-critical CPS. TORUS introduces splices, autonomous graph-based data structures that automatically create and manage trace links between requirements and components through the inevitable changes that occur during system development. The formal, graph-based structure of TORUS lends itself well to the development of sophisticated algorithms to automate the extraction of useful traceability information such as historical records and metrics for requirements coverage and component coupling. By capturing not only the current state of the system but also historical information, TORUS allows project teams to see a much richer view of the system and its artifacts. We apply TORUS to the development of a protection system for smart grid substations. In addition, through a number of experiments in splice creation, modification, and application of automated algorithms, we show that TORUS scales easily to large systems containing hundreds of thousands of requirements and system components and millions of possible trace links. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Certification; Cyber-physical systems; Graphs; IEC 61499; Industrial automation systems; Requirements; Requirements management; Requirements traceability,Automation; Cyber Physical System; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Graphic methods; Outsourcing; Requirements engineering; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Smart power grids; Software design; Certification; Graphs; IEC 61499; Industrial automation system; Requirements; Requirements management; Requirements traceability; Information management

By our algorithm, the aggregator can confirm whether a user's data value is equal to certain value or within certain scale. Consequently, it is also possible to count the number of users satisfying given conditions.

Thus, safety has been perceived as a crucial system property since the early days by the industry, the medical community, and the regulatory agents. In this article, we discuss the application of the mathematically rigorous technique known as Formal Verification to analyze the safety properties of a laser incision case study, and we assess its safe and predictable operation. Like all formal methods approaches, our analysis has three distinct components: a method to create a model of the system, a language to specify the properties, and a strategy to prove rigorously that the behavior of the model fulfills the desired properties. The model of the system takes the form of a hybrid automaton consisting of a discrete control part that operates in a continuous environment. The safety constraints are formalized as reachability properties of the hybrid automaton model, while the verification strategy exploits the capabilities of the tool Ariadne to address the verification problem and answer the related questions ranging from safety to efficiency and effectiveness. © 2018 ACM",Formal verification; Hybrid systems; Surgical robotics,Hybrid systems; Laser safety; Patient rehabilitation; Robots; Hybrid automaton models; Hybrid automatons; Medical community; Potential hazards; Safety constraint; Surgical robotics; Verification problems; Verification Strategy; Formal verification

However, neither centralized nor distributed solutions can protect PSN communications as expected. How to automatically control data access in a trustworthy and efficient way is an important security issue. In this article, we propose a scheme to guarantee communication data security in PSN based on two dimensions of trust in a flexible manner on the basis of Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). Its advantages and performance are justified and evaluated through extensive analysis on security, computation complexity, communication cost, scalability, and flexibility, as well as scheme implementation. In addition, we develop a demo system based on Android mobile devices to test our scheme in practice. The results demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness.

The challenge is also compounded by the increasing complexity of power grids in both cyber and physical domains. In this article, we develop a stochastic Petri net based analytical model to assess and analyze the system reliability of smart grids, specifically against topology attacks under system countermeasures (i.e., intrusion detection systems and malfunction recovery techniques). Topology attacks, evolving from false data injection attacks, are growing security threats to smart grids. In our analytical model, we define and consider both conservative and aggressive topology attacks, and two types of unreliable consequences (i.e., system disturbances and failures). The IEEE 14-bus power system is employed as a case study to clearly explain the model construction and parameterization process. The benefit of having this analytical model is the capability to measure the system reliability from both transient and steady-state analysis.

However, the implementation of cyber-physical systems in hospitals has been limited. By nature, in clinical operations, patient safety and consideration for health outcomes are of the utmost importance, thus possibly slowing the implementation of innovative solutions with limited history. Revenues from operating room (OR) time and surgery account for about 50% of the income of major hospitals (Erdogan et al. 2011; Cuschieri 2006), but the efficiency of OR utilization is often reported to be relatively low. Therefore, improving OR management with a cyber-physical system should be a priority. In this article, we will report on our experience implementing a cyber-physical system at Houston Methodist Hospital and discuss some of the difficulties and potential drivers for success. Our pilot study was done in the context of the management of a large suite of ORs. It uses the agile codevelopment of a cyber-physical system through an intense collaboration of clinicians and computational scientists.

This article studies the energy savings potential of a commercial soccer stadium during day-to-day operation. Buildings of this kind are characterized by special purpose system installations like grass heating systems and by event-driven usage patterns. This work presents a methodology to holistically analyze the stadium's characteristics and integrate its existing instrumentation into a Cyber-Physical System, enabling to deploy different control strategies flexibly. In total, seven different strategies for controlling the studied stadium's grass heating system are developed and tested in operation. Experiments in winter season 2014/2015 validated the strategies' impacts within the real operational setup of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt, Germany. With 95% confidence, these experiments saved up to 66% of median daily weather-normalized energy consumption. Extrapolated to an average heating season, this corresponds to savings of 775MWh and 148t of CO2 emissions. In winter 2015/2016 an additional predictive nighttime heating experiment targeted lower temperatures, which increased the savings to up to 85%, equivalent to 1GWh (197t CO2) in an average winter. Beyond achieving significant energy savings, the different control strategies also met the target temperature levels to the satisfaction of the stadium's operational staff. While the case study constitutes a significant part, the discussions dedicated to the transferability of this work to other stadiums and other building types show that the concepts and the approach are of general nature. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the first successful application of Deep Belief Networks to regress and predict the thermal evolution of building systems. © 2018 ACM",Deep belief network; Energy efficiency; Predictive control; Stadium operation; Statistical inference; System modeling; Under-soil heating,Carbon dioxide; Cyber Physical System; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Heating; Heating equipment; Recreation centers; Stadiums; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Deep belief networks; Heating system; Predictive control; Soil heating; Stadium operation; Statistical inference; System models; Under-soil heating; Energy efficiency
Dependable model-driven development of CPS: From Stateflow simulation to verified implementation,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070892364&doi=10.1145%2f3078623&partnerID=40&md5=33df7a07b0cb7efa1a9d9ca756f5e32a,"Simulink is widely used for model-driven development (MDD) of cyber-physical systems. Typically, the Simulink-based development starts with Stateflow modeling, followed by simulation, validation, and code generation mapped to physical execution platforms. However, recent trends have raised the demands of rigorous verification on safety-critical applications to prevent intrinsic development faults and improve the system dependability, which is unfortunately challenging. Even though the constructed Stateflow model and the generated code pass the validation of Simulink Design Verifier and Simulink Polyspace, respectively, the system may still fail due to some implicit defects contained in the design model (design defect) and the generated code (implementation defects). In this article, we bridge the Stateflow-basedMDD and a well-defined rigorous verification to reduce development faults. First, we develop a self-contained toolkit to translate a Stateflow model into timed automata, where major advanced modeling features in Stateflow are supported. Taking advantage of the strong verification capability of Uppaal, we can not only find bugs in Stateflow models that are missed by Simulink Design Verifier but also check more important temporal properties. Next, we customize a runtime verifier for the generated non-intrusive VHDL and C code of a Stateflow model for monitoring. The major strength of the customization is the flexibility to collect and analyze runtime properties with a pure software monitor, which offers more opportunities for engineers to achieve high reliability of the target system compared with the traditional act that only relies on Simulink Polyspace. In this way, safety-critical properties are both verified at the model level and at the consistent system implementation level with physical execution environment in consideration. We apply our approach to the development of a typical cyber-physical system-train communication controller based on the IEC standard 61375. Experiments show that more ambiguousness in the standard are detected and confirmed and more development faults and those corresponding errors that would lead to system failure have been removed. Furthermore, the verified implementation has been deployed on real trains. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Formal verification; Model-driven development; Runtime verification; Simulink stateflow; Timed automaton,Codes (symbols); Computer aided software engineering; Cyber Physical System; Defects; Embedded systems; Formal verification; Safety engineering; Software reliability; Systems engineering; Communication controllers; Execution environments; Model driven development; Run-time verification; Safety critical applications; STATEFLOW; System implementation; Timed Automata; C (programming language)
Holistic cyber-physical management for dependable wireless control systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053810266&doi=10.1145%2f3185510&partnerID=40&md5=a2de52f23f74971007cdba587dc78b5e,"Wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) are gaining momentum in industrial process automation as a communication infrastructure for lowering deployment and maintenance costs. In traditional wireless control systems, the plant controller and the network manager operate in isolation, which ignores the significant influence of network reliability on plant control performance. To enhance the dependability of industrial wireless control, we propose a holistic cyber-physical management framework that employs runtime coordination between the plant control and network management. Our design includes a holistic controller that generates actuation signals to physical plants and reconfigures the WSAN to maintain the desired control performance while saving wireless resources. As a concrete example of holistic control, we design a holistic manager that dynamically reconfigures the number of transmissions in the WSAN based on online observations of physical and cyber variables. We have implemented the holistic management framework in the wireless cyber-physicalsimulator (WCPS). A systematic case study is presented based on two five-state plants and a load positioning system using a 16-node WSAN. Simulation results show that the holistic management design has significantly enhanced the dependability of the system against both wireless interferences and physical disturbances, while effectively reducing the number of wireless transmissions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber-physical system; Model predictive control; Wireless control; Wireless sensor-actuator network,Actuators; Control systems; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Managers; Model predictive control; Network management; Communication infrastructure; Management frameworks; Number of transmissions; Physical disturbance; Wireless control; Wireless interference; Wireless sensor; Wireless transmissions; Wireless sensor networks
Dependable visual light-based indoor localization with automatic anomaly detection for location-based service of mobile cyber-physical systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075489669&doi=10.1145%2f3162051&partnerID=40&md5=e32fd91cb407b002f2fecc5ec47a50d4,"Indoor localization has become popular in recent years due to the increasing need of location-based services in mobile cyber-physical systems (CPS). The massive deployment of light emitting diodes (LEDs) further promotes the indoor localization using visual light. As a key enabling technique for mobile CPS, accurate indoor localization based on visual light communication remains nontrivial due to various non-idealities such as attenuation induced by unexpected obstacles. The anomalies of localization can potentially reduce the dependability of location-based services. In this article, we develop a novel indoor localization framework based on relative received signal strength. Most importantly, an efficient method is derived from the triangle inequality to automatically detect the abnormal LED lamps that are blocked by obstacles. These LED lamps are then ignored by our localization algorithm so that they do not bias the localization results, which improves the dependability of our localization framework. As demonstrated by the simulation results, the proposed techniques can achieve superior accuracy over the conventional approaches, especially when there exist abnormal LED lamps. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Dependability; Mobile cyber-physical systems; Relative received signal strength; Triangle inequality; Visual light based indoor localization,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Knowledge based systems; Light emitting diodes; Location; Location based services; Mobile devices; Telecommunication services; Dependability; Indoor localization; Mobile Cyber Physical Systems; Received signal strength; Triangle inequality; Indoor positioning systems
OS-aware automotive controller design using non-uniform sampling,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065776130&doi=10.1145%2f3121427&partnerID=40&md5=3955dc54391d414de42124f821c8f9bc,"Automotive functionalities typically consist of a large set of periodic/cyclic tasks scheduled under a real-time operating system (OS). Many of the tasks are feedback control applications with stringent performance requirements. OSEK/VDX is a common class of automotive OS that offers preemptive periodic schedules supporting a pre-configured set of periods. The feedback controllers implemented onto such OSEK/VDX-compliant systems need to use one of the pre-configured (sampling) periods. A shorter period is often desired for a higher control performance, and this implies a higher processor load. For a given performance requirement, the longest sampling period that meets this requirement is the optimal one. Given a limited set of pre-configured periods, such optimal sampling periods are often not available, and the practice is to choose a shorter available period-leading to a higher processor load. To address this, we propose a controller that cyclically switches among the available periods, thereby leading to an average sampling period closer to the optimal one. This way, we reduce the processor load and are able to pack more control applications on the same processor. The main challenge in this article is the design of such controllers that takes into account such cyclic switching of sampling periods (i.e., use non-uniform sampling). The controller needs to meet specified performance requirements (settling time) and system constraints (e.g., input saturation). Such a non-convex constrained controller optimization problem as raised in the OS-aware automotive systems design has not been addressed in the traditional optimal control literature. A novel approach based on adaptively parameterized particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve it. Using the OS-aware controller design with non-uniform sampling, we show that a higher number of applications can be packed on a processor, which is of particular interest in the cost-sensitive automotive industry. © 2018 ACM",Computation resources; Non-uniform sampling; Optimal control; OSEK/VDX,Automotive industry; Computer operating systems; Constrained optimization; Feedback control; Integrated circuit design; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Computation resources; Controller optimization; Feedback control applications; Nonuniform sampling; Optimal controls; OSEK/VDX; Performance requirements; Real time operating system; Controllers
Cross-domain noise impact evaluation for black box two-level control CPS,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075490010&doi=10.1145%2f3226029&partnerID=40&md5=ad2edcf0087be05ee3f370ebeb3edeb2,"Control Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) constitute a major category of CPS. In control CPSs, in addition to the well-studied noises within the physical subsystem, we are interested in evaluating the impact of cross-domain noise: the noise that comes from the physical subsystem, propagates through the cyber subsystem, and goes back to the physical subsystem. Impact of cross-domain noise is hard to evaluate when the cyber subsystem is a black box, which cannot be explicitly modeled. To address this challenge, this article focuses on the two-level control CPS, a widely adopted control CPS architecture, and proposes an emulation based evaluation methodology framework. The framework uses hybrid model reachability to quantify the cross-domain noise impact, and exploits Lyapunov stability theories to reduce the evaluation benchmark size. We validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework on a representative control CPS testbed. Particularly, 24.1% of evaluation effort is saved using the proposed benchmark shrinking technology. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cyber-physical systems; Hybrid automata; Hybrid model; Lyapunov stable; Testing,Cyber Physical System; Level control; Noise pollution; Testing; Cps architectures; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Effectiveness and efficiencies; Evaluation methodologies; Hybrid automatons; Hybrid model; Lyapunov stability theory; Two-level control; Embedded systems

A recent trend to contain costs while providing high quality of healthcare services is to foster the adoption of self-care procedures, performed primarily in patients' environments rather than in hospitals or healthcare structures, especially in the case of intensive and chronic patients' rehabilitation. This work presents a platform to enhance limb functional recovery through telerehabilitation sessions. It relies on a sensing system based on inertial sensors and data fusion algorithms, a module to provide biofeedback tailored to the users, and a module dedicated to the physicians' practices. The system design had to face several cyber-physical challenges due to the tight interaction between patient and sensors. For instance, integrating the body kinematics into the sensory processing improved the precision of measurements, simplified the calibration procedure, and made it possible to generate bio-feedback signals. The precision of the proposed system is presented through a set of experiments, showing a resolution below one degree in monitoring joint angles. A validation of the proposed solution has been performed through a medical trial on 50 patients affected by osteo-articular diseases. The presented framework has been designed to operate in other application fields, such as neurological rehabilitation (e.g., Parkinson, Stroke, etc.), sports training, and fitness activities. © 2018 ACM.",Inertial sensors; Limb tracking; Telerehabilitation; Wireless sensor networks,Biofeedback; Data fusion; Health care; Inertial navigation systems; Wireless sensor networks; Calibration procedure; Data fusion algorithm; Functional recovery; Healthcare structures; Inertial sensor; Neurological rehabilitation; Sensory processing; Telerehabilitation; Patient rehabilitation
Closed-loop quantitative verification of rate-adaptive pacemakers,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055881154&doi=10.1145%2f3152767&partnerID=40&md5=a7b7260706e758e5413ac68ed80ba18c,"Rate-adaptive pacemakers are cardiac devices able to automatically adjust the pacing rate in patients with chronotropic incompetence, i.e., whose heart is unable to provide an adequate rate at increasing levels of physical, mental, or emotional activity. These devices work by processing data from physiological sensors in order to detect the patient's activity and update the pacing rate accordingly. Rate adaptation parameters depend on many patient-specific factors, and effective personalization of such treatments can only be achieved through extensive exercise testing, which is normally intolerable for a cardiac patient. In this work, we introduce a data-driven and model-based approach for the automated verification of rate-adaptive pacemakers and formal analysis of personalized treatments. To this purpose, we develop a novel dual-sensor pacemaker model where the adaptive rate is computed by blending information from an accelerometer, and a metabolic sensor based on the QT interval. Our approach enables personalization through the estimation of heart model parameters from patient data (electrocardiogram), and closed-loop analysis through the online generation of synthetic, model-based QT intervals and acceleration signals. In addition to personalization, we also support the derivation of models able to account for the varied characteristics of a virtual patient population, thus enabling safety verification of the device. To capture the probabilistic and nonlinear dynamics of the heart, we define a probabilistic extension of timed I/O automata with data and employ statistical model checking for quantitative verification of rate modulation. We evaluate our rate-adaptive pacemaker design on three subjects and a pool of virtual patients, demonstrating the potential of our approach to provide rigorous, quantitative insights into the closed-loop behavior of the device under different exercise levels and heart conditions. © 2018 ACM",PTIOA; Quantitative verification,Blending; Data handling; Formal methods; Heart; Hospital data processing; Pacemakers; Automated verification; Closed-loop analysis; Closed-loop behavior; Physiological sensors; Probabilistic extension; PTIOA; Quantitative verification; Statistical model checking; Model checking

Abnormalities in the heart's electrical behaviour can be managed with a cardiac pacemaker. Recently, the closed-loop testing of pacemakers with an emulation (real-time simulation) of the heart has been proposed. This enables developers to interrogate their pacemaker design without having to engage in costly or lengthy clinical trials. Many high-fidelity heart models have been developed, but are too computationally intensive to be simulated in real-time. Heart models, designed specifically for the closed-loop testing of pacemaker logic, are too abstract to be useful for the testing of pacemaker implementations. In the context of pacemaker testing, compared to high-fidelity heart models, this article presents a more computationally efficient heart model that generates realistic piecewise continuous electrical signals. The heart model is composed of cardiac cells that are connected by paths. Our heart model is based on the Stony Brook cardiac cell model and the UPenn path model, and improves them by stabilising the activation behaviour of the cells and by capturing the piecewise continuous behaviour of electrical propagation. We provide simulation results that show our ability to faithfully model a range of arrhythmias, such as VA conduction, heart blocks, and long Q-T syndrome. Moreover, re-entrant circuits (that cause arrhythmia) can be faithfully modelled, which only the discrete-event UPenn heart model is also able to achieve. © 2018 ACM",Cardiac; Electrophysiology; Emulation,Abstracting; Discrete event simulation; Electrophysiology; Pacemakers; Cardiac; Cardiac conductions; Closed-loop testing; Computationally efficient; Electrical propagation; Emulation; Piecewise-continuous; Real time simulations; Heart

Automotive functions involve distributed end-to-end computation in automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPSs). The automotive industry is highly cost-sensitive to the mass market. This study presents a resource-cost-aware fault-tolerant design methodology for end-to-end functional safety computation on ACPSs. The proposed design methodology involves early functional safety requirement verification and late resource cost design optimization. We first propose the functional safety requirement verification (FSRV) method to verify the functional safety requirement consisting of reliability and response time requirements of the distributed automotive function during the early design phase. We then propose the resource-cost-aware fault-tolerant optimization (RCFO) method to reduce the resource cost while satisfying the functional safety requirement of the function during the late design phase. Finally, we perform experiments with real-life automotive and synthetic automotive functions. Findings reveal that the proposed RCFO and VFSR methods demonstrate satisfactory resource cost reduction compared with other methods while satisfying the functional safety requirement. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPSs); Functional safety; Reliability; Resource cost; Response time,Automotive industry; Cost reduction; Cyber Physical System; Distributed computer systems; Embedded systems; Fault tolerance; Reliability; Response time (computer systems); Automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPSs); Automotive functional safeties; Design Methodology; Early design phase; End-to-end computations; Fault tolerant design; Functional Safety; Resource costs; Design

Cyber-physical specification mismatches,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055873401&doi=10.1145%2f3170500&partnerID=40&md5=77a58740a0ff9b28e8e44108e17d9d80,"Embedded systems use increasingly complex software and are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPS) with sophisticated interaction and coupling between physical and computational processes. Many CPS operate in safety-critical environments and have stringent certification, reliability, and correctness requirements. These systems undergo changes throughout their lifetimes, where either the software or physical hardware is updated in subsequent design iterations. One source of failure in safety-critical CPS is when there are unstated assumptions in either the physical or cyber parts of the system, and new components do not match those assumptions. In this work, we present an automated method toward identifying unstated assumptions in CPS. Dynamic specifications in the form of candidate invariants of both the software and physical components are identified using dynamic analysis (executing and/or simulating the system implementation or model thereof). A prototype tool called Hynger (for HYbrid iNvariant GEneratoR) was developed that instruments Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) model diagrams to generate traces in the input format compatible with the Daikon invariant inference tool, which has been extensively applied to software systems. Hynger, in conjunction with Daikon, is able to detect candidate invariants of several CPS case studies. We use the running example of a DC-to-DC power converter and demonstrate that Hynger can detect a specification mismatch where a tolerance assumed by the software is violated due to a plant change. Another case study of an automotive control system is also introduced to illustrate the power of Hynger and Daikon in automatically identifying cyber-physical specification mismatches. © 2018 ACM",Cyber-physical systems; Dynamic analysis; Specifications,Cyber Physical System; DC-DC converters; Dynamic analysis; Safety engineering; Software prototyping; Specifications; Automotive control systems; Computational process; Critical environment; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Dc-to-DC power converters; Dynamic specifications; Physical components; System implementation; Embedded systems

However, the use of these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service disruptions. In this article, we study False Data Injection (FDI) attacks against railway Traction Power Systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor measurements-which we call efficiency attack and safety attack-that (i) maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a Global Attack Detection (GAD) system that serializes a bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection system can effectively detect FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false-positive and negative rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS setup is vulnerable to FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false-positive rate. © 2018 ACM",Efficiency; False data injection attacks; Global attack detection; Railway traction power systems; Safety,Accident prevention; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Attack detection; Control technologies; Extensive simulations; False data injection; False data injection attacks; False positive rates; Railway traction; Total power consumption; Railroads

The Smart Grid (SG) built on top of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the foundations of this CPS revolution, which involves a large number of smart objects connected by networks. The volume of time series of SG equipment is tremendous and the raw time series are very likely to contain missing values because of undependable network transferring. The problem of storing a tremendous volume of raw time series thereby providing a solid support for precise time series analytics now becomes tricky. In this article, we propose a dependable time series analytics (DTSA) framework for IoT-based SG. Our proposed DTSA framework is capable of providing a dependable data transforming from CPS to the target database with an extraction engine to preliminary refining raw data and further cleansing the data with a correction engine built on top of a sensor-network-regularization-based matrix factorization method. The experimental results reveal that our proposed DTSA framework is capable of effectively increasing the dependability of raw time series transforming between CPS and the target database system through the online lightweight extraction engine and the offline correction engine.

The Simplex architecture is shown to be an efficient tool to address software failures in such systems.

To address concurrent software and physical failures, this article presents the RSimplex architecture, which integrates Robust Fault-Tolerant Control (RFTC) techniques into the Simplex architecture. It includes the uncertainty monitor, the High-Performance Controller (HPC), the Robust High-Assurance Controller (RHAC), and the decision logic that triggers the switch of the controllers.

However, due to the sparse deployment of anchors and the instability of signals in the wireless environment, users cannot receive information from adequate anchors, which leads to the localization quality being undependable and unacceptable. To solve this problem, we propose exploiting the localized users as the mobile anchors for localizing the nonlocalized users. These mobile users cooperate as a whole group to improve the localization accuracy. Moreover, to decrease the communication cost among users, an algorithm for electing mobile anchors is designed, with several provable properties. This electing algorithm is a distributed method, without advanced negotiations among mobile users. In addition, for the scenarios with a crowd of users, we divide the users into different groups according to their distance information, which can ensure that only the dependable anchors are used for the localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the localization dependability can be improved obviously. In terms of localization probability, our method outperforms the traditional fixed anchors-based method by approximately 70% with a small increment of communication cost (about 30%), and outperforms the method in which all the localized users are exploited as mobile anchors by about 50% with about a 70% decrement of communication cost. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Communication cost; Grouping; Localization for mobile users; Localization probability; Mobile anchors electing,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Communication cost; Distance information; Grouping; Localization accuracy; Mobile anchors; Mobile users; Provable properties; Wireless environment; Anchors

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a Big Data technique to enable such analytics and is traditionally performed on Cloud Virtual Machines (VM). Leveraging captive IoT edge resources in combination with Cloud VMs can offer better performance, flexibility, and monetary costs for CEP. Here, we formulate an optimization problem for energy-aware placement of CEP queries, composed as an analytics dataflow, across a collection of edge and Cloud resources, with the goal of minimizing the end-to-end latency for the dataflow. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) meta-heuristic to solve this problem and compare it against a brute-force optimal algorithm (BF).

Wearable devices are intelligent and multifunctional, but they rely heavily on batteries. This greatly limits their application scope, where replacement of battery or recharging is challenging or inconvenient. We note that wearable devices have the opportunity to harvest energy from human motion, as they are worn by the users as long as being functioning. In this article, we propose a battery-free sensing platform for wearable devices in the form factor of shoes. It harvests the kinetic energy from walking or running to supply devices with power for sensing, processing, and wireless communication, covering all the functionalities of commercial wearable devices. We achieve this goal by enabling the whole system running on the harvested energy from two feet. Each foot performs separate tasks and two feet are coordinated by ambient backscatter communication. We instantiate this idea by building a prototype, containing energy harvesting insoles, power management circuits, and ambient backscatter module. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can wake up shortly after several seconds' walk and have sufficient Bluetooth throughput for supporting many applications. We believe that our framework can stir a lot of useful applications that were infeasible previously. © 2018 ACM.",backscatter communication; Battery-free; energy harvesting,Backscattering; Energy harvesting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Secondary batteries; Building a prototypes; Evaluation results; Form factors; Human motions; Power management circuits; Sensing platforms; Wearable devices; Wireless communications; Wearable technology

This paradigm is often referred to as edge computing. If edge resources are pooled together, they can be used as decentralized shared resources for IoT applications, providing increased capacity to scale up computations and minimize end-to-end latency. Managing applications on these edge resources is hard, however, due to their remote, distributed, and (possibly) dynamic nature, which necessitates autonomous management mechanisms that facilitate application deployment, failure avoidance, failure management, and incremental updates. To address these needs, we present CHARIOT, which is orchestration middleware capable of autonomously managing IoT systems consisting of edge resources and applications. CHARIOT implements a three-layer architecture. The topmost layer comprises a system description language, the middle layer comprises a persistent data storage layer and the corresponding schema to store system information, and the bottom layer comprises a management engine that uses information stored persistently to formulate constraints that encode system properties and requirements, thereby enabling the use of satisfiability modulo theory solvers to compute optimal system (re)configurations dynamically at runtime.

The current art in IoT architectures utilizes gateways to enable application-specific connectivity to IoT devices. In typical configurations, IoT gateways are shared among several IoT edge devices. Given the limited available bandwidth and processing capabilities of an IoT gateway, the service quality (SQ) of connected IoT edge devices must be adjusted over time not only to fulfill the needs of individual IoT device users but also to tolerate the SQ needs of the other IoT edge devices sharing the same gateway. However, having multiple gateways introduces an interdependent problem, the binding, i.e., which IoT device shall connect to which gateway. In this article, we jointly address the binding and allocation problems of IoT edge devices in a multigateway system under the constraints of available bandwidth, processing power, and battery lifetime. We propose a distributed trade-based mechanism in which after an initial setup, gateways negotiate and trade the IoT edge devices to increase the overall SQ. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach with a case study and through extensive experimentation over different IoT system configurations regarding the number and type of the employed IoT edge devices. Experiments show that our solution improves the overall SQ by up to 56% compared to an unsupervised system. Our solution also achieves up to 24.6% improvement on overall SQ compared to the state-of-the-art SQ management scheme, while they both meet the battery lifetime constraints of the IoT devices. © 2018 ACM.",computation offloading; constrained devices; distributed resource allocation; edge computing; Internet-of-Things; IoT,Bandwidth; Commerce; Electric batteries; Gateways (computer networks); Advanced monitoring; Allocation problems; Application specific; Available bandwidth; Internet of thing (IOT); Management scheme; Processing capability; System configurations; Internet of things

We model the systems under attack as hidden mode stochastic switched linear systems with unknown inputs and propose the use of a multiple-model inference algorithm to tackle these security issues. Moreover, we characterize fundamental limitations to resilient estimation (e.g., upper bound on the number of tolerable signal attacks) and discuss the topics of attack detection, identification, and mitigation under this framework. Simulation examples of switching and false data injection attacks on a benchmark system and an IEEE 68-bus test system show the efficacy of our approach to recover resilient (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) state estimates as well as to identify and mitigate the attacks.  © 2018 ACM.",false data injection attacks; Resilient systems; switching attacks,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Inference engines; Linear systems; Network security; Random processes; State estimation; Stochastic models; Attack detection; False data injection attacks; Fundamental limitations; Measurement Noise; Multiple-modeling; Simulation example; Switched linear system; Switching mechanism; Stochastic systems

Collaborative security exploits the capabilities of these connected devices and opportunistically composes them to protect assets from potential harm. By dynamically composing these capabilities, collaborative security implements the security controls that satisfy both security and non-security requirements. However, this dynamic composition is often hampered by the heterogeneity of the devices available in the environment and the diversity of their behaviours. In this article, we present a systematic, tool-supported approach for collaborative security where the analysis of requirements drives the opportunistic composition of capabilities to realise the appropriate security control in the operating environment. This opportunistic composition is supported through a combination of feature modelling and mediator synthesis. We use features and transition systems to represent and reason about capabilities and requirements. We formulate the selection of the optimal set of features to implement adequate security control as a multi-objective constrained optimisation problem and use constraint programming to solve it efficiently. The selected features are then used to scope the behaviours of the capabilities and thereby restrict the state space for synthesising the appropriate mediator. The synthesised mediator coordinates the behaviours of the capabilities to satisfy the behaviour specified by the security control. Our approach ensures that the implemented security controls are the optimal ones, given the capabilities available in the operating environment. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing a feature-driven mediation for collaborative security tool and applying it to a collaborative robots case study. © 2018 ACM.",Adaptive security; collaborative adaptation; feature models; mediator synthesis; requirements,Computer programming; Internet of things; Collaborative robots; Collaborative securities; Constrained optimisation problems; Constraint programming; Dynamic composition; Internet of thing (IOT); Operating environment; Security requirements; Constrained optimization

A Survey of Mobile Crowdsensing Techniques,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084305844&doi=10.1145%2f3185504&partnerID=40&md5=cf1071d983f0de875b6dff0e69caf4da,"Mobile crowdsensing serves as a critical building block for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the sensing devices continuously generate a large amount of data, which consumes much resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, and storage) and may sacrifice the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of applications. Prior work has demonstrated that there is significant redundancy in the content of the sensed data. By judiciously reducing redundant data, data size and load can be significantly reduced, thereby reducing resource cost and facilitating the timely delivery of unique, probably critical information and enhancing QoS. This article presents a survey of existing works on mobile crowdsensing strategies with an emphasis on reducing resource cost and achieving high QoS. We start by introducing the motivation for this survey and present the necessary background of crowdsensing and IoT. We then present various mobile crowdsensing strategies and discuss their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss future research directions for mobile crowdsensing for IoT. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, systems, and applications related to mobile crowdsensing and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyze and compare the strategies proposed in prior works, but also to discuss their applicability toward the IoT and provide guidance on future research directions for mobile crowdsensing. © 2018 ACM.",cost-effectiveness; Internet of Things; Mobile crowdsensing; quality of service; redundancy elimination,Cost reduction; Data reduction; Digital storage; Quality of service; Surveys; Building blockes; Future research directions; Internet of Things (IOT); Large amounts; Provide guidances; Redundant data; Resource costs; Sensing devices; Internet of things
Systematically Ensuring the Confidence of Real-Time Home Automation IoT Systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066024511&doi=10.1145%2f3185501&partnerID=40&md5=0f99db4ba739fbd87fd41a271ff50337,"Recent advances and industry standards in Internet of Things (IoT) have accelerated the real-world adoption of connected devices. To manage this hybrid system of digital real-time devices and analog environments, the industry has pushed several popular home automation IoT (HA-IoT) frameworks, such as If-This-Then-That (IFTTT), Apple HomeKit, and Google Brillo. Typically, users author device interactions by specifying the triggering sensor event and the triggered device command. In this seemingly simple software system, two dominant factors govern the system confidence properties with respect to the physical world. First, IoT users are largely nonexperts who lack the comprehensive consideration regarding potential impact and joint effect with existing rules. Second, while the increasing complexity of IoT devices enables fine-grained control (e.g., heater temperature) of continuous real-time environments, even two simply connected devices can have a huge state space to explore. In fact, bugs that wrongfully control devices and home appliances can have ramifications on system correctness and even user physical safety. It is crucial to help users to make sure the system they created meets their expectation. In this article we introduce how techniques from hybrid automata can be practically applied to assist nonexpert IoT users in the confidence checking of such hybrid HA-IoT systems. We propose an automated framework for end-to-end programming assistance. We build and check the Linear Hybrid Automata (LHA) model of the system automatically. We also present a quantifier elimination-based method to analyze the counterexample found and synthesize fix suggestions. We implemented a platform, MenShen, based on this framework and proposed techniques. We conducted sets of real HA-IoT case studies with up to 46 devices and 65 rules. Empirical results show that MenShen can find violations and generate rule fix suggestions in only 10 seconds. © 2018 ACM.",automatic modeling and verification; fix suggestion; home automation; IFTTT; internet of things; linear hybrid automata,Automata theory; Automation; Digital devices; Domestic appliances; Hybrid systems; Program debugging; Real time systems; Digital real time; Fine-grained control; Heater temperatures; Industry standards; Internet of Things (IOT); Linear hybrid automata; Quantifier elimination; Real-time environment; Internet of things

Recent advances in ultra-wideband RF communication have enabled accurate packet timestamping, which can be used to precisely synchronize time. Location may be further estimated by timing signal propagation, but this requires additional communication overhead to mitigate the effect of relative clock drift. This additional communication lowers overall channel efficiency and increases energy consumption. This article describes a novel approach to simultaneously localizing and time synchronizing networked mobile devices. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to estimate all devices' positions and clock errors, and packet timestamps serve as measurements that constrain time and overall network geometry. By inspection of the uncertainty in our state estimate, we can adapt the number of messages sent in each communication round to balance accuracy with communication cost. This reduces communication overhead, which decreases channel congestion and power consumption compared to traditional time of arrival and time difference of arrival localization techniques. We demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our approach using a real network of custom RF devices and mobile quadrotors. © 2018 ACM.",Localization; time synchronization; ultra-wideband,Clocks; Energy utilization; Kalman filters; Uncertainty analysis; Channel efficiency; Communication cost; Communication overheads; Communication rounds; Constrained sensors; Localization technique; Packet timestamping; Time synchronization; Ultra-wideband (UWB)

On learning how players learn: Estimation of learning dynamics in the routing game,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075489736&doi=10.1145%2f3078620&partnerID=40&md5=fccd1e643b182d304b43d5bffabfe2a7,"The routing game models congestion in transportation networks, communication networks, and other cyberphysical systems in which agents compete for shared resources. We consider an online learning model of player dynamics: At each iteration, every player chooses a route (or a probability distribution over routes, which corresponds to a flow allocation over the physical network), then the joint decision of all players determines the costs of each path, which are then revealed to the players. We pose the following estimation problem: Given a sequence of player decisions and the corresponding costs, we would like to estimate the parameters of the learning model. We consider, in particular, entropic mirror descent dynamics and reduce the problem to estimating the learning rates of each player. In order to demonstrate our methods, we developed a web application that allows players to participate in a distributed, online routing game, and we deployed the application on Amazon Mechanical Turk. When players log in, they are assigned an origin and destination on a shared network. They can choose, at each iteration, a distribution over their available routes, and each player seeks to minimize her own cost. We collect a dataset using this platform, then apply the proposed method to estimate the learning rates of each player. We observe, in particular, that after an exploration phase, the joint decision of the players remains within a small distance of the set of equilibria. We also use the estimated model parameters to predict the flow distribution over routes, and compare our predictions to the actual distributions, showing that the online learning model can be used as a predictive model over short horizons. Finally, we discuss some of the qualitative insights from the experiments, and give directions for future research. © 2018 ACM.",Behavioral experiment; Routing game; Sequential decision model,Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Iterative methods; Parameter estimation; Phase equilibria; Probability distributions; Amazon mechanical turks; Behavioral experiment; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Origin and destinations; Predictive modeling; Routing game; Sequential decisions; Transportation network; E-learning
Dependable deep computation model for feature learning on big data in cyber-physical systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065534750&doi=10.1145%2f3110218&partnerID=40&md5=b4e37118fa248d7d9413ea041721abff,"With the ongoing development of sensor devices and network techniques, big data are being generated from the cyber-physical systems. Because of sensor equipment occasional failure and network transmission unreliability, a large number of low-quality data, such as noisy data and incomplete data, is collected from the cyber-physical systems. Low-quality data pose a remarkable challenge on deep learning models for big data feature learning. As a novel deep learning model, the deep computation model achieves superior performance for big data feature learning. However, it is difficult for the deep computation model to learn dependable features for low-quality data, since it uses the nonlinear function as the encoder. In this article, a dependable deep computation model is proposed for feature learning on low-quality big data in cyber-physical systems. Specially, a regularity is added into the objective function of the deep computation model to obtain reliable features in the intermediate-level representation space. Furthermore, a learning algorithm based on the back-propagation strategy is devised to train the parameters of the proposed model. Finally, experiments are conducted on three representative datasets and a real dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the dependable deep computation model for low-quality big data feature learning. Results show that the proposed model achieves a remarkable result for the tasks of classification, restoration, and prediction, proving the potential of this work for practical applications in cyber-physical systems. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Back-propagation algorithm; Big data; Cyber-physical systems; Dependable deep computation model; Feature learning,Backpropagation algorithms; Big data; Computation theory; Cyber Physical System; Data communication equipment; Deep learning; Embedded systems; Large dataset; Machine learning; Computation model; Feature learning; Intermediate level; Network techniques; Network transmission; Nonlinear functions; Objective functions; Representation space; Learning algorithms

To overcome this limitation, we present BuildingRules, a trigger-action programming-based system that aims to provide occupants of commercial buildings with the possibility of specifying the characteristics of their office environment through an intuitive interface. Trigger-action programming is intuitive to use and has been shown to be effective in meeting user requirements in home environments. To extend this intuitive interface to commercial buildings, an essential step is to manage the system scalability as large number of users will express their policies. BuildingRules has been designed to scale well for large commercial buildings as it automatically detects conflicts that occur among user specified policies and it supports intelligent grouping of rules to simplify the policies across large numbers of rooms. We ensure the conflict resolution is fast for a fluid user experience by using the Z3 SMT solver. BuildingRules backend is based on RESTful web services so it can connect to various BMSs and scale well with large number of buildings. We have tested our system with 23 users across 17 days in a virtual office building, and the results we have collected prove the effectiveness and the scalability of BuildingRules. © 2018 ACM",Cyber-physical systems; Mobile; Smart environment; Ubiquitous systems,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Intelligent buildings; Mobile computing; Scalability; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Web services; Commercial building; Conflict Resolution; Intuitive interfaces; Mobile; Office environments; RESTful Web services; Smart environment; Ubiquitous systems; Office buildings
SMT-based observer design for cyber-physical systems under sensor atacks,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058021715&doi=10.1145%2f3078621&partnerID=40&md5=9b00d6aeafa39f1f988371b3ce3e151b,"We introduce a scalable observer architecture, which can efciently estimate the states of a discrete-time linear-time-invariant system whose sensors are manipulated by an attacker, and is robust to measurement noise. Given an upper bound on the number of attacked sensors, we build on previous results on necessary and sufcient conditions for state estimation, and propose a novel Multi-Modal Luenberger (MML) observer based on efcient Satisfability Modulo Theory (SMT) solving. We present two techniques to reduce the complexity of the estimation problem. As a frst strategy, instead of a bank of distinct observers, we use a family of flters sharing a single dynamical equation for the states, but different output equations, to generate estimates corresponding to different subsets of sensors. Such an architecture can reduce the memory usage of the observer from an exponential to a linear function of the number of sensors. We then develop an efcient SMT-based decision procedure that is able to reason about the estimates of the MML observer to detect at runtime which sets of sensors are attack-free, and use them to obtain a correct state estimate. Finally, we discuss two optimization-based algorithms that can efciently select the observer parameters with the goal of minimizing the sensitivity of the estimates with respect to sensor noise. We provide proofs of convergence for our estimation algorithm and report simulation results to compare its runtime performance with alternative techniques. We show that our algorithm scales well for large systems (including up to 5,000 sensors) for which many previously proposed algorithms are not implementable due to excessive memory and time requirements. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of resiliency to attacks and robustness to noise, on the design of large-scale power distribution networks. © 2018 ACM.",Satisfability modulo theory; Secure cyberphysical systems; Secure state estimation,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Invariance; Linear systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; State estimation; Time varying control systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Discrete-time linear time-invariant systems; Estimation algorithm; Modulo theories; Optimization-based algorithm; Power distribution network; Robustness to noise; Run-time performance; Equations of state

In various IoT and CPS application scenarios, the event processing systems are required to detect complex event patterns using large time window, namely long-term events. The detection of long-term event usually leads to a large number of redundant runtime instances and calculations that significantly deteriorates the system efficiency. In this article, we propose an efficient long-term event processing model, named Long-Term Complex Event Processing (LTCEP). It leverages the semantic constraints calculus to split long-term event into sub-models. We establish a long-term query and intermediate result buffering mechanism to optimize the real-time response ability and throughput performance. Experimental results show that LTCEP can effectively reduce more than 50% redundant runtime states, which provides over 60% faster response performance and around 30% higher system throughput comparing to other selected benchmarks. The results also imply that LTCEP model has better stability and scalability in large-scale event processing applications. © 2018 ACM",Cyber-Physical Systems; Data stream; Event processing; Internet of things; Long-term,Benchmarking; Calculations; Cyber Physical System; Data mining; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Network layers; Real time control; Semantics; Complex event processing; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Data stream; Event Processing; Intelligent computation; Internet of Things (IOT); Long-term; Throughput performance; Data handling
Confidentiality breach through acoustic side-channel in cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488313&doi=10.1145%2f3078622&partnerID=40&md5=2f372b1ecebee59770a1044a2ae948a8,"In cyber-physical systems, due to the tight integration of the computational, communication, and physical components, most of the information in the cyber-domain manifests in terms of physical actions (such as motion, temperature change, etc.). This leads to the system being prone to physical-to-cyber domain attacks that affect the confdentiality. Physical actions are governed by energy flows, which may be observed. Some of these observable energy flows unintentionally leak information about the cyber-domain and hence are known as the side-channels. Side-channels such as acoustic, thermal, and power allow attackers to acquire the information without actually leveraging the vulnerability of the algorithms implemented in the system. As a case study, we have taken cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems (fused deposition modelingbased three-dimensional (3D) printer) to demonstrate how the acoustic side-channel can be used to breach the confdentiality of the system. In 3D printers, geometry, process, and machine information are the intellectual properties, which are stored in the cyber domain (G-code). We have designed an attack model that consists of digital signal processing, machine-learning algorithms, and context-based post processing to steal the intellectual property in the form of geometry details by reconstructing the G-code and thus the test objects.

Dynamic security analysis of power systems by a sampling-based algorithm,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075489250&doi=10.1145%2f3208093&partnerID=40&md5=761bbe166d849a64444c63a3e035e46c,"Dynamic security analysis is an important problem of power systems on ensuring safe operation and stable power supply even when certain faults occur. No matter if such faults are caused by vulnerabilities of system components, physical attacks, or cyber-attacks that are more related to cyber-security, they eventually affect the physical stability of a power system. Examples of the loss of physical stability include the Northeast Blackout of 2003 in North America and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid nature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete switching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics make it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this article, we use the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and mainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding the continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is formulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model. A sampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating modeling and randomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search for a feasible execution connecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the desired operation mode. The proposed method enables the use of existing power system simulators for the synthesis of discrete switching and control strategies through randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic security analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system exhibiting hybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic security, the proposed method searches for a feasible strategy to ensure the dynamic security of the system in the face of disruptions. © 2018 ACM.",Dynamic security; Hybrid automaton; Power system; Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT); Reachability,Benchmarking; Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Differential equations; Dynamics; Electric power system security; Motion planning; Network security; Outages; Security systems; Dynamic security; Hybrid automatons; Power system; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Reachability; System stability

Our motivation example, alternating bit protocol, and application example, multi-track level crossing with sensors, both demonstrate that some nondeterministic behaviours can take place if the time associated with events is configured inappropriately or some concurrent events are controlled imperfectly in an overlapping period. These nondeterministic behaviours decrease the reliability and/or safety of a time-critical system. Therefore, it is valuable to formalise and check (non)determinacy. Time Petri Nets (TPN) in which the firing of every event is limited to a fix time interval are used to model time-critical systems in this article. We proposes a novel notion for TPN named time-soundness. It guarantees that the system always owns deterministic behaviours after any event is performed no matter when the event is performed. We utilise the notion of bisimulation to prove that the time-soundness can guarantee the behavioural determinacy. We propose an algorithm to check time-soundness, develop the related tool, and do experiments to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our notion and method. © 2018 ACM",Bisimulation; Concurrency; Determinism; Model checking; Time Petri nets; Time-critical systems,Petri nets; Bisimulations; Concurrency; Determinism; Time Petri nets; Time-critical systems; Model checking

However, in the wrong hands, the data might pose a privacy threat. In this article, we consider the tradeoff between the operational value of data collected in the IoT and the privacy of consumers. We present a general framework for quantifying this tradeoff in the IoT, and focus on a smart grid application for a proof of concept. In particular, we analyze the tradeoff between smart grid operations and how often data are collected by considering a realistic direct-load control example using thermostatically controlled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its performance degrades as the sampling frequency decreases. Additionally, we introduce a new privacy metric, which we call inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumes a strong adversary model and provides an upper bound on the adversary’s ability to infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses. Combining these two results allows us to directly consider the tradeoff between better operational performance and consumer privacy. © 2018 ACM",Privacy; Smart grid,Data privacy; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Control and monitoring; Direct load control; Internet of thing (IOT); Operational performance; Sampling frequencies; Smart grid; Smart grid applications; Thermostatically controlled loads; Internet of things
Selecting the transition speeds of engine control tasks to optimize the performance,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061526798&doi=10.1145%2f3127022&partnerID=40&md5=dae93e92796380ca100834cc54b619a4,"Engine control applications include functions that need to be executed at specifc rotation angles of the crankshaft. The tasks performing these functions are activated at variable rates and are programmed to be adaptive with respect to the rotation speed of the engine to avoid overloading the CPU. Simplifed control implementations are used at high speeds; for example, reducing the number of fuel injections or the complexity of the computations. Such different control implementations defne execution modes with different execution times for different ranges of the rotation speed. The selection of the switching speeds for the operating modes of such tasks is an optimization problem, consisting in determining the optimal transition speeds that maximize the engine performance while guaranteeing schedulability. This article presents three methods for tackling such an optimization problem under a set of assumptions about the performance metrics: Two heuristics and a branch and bound method that guarantees fnding the optimal solution within a given speed granularity. In addition, a simple method to compute a performance upper bound is presented. The approach and the hypothesis are validated using a Simulink model of the engine and the computational tasks, considering the engine efciency and the production of pollutants (NO2) as metrics of interest.

Hybrid optimal control under mode switching constraints with applications to pesticide scheduling,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488308&doi=10.1145%2f3047411&partnerID=40&md5=ec6ef0d0979415b5f23e052ffa516a4b,"This paper concerns optimal mode-scheduling in autonomous switched-mode hybrid dynamical systems, where the objective is to minimize a cost-performance functional defned on the state trajectory as a function of the schedule of modes. The controlled variable, namely the modes' schedule, consists of the sequence of modes and the switchover times between them. We propose a gradient-descent algorithm that adjusts a given mode-schedule by changing multiple modes over time-sets of positive Lebesgue measures, thereby avoiding the inefciencies inherent in existing techniques that change the modes one at a time. The algorithm is based on steepest descent with Armijo step sizes along Gâteaux differentials of the performance functional with respect to schedule-variations, which yields effective descent at each iteration. Since the space of modeschedules is infnite dimensional and incomplete, the algorithm's convergence is proved in the sense of Polak's framework of optimality functions and minimizing sequences. Simulation results are presented, and possible extensions to problems with dwell-time lower-bound constraints are discussed. © 2018 ACM.",Dwell time; Hybrid optimal control; Optimal control; Pesticide scheduling; Precision agriculture; Scheduling; Switch time optimization,Dynamical systems; Iterative methods; Pesticides; Precision agriculture; Scheduling; Controlled variables; Dwell time; Gradient descent algorithms; Hybrid dynamical systems; Hybrid optimal control; Optimal controls; Optimality function; Time optimization; Optimization

Data-driven model predictive control with regression trees-an application to building energy management,2018,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050087892&doi=10.1145%2f3127023&partnerID=40&md5=53268d6d2eac4816af60ffb62c1b0650,"Model Predictive Control (MPC) plays an important role in optimizing operations of complex cyber-physical systems because of its ability to forecast system's behavior and act under system level constraints. However, MPC requires reasonably accurate underlying models of the system. In many applications, such as building control for energy management, Demand Response, or peak power reduction, obtaining a high-fdelity physics-based model is cost and time prohibitive, thus limiting the widespread adoption of MPC. To this end, we propose a data-driven control algorithm for MPC that relies only on the historical data. We use multioutput regression trees to represent the system's dynamics over multiple future time steps and formulate a fnite receding horizon control problem that can be solved in real-time in closed-loop with the physical plant. We apply this algorithm to peak power reduction in buildings to optimally trade-off peak power reduction against thermal comfort without having to learn white/grey box models of the systems dynamics. © 2018 ACM.",Cyber-physical systems; Demand response; Machine learning; Peak power reduction; Predictive control,Cyber Physical System; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Energy management; Forestry; Learning systems; Predictive control systems; Trees (mathematics); Building controls; Building energy managements; Data-driven control; Demand response; Peak power reduction; Physics-based modeling; Predictive control; Receding horizon control; Model predictive control

The middleware realizes the channel-based publish/subscribe paradigm that has been identified as a valid means to asynchronously disseminate data in IoT applications. The novelty lies in the routing algorithm PSVR that greatly reduces the path lengths to deliver publications and its suitability for scenarios with a high subfluctuation rate. The middleware is self-stabilizing and eventually provides safety and liveness properties such as the guaranteed delivery of all published messages to all subscribers and the correct handling of subscriptions and unsubscriptions, while no error occurs. The evaluation of the middleware, based on simulations and a real deployment, shows that it has a low memory footprint and scales well with the number of nodes. © 2018 ACM",IoT; Publish/Subscribe; Self-stabilization; Wireless networks,Middleware; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Publishing; Wireless networks; Data dissemination; Guaranteed delivery; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT applications; Liveness properties; Publish/subscribe; Publish/subscribe middlewares; Self stabilization; Internet of things
Adaptive real-time scheduling of cyber-physical energy systems,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050099863&doi=10.1145%2f3047412&partnerID=40&md5=36f71eb5a75af3f73a73a9279856308c,"This article addresses the application of real-time scheduling to the reduction of the peak load of power consumption generated by electric loads in Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (CPES). The goal is to reduce the peak load while achieving a desired Quality of Service of the physical system under control. The considered physical processes are characterized by integrator dynamics and modelled as sporadic real-time activities. Timing constraints are obtained from physical parameters and are used to manage the activation of electric loads by a real-time scheduling algorithm. As a main contribution, an algorithm derived from the multi-processor real-time scheduling domain is proposed to efciently deal with a high number of physical processes (i.e., electric loads), making its scalability suitable for large CPES, such as smart energy grids. The cyber-physical nature of the proposed method arises from the tight interaction between the physical processes operated by the electric loads, and the applied scheduling. To allow the use of the proposed approach in practical applications, modelling approximations and uncertainties on physical parameters are explicitly included in the model. An adaptive control strategy is proposed to guarantee the requirements on physical values under control in presence of modelling and measurement uncertainties. The compensation for such uncertainties is done by dynamically adapting the values of timing parameters used by the scheduler. Formal results have been derived to put into relationship the values of quantities describing the physical process with real-time parameters used to model and to schedule the activation of loads. The performance of the method is evaluated by means of physically accurate simulations of thermal systems, showing a remarkable reduction of the peak load and a robust enforcement of the desired physical requirements. © 2017 ACM.",Adaptive scheduling; Bin-packing; CPES; Cyber-physical energy systems; Demand-side management; Direct-load control; Dynamical systems; Earliest-deadline frst; EDF; FFDH; First-ft decreasing height; Hybrid switching systems; Partitioned scheduling; Peak load shaving; Planning and scheduling; Power and energy; Power management; Real-time scheduling; Schedulability analysis; Smart Grid; Thermal systems,Adaptive control systems; Chemical activation; Cyber Physical System; Demand side management; Dynamical systems; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Power and Energy; Power management; Quality control; Quality of service; Real time systems; Response time (computer systems); Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Smart power grids; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive scheduling; Bin packing; CPES; Cyber physicals; Direct load control; Earliest-deadline frst; FFDH; First-ft decreasing height; Hybrid switching systems; Peak load; Planning and scheduling; Real - time scheduling; Schedulability analysis; Smart grid; Thermal systems; Electric power system control
Fundamental limits of cyber-physical systems modeling,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488542&doi=10.1145%2f2912149&partnerID=40&md5=ec84cc78ea0615c2cb3462d2df33f790,"This article examines the role of modeling in the engineering of cyber-physical systems. It argues that the role that models play in engineering is different from the role they play in science, and that this difference should direct us to use a different class of models, where simplicity and clarity of semantics dominate over accuracy and detail. I argue that determinism in models used for engineering is a valuable property and should be preserved whenever possible, regardless of whether the system being modeled is deterministic. I then identify three classes of fundamental limits on modeling, specifically chaotic behavior, the inability of computers to numerically handle a continuum, and the incompleteness of determinism. The last of these has profound consequences. © 2016 ACM.",Chaos; Completeness; Continuums,Chaos theory; Cyber Physical System; Semantics; Chaotic behaviors; Completeness; Continuums; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Different class; Embedded systems
Security of cyber-physical systems in the presence of transient sensor faults,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071483569&doi=10.1145%2f3064809&partnerID=40&md5=8f9c5597c71202ce518e512ab1e3aba0,"This article is concerned with the security of modern Cyber-Physical Systems in the presence of transient sensor faults.We consider a system with multiple sensors measuring the same physical variable, where each sensor provides an interval with all possible values of the true state.We note that some sensors might output faulty readings and others may be controlled by a malicious attacker. Differing from previous works, in this article, we aim to distinguish between faults and attacks and develop an attack detection algorithm for the latter only. To do this, we note that there are two kinds of faults-transient and permanent; the former are benign and short-lived, whereas the latter may have dangerous consequences on system performance. We argue that sensors have an underlying transient fault model that quantifies the amount of time in which transient faults can occur. In addition, we provide a framework for developing such a model if it is not provided by manufacturers. Attacks can manifest as either transient or permanent faults depending on the attacker's goal.We provide different techniques for handling each kind. For the former, we analyze the worst-case performance of sensor fusion over time given each sensor's transient fault model and develop a filtered fusion interval that is guaranteed to contain the true value and is bounded in size. To deal with attacks that do not comply with sensors' transient fault models, we propose a sound attack detection algorithm based on pairwise inconsistencies between sensor measurements. Finally, we provide a real-data case study on an unmanned ground vehicle to evaluate the various aspects of this article. © 2017 ACM.",,Automobile manufacture; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Fault tree analysis; Random access storage; Signal detection; Attack detection; Multiple sensors; Permanent faults; Physical variables; Sensor measurements; Transient faults; Unmanned ground vehicles; Worst-case performance; Fault detection
Collaborative load management with safety assurance in smart grids,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066601091&doi=10.1145%2f2823351&partnerID=40&md5=4e7e924e16dd5f86c4c7d9cb34528a2b,"Load shedding can combat the overload of a power grid that may jeopardize the grid's safety. However, disconnected customers may be excessively inconvenienced or even endangered. With the emergence of demand-response based on cyber-enabled smartmeters and appliances, customers may participate in solving the overload by curtailing their demands collaboratively such that no single customers will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage. However, compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is uncertain, which causes an important safety concern. This article proposes a two-phase load management scheme that (i) gives customers a chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid's overload when there are no immediate safety concerns but (ii) falls back to load shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state. Extensive simulations based on a 37-bus electrical grid and traces of real electrical load demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme. In particular, if customers are, as expected, sufficiently committed to the load curtailment, overloads can be resolved in real time by collaborative and graceful usage degradation among them, thereby avoiding unpleasant load shedding. © 2016 ACM.",Contingency analysis; Demand response; Safety assessment; Smart grid,Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Safety engineering; Sales; Smart power grids; Contingency analysis; Demand response; Electrical grids; Extensive simulations; Load curtailment; Safety assessments; Safety assurance; Smart grid; Electric load shedding
Optimal control of PEVs with a charging aggregator considering regulation service provisioning,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075489465&doi=10.1145%2f3086507&partnerID=40&md5=f475b89cf3a0e4d130b8b9e7c03371d5,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are considered the key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and an important part of the smart grid. The plug-in electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the smart grid infrastructure enables energy flow from PEV batteries to the power grid so that the grid stability is enhanced and the peak power demand is shaped. PEV owners will also beneft from V2G technology, as they will be able to reduce energy cost through proper PEV charging and discharging scheduling. Moreover, power regulation service (RS) reserves have been playing an increasingly important role in modern power markets. It has been shown that by providing RS reserves, the power grid achieves a better match between energy supply and demand in presence of volatile and intermittent renewable energy generation. This article starts with the problem of PEV charging under dynamic energy pricing, properly taking into account the degradation of battery stateof-health (SoH) during V2G operations as well as RS provisioning. An overall optimization throughout the whole parking period is proposed for the PEV and an adaptive control framework is presented to dynamically update the optimal charging/discharging decision at each hour to mitigate the effect of RS tracking error. As more and more PEVs are being plugged into the power grid, the control or management issue of PEV charging arises, since mass unregulated charging processes of PEVs may result in degradation of power quality and damage utility equipments and customer appliances. To solve this problem, this article also presents an SoH-aware charging aggregator design, which decides the control sequences of a group of PEVs. An energy storage system is used in the charging aggregator to do a peak power shaving, and future parking PEVs are properly taken care of. Experimental results show that the proposed optimal charging algorithm minimizes the combination of electricity cost and battery aging cost in the RS provisioning power market. Experimental results also show that the introduction of charging aggregator can signifcantly reduce the peak power consumption caused by simultaneous PEV charging. © 2017 ACM.",Charging aggregator; Dynamic energy pricing; Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV); Regulation service (RS) reserve; State-of-health (SoH) degradation,Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Costs; Electric automobiles; Electric energy storage; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power markets; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Dynamic energy pricing; Energy storage systems; Peak power shaving; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Plugin electric vehicle (PEVs); Regulation services; Renewable energy generation; State of health; Electric power system stability

We infer real-time passenger demand (e.g., exiting stations and times) for Feeder design by utilizing extreme-scale urban infrastructures, which consist of 10 million cellphones, 27 thousand vehicles, and 17 thousand smartcard readers for 16 million smartcards in a Chinese city, Shenzhen.

When developing such systems, however, it is often impossible to explicitly design for all potential situations up front and provide corresponding strategies. Situations that come out of this ""envelope of adaptability"" can lead to problems that end up by applying an emergency fail-safe strategy to avoid complete system failure. The existing approaches to self-adaptation cannot typically cope with such situations better-while they are adaptive (and can apply learning) in choosing a strategy, they still rely on a pre-defined set of strategies not flexible enough to deal with those situations adequately. To alleviate this problem, we propose the concept of meta-adaptation strategies, which extends the limits of adaptability of a system by constructing new strategies at runtime to reflect the changes in the environment. Though the approach is generally applicable to most approaches to self-adaptation, we demonstrate our approach on IRM-SA-a design method and associated runtimemodel for self-adaptive distributed systems based on component ensembles.We exemplify the meta-adaptation strategies concept by providing three concrete meta-adaptation strategies and show its feasibility on an emergency coordination case study. © 2017 ACM.",Adaptation strategies; Meta-adaptation strategies,Cyber Physical System; Systems engineering; Adaptation strategies; Complete system; Design for all; Design method; Distributed systems; Dynamic nature; Self adaptation; Self-Adaptive; Embedded systems

In this article, we present a case study of exploiting system reconfigurations to mitigate the cell imbalance in battery packs. Specifically, instead of using all the cells in a battery pack to support the load, selectively skipping cells to be discharged may actually enhance the pack's capacity delivery. Based on this observation, we propose CSR, a Cell Skipping-assisted Reconfiguration algorithm that identifies the system configuration with (near)-optimal capacity delivery.We evaluate CSR using large-scale emulation based on empirically collected discharge traces of 40 lithium-ion cells. CSR achieves close-to-optimal capacity delivery when the cell imbalance in the battery pack is low and improves the capacity delivery by about 20% and up to 1x in the case of a high imbalance. © 2016 ACM.",Cell imbalance; Cell skipping; Reconfigurable battery packs,Battery pack; Large battery packs; Lithium-ion cells; Optimal capacity; Reconfiguration algorithm; System configurations; System reconfiguration; Lithium-ion batteries
Minimizing transmission loss in smart microgrids by sharing renewable energy,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488982&doi=10.1145%2f2823355&partnerID=40&md5=7171a48466b002e110fb1d68044eba57,"Renewable energy (e.g., solar energy) is an attractive option to provide green energy to homes. Unfortunately, the intermittent nature of renewable energy results in a mismatch between when these sources generate energy and when homes demand it. This mismatch reduces the efficiency of using harvested energy by either (i) requiring batteries to store surplus energy, which typically incurs ~20% energy conversion losses, or (ii) using net metering to transmit surplus energy via the electric grid's AC lines, which severely limits the maximum percentage of renewable penetration possible. In this article, we propose an alternative structure where nearby homes explicitly share energy with each other to balance local energy harvesting and demand in microgrids. We develop a novel energy sharing approach to determine which homes should share energy, and when to minimize system-wide energy transmission losses in the microgrid. We evaluate our approach in simulation using real traces of solar energy harvesting and home consumption data from a deployment in Amherst, MA. We show that our system (i) reduces the energy loss on the AC line by 64% without requiring large batteries, (ii) performance scales up with larger battery capacities, and (iii) is robust to different energy consumption patterns and energy prediction accuracy in the microgrid. © 2016 ACM.",Battery; Energy sharing; Microgrid; Renewable energy,Electric batteries; Electric lines; Electric losses; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Solar energy; Wave transmission; Alternative structure; Battery; Energy prediction; Energy sharings; Energy transmission; Micro grid; Renewable energies; Transmission loss; Energy policy
A cloud-based black-box solar predictor for smart homes,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050453281&doi=10.1145%2f3004056&partnerID=40&md5=f08da916f72cff55695c1068953604c0,"The popularity of rooftop solar for homes is rapidly growing. However, accurately forecasting solar generation is critical to fully exploiting the benefts of locally generated solar energy. In this article, we present two machine-learning techniques to predict solar power from publicly available weather forecasts. We use these techniques to develop SolarCast, a cloud-based web service that automatically generates models that provide customized site-specifc predictions of solar generation. SolarCast utilizes a ""black box"" approach that requires only (1) a site's geographic location and (2) a minimal amount of historical generation data. Since we intend SolarCast for small rooftop deployments, it does not require detailed site- A nd panel-specifc information, which owners may not know, but instead automatically learns these parameters for each site. We evaluate the accuracy of SolarCast's di?erent algorithms on two publicly available datasets, each containing over 100 rooftop deployments with a variety of attributes (e.g., climate, tilt, orientation, etc.). We show that SolarCast learns a more accurate model using much less data (~1 month) than prior SVM-based approaches, which require ~3 months of data. SolarCast also provides a programmatic API, enabling developers to integrate its predictions into energy efciency applications. Finally, we present two case studies of using SolarCast to demonstrate how real-world applications can leverage its predictions. We frst evaluate a ""sunny"" load scheduler, which schedules a dryer's energy usage to maximally align with a home's solar generation. We then evaluate a smart solar-powered charging station, which can optimally charge the maximum number of electric vehicles (EVs) on a given day. Our results indicate that a representative home is capable of reducing its grid demand up to 40% by providing a modest amount of ?exibility (of ~5 hours) in the dryer's start time with opportunistic load scheduling. Further, our charging station uses SolarCast to provide EV owners the amount of energy they can expect to receive from solar energy sources. © 2017 ACM.",Machine learning; Renewable integration; Smart grid; Solar power prediction,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Dryers (equipment); Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; Scheduling; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Weather forecasting; Web services; Accurate modeling; Charging station; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Geographic location; Power predictions; Renewable integration; Smart grid; Solar generation; Smart power grids

Wired sensor networks are usually adopted for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. This is also an important Smart City application. Recent wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology promises the eventual ability to cover such a structure and continuously monitor its health. However, researchers from both engineering and computer science domains face numerous hurdles, such as application-specifc requirements, in reaching this goal. These hurdles have a cumulative e?ect on severely resource-constrained WSNs. This article provides a comprehensive investigation of WSNbased SHM applications with an emphasis on networking perspectives to get insights into a cyber-physical system (CPS) design. First, we provide the SHM philosophy and conduct extensive comparative studies regarding various aspects of benefts and hurdles of going wireless for SHM. Second, we propose a taxonomy of SHM techniques and their applicability to WSNs. Third, we show a transition from the WSN-based SHM towards the CPS design, expecting that such a design will mitigate WSN resource constraints and satisfy SHM application-specifc requirements to a great extent. For each of these, we discuss a surge of existing schemes with an emphasis on limitations of the state-of-the-art, and we point out open issues. Finally, we propose a series of design guidelines for a potential CPS. This article will help both engineering and computer science domain researchers/engineers and respective communities in designing future CPS to ensure the economic beneft and public safety in functioning civil structures. © 2017 ACM.",Cyber-physical systems; Network architecture; Resource constraints; Sensor networks; Structural event detection; Structural health monitoring,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Flow measurement; Network architecture; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Comparative studies; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Engineering and computer science; Resource Constraint; Smart city applications; Structural events; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Structural health monitoring
Event-based mobility modeling and analysis,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056880423&doi=10.1145%2f2823353&partnerID=40&md5=eff5dd15f6ef8b6c47b9f9e4e05ec012,"Mobility is a critical issue that must be considered during the modeling and analyzing of a mobile system. At a high abstract level, event-based models can directly specify a mobile system without the introduction of additional mechanisms. In this article, we first propose two types of special events, entering and exiting an ambient, as movement events. Next, based on the movement events, we introduce the notion of a movement path and propose a feasible movement criterion (deciding whether a given movement path of a mobile object (agent) is feasible or not in terms of spatiotemporal topological relationships of ambients). Then, we investigate how a message movement-based communication model represents synchronous communication, asynchronous communication, and broadcast communication in a unified way. Finally, we use movement event sequences to discuss the exclusivity of ambients (an ambient only allows one mobile object to occupy (enter) it at any moment) and show that a priority scheduling control policy can guarantee exclusivity. Accordingly, we propose a correct movement criterion-that is, a correct movement path is feasible and satisfies the exclusivity of ambients. Case studies demonstrate these results. © 2016 ACM.",Ambient; Event-based model; Mobility; Movement path,Carrier mobility; Ambient; Asynchronous communication; Broadcast communication; Communication modeling; Event-based model; Movement path; Synchronous communications; Topological relationships; Abstracting
Data analytics for managing power in commercial buildings,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075488147&doi=10.1145%2f3110219&partnerID=40&md5=8a6654bc2dfdf6f4d4852acda1605b7b,"Commercial buildings are signifcant consumers of electricity. We propose a number of methods for managing power in commercial buildings. The frst step toward better energy management in commercial buildings is monitoring consumption. However, instrumenting every electrical panel in a large commercial building is an expensive proposition. In this article, we demonstrate that it is also unnecessary. Specifcally, we propose a greedy meter (sensor) placement algorithm based on maximization of information gain subject to a cost constraint. The algorithm provides a near-optimal solution guarantee, and our empirical results demonstrate a 15% improvement in prediction power over conventional methods. Next, to identify power-saving opportunities, we use an unsupervised anomaly detection technique based on a low-dimensional embedding. Furthermore, to enable a building manager to effectively plan for demand response programs, we evaluate several solutions for fne-grained, short-term load forecasting. Our investigation reveals that support vector regression and an ensemble model work best overall. Finally, to better manage resources such as lighting and HVAC, we propose a semisupervised approach combining hidden Markov models (HMMs) and a standard classifer to model occupancy based on readily available port-level network statistics. We show that the proposed two-step approach simplifes the occupancy model while achieving good accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate an average occupancy estimation error of 9.3% with a potential reduction of 9.5% in lighting load using our occupancy models. © 2017 ACM.",Anomaly detection; Commercial buildings; Meter placement; Occupancy modeling; Power management; Short-term load forecast,Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Lighting; Power management; Anomaly detection; Commercial building; Hidden markov models (HMMs); Meter placement; Short term load forecast; Short term load forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Unsupervised anomaly detection; Office buildings

Enabling distributed energy storage by incentivizing small load shifts,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050240836&doi=10.1145%2f3015663&partnerID=40&md5=db55093e2dadd17cc34307b0dd8cc2c2,"Reducing peak demands and achieving a high penetration of renewable energy sources are important goals in achieving a smarter grid. To reduce peak demand, utilities are introducing variable rate electricity prices to incentivize consumers to manually shift their demand to low-price periods. Consumers may also use energy storage to automatically shift their demand by storing energy during low-price periods for use during high-price periods. Unfortunately, variable rate pricing provides only a weak incentive for distributed energy storage and does not promote its adoption at large scales. In this article, we present the storage adoption dilemma to capture the problems with incentivizing energy storage using variable rate prices. To address the problem, we propose a simple pricing scheme, called flat-power pricing, which incentivizes consumers to shift small amounts of load to flatten their demand rather than shift as much of their power usage as possible to low-price, off-peak periods. We show that compared to variable rate pricing, flat-power pricing (i) reduces consumers' upfront capital costs, as it requires significantly less storage capacity per consumer; (ii) increases energy storage's return on investment, as it mitigates free riding and maintains the incentive to use energy storage at large scales; and (iii) uses aggregate storage capacity within 31% of an optimal centralized approach. In addition, unlike variable rate pricing, we also show that flat-power pricing incentivizes the scheduling of elastic background loads, such as air conditioners and heaters, to reduce peak demand. We evaluate our approach using real smart meter data from 14,000 homes in a small town. © 2016 ACM.",Energy storage; Load scheduling; Load shifting; Smart grid,Air conditioning; Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Smart meters; Centralized approaches; Distributed energy storages; Load scheduling; Load shifting; Renewable energy source; Return on investments; Smart grid; Variable rate pricing; Smart power grids

To address this challenge, we motivate, design, and implement UrbanCPS, a cyber-physical system with heterogeneous model integration, based on extremely-large multi-source infrastructures in the Chinese city Shenzhen, involving 42,000 vehicles, 10 million residents, and 16 million smartcards. Based on temporal, spatial, and contextual contexts, we formulate an optimization problem about how to optimally integrate models based on highly diverse datasets under three practical issues, that is, heterogeneity of models, input data sparsity, or unknown ground truth. We further propose a real-world application called Speedometer, inferring real-time traffic speeds in urban areas. The evaluation results show that, compared to a state-ofthe- art system, Speedometer increases the inference accuracy by 29% on average. © 2016 ACM.",Cyber-physical system; Model integration,Accelerometers; Cyber Physical System; Integration; Smart cards; Evaluation results; Heterogeneous modeling; Large-scale modeling; Model integration; Optimization problems; Real time traffics; Spatial temporals; Urban infrastructure; Embedded systems

IoT is considered to be a networking infrastructure that can connect enormous physical objects and has great potential to extend mankind's capabilities in monitoring, analyzing, and controlling the physical space using cyber technologies. Extensive studies on IoT have been carried out and many IoT prototype systems have been built. However, most of these systems are usually suitable for domain-specific applications and operate in a local region. They are really ""Nets of Things (NoT)"" as they miss mechanisms for large-scale interconnection. As such, how to build a globally interconnected IoT is still an open problem. In this article, by reviewing the development of the Internet, we derive a pathway that may lead to successful development and deployment of a global IoT. We propose and examine a novel IoT architecture, namely, WInternet, which aims at interconnecting small-scale domain-specific NoTs into a globally connected IoT. © 2016 ACM.",Internet of things; Netlet computing; Pipe protocol; WInternet,Domain-specific application; Internet of Things (IOT); Iot architectures; Large-scale interconnections; Netlet computing; Networking infrastructure; Physical objects; WInternet; Internet of things
Adaptive real-time communication for wireless cyber-physical systems,2017,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030699285&doi=10.1145%2f3012005&partnerID=40&md5=8f2b2c81b8c9e9e8c782fb0134ab09d3,"Low-power wireless technology promises greater flexibility and lower costs in cyber-physical systems. To reap these benefits, communication protocols must deliver packets reliably within real-time deadlines across resource-constrained devices, while adapting to changes in application requirements (e.g., traffic demands) and network state (e.g., link qualities). Existing protocols do not solve all these challenges simultaneously, because their operation is either localized or a function of network state, which changes unpredictably over time. By contrast, this article claims a global approach that does not use network state information as input can overcome these limitations. The Blink protocol proves this claim by providing hard guarantees on endto- end deadlines of received packets in multi-hop low-power wireless networks, while seamlessly handling changes in application requirements and network state. We build Blink on the non-real-time Low-Power Wireless Bus (LWB) and design new scheduling algorithms based on the earliest-deadline-first policy. Using a dedicated priority queue data structure, we demonstrate a viable implementation of our algorithms on resource-constrained devices. Experiments show that Blink (i) meets all deadlines of received packets, (ii) delivers 99.97% of packets on a 94-node testbed, (iii) minimizes communication energy consumption within the limits of the underlying LWB, (iv) supports end-to-end deadlines of 100ms across four hops and nine sources, and (v) runs up to 4.1× faster than a conventional scheduler implementation on popular microcontrollers. © 2016 ACM.",Adaptivity; Earliest deadline first (EDF); Efficiency; End-to-end deadline; Glossy; Low-power platform; Low-power wireless bus (LWB); Priority queue data structure; Real-time communication; Real-world implementation; Reliability; Synchronous transmissions; Wireless multi-hop network,Cyber Physical System; Data structures; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Reliability; Response time (computer systems); Scheduling algorithms; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptivity; Earliest deadline first; End-to-end deadline; Glossy; Low Power; Low power wireless; Priority queues; Real-time communication; Real-world implementation; Synchronous transmission; Wireless multi-hop network; Real time systems

On one hand, the convenience of offering certain services via drones is attractive. On the other hand, the mere operation of these airborne machines, which rely heavily on their cyber capabilities, poses great threats to people and property. Also, while the Federal Aviation Administration NextGen project aims to integrate civilian drones into the national airspace, the regulation is still a work-in-progress and does not cope with their threats. This article surveys the main security, privacy, and safety aspects associated with the use of civilian drones in the national airspace. In particular, we identify both the physical and cyber threats of such systems and discuss the security properties required by their critical operation environment.We also identify the research challenges and possible future directions in the fields of civilian drone security, safety, and privacy.

Scalable Pythagorean Mean-based Incident Detection in Smart Transportation Systems,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198751506&doi=10.1145%2f3603381&partnerID=40&md5=f01515212e5503ed2f947ab43e7034b7,"Modern smart cities need smart transportation solutions to quickly detect various traffic emergencies and incidents in the city to avoid cascading traffic disruptions. To materialize this, roadside units and ambient transportation sensors are being deployed to collect speed data that enables the monitoring of traffic conditions on each road segment. In this article, we first propose a scalable data-driven anomaly-based traffic incident detection framework for a city-scale smart transportation system. Specifically, we propose an incremental region growing approximation algorithm for optimal Spatio-temporal clustering of road segments and their data; such that road segments are strategically divided into highly correlated clusters. The highly correlated clusters enable identifying a Pythagorean Mean-based invariant as an anomaly detection metric that is highly stable under no incidents but shows a deviation in the presence of incidents. We learn the bounds of the invariants in a robust manner such that anomaly detection can generalize to unseen events, even when learning from real noisy data. Second, using cluster-level detection, we propose a folded Gaussian classifier to pinpoint the particular segment in a cluster where the incident happened in an automated manner. We perform extensive experimental validation using mobility data collected from four cities in Tennessee and compare with the state-of-the-art ML methods to prove that our method can detect incidents within each cluster in real-time and outperforms known ML methods.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"CASTNet: A Context-Aware, Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Motion Prediction Ensemble for Autonomous Driving",2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198714118&doi=10.1145%2f3648622&partnerID=40&md5=469c2492d7c75ca930bb64bc632aa9a4,"Autonomous vehicles are cyber-physical systems that combine embedded computing and deep learning with physical systems to perceive the world, predict future states, and safely control the vehicle through changing environments. The ability of an autonomous vehicle to accurately predict the motion of other road users across a wide range of diverse scenarios is critical for both motion planning and safety. However, existing motion prediction methods do not explicitly model contextual information about the environment, which can cause significant variations in performance across diverse driving scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose CASTNet: a dynamic, context-aware approach for motion prediction that (i) identifies the current driving context using a spatio-temporal model, (ii) adapts an ensemble of motion prediction models to fit the current context, and (iii) applies novel trajectory fusion methods to combine predictions output by the ensemble. This approach enables CASTNet to improve robustness by minimizing motion prediction error across diverse driving scenarios. CASTNet is highly modular and can be used with various existing image processing backbones and motion predictors. We demonstrate how CASTNet can improve both CNN-based and graph-learning-based motion prediction approaches and conduct ablation studies on the performance, latency, and model size for various ensemble architecture choices. In addition, we propose and evaluate several attention-based spatio-temporal models for context identification and ensemble selection. We also propose a modular trajectory fusion algorithm that effectively filters, clusters, and fuses the predicted trajectories output by the ensemble. On the nuScenes dataset, our approach demonstrates more robust and consistent performance across diverse, real-world driving contexts than state-of-the-art techniques.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Towards Safe Autonomy in Hybrid Traffic: Detecting Unpredictable Abnormal Behaviors of Human Drivers via Information Sharing,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186286643&doi=10.1145%2f3616398&partnerID=40&md5=052afd60b1480051501c7df7abf328ab,"Hybrid traffic which involves both autonomous and human-driven vehicles would be the norm of the autonomous vehicles' practice for a while. On the one hand, unlike autonomous vehicles, human-driven vehicles could exhibit sudden abnormal behaviors such as unpredictably switching to dangerous driving modes - putting its neighboring vehicles under risks; such undesired mode switching could arise from numbers of human driver factors, including fatigue, drunkenness, distraction, aggressiveness, and so on. On the other hand, modern vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies enable the autonomous vehicles to efficiently and reliably share the scarce run-time information with each other [1]. In this article, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first efficient algorithm that can (1) significantly improve trajectory prediction by effectively fusing the run-time information shared by surrounding autonomous vehicles, and can (2) accurately and quickly detect abnormal human driving mode switches or abnormal driving behavior with formal assurance without hurting human drivers' privacy.To validate our proposed algorithm, we first evaluate our proposed trajectory predictor on NGSIM and Argoverse datasets and show that our proposed predictor outperforms the baseline methods. Then through extensive experiments on SUMO simulator, we show that our proposed algorithm has great detection performance in both highway and urban traffic. The best performance achieves detection rate of 97.3%, average detection delay of 1.2 s, and 0 false alarm.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To enforce their widespread use, both the technical development and the security of users shall be guaranteed. Users' privacy represents a possible threat that impairs the adoption of EVs. In particular, recent works showed the feasibility of identifying EVs based on the current exchanged during the charging phase. In fact, while the resource negotiation phase runs over secure communication protocols, the signal exchanged during the actual charging contains features peculiar to each EV. In what is commonly known as profiling, a suitable feature extractor can associate such features to each EV.In this article, we propose EVScout2.0, an extended and improved version of our previously proposed framework to profile EVs based on their charging behavior. By exploiting the current and pilot signals exchanged during the charging phase, our scheme can extract features peculiar for each EV, hence allowing their profiling. We implemented and tested EVScout2.0 over a set of real-world measurements considering over 7,500 charging sessions from a total of 137 EVs. In particular, numerical results show the superiority of EVScout2.0 with respect to the previous version. EVScout2.0 can profile EVs, attaining a maximum of 0.88 for both recall and precision scores in the case of a balanced dataset. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these results set a new benchmark for upcoming privacy research for large datasets of EVs.  © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.",charging; Cyber-Physical Systems; Electric Vehicle; profiling,Charging (batteries); Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Large datasets; 'current; Charging; Charging profiles; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Profiling; Resource negotiation; Technical development; Traditional fuels; User privacy; Electric vehicles
Memory-based Distribution Shift Detection for Learning Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems with Statistical Guarantees,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198716891&doi=10.1145%2f3643892&partnerID=40&md5=06a709597b448ee96a711ce0ddcadcee,"Incorporating learning based components in the current state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) has been a challenge due to the brittleness of the underlying deep neural networks. On the bright side, if executed correctly with safety guarantees, this has the ability to revolutionize domains like autonomous systems, medicine, and other safety-critical domains. This is because it would allow system designers to use high-dimensional outputs from sensors like camera and LiDAR. The trepidation in deploying systems with vision and LiDAR components comes from incidents of catastrophic failures in the real world. Recent reports of self-driving cars running into difficult to handle scenarios is ingrained in the software components which handle such sensor inputs.The ability to handle such high-dimensional signals is due to the explosion of algorithms which use deep neural networks. Sadly, the reason behind the safety issues is also due to deep neural networks themselves. The pitfalls occur due to possible over-fitting and lack of awareness about the blind spots induced by the training distribution. Ideally, system designers would wish to cover as many scenarios during training as possible. However, achieving a meaningful coverage is impossible. This naturally leads to the following question: is it feasible to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without causing too many false alarms? Such an OOD detector should be executable in a fashion that is computationally efficient. This is because OOD detectors often are executed as frequently as the sensors are sampled.Our aim in this article is to build an effective anomaly detector. To this end, we propose the idea of a memory bank to cache data samples which are representative enough to cover most of the in-distribution data. The similarity with respect to such samples can be a measure of familiarity of the test input. This is made possible by an appropriate choice of distance function tailored to the type of sensor we are interested in. Additionally, we adapt conformal anomaly detection framework to capture the distribution shifts with a guarantee of false alarm rate. We report the performance of our technique on two challenging scenarios: a self-driving car setting implemented inside the simulator CARLA with image inputs and autonomous racing car navigation setting with LiDAR inputs. From the experiments, it is clear that a deviation from the in-distribution setting can potentially lead to unsafe behavior. It should be noted that not all OOD inputs lead to precarious situations in practice, but staying in-distribution is akin to staying within a safety bubble and predictable behavior. An added benefit of our memory-based approach is that the OOD detector produces interpretable feedback for a human designer. This is of utmost importance since it recommends a potential fix for the situation as well. In other competing approaches, such feedback is difficult to obtain due to reliance on techniques which use variational autoencoders.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Given a system specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), we would like to verify that for all (infinite) values of the model parameters/input signals, the system satisfies its specification. Unfortunately, this problem is undecidable in general. Statistical model checking (SMC) offers a solution by providing guarantees on the correctness of CPS models by statistically reasoning on model simulations. We propose a new approach for statistical verification of CPS models for user-provided distribution on the model parameters. Our technique uses model simulations to learn surrogate models, and uses conformal inference to provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of a given STL property. Additionally, we can provide prediction intervals containing the quantitative satisfaction values of the given STL property for any user-specified confidence level. We compare this prediction interval with the interval we get using risk estimation procedures. We also propose a refinement procedure based on Gaussian Process (GP)-based surrogate models for obtaining fine-grained probabilistic guarantees over sub-regions in the parameter space. This in turn enables the CPS designer to choose assured validity domains in the parameter space for safety-critical applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on several CPS models.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conformal inference; risk measures,Embedded systems; Model checking; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Temporal logic; Conformal inference; Modeling parameters; Modeling simulation; Parameter spaces; Prediction interval; Probabilistic guarantees; Risk measures; Statistical verification; Surrogate modeling; Temporal logic properties; Specifications

However, DNNs may make incorrect decisions when presented with inputs outside the distribution of their training data. These inputs can compromise the safety of CPSs. So, it becomes crucial to detect inputs as out-of-distribution (OOD) and interpret the reasons for their classification as OOD. In this study, we propose an interpretable learning method to detect OOD caused by meteorological features like darkness, lightness, and rain.To achieve this, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to map high-dimensional image data to a lower-dimensional latent space. We then focus on a specific latent dimension and encourage it to classify different intensities of a particular meteorological feature in a monotonically increasing manner. This is accomplished by incorporating two additional terms into the VAE's loss function: a classification loss and a positional loss. During training, we optimize the utilization of label information for classification. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that using only 25% of the training data labels is sufficient to train a single pre-selected latent dimension to classify different intensities of a specific meteorological feature. We evaluate the proposed method on two distinct datasets, CARLA and Duckietown, employing two different rain-generation methods. We show that our approach outperforms existing approaches by at least 15 in the F1 score and precision when trained and tested on CARLA dataset.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The resource requirements of the tasks are usually variable at runtime due to the uncertainties in the environment, necessitating some kinds of adaptation to deal with the resource limitations. Such adaptations may positively or negatively affect the control performance of several subsystems. Since there might be some thresholds on the control performances as quality constraints, this matter should be considered carefully to avoid any quality attribute constraint violation. This article proposes a scalable control performance constraint verification method for such a system that works based on a feedback scheduler. The scalability is the result of a control-aware pruning method. In case of a constraint violation, the designer may change the system configuration and perform re-verification. Our evaluations show that the proposed method scales well while preserving the verification soundness.  © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automotive systems; control performance; cyber-physical systems; efficient analysis; feedback scheduler; formal verification; hybrid systems,Embedded systems; Feedback control; Formal verification; Hybrid systems; Quality control; Automotive Systems; Automotives; Constraint violation; Control performance; Control performance analysis; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Efficient analysis; Feedback schedulers; Resource limitations; Cyber Physical System
CANOA: CAN Origin Authentication through Power Side-channel Monitoring,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198959403&doi=10.1145%2f3571288&partnerID=40&md5=eec05450d12139d01ad204078ab10441,"The lack of any sender authentication mechanism in place makes Controller Area Network (CAN) vulnerable to security threats. For instance, an attacker can impersonate an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) on the bus and send spoofed messages unobtrusively with the identifier of the impersonated ECU. To address this problem, we propose a novel source authentication technique that uses power consumption measurements of the ECU to authenticate the source of a message. A transmission of an ECU affects the power consumption and a characteristic pattern will appear. Our technique exploits the power consumption of each ECU during the transmission of a message to determine whether the message actually originated from the purported sender. We evaluate our approach in both a lab setup and a real vehicle. We also evaluate our approach against factors that can impact the power consumption measurement of the ECUs. The results of the evaluation show that the proposed technique is applicable in a broad range of operating conditions with reasonable computational power requirements and attaining good accuracy. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.",authentication; Automotive security; CAN; transmissions,Authentication; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Side channel attack; Authentication mechanisms; Automotive security; Automotives; Consumption measurement; Controller-area network; Electronics control unit; Measurements of; Origin authentications; Side-channel; Through power; Electric power utilization
A Deep Time Delay Filter for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198713477&doi=10.1145%2f3631613&partnerID=40&md5=5de8701438997359a594b72c71777836,"Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is a smart transportation solution to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance road safety. The performance of CACC systems can be remarkably affected by communication time delays, and traditional control methods often compromise control performance by adjusting control gains to maintain system stability. In this article, we present a study on the stability of a CACC system in the presence of time delays and highlight the tradeoff between control performance and tuning controller gains to address increasing delays. We propose a novel approach incorporating a neural network module called the deep time delay filter (DTDF) to overcome this limitation. The DTDF leverages the assumption that time delays primarily originate from the communication layer of the CACC network, which can be subject to adversarial delays of varying magnitudes. By considering time-delayed versions of the car states and predicting the present (un-delayed) states, the DTDF compensates for the effects of communication delays. The proposed approach combines classical control techniques with machine learning, offering a hybrid control system that excels in explainability and robustness to unknown parameters.We conduct comprehensive experiments using various deep learning architectures to train and evaluate the DTDF models. Our experiments utilize a robot platform consisting of MATLAB, Simulink, the Optitrack motion capture system, and the Qbot2e robots. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that when appropriately trained, our system can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of constant time delays and outperforms a traditional CACC baseline in control performance. This experimental comparison, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first of its kind in the context of a hybrid machine learning CACC system. We thoroughly explore initial conditions and range policy parameters to evaluate our system under various experimental scenarios. By providing detailed insights and experimental results, we aim to contribute to the advancement of CACC research and highlight the potential of hybrid machine learning approaches in improving the performance and reliability of CACC systems.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Remote Perception Attacks against Camera-based Object Recognition Systems and Countermeasures,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198738246&doi=10.1145%2f3596221&partnerID=40&md5=b63e2c67308b4278c15a6a94e96fa131,"In vision-based object recognition systems, imaging sensors perceive the environment and then objects are detected and classified for decision-making purposes, e.g., to maneuver an automated vehicle around an obstacle or to raise alarms for intruders in surveillance settings. In this work we demonstrate how camera-based perception can be unobtrusively manipulated to enable an attacker to create spurious objects or alter an existing object, by remotely projecting adversarial patterns into cameras, exploiting two common effects in optical imaging systems, viz., lens flare/ghost effects and auto-exposure control. To improve the robustness of the attack, we generate optimal patterns by integrating adversarial machine learning techniques with a trained end-to-end channel model. We experimentally demonstrate our attacks using a low-cost projector on three different cameras, and under different environments. Results show that, depending on the attack distance, attack success rates can reach as high as 100%, including under targeted conditions. We develop a countermeasure that reduces the problem of detecting ghost-based attacks into verifying whether there is a ghost overlapping with a detected object. We leverage spatiotemporal consistency to eliminate false positives. Evaluation on experimental data provides a worst-case equal error rate of 5%.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Green Data Center Cooling Control via Physics-guided Safe Reinforcement Learning,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198748158&doi=10.1145%2f3582577&partnerID=40&md5=a4c85b78e7e4783ecaba971e1b1ca02a,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown good performance in tackling Markov decision process (MDP) problems. As DRL optimizes a long-term reward, it is a promising approach to improving the energy efficiency of data-center cooling. However, enforcement of thermal safety constraints during DRL's state exploration is a main challenge. The widely adopted reward-shaping approach adds negative reward when the exploratory action results in unsafety. Thus, it needs to experience sufficient unsafe states before it learns how to prevent unsafety. In this article, we propose a safety-aware DRL framework for data-center cooling control. It applies offline imitation learning and online post-hoc rectification to holistically prevent thermal unsafety during online DRL. In particular, the post-hoc rectification searches for the minimum modification to the DRL-recommended action such that the rectified action will not result in unsafety. The rectification is designed based on a thermal state transition model that is fitted using historical safe operation traces and able to extrapolate the transitions to unsafe states explored by DRL. Extensive evaluation for chilled water and direct expansion-cooled data centers in two climate conditions show that our approach saves 18% to 26.6% of total data-center power compared with conventional control and reduces safety violations by 94.5% to 99% compared with reward shaping. We also extend the proposed framework to address data centers with non-uniform temperature distributions for detailed safety considerations. The evaluation shows that our approach saves 14% power usage compared with the PID control while addressing safety compliance during the training.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",computational fluid dynamics; Data center; energy efficiency; proper orthogonal decomposition; safe reinforcement learning,Compliance control; Computational fluid dynamics; Deep learning; Green computing; Markov processes; Principal component analysis; Reinforcement learning; Three term control systems; Cooling control; Data center cooling; Datacenter; Green data centers; Orthogonal decomposition; Performance; Proper Orthogonal; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Reinforcement learnings; Safe reinforcement learning; Energy efficiency

ICS and SCADA systems run some of the most important networks in the country: our critical infrastructure (i.e., water flow, power grids, etc.). Disruption of these systems causes confusion, panic, and in some cases loss of life. We propose a SCADA architecture that uses blockchain to help protect ICS data from ransomware. We focus on the historian. In a SCADA system, the historian collects events from devices in the control network for real-time and future analysis. We choose to use Ethereum and its Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus protocol. The other goal of this research focuses on the resilience of blockchain. There is very little research in protecting the blockchain itself. By performing encryption testing on an Ethereum private network, we explore how vulnerable blockchain is and discuss potential ways to make a blockchain client more resilient. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",blockchain; ethereum; industrial control systems; ransomware; SCADA,Cryptography; Ethereum; Flow of water; Industrial research; Malware; Network architecture; Block-chain; Control network; Data acquisition architecture; Industrial control systems; Loss of life; Power grids; Real- time; Supervisory control and data acquisition; System control; Water flows; Blockchain
Techniques for Enhancing Security in Industrial Control Systems,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184765007&doi=10.1145%2f3630103&partnerID=40&md5=11178ce263cae848446420e95ef412c8,"Increasingly Industrial Control Systems (ICS) systems are being connected to the Internet to minimise the operational costs and provide additional flexibility. These control systems such as the ones used in power grids, manufacturing and utilities operate continually and have long lifespans measured in decades rather than years as in the case of Information Technology (IT) systems. Such industrial control systems require uninterrupted and safe operation. However, they can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, as successful attacks on critical control infrastructures could have devastating consequences to the safety of human lives as well as a nation’s security and prosperity. Furthermore, there can be a range of attacks that can target ICS and it is not easy to secure these systems against all known attacks let alone unknown ones. In this paper, we propose a software enabled security architecture using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) that can enhance the capability to secure industrial control systems. We have designed such an SDN/NFV enabled security architecture and developed a Control System Security Application (CSSA) in SDN Controller for enhancing security in ICS by achieving real time situational awareness and dynamic policy-driven decision making across the network infrastructure. In particular, CSSA can be used for establishing secure path for end-to-end communication between devices and also deal against certain specific attacks namely denial of service attacks, from unpatched vulnerable control system components and securing the communication flows from the legacy devices that do not support any security functionality. We also discuss how CSSA provides reliable paths for safety critical messages in control systems. We discuss the prototype implementation of the proposed architecture and the results obtained from our analysis. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In the companion paper, we proposed an abstract reference architecture capable of expressing all classes of system-level interactions in human cyber-physical systems. Here we demonstrate how this reference architecture supports the analysis of levels of communication between agents and helps to identify the potential for misunderstandings and misconceptions. We then develop a metamodel for safe human machine interaction. Therefore, we ask what type of information exchange must be supported on what level so that humans and systems can cooperate as a team, what is the criticality of exchanged information, what are timing requirements for such interactions, and how can we communicate highly critical information in a limited time frame in spite of the many sources of a distorted perception. We highlight shared stumbling blocks and illustrate shared design principles, which rest on established ontologies specific to particular application classes. In order to overcome the partial opacity of internal states of agents, we anticipate a key role of virtual twins of both human and technical cooperation partners for designing a suitable communication. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",architecture; Cyber-Physical Systems; Human-CPS Interaction; interaction design; Real-time systems,Architecture; Embedded systems; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Virtual reality; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Design Principles; Fundamental design; Human operator; Human-CPS interaction; Interaction design; Real - Time system; Reference architecture; System-level interactions; Cyber Physical System

To reach this quality gate, the expressivity of the model must go beyond classical viewpoints such as operational, functional, and architectural views and views used for safety and security analysis. The model does so by incorporating elements of such systems for mutual introspections in situational awareness, capabilities, and intentions to enable a synergetic, trusted relation in the interaction of humans and CPSs, which we see as a prerequisite for their societal acceptance. The reference architecture is represented as a metamodel incorporating conceptual and behavioral semantic aspects.

We present such a semantic foundation. This framework extends beyond previous approaches by extending the agent-local dynamic state beyond state components under direct control of the agent and belief about other agents (as previously suggested for understanding cooperative as well as rational behavior) to agent-local evidence and belief about the overall cooperative, competitive, or coopetitive game structure. We argue that this extension is necessary for rigorously analyzing systems of human cyber-physical systems because humans are known to employ cognitive replacement models of system dynamics that are both non-stationary and potentially incongruent. These replacement models induce visible and potentially harmful effects on their joint emergent behavior and the interaction with cyber-physical system components. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

A Combinatorial Optimization Analysis Method for Detecting Malicious Industrial Internet Attack Behaviors,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184748890&doi=10.1145%2f3637554&partnerID=40&md5=fd875a7b61759b36b97c61aa6b87e596,"Industrial Internet plays an important role in key critical infrastructure sectors and is the target of different security threats and risks. There are limitations in many existing attack detection approaches, such as function redundancy, overfitting, and low efficiency. A combinatorial optimization method—Lagrange multiplier—is designed to optimize the underlying feature screening algorithm. The optimized feature combination is fused with random forest and XG-Boost selected features to improve the accuracy and efficiency of attack feature analysis. Using both the UNSW-NB15 and natural gas pipeline datasets, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is observed that the influence degrees of the different features associated with the attack behavior can result in the binary classification attack detection increasing to 0.93 and the attack detection time reducing by 6.96 times. The overall accuracy of multi-classification attack detection is also observed to improve by 0.11. We also observe that nine key features of attack behavior analysis are essential to the analysis and detection of general attacks targeting the system, and by focusing on these features one could potentially improve the effectiveness and efficiency of real-time critical industrial system security. In this article, the CICDDoS2019 and CICIDS2018 datasets are used to prove the generalization. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good generalization and can be extended to the same type of industrial anomaly datasets. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",attack behavior; combinatorial optimization; feature analysis; Industrial Internet; industrial situational security,Binary trees; Efficiency; Feature Selection; Lagrange multipliers; Natural gas pipelines; Analysis method; Attack behavior; Attack detection; Feature analysis; Generalisation; Industrial internet; Industrial situational security; Infrastructure sector; Internet attacks; Optimization analysis; Combinatorial optimization

The fault diagnosis module uses model-based diagnosis algorithms to detect and isolate faults and generates interventions in the system to disambiguate uncertain diagnosis solutions. We scale up the fault diagnosis algorithm to the required real-time performance through the use of parallelization and surrogate models of the physics-based digital twin. The prognostics module tracks fault progression and trains the online degradation models to compute remaining useful life of system components. In addition, we use the degradation models to assess the impact of the fault progression on the operational requirements. The reconfiguration module uses PDDL-based planning endowed with semantic attachments to adjust the system controls to minimize the fault impact on the system operation.

Recently, many methods have implemented electricity theft detection on smart meter data. However, how to conduct detection on the dataset without any label still remains challenging. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised two-stage approach under the assumption that the training set is contaminated by attacks. Specifically, the method consists of two stages: (1) a Gaussian mixture model is employed to cluster consumption patterns with respect to different habits of electricity usage, and with the goal of improving the accuracy of the model in the posterior stage; (2) an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory encoder-decoder scheme is employed to improve the robustness against the non-malicious changes in usage patterns leveraging the process of encoding and decoding. Quantifying the similarity of consumption patterns and reconstruction errors, the anomaly score is defined to improve detection performance. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised detectors. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

RollBack: A New Time-Agnostic Replay Attack Against the Automotive Remote Keyless Entry Systems,2024,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183044952&doi=10.1145%2f3627827&partnerID=40&md5=1113eabdbe4662d2caed90cf25bef2c1,"Automotive Keyless Entry (RKE) systems provide car owners with a degree of convenience, allowing them to lock and unlock their car without using a mechanical key. Today’s RKE systems implement disposable rolling codes, making every key fob button press unique, effectively preventing simple replay attacks. However, a prior attack called RollJam was proven to break all rolling code–based systems in general. By a careful sequence of signal jamming, capturing, and replaying, an attacker can become aware of the subsequent valid unlock signal that has not been used yet. RollJam, however, requires continuous deployment indefinitely until it is exploited. Otherwise, the captured signals become invalid if the key fob is used again without RollJam in place. We introduce RollBack, a new replay-and-resynchronize attack against most of today’s RKE systems. In particular, we show that even though the one-time code becomes invalid in rolling code systems, replaying a few previously captured signals consecutively can trigger a rollback-like mechanism in the RKE system. Put differently, the rolling codes become resynchronized back to a previous code used in the past from where all subsequent yet already used signals work again. Moreover, the victim can still use the key fob without noticing any difference before and after the attack. Unlike RollJam, RollBack does not necessitate jamming at all. In fact, it requires signal capturing only once and can be exploited at any time in the future as many times as desired. This time-agnostic property is particularly attractive to attackers, especially in car-sharing/renting scenarios in which accessing the key fob is straightforward. However, while RollJam defeats virtually any rolling code–based system, vehicles might have additional anti-theft measures against malfunctioning key fobs, hence against RollBack. Our ongoing analysis (with crowd-sourced data) against different vehicle makes and models has revealed that ∼ 50% of the examined vehicles in the Asian region are vulnerable to RollBack, whereas the impact tends to be smaller in other regions, such as Europe and North America. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We first derive a state machine-based abstraction of the scheduler's modes of operation along with the control flow abstractions of the scheduler's most important functions. We then use a set of transformation rules to formally specify the scheduler and all its internal functions in Promela. Additional contributions with respect to the conference version of this article include (1) modeling nested function calls in the Promela model of the scheduler using a novel technique amenable to model checking in SPIN; (2) modeling protothreads in Promela; (3) specifying and formally verifying 12 critical requirements of the scheduler; (4) detecting new design flaws in Contiki's scheduler for the first time (to the best of our knowledge); (5) repairing the model and the source code of Contiki's scheduler towards fixing the flaws detected through verification, as well as regression verification of the entire model of the scheduler; and (6) experimentally analyzing the time and space costs of verification before and after repair.

Often, safety-critical systems rely on custom hardware-software components that are built from scratch to achieve specific functional and non-functional requirements. Instead, the (partial) usage of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components is very attractive as it potentially allows reducing cost and time to market. Unfortunately, COTS components do not individually offer enough guarantees in terms of safety and security to be used in critical systems as they are. In such a context, RFI (Rete Ferroviaria Italiana), a major player in Europe for railway infrastructure management, aims at equipping track-side workers with COTS devices to remotely and safely interact with the existing interlocking system, drastically improving the performance of maintenance operations. This paper describes the first effort to update existing (embedded) railway systems to a more recent cyber-physical system paradigm. Our Remote Worker Dashboard (RWD) pairs the existing safe interlocking machinery alongside COTS mobile components, making cyber and physical components cooperate to provide the user with responsive, safe, and secure service. Specifically, the RWD is a SIL4 cyber-physical system to support maintenance of actuators and railways in which COTS mobile devices are safely used by track-side workers. The concept, development, implementation, verification, and validation activities to build the RWD were carried out in compliance with the applicable CENELEC standards required by certification bodies to declare compliance with specific guidelines. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",CENELEC; COTS; CPS; mobile devices; railway; Safety; security; SIL4; track-side maintenance,Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Human resource management; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Regulatory compliance; Safety engineering; CENELEC; Commercial off the shelves; Commercial off-the shelves; Commercial-off-the-shelf; CPS; Railway; Remote workers; Security; SIL4; Track-side maintenance; Maintenance

This work looks into the communication and control problems of vehicle platooning, and proposes a control and communication co-design for CACC. First, an integrated radar system is presented. This system integrates sensing of relative position, speed, and communication between a predecessor and its follower. Second, a working scheme for the integrated radar system is presented. This scheme allows the radar systems to switch periodically between different working modes without interferences from other modes. Therefore, the relative position, speed, and communication can be asynchronously periodically updated to the controller. Third, a periodic event-triggered control approach is presented. This approach allows asynchronous periodic sampling of the output, and is deeply co-designed with the radar system and its working scheme. Delays are also considered in the control approach. The co-design CACC approach can guarantee the vehicle platoons to be string stable. A numerical example has shown the feasibility of the approach. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

While firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and similar appliances introduce essential checks, their efficacy depends on the attackers' ability to bypass such middleboxes. We propose a provenance solution to enable the verification of an end-to-end message delivery path and the actions performed on a message. Fast and flexible provenance verification (F2-Pro) provides cryptographically verifiable evidence that a message has originated from a legitimate source and gone through the necessary checks before reaching its destination. F2-Prorelies on lightweight cryptographic primitives and flexibly supports various communication settings and protocols encountered in ICS thanks to its transparent, bump-in-the-wire design. We provide formal definitions and cryptographically prove F2-Pro's security. For human interaction with ICS via a field service device, F2-Profeatures a multi-factor authentication mechanism that starts the provenance chain from a human user issuing commands. We compatibility tested F2-Proon a smart power grid testbed and reported a sub-millisecond latency overhead per communication hop using a modest ARM Cortex-A15 processor.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Bump-in-the-wire; cyberphysical system; digital signature; hash chain; Message authentication; multi-factor authentication; provenance; signature aggregation; verifiable,Authentication; Computer system firewalls; Control systems; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Electronic document identification systems; Embedded systems; Bump in the wires; Cyber-physical systems; Hash chains; Industrial control systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Message authentication; Multi-factor authentication; Provenance; Signature aggregation; Verifiable; Intrusion detection

Certain safety rules must be guaranteed. However, this demand is complicated by the inherently unreliable wireless communications. In this article, we focus on the well adopted constant-time-headway (CTH) safety rule. We propose a highway and metered-ramp CAV collaborative merging protocol, and formally prove its guarantee of the CTH safety and liveness under arbitrary wireless data packet losses. These theoretical claims are further validated by our simulations. Furthermore, the simulation results also show significant improvements in the merging efficiency over other solution alternatives.

Investigating the Security of EV Charging Mobile Applications as an Attack Surface,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176771108&doi=10.1145%2f3609508&partnerID=40&md5=533cc16bc5013b4254eaffd9747dc5fb,"The adoption rate of EVs has witnessed a significant increase in recent years driven by multiple factors, chief among which is the increased flexibility and ease of access to charging infrastructure. To improve user experience and increase system flexibility, mobile applications have been incorporated into the EV charging ecosystem. EV charging mobile applications allow consumers to remotely trigger actions on charging stations and use functionalities such as start/stop charging sessions, pay for usage, and locate charging stations, to name a few. In this article, we study the security posture of the EV charging ecosystem against a new type of remote that exploits vulnerabilities in the EV charging mobile applications as an attack surface. We leverage a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to analyze the security of widely used EV charging mobile applications. Our analysis was performed on 31 of the most widely used mobile applications including their interactions with various components such as cloud management systems. The attack scenarios that exploit these vulnerabilities were verified on a real-time co-simulation test bed. Our discoveries indicate the lack of user/vehicle verification and improper authorization for critical functions, which allow adversaries to remotely hijack charging sessions and launch attacks against the connected critical infrastructure. The attacks were demonstrated using the EVCS mobile applications showing the feasibility and the applicability of our attacks. Indeed, we discuss specific remote attack scenarios and their impact on EV users. More importantly, our analysis results demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging existing vulnerabilities across various EV charging mobile applications to perform wide-scale coordinated remote charging/discharging attacks against the connected critical infrastructure (e.g., power grid), with significant economical and operational implications. Finally, we propose countermeasures to secure the infrastructure and impede adversaries from performing reconnaissance and launching remote attacks using compromised accounts.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

HPRoP: Hierarchical Privacy-preserving Route Planning for Smart Cities,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176765401&doi=10.1145%2f3616874&partnerID=40&md5=28305fbe0a7644f6037f1cce73a75e08,"Route Planning Systems (RPS) are a core component of autonomous personal transport systems essential for safe and efficient navigation of dynamic urban environments with the support of edge-based smart city infrastructure, but they also raise concerns about user route privacy in the context of both privately owned and commercial vehicles. Numerous high-profile data breaches in recent years have fortunately motivated research on privacy-preserving RPS, but most of them are rendered impractical by greatly increased communication and processing overhead. We address this by proposing an approach called Hierarchical Privacy-Preserving Route Planning (HPRoP), which divides and distributes the route-planning task across multiple levels and protects locations along the entire route. This is done by combining Inertial Flow partitioning, Private Information Retrieval (PIR), and Edge Computing techniques with our novel route-planning heuristic algorithm. Normalized metrics were also formulated to quantify the privacy of the source/destination points (endpoint location privacy) and the route itself (route privacy). Evaluation on a simulated road network showed that HPRoP reliably produces routes differing only by ≤ 20% in length from optimal shortest paths, with completion times within ∼25 seconds, which is reasonable for a PIR-based approach. On top of this, more than half of the produced routes achieved near-optimal endpoint location privacy (∼1.0) and good route privacy (≥ 0.8). © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Event-Triggered Control with Intermittent Communications over Erasure Channels for Leader-Follower Problems with the Combined-Slip Effect,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176737804&doi=10.1145%2f3625562&partnerID=40&md5=2d5bda57a08f6a62b999566acb93dbad,"In this article, we investigate the vehicle path-following problem for a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)-enabled leader-follower scenario and propose an integrated control policy for the following vehicle to accurately follow the leader's path. We propose a control strategy for the follower vehicle to maintain a velocity-dependent distance relative to the leader vehicle while stabilizing its longitudinal and lateral dynamics considering the combined-slip effect and tire force saturation. In light of reducing wireless communication errors and efficient usage of battery power and resources, we propose an intermittent V2V communication in which transmissions are scheduled based on an event-triggered law. An event is triggered and a transmission is scheduled in subsequent sample time if some of the well-defined path-following error functions (relative distance error and lateral error) exceed given tolerance bounds. Considering that the V2V communication channel might be erroneous or a transmission fails due to, e.g., vehicles' distance or low battery power, we consider data loss in the V2V channel. Our proposed control law consists of two components: a receding horizon feedback controller with state constraints based on a safe operation envelop and a feedforward controller that generates complementary control inputs when the leader's states are successfully communicated to the follower. To mitigate the effects of data loss on the follower's path-following performance, we design a remote estimator for the follower to predict the leader's state using its on-board sensor equipment when an event is triggered but the corresponding state information is not received by the follower due to a packet loss. Incorporating this estimator allows the follower to apply cautionary control inputs knowing that the path-following error had exceeded a tolerance bound. We show that while the feedback controller stabilizes the follower's dynamics, the feedforward component improves the safety margins and reduces the path-following errors even in the presence of data loss. High-fidelity simulations are performed using CarSim to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control architecture specifically in harsh maneuvers and high-slip scenarios on various road surface conditions.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Timing-Based Framework for Designing Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems under Safety Constraint,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166391012&doi=10.1145%2f3594638&partnerID=40&md5=fbfc2dd790bd7c9c885976c21156c6f3,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are required to satisfy safety constraints in various application domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing systems, and power systems. Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety violations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Resilient architectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and attacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe operating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize different mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently, there is no common framework to compare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing one architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this article, we propose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient architectures and develop a common methodology for safety analysis and computation of control policies and design parameters. Using the insight that the cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we first develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these architectures. Based on the hybrid system, we formulate the problem of joint computation of control policies and associated timing parameters for CPS to satisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the solution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute control policies and timing parameters relevant to the employed architecture. We also note that our solution can be applied to a wide class of CPS with polynomial dynamics and also allows incorporation of new architectures. We verify our proposed framework by performing a case study on adaptive cruise control of vehicles.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Automated Adversary-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical Defense Planning,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166389728&doi=10.1145%2f3596222&partnerID=40&md5=25794de45d546c4e1decfc4ffaf55c84,"Security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) continues to pose new challenges due to the tight integration and operational complexity of the cyber and physical components. To address these challenges, this article presents a domain-aware, optimization-based approach to determine an effective defense strategy for CPS in an automated fashion - by emulating a strategic adversary in the loop that exploits system vulnerabilities, interconnection of the CPS, and the dynamics of the physical components. Our approach builds on an adversarial decision-making model based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that determines the optimal cyber (discrete) and physical (continuous) attack actions over a CPS attack graph. The defense planning problem is modeled as a non-zero-sum game between the adversary and defender. We use a model-free reinforcement learning method to solve the adversary's problem as a function of the defense strategy. We then employ Bayesian optimization (BO) to find an approximate best-response for the defender to harden the network against the resulting adversary policy. This process is iterated multiple times to improve the strategy for both players. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a ransomware-inspired graph with a smart building system as the physical process. Numerical studies show that our method converges to a Nash equilibrium for various defender-specific costs of network hardening.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Minimal Critical Sequences in Model-based Safety and Security Analyses: Commonalities and Differences,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166384951&doi=10.1145%2f3593811&partnerID=40&md5=86d69e8ceb0bd46a309d19b252be161c,"Discrete event systems are increasingly used as a modeling tool to assess safety and cybersecurity of complex systems. In both cases, the analysis relies on the extraction of critical sequences. This approach proves to be very powerful. It suffers, however, from the combinatorial explosion of the number of sequences to look at. To push the limits of what is feasible with reasonable computational resources, extraction algorithms use cutoffs and minimality criteria. In this article, we review the principles of extraction algorithms, and we show that there are important differences between critical sequences extracted in the context of safety analyses and those extracted in the context of cybersecurity analyses. Based on this thorough comparison, we introduce a new cutoff criterion, so-called footprint, that aims at capturing the willfulness of an intruder performing a cyberattack. We illustrate our presentation by means of three case studies, one focused on the analysis of failures and two focused on the analysis of cyberattacks and their effects on safety. We show experimentally the interest of the footprint criterion.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this article, we use a weakly-hard fault model to constrain the occurrences of faults in system inputs. We develop approaches to verify properties for all possible values of (m,k), where k is smaller than or equal to a given K, in an exact and efficient manner. By verifying all possible values of (m,k), we define weakly-hard requirements for the system environment and design a runtime monitor based on counting the number of faults in system inputs. If the system environment satisfies the weakly-hard requirements, then the satisfaction of desired properties is guaranteed; otherwise, the runtime monitor can notify the system to switch to a safe mode. This is especially essential for cyber-physical systems that need to provide guarantees with limited resources and the existence of faults. Experimental results with discrete second-order control, network routing, vehicle following, and lane changing demonstrate the generality and the efficiency of the proposed approaches.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Moving toward energy harvesting powered systems enables their long-term, sustainable, scalable, and maintenance-free operation. When these systems are used as components of an automatic control system to sense a control plant, energy availability limits when and how often sensed data are obtainable and therefore when and how often control updates can be performed. The time-varying and non-deterministic availability of harvested energy and the necessity to plan the energy usage of the energy harvesting sensor nodes ahead of time, on the one hand, have to be balanced with the dynamically changing and complex demand for control updates from the automatic control plant and thus energy usage, on the other hand. We propose a hierarchical approach with which the resources of the energy harvesting sensor nodes are managed on a long time horizon and on a faster timescale, self-triggered model predictive control controls the plant. The controller of the harvesting-based nodes' resources schedules the future energy usage ahead of time and the self-triggered model predictive control incorporates these time-varying energy constraints. For this novel combination of energy harvesting and automatic control systems, we derive provable properties in terms of correctness, feasibility, and performance. We evaluate the approach on a double integrator and demonstrate its usability and performance in a room temperature and air quality control case study.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Distributed embedded systems; energy harvesting; self-triggered model predictive control; sensor networks; sustainable automatic control,Air quality; Automation; Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Sensor nodes; Time varying control systems; Automatic control systems; Control plants; Distributed embedded system; Energy usage; Energy-harvesting sensor nodes; Model-predictive control; Self-triggered model predictive control; Sensors network; Sustainable automatic control; Time varying; Model predictive control
Toward a Distributed Trust Management System for Misbehavior Detection in the Internet of Vehicles,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164554310&doi=10.1145%2f3594637&partnerID=40&md5=3f646524b777636b1845cbee12453a13,"Recent considerable state-of-the-art advancements within the automotive sector, coupled with an evolution of the promising paradigms of vehicle-to-everything communication and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), have facilitated vehicles to generate and, accordingly, disseminate an enormous amount of safety-critical and non-safety infotainment data in a bid to guarantee a highly safe, convenient, and congestion-aware road transport. These dynamic networks require intelligent security measures to ensure that the malicious messages, along with the vehicles that disseminate them, are identified and subsequently eliminated in a timely manner so that they are not in a position to harm other vehicles. Failing to do so could jeopardize the entire network, leading to fatalities and injuries amongst road users. Several researchers, over the years, have envisaged conventional cryptographic-based solutions employing certificates and the public key infrastructure for enhancing the security of vehicular networks. Nevertheless, cryptographic-based solutions are not optimum for an IoV network primarily, since the cryptographic schemes could be susceptible to compromised trust authorities and insider attacks that are highly deceptive in nature and cannot be noticed immediately and are, therefore, capable of causing catastrophic damage. Accordingly, in this article, a distributed trust management system has been proposed that ascertains the trust of all the reputation segments within an IoV network. The envisaged system takes into consideration the salient characteristics of familiarity, i.e., assessed via a subjective logic approach, similarity, and timeliness to ascertain the weights of all the reputation segments. Furthermore, an intelligent trust threshold mechanism has been developed for the identification and eviction of the misbehaving vehicles. The experimental results suggest the advantages of our proposed IoV-based trust management system in terms of optimizing the misbehavior detection and its resilience to various sorts of attacks.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Measures to be taken post-incident are crucial to reduce damage, restore control, and identify attack actors involved. By monitoring Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), the incident responder can detect malicious activity triggers and respond quickly to a similar intrusion at an earlier stage. However, to implement IOCs in critical infrastructures, we need to understand their contexts and requirements. Unfortunately, there is no survey paper in the literature on IOC in the ICS environment, and only limited information is provided in research articles. In this article, we describe different standards for IOC representation and discuss the associated challenges that restrict security investigators from developing IOCs in the industrial sectors. We also discuss the potential IOCs against cyber-attacks in ICS systems. Furthermore, we conduct a critical analysis of existing works and available tools in this space. We evaluate the effectiveness of identified IOCs' by mapping these indicators to the most frequently targeted attacks in the ICS environment. Finally, we highlight the lessons to be learned from the literature and the future problems in the domain along with the approaches that might be taken.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, the accuracy of in-vehicle perception systems may significantly vary under different operational conditions (e.g., fog density, light condition, etc.) and consequently degrade the reliability of autonomous driving. A perception system for autonomous driving must be carefully validated with an extremely large dataset collected under all possible operational conditions in order to ensure its robustness. The aforementioned dataset required for validation, however, is expensive or even impossible to acquire in practice, since most operational corners rarely occur in a real-world environment. In this paper, we propose to generate synthetic datasets at a variety of operational corners by using a parameterized cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (PCGAN). The proposed PCGAN is able to learn from an image dataset recorded at real-world operational conditions with only a few samples at corners and synthesize a large dataset at a given operational corner. By taking STOP sign detection as an example, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate high-quality synthetic datasets to facilitate accurate validation.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To avoid accidents in such safety-critical systems, a traffic protocol needs to be implemented. In this article, we are concerned with synchronous traffic protocols, i.e., those that synchronize the arrival time of vehicles at the intersection. In particular, such protocols are normally conceived for homogeneous vehicles of approximately the same size/length. However, these do not extend well to heterogeneous vehicles, i.e., they lead to unviable requirements on the road infrastructure. To overcome this limitation, based on the observation that large/overlength vehicles like buses and trams are less frequent than passenger vehicles, we propose an approach that treats them as exceptions (rather than the rule) leading to a much more efficient design. In contrast to approaches from the literature, we implement a two-speed policy - with a high speed for drive-through and a low speed for turn maneuvers - and analyze both single-vehicle as well as fairness-based platoon crossing. To conclude, we perform detailed comparisons illustrating the benefits by the proposed approach.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesIntelligent intersections; traffic automation; traffic protocols; vehicle throughput,Safety engineering; Additional key word and phrasesintelligent intersection; Autonomous driving; Cooperative driving; Intelligent intersection; Key words; Traffic automation; Traffic efficiency; Traffic light; Traffic protocol; Vehicle throughput; Vehicles
AcTrak: Controlling a Steerable Surveillance Camera using Reinforcement Learning,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162057449&doi=10.1145%2f3585316&partnerID=40&md5=f2e3df861c4e8d4e39d59ee18f99a531,"Steerable cameras that can be controlled via a network, to retrieve telemetries of interest have become popular. In this paper, we develop a framework called AcTrak, to automate a camera's motion to appropriately switch between (a) zoom ins on existing targets in a scene to track their activities, and (b) zoom out to search for new targets arriving to the area of interest. Specifically, we seek to achieve a good trade-off between the two tasks, i.e., we want to ensure that new targets are observed by the camera before they leave the scene, while also zooming in on existing targets frequently enough to monitor their activities. There exist prior control algorithms for steering cameras to optimize certain objectives; however, to the best of our knowledge, none have considered this problem, and do not perform well when target activity tracking is required. AcTrak automatically controls the camera's PTZ configurations using reinforcement learning (RL), to select the best camera position given the current state. Via simulations using real datasets, we show that AcTrak detects newly arriving targets 30% faster than a non-adaptive baseline and rarely misses targets, unlike the baseline which can miss up to 5% of the targets. We also implement AcTrak to control a real camera and demonstrate that in comparison with the baseline, it acquires about 2× more high resolution images of targets.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Optimizing Mixed Autonomy Traffic Flow with Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161990096&doi=10.1145%2f3582576&partnerID=40&md5=03f1e324ffd0ecb181b7e7233dd36b4f,"We study the ability of autonomous vehicles to improve the throughput of a bottleneck using a fully decentralized control scheme in a mixed autonomy setting. We consider the problem of improving the throughput of a scaled model of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge: a two-stage bottleneck where four lanes reduce to two and then reduce to one. Although there is extensive work examining variants of bottleneck control in a centralized setting, there is less study of the challenging multi-agent setting where the large number of interacting AVs leads to significant optimization difficulties for reinforcement learning methods. We apply multi-agent reinforcement algorithms to this problem and demonstrate that significant improvements in bottleneck throughput, from 20% at a 5% penetration rate to 33% at a 40% penetration rate, can be achieved. We compare our results to a hand-designed feedback controller and demonstrate that our results sharply outperform the feedback controller despite extensive tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RL-based controllers adopt a robust strategy that works across penetration rates whereas the feedback controllers degrade immediately upon penetration rate variation. We investigate the feasibility of both action and observation decentralization and demonstrate that effective strategies are possible using purely local sensing.

DT-DS: CAN Intrusion Detection with Decision Tree Ensembles,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151799758&doi=10.1145%2f3566132&partnerID=40&md5=9f09a5e975b153785b995e7b38adfeef,"The controller area network (CAN) protocol, used in many modern vehicles for real-time inter-device communications, is known to have cybersecurity vulnerabilities, putting passengers at risk for data exfiltration and control system sabotage. To address this issue, researchers have proposed to utilize security measures based on cryptography and message authentication; unfortunately, such approaches are often too computationally expensive to be deployed in real time on CAN devices. Additionally, they have developed machine learning (ML) techniques to detect anomalies in CAN traffic and thereby prevent attacks. The main disadvantage of existing ML-based techniques is that they either depend on additional computational hardware or they heuristically assume that all communication anomalies are malicious.In this article, we show that tree-based learning ensembles outperform anomaly-based techniques like AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Z-Score when used to detect attacks that result in increased bus utilization. We evaluated the detection capacity of three tree-based ensembles, Adaboost, gradient boosting, and random forests, and collectively refer to these as DT-DS. We conclude that the decision tree ensemble with Adaboost performs best with an area under curve (AUC) score of 0.999, closely followed by gradient boosting and random forests with 0.997 and 0.991 AUC scores, respectively, when trained using message profiles. We observe that with an increase in the observation window, the DT-DS models present an average AUC score of 0.999, and offer a nearly perfect detection of attacks, at the cost of increased latency in detection of attacked messages. We evaluate the performance of the IDS for Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated- (ARINC) encoded CAN communication traffic in avionic systems, generated using an aerospace testbench, ARINC-825TBv2. The IDS has been evaluated against the active attacks of a state-of-the-art predictive attacker model. Additionally, we observed that the performance of IDS approaches such as ARIMA and Z-Score degrade considerably with a decrease in the size of the observation time window. In contrast, the performance of DT-DS models is consistent, with only an average drop of 0.005 in the AUC score.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

SL1-Simplex: Safe Velocity Regulation of Self-Driving Vehicles in Dynamic and Unforeseen Environments,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151848062&doi=10.1145%2f3564273&partnerID=40&md5=a7bdb171cdf79cecb0d2bc594a4a3403,"This article proposes a novel extension of the Simplex architecture with model switching and model learning to achieve safe velocity regulation of self-driving vehicles in dynamic and unforeseen environments. To guarantee the reliability of autonomous vehicles, an gL1 adaptive controller that compensates for uncertainties and disturbances is employed by the Simplex architecture as a verified high-assurance controller (HAC) to tolerate concurrent software and physical failures. Meanwhile, the safe switching controller is incorporated into the HAC for safe velocity regulation in the dynamic (prepared) environments, through the integration of the traction control system and anti-lock braking system. Due to the high dependence of vehicle dynamics on the driving environments, the HAC leverages the finite-time model learning to timely learn and update the vehicle model for gL1 adaptive controller, when any deviation from the safety envelope or the uncertainty measurement threshold occurs in the unforeseen driving environments. With the integration of gL1 adaptive controller, safe switching controller and finite-time model learning, the vehicle's angular and longitudinal velocities can asymptotically track the provided references in the dynamic and unforeseen driving environments, while the wheel slips are restricted to safety envelopes to prevent slipping and sliding. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed Simplex architecture for safe velocity regulation is validated by the AutoRally platform.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",anti-lock braking system; gL<sub>1</sub>adaptive controller; model learning; model switching; safe velocity regulation; Simplex; traction control system,Adaptive control systems; Learning systems; Software reliability; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive controllers; Driving environment; Gl1adaptive controller; High assurance; Model learning; Model switching; Safe velocity regulation; Self drivings; Simplex; Traction control systems; Controllers
CASCADE: An Asset-driven Approach to Build Security Assurance Cases for Automotive Systems,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151887634&doi=10.1145%2f3569459&partnerID=40&md5=c5802b17d5b7ca5841cbccabb72ad454,"Security Assurance Cases (SAC) are structured arguments and evidence bodies used to reason about the security of a certain system. SACs are gaining focus in the automotive industry, as the needs for security assurance are growing in this domain. However, the state-of-the-arts lack a mature approach able to suit the needs of the automotive industry. In this article, we present CASCADE, an asset-driven approach for creating SAC, which is inspired by the upcoming security standard ISO/SAE-21434 as well as the internal needs of automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). CASCADE also differentiates itself from the state-of-the-art by incorporating a way to reason about the quality of the constructed security assurance case. We created the approach by conducting an iterative design science research study. We illustrate the results using the example case of the road vehicle's headlamp provided in the ISO standard. We also illustrate how our approach aligns well with the structure and content of the ISO/SAE-21434 standard, hence demonstrating the practical applicability of CASCADE in an industrial context.  © 2023 held by the owner/author(s).",assurance cases; automotive systems; Security,Automotive industry; Headlights; Assurance case; Automotive Systems; Automotives; Design-science researches; Iterative design; Original equipment manufacturers; Security; Security assurance; Security standards; State of the art; ISO Standards
SchedGuard++: Protecting against Schedule Leaks Using Linux Containers on Multi-Core Processors,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151790383&doi=10.1145%2f3565974&partnerID=40&md5=078c5edc5064e5ca91666b54b6e2f05e,"Timing correctness is crucial in a multi-criticality real-time system, such as an autonomous driving system. It has been recently shown that these systems can be vulnerable to timing inference attacks, mainly due to their predictable behavioral patterns. Existing solutions like schedule randomization cannot protect against such attacks, often limited by the system's real-time nature. This article presents ""SchedGuard++"": a temporal protection framework for Linux-based real-time systems that protects against posterior schedule-based attacks by preventing untrusted tasks from executing during specific time intervals. SchedGuard++ supports multi-core platforms and is implemented using Linux containers and a customized Linux kernel real-time scheduler. We provide schedulability analysis assuming the Logical Execution Time (LET) paradigm, which enforces I/O predictability. The proposed response time analysis takes into account the interference from trusted and untrusted tasks and the impact of the protection mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using a realistic radio-controlled rover platform. Not only is ""SchedGuard++""able to protect against the posterior schedule-based attacks, but it also ensures that the real-time tasks/containers meet their temporal requirements.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, with security requirements often being an afterthought in automotive software development, incorporation of such software features with intra- and inter-vehicular connectivity requirements often opens up new attack surfaces. Demonstrations of such security vulnerabilities in past reports and literature bring in the necessity to formally analyze how secure automotive control systems really are against adversarial attacks. Modern vehicles often incorporate onboard monitoring systems that test the sanctity of data samples communicated among controllers and detect possible attack/noise insertion scenarios. The performance of such monitors against security threats also needs to be verified.In this work, we outline a rigorous methodology for estimating the vulnerability of automotive CPSs. We provide a computer-aided design framework that considers the model-based representation of safety-critical automotive controllers and monitoring systems working in a closed loop with vehicle dynamics and verifies their safety and robustness w.r.t. false data injection attacks. Symbolically exploring all possible combinations of attack points of the input automotive CPS, the proposed framework tries to find out which sensor and/or actuation signal is vulnerable by generating stealthy and successful attacks using a formal method-based counter-example guided abstract refinement process. We also validate the efficacy of the proposed framework using a case study performed in an industry-scale simulator.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",CPS; formal methods; safety verification; Vehicle Stability Control system,Computer aided design; Controllers; Formal verification; Network security; Robustness (control systems); Vehicles; Automotive software; Automotives; CPS; Electronics control unit; Robustness analysis; Safety verification; Security analysis; Software features; Support for securities; Vehicle stability control systems; Software design

It is used to derive security requirements for a secure system design and to evaluate design alternatives as well as vulnerabilities. Security risk assessment is also a complex and interdisciplinary task, where experts from the application domain and the security domain have to collaborate and understand each other. Automated and tool-supported approaches are desired to help manage the complexity. However, the models used for system engineering usually focus on functional behavior and lack security-related aspects. Therefore, we present our modeling approach that alleviates communication between the involved experts and features steps of computer-aided modeling to achieve consistency and avoid omission errors. We demonstrate our approach with an example. We also describe how to model impact rating and attack feasibility estimation in a modular fashion, along with the propagation and aggregation of these estimations through the model. As a result, experts can make local decisions or changes in the model, which in turn provides the impact of these decisions or changes on the overall risk profile. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our model-based method.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",model-based; risk analysis; secure design; security engineering; Security risk assessment; threat modeling,Risk assessment; Security systems; Assessment risks; Model-based OPC; Risk assessment - modelling; Risk levels; Secure designs; Secure system; Security engineering; Security requirements; Security risk assessments; Threat modeling; Risk analysis
Automating Safety and Security Co-design through Semantically Rich Architecture Patterns,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151848656&doi=10.1145%2f3565269&partnerID=40&md5=a9c36e34b96371467afb57707899e304,"During the design of safety-critical systems, safety and security engineers make use of architecture patterns, such as Watchdog and Firewall, to address identified failures and threats. Often, however, the deployment of safety architecture patterns has consequences on security; e.g., the deployment of a safety architecture pattern may lead to new threats. The other way around may also be possible; i.e., the deployment of a security architecture pattern may lead to new failures. Safety and security co-design is, therefore, required to understand such consequences and tradeoffs in order to reach appropriate system designs. Currently, architecture pattern descriptions, including their consequences, are described using natural language. Therefore, their deployment in system design is carried out manually by experts and thus is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially given the high system complexity. We propose the use of semantically rich architecture patterns to enable automated support for safety and security co-design by using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) methods. Based on our domain-specific language, we specify reasoning principles as logic specifications written as answer-set programs. KRR engines enable the automation of safety and security co-engineering activities, including the automated recommendation of which architecture patterns can address failures or threats, and consequences of deploying such patterns. We demonstrate our approach on an example taken from the ISO 21434 standard.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",automation; automotive vehicle systems; safety and security co-design; Safety architecture patterns; security architecture patterns,Knowledge representation; Problem oriented languages; Safety engineering; Systems analysis; Architecture patterns; Automotive vehicle; Automotive vehicle system; Co-designs; Safety and securities; Safety and security co-design; Safety architecture; Safety architecture pattern; Security Architecture; Security architecture pattern; Vehicle system; Automation
How Hard Is Cyber-risk Management in IT/OT Systems? A Theory to Classify and Conquer Hardness of Insuring ICSs,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146439135&doi=10.1145%2f3568399&partnerID=40&md5=2fd9ce4a9f919d6f2623d4a8c674598e,"Third-party residual cyber-risk management (RCRM) services (e.g., insurance, re-insurance) are getting increasingly popular (currently, a multi-billion-dollar annual market) with C-suites managing industrial control systems (ICSs) based upon IoT-driven cyber-physical IT and OT technology. Apart from mitigating and diversifying losses from (major) cyber-threats RCRM services positively contribute to improved cyber-security as an added societal benefit. However, it is also well known that RCRM markets (RCRM for ICSs being a mere subset) are relatively nascent and sparse. There is a huge (approximately 10-fold) supply-demand gap in an environment where (a) annual cyber-losses range in trillions of USD, and (b) CRM markets (residual or otherwise) are annually worth only up to 0.25 trillion USD. The main reason for this wide gap is the age-old information asymmetry (IA) bottleneck between the demand and supply sides of the third-party RCRM market, which is significantly amplified in modern cyber-space settings. This setting primarily comprises interdependent and intra-networked ICSs (and/or traditional IT systems) from diverse application sectors inter-networked with each other in a service supply-chain environment. In this article, we are the first to prove that optimal cyber-risk diversification (integral to RCRM) under IA is computationally intractable, i.e., NP-hard, for such (systemic) inter-networked societies. Here, the term ""optimal diversification""implies the best way a residual and profit-minded cyber-risk manager can form a portfolio of client coverage contracts. We follow this up with the design and analysis of a computational policy that alleviates this intractability challenge for the social good. Here, the social good can be ensured through denser RCRM markets that in principle improve cyber-security. Our work formally establishes (a) the reason why it has been very difficult in practice (without suitable policy intervention) to densify IA-affected RCRM markets despite their high demand in modern CPS/ICS/IoT societies; and (b) the efficacy of our computational policy to mitigate IA issues between the supply and demand sides of an RCRM market in such societies.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",bipartite graph; Cyber-risk; cyber-risk diversification; expander graph; ICS; information asymmetry; insurance; IoT; IT; NP-hard; OT; residual cyber-risk management; security,Commerce; Computation theory; Cybersecurity; Financial markets; Insurance; Integrated circuits; Internet of things; Optimization; Supply chains; Bipartite graphs; Cybe-risk; Cybe-risk diversification; Expander graphs; Industrial control systems; Information asymmetry; IoT; IT; NP-hard; OT; Residual cybe-risk management; Risk diversification; Risks management; Security; Risk management

Intrusion Detection Framework for Invasive FPV Drones Using Video Streaming Characteristics,2023,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160674037&doi=10.1145%2f3579999&partnerID=40&md5=83914f4ceedaba36cb496ae09efc02fa,"Cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) First-Person View (FPV) drones have become widely available for consumers in recent years. Unfortunately, they also provide low-cost attack opportunities to malicious users. Thus, effective methods to detect the presence of unknown and non-cooperating drones within a restricted area are highly demanded. Approaches based on detection of drones based on emitted video stream have been proposed, but were not yet shown to work against other similar benign traffic, such as that generated by wireless security cameras. Most importantly, these approaches were not studied in the context of detecting new unprofiled drone types. In this work, we propose a novel drone detection framework, which leverages specific patterns in video traffic transmitted by drones. The patterns consist of repetitive synchronization packets (we call pivots), which we use as features for a machine learning classifier. We show that our framework can achieve up to 99% in detection accuracy over an encrypted WiFi channel using only 170 packets originated from the drone within 820ms time period. Our framework is able to identify drone 2 transmissions even among very similar WiFi transmissions (such as video streams originated from security cameras) as well as in noisy scenarios with background traffic. Furthermore, the design of our pivot features enables the classifier to detect unprofiled drones in which the classifier has never trained on and is refined using a novel feature selection strategy that selects the features that have the discriminative power of detecting new unprofiled drones. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Aircraft detection; Cameras; Classification (of information); Costs; Drones; Video streaming; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Based on detections; Commercial off the shelves; Commercial off-the shelves; Commercial-off-the-shelf; Detection framework; First person; Intrusion-Detection; Low-costs; Security cameras; Video-streaming; Intrusion detection

By not having taken this possible linkage into account, previous research has underestimated the impacts both of risk aversion and balanced skills on the likelihood individuals choose entrepreneurship. Data on Dutch university graduates provides evidence which supports this contention. It thereby raises the possibility that even risk-averse people might be suited to entrepreneurship; and it may also help explain why prior research has generated mixed evidence about the effects of risk aversion on selection into entrepreneurship.",,Risk averse; Risk aversion; University graduates

This 'me-search' feature seeks to account for the researcher's footprint and, in doing so, to attend to the issue of subjectivity. This essay contributes to that trend by pinpointing a particular type of subjectivity, namely countertransference, and explores the potential of anxiety dreams to help in its identification. Using field notes from a 199-day full-time ethnography of Cambridge University's preparations for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, it argues that dreams are a useful resource for reflexivity. The essay concludes with practical suggestions for organization researchers keen to understand how they, their anxieties, and their dreams are implicated in the production and interpretation of field accounts.",,Cambridge; Cambridge university; Field notes; Self reflection

I carefully performed both the historical analysis of technology evolution and detailed patent content analysis for the automotive emissions control system and empirically confirmed that there was significant shift in the focus of innovation to another subsystem, electronics, following the emergence of a catalyst-based dominant design. Moreover, the rate of innovation during the post-dominant design period is found to be lower than that of the pre-dominant design period.

The more intense the attacks on rivals, the more likely audiences will stereotype the industry category and generalize to all members of that industry category the negative attributes implied by the attacks. In this paper, we suggest that the intensity of the public attacks of rivals leads to a greater likelihood that a focal firm will respond to avoid contamination. As the risk of generalization increases, firms tend to dissociate themselves from the tainted industry category by altering their business portfolio. They do so in relation to their own degree of prototypicality (i.e., how much they resemble the average member of the tainted category). We use panel data on the global defense industry between 1996 and 2007 to test our hypotheses. Results support our claims that (1) the public attacks of rivals drive a firm's dissociation from the targeted industry and (2) this dissociation is attenuated for less prototypical firms.",,Dissociation; Business portfolios; Defense Industry; Industry norms; Panel data; Prototypicality; Risk of contamination; Digital storage

Our unique dataset, consisting of panel data with 24-month observations for 232 stores of a large Spanish fashion retail company, enabled us to compare different time lags between the moment of departures and the performance measures using fixed effects regressions. Such analyses revealed that both types of turnover had different consequences. Voluntary turnover was unrelated to store performance. Otherwise, involuntary turnover was significantly and negatively related both to store productivity and efficiency when variables are measured simultaneously, though this effect disappears in a one-month time lag. These results are discussed in the context of operational disruption arguments.",,Fixed effects; Panel data; Panel data analysis; Performance measure; Store performance; Time lag; Retail stores

This paper examines the developments in the practices of research supervision through the lens of new institutional theory.

"Open source, open innovation, open communities: What drives the performance of ""open""?",2012,"Academy of Management 2012 Annual Meeting, AOM 2012",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026232926&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2012.309&partnerID=40&md5=78c2bfe64eaef3cd4e1017a49551cd8e,"Despite its economic and social impact, open collaboration (OC) remains a puzzle. Here we show that OC - in software, science, and elsewhere - is a robust engine for innovation and production, one that performs well even in unfavorable conditions and is likely to continue expanding. Its emergence and growth can inform organizational theory. ""Open"" is booming. Open source software, a well-known harbinger, has progressed to mainstream. Once the domain of hobbyists and hackers, it has gained acceptance with corporations and governments. The Apache webserver and the Linux and Android operating systems have become commonplace, creating billions of dollars in economic value (e.g., European Commission, 2006). Yet ""open"" has progressed beyond software. Similar patterns of innovation and production - which we called Open Collaboration (OC) - have flourished in a variety of innovation and production activities, for goods and services (Baldwin & Von Hippel, 2011; Benkler, 2011; von Hippel, 2005b). The free encyclopedia Wikipedia, once mocked as ""faith based"", has come to match the quality of its primary for-profit rival (Giles, 2005). Science has been progressing by enlisting thousands of volunteers, each contributing just a fraction of a solution, to make discoveries and solve problems too immense for traditional organizations (Benkler, 2004; Partha, 1994). Similar patterns that are labeled by the adjectival ""open"" have emerged in medicine (Ortí et al., 2009; Rai, 2005), engineering (""open design"") and biotechnology (Henkel & Maurer, 2007, 2009). More generally, the Open Science movement aims to transform scientific research and publishing by dispersing authority and expanding sharing (Lin, 2012). In everyday life, strangers collaborate, answer questions, and solve problems in user-to-user forums (Lakhani & von Hippel, 2003), mailing lists (Jarvenpaa & Majchrzak, 2008) and online communities (Faraj & Johnson, 2010). People also collaborate in peer-to-peer networks, where they share files (sometimes illegally, see Levine, 2001) and bandwidth, leading to free services such as Skype (Benkler, 2006:83-87). These patterns of innovation, production, and collaboration have been noted by scholars. Our inquiry and model apply broadly to cover a variety of phenomena, including Open Collaborative Innovation (Baldwin & Von Hippel, 2011), Peer Production (Benkler, 2002), Community Based Innovation System (Franke & Shah, 2003), and some instances of Open Innovation (West & Gallagher, 2006), Transaction-Free Zones (Baldwin, 2008), Collaborative communities (Adler, Kwon, & Heckscher, 2008), and Electronic Networks of Practice or Online Communities (Faraj, Jarvenpaa, & Majchrzak, 2011; Kollock, 1999; Wasko & Faraj, 2005). Despite its social and economic impact and the scholarly interest it drew, OC remains a puzzle. Here, we trace the boundaries that define it. Then, we draw on recent evidence on human cooperation to answer a fundamental question about the phenomenon: why people share the fruits of cooperation with non-contributors. The answer is related to cooperativeness, the tendency of participants to cooperate, which is one factor that affects the performance of OC. We join cooperativeness with other factors found in theory and evidence: need heterogeneity, or diversity of the participants' needs and wants, and the extent to which the shared goods are rival, where one's consumption interferes with another's (aka subtractable, Hess & Ostrom, 2006). To test the performance of OC, we combine the three elements - cooperativeness, need heterogeneity, rivalry - in an agent-based model. Because we envision OC as a general system for innovation and production, the model uses a fundamental measure of economic performance: efficiency in turning inputs to outputs through collaboration. The results are counterintuitive: OC can thrive even in seemingly inhospitable environments, reaching much broadly than currently assumed or observed. It performs robustly even when cooperators are a fraction of participants, free riders are present, goods are rival, or participant needs are homogenous. The results suggest what affects the performance of OC, but - equally important - what does not. The findings imply growth and spread of OC into new domains, and they can also inform the discussion on new organizational forms, collaborative and communal (e.g., Adler et al., 2008; Benkler, 2011; Faraj et al., 2011; Heckscher & Adler, 2006). It suggests that human efforts can be harnessed in previously unthought-of ways.",,Aluminum alloys; Autonomous agents; Computer operating systems; Distributed computer systems; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Online systems; Open source software; Open systems; Peer to peer networks; Personal computing; Social networking (online); Software engineering; Websites; Collaborative community; Collaborative innovation; Community-based innovations; Economic performance; New organizational forms; Organizational theory; Scientific researches; Social and economic impacts; Innovation

We hypothesize indirect effects of cultural norms on venture emergence. Specifically that community-level cultural norms (performance-based culture and socially-supportive institutional norms) impact important supply-side variables (entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial motivation) which in turn influence nascent entrepreneurs' success in creating operational ventures (venture emergence). We test our predictions on a unique longitudinal data set (PSED II) tracking nascent entrepreneurs venture creation efforts over a 5 year time span and find evidence supporting them. Our research contributes to a more fine-grained understanding of how culture, in particular perceptions of community cultural norms, influences venture emergence.

Organizations across all sectors frequently ask employees to voluntarily donate either directly or through payroll deduction. To date, there has been little research that explores how employee attributes, including motivational bases, affect voluntary participation in workplace giving campaigns. There are two research questions we seek to answer. First, is an employee's public service motivation (PSM) positively related to the amount donated in the workplace? Second, does an employee's level of organizational identification (OI) moderate the effect of PSM on workplace giving? The findings suggest that both PSM and OI have significant direct effects on employee giving. Furthermore, we find evidence that PSM is conditioned by OI as a moderator with respect to employee giving in workplace campaigns.",,Compensation (personnel); Motivation; Wages; Organizational identifications; Organizational identities; Payroll deductions; Public service motivations; Research questions; Voluntary participation; Photomasks

We show that the presence of 'kingpins' in a segment increases the segment's share of total sector value, and establishes the segment as a bottleneck.

However, current research has scarcely addressed the role of leadership in business model innovation. By developing a conceptual model, we address this research gap and establish a theoretical linkage between top-level leader behavior and business-model innovation from a cultural historical activity system perspective of organizational learning and development. Based on our model, we suggest that transformational and transactional leader behaviors of top-level managers are likely to have a positive impact on business model innovation by supporting the development of followers' learning activity. We also suggest that transactional and transformational leader behaviors mediate the positive impact of instrumental leader behavior, and that laissez-faire leader behavior is negatively associated with business model innovation.",,Activity Systems; Business model innovation; Business modeling; Conceptual model; Cultural-historical; Learning Activity; Organizational learning; Education

We test the respective role of each of these three complementary pricing strategies with archival data from a global online market that specializes in the outsourcing of IT services. The results confirm that, besides cost-based pricing, service providers also account for the information signals of competing providers when pricing their services, while they also personalize their prices for service outsourcers with different quality levels to shield themselves from transaction uncertainty.",,Electronic commerce; Outsourcing; Competitive pricing; Empirical investigation; Information signals; Online reverse auctions; Personalized pricing; Pricing strategy; Strategic pricing; Uncertainty theory; Costs

Agglomeration, by eliminating the physical space between people, firms and ideas, affects not only the rate of innovation, but also the type of idea recombinations that take place. While the role of co-location on innovation has been extensively studied, the micro-foundations of knowledge transfer and generation still remain undeveloped. Co-location, by increasing the frequency of interactions with very low expected value, qualitatively transforms the knowledge that is recombined, allowing for high levels of ""exploration"". This is particularly important when the uncertainty surrounding idea quality is high (e.g. early-stage research) and the outcome distribution is very skewed (e.g. scientific breakthroughs). I analyze how geographic proximity impacts the recombination of ideas using a novel dataset of department relocations at the University of Toronto (1995-2010).

We present an inductive study of university-research centres, which are research groups based at universities but sponsored by corporations. We develop a process model for how centre participants first reached settlements that exploited institutional complementarities, and then dealt with the arising logics tensions via organizational design. We conclude with implications for work on institutional complexity, ambidexterity and resource dependence theory.",,Multiple logic; Organizational designs; Process Modeling; Recent researches; Research groups; Resource dependences; University research; Societies and institutions

We argue that the BOP is embedded in and reliant on broader hegemonic capitalist discourses, which have proliferated since the 19th century. In this abridged version of the paper, we focus on two homogenizing tendencies of the BOP discourse: (1) the way in which it positions all poor people as self-interested individuals, or homo economicus and (2) the way in which it represents non-capitalist economic practices as either co-existing peacefully with capitalist economic practices or as a threat to capitalist development. We briefly discuss some alternative perspectives that reveal the diversity of noncapitalist alternatives, subjectivities, and resistance to incorporation into capitalism.",,Base of the pyramids; Co-existing; Critical analysis

In this paper we argue that an approach to innovation based on the use of diverse, distant, and distinctive knowledge may hinder securities analysts' efforts to evaluate a firm's innovation strategy, thereby making them less willing to cover the firm. The theory is tested using data on medical devices and computer hardware firms and the preliminary results offer support for these ideas. Whereas prior research has shown that using diverse, distant, and distinctive knowledge helps firms create innovations, this study, in contrast, shows that such an approach to innovation may also complicate the firm's efforts to attract analyst coverage.",,Computer hardware; Analyst coverages; Financial resources; Innovation strategy; Medical Devices; Securities analysts; Biomedical equipment

Inter-team knowledge sharing: The variegated effects of context and when lobbying can help,2012,"Academy of Management 2012 Annual Meeting, AOM 2012",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026200807&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2012.92&partnerID=40&md5=195a1e9c0e1d477042e721865149b3a1,"This paper considers the contingent effects of context on the relationship between upward lobbying and knowledge sharing in organizations. Existing research has indicated that organizational groups frequently rely on lobbying tactics to acquire knowledge and that this has significant performance effects. But how the effectiveness of such tactics depend on the task context is not clear. In R&D teams in the pharmaceutical industry, I investigated the effects of upward lobbying on knowledge acquisition in contexts involving different kinds of knowledge and with varying levels of inter-group competition. In contexts of high competition, upward lobbying was positively associated with acquisition of codified knowledge, but it had no effect on non-codified knowledge. In contexts of low competition, upward lobbying was negatively associated with acquisition of non-codified knowledge, and had no effect on codified knowledge. Furthermore, I found that acquisition of both codified and non-codified knowledge was positively associated with performance. The findings highlight the importance of context in understanding how political behavior can help, or hurt, knowledge acquisition and performance in organizations.",,Competition; Information management; Knowledge acquisition; Mergers and acquisitions; In contexts; Inter-group; Knowledge-sharing; Performance effect; Pharmaceutical industry; Political behaviors; Team knowledge sharing; Knowledge management

Such a review is timely and relevant since e-HRM is one of the most implemented applications in organizations (Lee, 2011). The analysis of 299 articles reveals that one stream of e-HRM literature, dominated by IT-oriented scholars, investigates the essential factors to consider when implementing e-HRM technology. A second stream, dominated by organizational (and pure HRM) scholars, focuses on studying the consequences of e-HRM systems. The authors synthesize and discuss the full range of empirically studied factors, aiming to heighten awareness about the impact of e-HRM systems on management decisions and their consequences for organizations and employees. While technological factors were assumed to be most relevant for effectively automating personnel departments in the 70's and 80's, it was subsequently recognized that managing people and organizational factors was of vital importance for successful implementations. Next to positive operational consequences of e-HRM systems, relational and transformational consequences continue to gain importance. This review shows how e-HRM research is evolving from merely declaring assumptions towards enhancing the rigor of its conceptual and empirical basis.",,Decision support systems; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Academic literature; Electronic human resource managements; Hrm systems; Management decisions; Organizational factors; Personnel department; Technological factors; Human resource management

To perform their complex tasks efficiently, team members need to develop shared mental models (SMMs), i.e. an organized understanding of the knowledge base they are sharing. However, the heterogeneity of MNT members presents a substantial challenge to SMM formation. While previous research has investigated the influence of different diversity factors on SMMs, the impact of language differences has been neglected so far. To address this important gap we investigate in depth how different elements of the language barrier impede the formation of different types of SMMs. Our findings integrate linguistic and psychological theories with management studies and complement our understanding of the antecedents of SMMs in MNTs. This is of crucial importance since SMMs have been established as important prerequisites for team performance.",,Knowledge based systems; Complex task; Diversity factors; Global operations; Knowledge base; Language barriers; Psychological theory; Shared mental model; Team performance; Cognitive systems

"XBRL Adoption and Information Asymmetry: Evidence from the Indian Capital Market","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165889556&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i7%2f170240&partnerID=40&md5=80910e60d682294ea80b32d2071b3a10","Purpose: The study was conducted in the context of the Indian capital market to find out the effect of adopting XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) on the reduction of information asymmetry and the impact of XBRL on the trading volume of the market. Methodology: In the current study, trading volume has been taken as the proxy variable to study the impact of XBRL adoption on information asymmetry. The study focused on the pre-and post-adoption XBRL effect on information asymmetry, followed by the influence of the implementation of XBRL, which is measured by taking the trading volume of the Indian capital market as a proxy variable. Data for 270 listed firms were collected for this research during a 20-year period, from 2001–2020, including 11 years before the implementation of XBRL and 9 years after it. Findings: There is a significant difference in the information asymmetry pre-and post-adoption of XBRL by Indian listed firms. A strong positive and significant relationship has been found between XBRL and the trading volume of the Indian capital market due to a reduction in information asymmetry. Practical Implications: Listed companies might increase investments by offering their stakeholders XBRL-enabled software and services. Regulatory authorities can also enable companies to disclose reports that are useful to decision-making stakeholders according to the XBRL taxonomy. The adoption of XBRL helps reduce information asymmetry, increase companies’ valuation, and lower the cost of capital. Originality: This study contributes to the financial reporting and Indian capital markets fields. This study contributes to the literature by identifying the impact on Indian capital markets post-adoption of XBRL. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

"Optimism and Self-Control: Complementary Predictors of Financial Risk-Taking Propensity Among Working Adults","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165926385&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i7%2f170966&partnerID=40&md5=f2434eabd55118090bca9c1cc4d67a2f","Purpose: The article aimed to investigate the complementary strength of two behavioral traits, namely, optimism and self-control, on the financial risk-taking propensity of working adults in India. In addition, the moderating effect of gender on the relationship of optimism and self-control with financial risk-taking propensity was examined. Methodology: The study adopted a cross-sectional-based survey approach with a sample consisting of 522 individuals of age 18 and above with diverse demographic characteristics. Purposive and convenience sampling techniques were employed for collecting data through a self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the study’s hypotheses using the IBM AMOS software. Findings: The results revealed a positive association between optimism and financial risk-taking, while self-control showed a negative association. Further, the relationship between optimism and risk-taking propensity was moderated by gender, and this relationship was more pronounced among females. The study also revealed a contradictory finding which showed greater levels of optimism among females compared to males as opposed to prior research findings. Practical Implications: The study finds its importance among academicians who want to explore the complementary strengths of optimism and self-control in various other decision-making contexts. Financial service providers can look into the behavioral traits of optimism and self-control of their clients while assisting them in making financial decisions. Originality: The present study is unique as optimism and self-control as complementary predictors of the financial risk-taking propensity of working individuals have not been explored in the Indian context. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/Methodology: The paper used event study methodology to analyze abnormal returns on stocks and credit rating changes of firms following the lockdown to understand the impact on the debt servicing of firms. Findings: The paper found a heterogeneous impact of lockdown on various industries. Pharmaceuticals, chemicals, FMCGs, and telecom sectors saw positive abnormal returns, while textiles, financial services, construction, services, cement, and automobile sectors were the worst affected. The paper also found that smaller companies were more susceptible to the effects of such lockdowns. Indian subsidiaries of foreign MNCs and Central Government-owned firms fared better than privately-owned domestic firms. The debt servicing ability of firms was unimpacted due to the debt relief package announced to mitigate the impact of the lockdown. Practical Implications: The paper's findings have implications for investors and managers who can make informed decisions in advance to reduce the risk to their investment if such a black swan event is expected. The paper's findings could help policymakers identify sectors that require immediate support due to the disruption from such an event. Originality: The paper is unique in investigating the impact of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on companies across different industries, with different ownership groups and sizes.

"Evaluation of Nexus Between Short-Run Return Measures of IPOs in India","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158814668&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i4%2f172696&partnerID=40&md5=cb6d6952aa36d11a307e8fd6f8bfa6bd","Purpose: This study aimed to provide a better understanding of the initial performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the day of listing by separating the gains on the listing day into primary and secondary market returns. An industry-wise evaluation of different return measures was done, and a year-on-year analysis was also conducted to understand more about the underpricing anomaly of IPOs. Methodology: The short-run IPO performance was analyzed using market-adjusted average returns (MAAR), focusing on the role of different factors in determining underpricing. The initial returns were divided into primary and secondary returns, and a sectoral analysis was conducted to evaluate the behavior of IPOs on the first day of trading. The quantitative analysis considered the returns from the issue date to the listing day opening price and compared the listing day opening and closing prices of all sample IPOs. Findings: The sectoral analysis revealed a reversal of the level of underpricing during the secondary market, which explains the listing day performance of IPOs under different industries over the last decade. According to the findings of this study, the subscription rate is a major determinant of short-run IPO performance. Practical Implications: To improve the short-run performance of IPOs, issuers should focus on increasing their subscription rates. This study recommended that corporations should publish credible, accurate, and adequate information and invite active participation from shareholders. Originality: Unlike prior research on IPOs, this study separated listing day gains into primary and secondary market returns, carried out an industry-wise evaluation of different return measures, and analyzed IPO behavior on the first day of trading to provide improved insights into the underpricing anomaly of IPOs. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The study investigated this relationship for financial services firms in India. Based on the literature review, four attributes of corporate governance were chosen: Ownership concentration, institutional ownership, board independence, and CEO duality. Tobin’s Q value was taken as a proxy for firm value. The dataset consisted of 20 companies forming part of the National Stock Exchange financial services index. An additional two control variables are included in the model: The firm’s size and leverage ratio. All data were sourced from the annual reports of the companies, and the period of study is from 2016–2020. The panel data were analyzed using the generalized method of moments. The empirical findings revealed a positive and significant impact of ownership concentration, institutional ownership, and board independence on firm value, while the CEO duality role had no impact on firm value.

This paper used content analysis to quantify the CSR performance of financial companies. Financial institutions loan money to businesses utilizing assets owned by saving bank account holders, thereby heightening their societal responsibility. Methodology: Data from 63 financial companies listed on the National Stock Exchange from 2014–2015 to 2020–2021 were considered. Cronbach’s alpha, descriptive statistics, and z-score test were used in this research to check the reliability and normality of the CSR scores. Findings: The results showed that private sector banks proactively participated in social activities compared to public sector banks (PSB) and non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs). Scores of CSR improved during the study period. Practical Implications: The study will allow future research because every issue and factor considered in the scale needs attention to benefit humankind’s future generations. Calculated CSR scores could be used to measure the impact on the financial performance of companies.

This study looked at the performance and short-term debt ratio of the Indian manufacturing and services industries independently, attempting to diagnose the varied effects of COVID-19 regulations. The study also looked into the variations caused by exogenous shocks in the factors determining the short-term debt ratio. Methodology: The study used linear panel data methods and the quarterly panel data of 4,536 enterprises from 2008–2009 to 2021–2022 to achieve its goals. The binary variables techniques were used to study the crisis period. Findings: The results corroborate the notion that the crisis negatively and unevenly impacted Indian industries. For example, the performance of manufacturing companies fell to 69%, while the services sector saw a decline of up to 91%. Similar to how the short-term debt ratio decreased dramatically during the pandemic, the manufacturing sector saw a slight decline, or 0.0204, and the services sector saw a reduction, or 0.0244. The study also noted significant deviations in the determinants of short-term debt ratio; for instance, profit, size, and liquidity were the prime determinants of short-term debt ratio in manufacturing firms. At the same time, liquidity was the sole determinant of the short-term debt ratio for a service sector firm. Theoretical, Managerial, and Practical Implications: The results indicated that the Indian firms were operating sub-optimally because of the demand and market and supply shocks during the COVID-19 period. However, the accessibility and easiness of the financing could help firms to work efficiently. Originality: The biggest upheaval the companies have experienced is the COVID-19 problem. For the businesses, which are the vital sector of the economy, to continue operating throughout the recession, government assistance was necessary. The governments, however, had difficulty determining which areas ought to be prioritized for assistance in order to distribute the scarce resources at their disposal. Thus, it was intended for this study to report on the crucial areas of the companies for successful government interventions. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Data were collected from 205 respondents using a structured 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. The data were coded and analyzed using descriptive statistics, SPSS, and AMOS statistical software. The main finding was that relationship quality influenced service delivery performance from the management’s perspective. The composite relationship quality variables (cooperation, trust, commitment, and satisfaction) significantly influenced the relationship quality. The implication is that the quality of the relational interactions between the municipalities and their suppliers significantly impacted the quality-of-service delivery performance. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Methodology: Fourteen studies were systematically reviewed, and special attention was paid to the policy implications they suggested. The study also used data from secondary sources to unravel the trends of various fiscal indicators of the Indian economy for the period from 1982–1983 to 2020–2021. Furthermore, unit root and Johansen’s co-integration tests were employed to assess public debt sustainability. Findings: The review of studies revealed the significance of the policies aimed at reduction in debt servicing and expenditure, debt restructuring, maintenance of a rainy day fund, and market-financed public investment plan. The combined government finances depicted that the government’s fiscal position was unhealthy even before the pandemic, further aggravated by the latter. Practical Implications: The present research provided valuable insights for the policymakers and the government to manage the fiscal health of the economy through various policy measures, namely, judicious resource utilization, structural changes in revenue and expenditure policies, and a flexible fiscal framework.

With this evidence, the purpose of this study was to verify whether there existed an extreme productivity growth and a spillover effect in Vietnam by spatial econometric tests to survey data and remote sensing data. The I-Moran test results showed a close relationship between the light density at night, industrial density, enterprise efficiency, and labor quality. Furthermore, the I-Moran test provided evidence that productivity spills existed among several firms.

Methodology: For the selected fund’s net asset values (NAV), Australian 10-year bond yield and ASX index points were collated. Subsequently, the NAV returns were regressed against the market premium and quadratic factors (as independent variables) of the TM and Henrikson–Merton (HM) models, respectively. The coefficients of these independent variables were tested for their statistical significance. Based on the p-values and positive or negative values of these coefficients, the presence or absence of market timing abilities of fund managers was identified. Findings: The findings indicated the absence of market timing in most funds during the COVID-19 period based on the market timing models, which were developed by TM and HM models. Practical Implications: The study enabled investors to make a rational decision in regard to investing in mutual funds during abnormal times. It also provided insights to fund managers in regard to their portfolio decisions during such abnormal market times.

Design: It entailed the comparison of pre-IPO and post-IPO performance for 3 years by employing data from 95 IPO firms getting listed on the main board segment of NSE and BSE in India between April 2012 and March 2018. Methodology: The methodology consisted of both univariate and multivariate data analysis techniques. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether underpricing and subscription levels determined IPO firms’ post-issue long-run operating performance. Findings: The study suggested that operating performance dropped significantly while financial health improved post-IPO. Both oversubscription and underpricing were not predicting factors of change in performance post-IPO. Rather, issue size, offer price, and post-issue promoter holding significantly and negatively impacted the change in performance; whereas, age positively and significantly determined the change in performance after the IPOs.

The paper’s objective was to critically review published research on the antecedents of non-transactional customer engagement behaviors (CEBs), such as relationship quality, emotions, customer empowerment, and the influence of the CEBs on customer loyalty and advocacy in the financial services industry. Relevant online databases were comprehensively searched through Boolean search, reviewed critically, and synthesized narratively. The guidelines of PICO (participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes) were followed. The final results indicated that an empowered, satisfied, highly pre-dispositional customer possessing different affective states and trust reciprocated positive engagement behaviors (CEBs). The positive CEBs build attitudinal loyalty and advocacy behaviors that create value in the long term.

Methodology: The study employed the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC) model to measure volatility spillover among the sectoral indices with asymmetric effects to assess the impact of bad news. The study further calculated the time-varying conditional correlation. Findings: The empirical analysis indicated short-run and long-run volatility persistence among sectoral indices of the Indian capital market. Furthermore, the results also showed the significant effect of bad news on the volatility of the sectoral indices. The time-varying conditional correlation suggested a high correlation among the sectoral indices during COVID-19. So, there was only a limited opportunity for portfolio diversification among these sectors during the crisis period. Practical Implications: The findings may assist financial advisors in assessing the relationship among sectors of the Indian capital market during the crisis period. While constructing the equity investment portfolio during the crisis period, financial managers must wait for the market to stabilize before determining whether sector diversification is appropriate or required.

"Evaluating the Efficiency of the Global Cryptocurrency Market","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177673941&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i11%2f173325&partnerID=40&md5=f31256c371824bf3600a104b87331b67","Purpose: This study focused on evaluating the efficiency of the global cryptocurrency market under the efficient market hypothesis. Methodology: The study explored the presence of calendar effects in the form of the day-of-the-week and the weekend effect in the top 25 global cryptocurrencies and a constructed index using autocorrelation corrected ARCH family models on the log-returns of prices. Non-normality is tackled through the use of a non-parametric bootstrapped approach in addition to parametric estimation. Additionally, rolling window regression is employed as a dynamic framework. Findings: The findings of this study showed the presence of calendar effects in terms of higher returns for certain days over others, thereby concluding that the global cryptocurrency market as a whole was not efficient. Practical Implications: As a result of its informational inadequacies, it was implied that cryptocurrency markets were not even efficient in the weak form. This had practical implications for investors, whose aggressive search and trading tactics appear warranted in the context of market anomalies, as well as other market players, like regulators attempting to comprehend the structure of the cryptocurrency market from an efficiency standpoint and researchers attempting to investigate the efficiency-related behavior and psychology of crypto markets. Originality: This study is exceptional in that it uses a sample of cryptocurrencies that objectively covers the larger global cryptocurrency markets over the most extended amount of time possible, making it unique both for the participants in the crypto markets and for its contribution to the literature on market efficiency. The study employed an evolutionary methodology, taking into account the time-varying behavior of financial assets. As far as we can tell, this is one of the first studies to use this methodology and model formulation. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

A lot of researchers have tried to develop different models with different accuracies of prediction over the years. It appears that the full potential of deep learning has not been explored to study FX rates. The current study, therefore, explored the proficiency of deep neural networks in predictive modeling. I tested different models of artificial neural networks (using hyperparameters-(tm) tuning like training algorithms, number of hidden layers, and hidden nodes) using neural network input-output fitting and tried to find the best fit model. The model was also validated by layered digital dynamic time series modeling using autoregression with two delays. The appraisal metrics used were regression R - value, MSE, time-series response plot, and error autocorrelation plot. It was concluded that the artificial neural network with a single hidden layer having 17 nodes and trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm gave the best performance in a minimum number of iterations. This study marks an extensive examination of ANN modeling. This model can be used by traders, investors, financiers, economists, bankers, speculators, hedgers, and governments to get insights into future forex rates and thus make profitable decisions. Various trading policies, import-export policies, and pricing of commodities in indigenous markets can be managed precisely. Future studies can use these models in simulated trading and help establish an alliance between statistical significance and economic significance. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Methodology: For the research, the paper used panel regression methodologies on 147 MSMEs of the most critical production and manufacturing industries from 2012–2021. Findings: Several firm-specific variables, including leverage, tangibility, firm size, profitability, human capital, asset turnover ratio, and firm growth, were found to have a significant effect on working capital management efficiency (WCE); whereas, the age of the firm and salary expenses were found to have an insignificant impact on working capital management efficiency. Practical Implications: The study results will facilitate stakeholders to make informed decisions for maintaining the liquidity scenario of the MSMEs by identifying the factors most important for small businesses in Rajasthan. The state can also frame policies concerning the management of the short-term financial position of small businesses. Originality: Unlike prior research on working capital, the current work explores WCM efficiency comprehensively by including organization factors in Rajasthan manufacturing MSMEs by utilizing two efficiency metrics, that is, the cash conversion cycle (CCC) and cash conversion efficiency (CCE), which have not been studied earlier, especially in the context of Rajasthan. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Methodology: Using economic indicators and official sources, we conducted a generalizing assessment of the fundamental models and ideas of taxation of transactions involving digital products and services generated within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development scope. The practical value of these models and ideas used to strengthen the Russian tax system was proved based on their findings. Findings: As a result of an analysis of international standards and rules relating to the taxation of transactions involving digital goods and services, the main principles and algorithms were identified, the use of which at the national level allows for the rapid modernization of the taxation system and adaptation to the challenges of the new (digital) economy. Practical Implications: Taking into account the dynamics of the expansion of the use of digital products not only in business but also in public administration, a practically realizable potential for the application of previously developed international rules in modern conditions was identified, in particular, the possibility of remote interaction between tax authorities and taxpayers. Originality: The paper’s novelty lies in substantiating the possibility of practical application of the basic principles and models of taxation of services in electronic form developed at the international level in states with significant differences in economic development and tax systems. The work’s practical significance lay in identifying the importance of international standards and principles of taxation of electronic services for the development of national rules and creating conditions that impede the development of new forms of economic activity, as well as formulating recommendations for the practical application and improvement of the rules for taxation of electronic services. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/Methodology: Ruchi Soya Industries Limited, an Indian listed firm that went into bankruptcy in 2018, was identified for back-testing and evaluating the predictive ability of four models: three accounting-based (Altman Z-score, Altman’s emerging market score, and Zmijewski) and the market-based KMV model. In the second stage of analysis, the operating and financial performance of the company was evaluated for pre-bankruptcy and post-acquisition by Patanjali Foods using t-tests on financial parameters of solvency, profitability, and efficiency. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that while all the models were accurate in predicting default accurately for up to 1 year before bankruptcy, they failed to do so accurately beyond that. The predictive ability of the models was highest for the KMV model, followed by Zmijewski and Altman's Z-score. The performance of the firm improved significantly post-acquisition on profitability and solvency parameters. Practical Implications: According to the findings of this research, credit risk models are accurate at predicting financial trouble and bankruptcy up to 1 year in advance. These findings can be used for credit appraisal by lenders to assess any financial trouble and enable effective risk management. These models can also be used to avoid business failure to develop proactive and preventive financial and managerial decisions. The impact on performance parameters post-acquisition can help consultants and advisors evaluate the restructuring process to see whether there has been value creation post-restructuring. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors affecting contingent liabilities in the public sector, using the audited financial statements of four national government departments in South Africa as the data set. The four departments are Education, Correctional Services, South African Police Services, and Health. Data from 12 years, 2007/8 to 2018/19, for each department were analyzed. The paper applied a quantitative approach using positive accounting theory to explain accounting practices on the effects of litigation claims and intergovernmental payables on the departments’ contingent liabilities. In addition, a Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate factors affecting the contingent liabilities of litigation claims (LC) and interdepartmental payables (IP). The study results indicated a statistically significant positive relationship between litigation claims and interdepartmental payables. The results further confirmed that both variables significantly impacted the growth of contingent liabilities in the public sector. The benefit of this study is that determining the escalation and quantum of contingent liabilities may encourage government departments to implement policies that promote efficient management and accounting practices to contain and eventually reduce contingent liabilities accounts’ transactions. Achieving this will significantly reduce government departments’ unproductive cash outflows, measured in millions of rands annually. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Our objective of this review was to present the academic researchers’ perspectives on the fastest-growing preferred investment avenue of the Indian financial system. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study adopted a systematic review approach and selected two verticals of academic research; the first one in the form of doctoral dissertations, and the other is the research articles published in academic journals. Doctoral dissertations between 2000 - 2022 were extracted from Shodhganga (the digital repository of the University Grants Commission), and research articles were extracted from the Scopus database. Findings: A comprehensive review conclusion was drawn from this study, which concluded that the IMFI is growing exponentially in T30 and B30 cities (T30 and B30 cities are geographical segmentations made by SEBI and AMFI based on AUM, T30 means top 30 Indian cities contributing maximum AUM and B30 are beyond T30 cities). We reviewed 374 doctoral dissertations for this study; 83 dissertations were submitted during the first decade of the 20th century. State-level universities have produced a higher number of dissertations than central and deemed universities. Based on the dissertations’ titles, we classified dissertations into four categories of themes. The first theme is the marketing mechanism used by mutual funds to promote their mutual fund schemes, where we found the minimum number of theses; the comparative study is the second theme; here, we found that the comparison was made at various levels. The third and most interesting theme is investors’ perspectives on mutual fund investments. The maximum number of doctoral dissertations was carried out on the theme of performance evaluation. In the second vertical, we extracted 69 research articles published in 13 journals, and finally, 10 articles with a minimum of five citations were reviewed. We found no correlation between the research papers published in the Scopus database to the completed dissertations. Practical Implications: The probable stakeholders of this study are future academic researchers in the same field. For them, this study is a systematic framework that can provide a basis for future research gap analysis. Academic institutions are another stakeholder; the important stakeholder is IMFI, where institutional policymakers can formulate strategies for their future mutual fund schemes. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper employed the nonparametric model of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess performance using the shortage function as the measure of performance. Three higher-order moment parameters were included in the model: skewness and kurtosis. Findings: The results showed that in contrast to the traditional mean–variance selection model, the measures of skewness and kurtosis did not lead to better performance during the COVID-19 pandemic despite the substantial departure from normalcy in asset returns. Additionally, the results showed that the sector rankings aligned with investor expectations regarding the economic activity sectors in high demand or less demand during the pandemic period in the American, French, and Moroccan markets. Practical Implications: The study’s conclusions suggested that, rather than considering higher-order moments, investors and portfolio managers would find it advantageous to concentrate their investing strategy on return and risk considerations during an unexpected market crisis. It didn’t seem that taking skewness and kurtosis measurements into account enhanced portfolio performance.

Against this backdrop, this study investigated the role of liquidity and credit risk on CCS. Methodology: The study applied three models using a battery of 392 active corporate bonds in India: pooled OLS, fixed effect, and IV-GMM. Data for the research were collected from Bloomberg and analyzed using Stata. Findings: First, while credit risk did have a role in determining CCS, liquidity holds greater significance as a determining factor. Specifically, there was a 0.9560427 basis point increase in CCS for every basis point increase in bid-ask spread (liquidity). In contrast, CCS increased by 0.3460369 for every basis point increase in credit risk. Second, a negative coefficient for the interaction term between bid-ask spread and credit risk suggested that credit risk was a moderating variable that weakened the relationship between bid-ask spread and CCS. Practical Implications: The managers should augment their risk management practices to manage liquidity risk better and maintain a higher credit quality to reduce the negative impact of liquidity risk on CCS. Moreover, the findings affirmed that the better the firm’s credibility, the lesser the CCS would be, implying that firms should try to improve their credit ratings. Originality: The results remained consistent across various regression models, and they held significant implications for the literature concerning the modeling of corporate bond prices. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

"Financial Contagion in European Equity Markets: Evidence from the US Subprime and the Eurozone Crises","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148942536&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2022%2fv16i8%2f171372&partnerID=40&md5=fd5111699b67e98bf38094381a54153d","The study explored the financial contagion between the five European stock markets (Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Spain) and the impact of the US subprime crisis and Eurozone crisis on it by employing multivariate DCC-GARCH methodology. The dynamic conditional correlation coefficient between Germany and other European markets was statistically significant for the period under review. The rise in the value of the conditional correlation coefficient was more evident during the US subprime crisis period, which signified the impact of this crisis on the financial interdependence of the European stock markets. But not much influence of the Eurozone crisis was observed on the dispersion of returns for all the markets, which was an important finding. The mechanism of rolling regression also corroborated these results. The study also validated the presence of financial contagion between the stock markets (except the Netherlands) during the US subprime crisis period. In contrast, the effect of the Eurozone crisis on financial contagion was significant only for Spain and Belgium. Further, the strength of financial contagion was highest for the stock market of Spain, followed by Belgium, and the least for the Netherlands. The timid reaction of the stock market of the Netherlands reflected that it could be a good choice for portfolio diversification during periods of crisis for investors. Further, governments and other regulators can learn from these findings and formulate appropriate policies to absorb the financial shocks coming from foreign markets, especially during the crisis period. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This incentivized numerous financial institutions and banks to offer e-wallets to their clientele, facilitating digital financial transactions. Given the importance of assessing e-wallet literacy, a carefully designed and thoroughly examined scale is needed. This study aimed to create and provide a fully validated and tested scale for assessing the literacy levels of e-wallet users. Methodology: This study created and validated the scale using the scientific and statistical procedures for scale development. Stakeholders, including academics, researchers, and e-wallet users (656), participated in this study at different phases. To create and validate the e-wallet literacy measure, the study employed panel interviews, primary data gathering, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis (using AMOS). Findings: Credit payment transactions (CPT), bill payment transactions (BTT), investment transactions (IT), money transfer transactions (FTT), purchase transactions (PT), and method of payment (MOP) are the six components that the study revealed, which can be used to quantify e-wallet literacy. With 26 scale items, these six constructs were created. Practical Implications: The measure can be employed by e-wallet service providers to evaluate the degree of e-wallet proficiency within their intended customer base. Campaigns to raise consumer awareness can be tailored to these literacy levels to promote more use of e-wallets. Government authorities and policymakers acknowledged E-wallets as essential tools for achieving financial inclusion. Originality: Unlike prior research on e-wallets, the current work constructed a scale to examine the literacy levels of users concerning e-wallets. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

"Evaluation of Pooled Cross-Sectional Earnings Forecasting Models: An Indian Evidence","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174627516&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i8%2f173008&partnerID=40&md5=a0b5a60bb6fca9238e5bda1b1a3ddd9c","Purpose : Earnings forecasts are essential for valuation, and a bleak coverage of analysts’ forecasts in emerging economies withholds the valuation research and practices. This study compared the pooled cross-sectional earnings forecasting models in the Indian market to choose alternative sources for earnings forecasts to solve the unavailability of analysts’ earnings forecasts. Specifically, evaluating the theoretical earnings forecasting models of three different propositions: the earnings persistence (Li & Mohanram, 2014, EP) model, the Hou, Van Dijk, and Zhang (2012, HVZ) model, and the Pope and Wang (Harris & Wang, 2019, PW) model. Methodology : This study considered all companies listed on NSE from 1995 – 2022 in an unbalanced panel structure with 36,591 firm years observations. Robust regression was used for the coefficient estimation because of its capability to handle outliers and provide a better model fit. Findings : The results showed that the pooled cross-sectional models are reasonably accurate with the Indian data, restricting average forecast errors between 3% to 10%. The coefficient of earnings greater than one across models signified a high persistence in earnings. The PW model outperformed the other two models in the short run with share prices as predictor variables; whereas, the EP model performed best in the long run. The PW and EP forecast offered incremental information fully encompassing the HVZ forecast. Practical Implications : This study elevated the application of valuation in theories in research and managerial practices where firms’ earnings forecasts are an essential input. Originality : This study uniquely compared the earning forecasting models of three proportions in a single setup to validate and suggest sources of earnings forecast for the Indian capital market. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Investors are recognizing that companies that prioritize ESG factors in their operations are more likely to be sustainable and resilient in the long term. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the ESG-responsible firms are performing better than the other firms in the pre-COVID and during the COVID periods. The paper also tried to investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases on the index movement. Methodology: The study employed the descriptive analysis on the financial data of NSE NIFTY 500 and NIFTY 100 Enhanced ESG index. The EGARCH model was applied to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on the volatility of the NIFTY 100 Enhanced ESG index. Findings: The results showed that there was no leverage effect in the ESG index in both periods. That means that the ESG Index can act as a cushion during the pandemic period. The ESG Index outperformed the conventional market index, thus acting as a COVID-19 safe asset class. This gives an opportunity to investors and fund managers to diversify their risk by acting sustainably responsible for society. Practical Implications: This study compared the performance of ESG-indexed firms with that of other firms in the pre-COVID and during COVID time period to check whether there was any difference between them. This study provided empirical evidence for practitioners, policymakers, and academicians in support of ESG investment as it showed that the ESG Index performed better than the conventional index during the COVID period. Originality: This study used secondary data to study the performance of the EGS firms in the pre and during COVID period in order to compare with the other firms. In the context of India, this study may be the first one to compare the performance of the ESG firms with the normal firms in the pre and during the COVID period. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

However, after a decade of inception, such institutions’ financial viability and survival became questionable, which posed a serious concern for policymakers. As a result, the Government of India and its regulators initiated various policies in the late 1990s to make these institutions financially viable and self-sustainable in the long run. These policy interventions have successfully transformed the financial health of RRBs to some extent. However, in this process, it was widely discussed that the RRBs were moving away from their original mandate. However, no detailed study has been published so far to investigate this dimension. This paper tried to bridge this gap by exploring the performance of RRBs with respect to the objectives for which they were incorporated through evidence based on data. This is the first study that provides a comparison of the performance of RRBs with other banks at the service area level. The study observed that RRBs have remained true to their original mandate and are still doing relatively better in comparison to other commercial banks in their area of operation. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Further research has evaluated some variables primarily responsible for oversubscribing the initial public offerings (IPO) of small & medium enterprises (SMEs). The study analyzed the cross-sectional data of 431 SME initial public offerings issued from February 2012 to January 2020 and listed on NSE EMERGE and BSE SME platforms. The econometric techniques of OLS (ordinary least square) and quantile regression model were applied to test the study’s hypotheses. According to the findings, the independent variables such as issue size, issue price, pricing mechanism, and the listing delay had a negative effect. In contrast, the independent variables: firm size and under-pricing positively influenced the SME IPOs’ oversubscription in the sample period under study. The current study provided a few implications for the investors, advisors, and regulators operating in the stock market. For the investors, the study suggested certain essential factors to consider while buying SME IPOs. For the regulator, that is, SEBI, the study provided insights for framing guidelines and amendments to regulate the SME IPOs in the future. Further, the research also suggested the issuers (SMEs) should issue their IPOs when the buyers of the IPOs are driven to invest in the primary market with the objective of optimization of returns with potential growth in the future.

Using Discretionary Accruals as a proxy for audit quality, the study took the data of all the companies listed on the NSE for 11 financial years, from 2009 – 2019 (totaling 8,171 firm-year observations). It deployed panel data regression with a random-effects model. The results showed that audit quality improved up to specific auditors’ tenure, particularly with the IFRS compliance and Big 4 auditors. The higher audit fee is positively significantly associated with lower earnings quality. The study suggested that mandatory auditor rotation might provide the full benefit only along with other regulations on IFRS, auditor reputation, and audit fee. The study provided an impetus to the regulators, audit fraternity, and companies to improve the relevance of financial statements. This is one of the first longitudinal studies examining the interaction effects of different audit regulations.

The objective of this study was to find out the significant determinants of CSR disclosure using financial and non-financial variables. Methodology: Data sources used included annual reports, CSR reports, the company website, and other available public sources. Fixed-effect regression was applied to 708 data observations for the period from 2014–2015 to 2019–2020. The study has developed a total of four regression models for individually testing the influence of promoters’ ownership, institutional ownership, company popularity, and innovation on CSR disclosure. Findings: The findings of this study reported that firm size, firm age, and leverage (gearing) are strong determinants that positively influence CSR reporting. Apart from that, ownership of promoters showed a weak negative effect on CSR disclosure of Indian firms, but profitability does not appear to have any impact on CSR score. However, institutional ownership and innovation are not significant determinants of CSR disclosure. Practical Implications: Larger firms are more accountable and hold a prominent place in society and the community as a whole, therefore, they are supposed to disclose greater CSR information. Furthermore, Indian companies with greater promoter ownership stakes make lesser CSR reporting due to lower information asymmetry and agency conflicts. Originality: The present research on factors affecting CSR, which is under-researched in India, has offered an extensive range of variables by developing advanced regression models. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The analysis was based on balanced panel data over the period from 2010 – 11 to 2020 – 21 for 10 public and private sector banks, using a hierarchical multiple regression approach. The study investigated the three aspects of financial performance, namely return on assets, return on equity, and Tobin’s Q ratio. Based on previous studies, a conceptual model was developed by taking the financial performance of banks as a dependent variable, corporate governance attributes as independent variables, and age, size, growth, and financial leverage as control variables. Content analysis was applied to derive the Corporate Governance Index. The findings for accounting-based measures revealed that board attendance had a positive and significant impact on ROA and ROE of banks, while board expertise and CEO duality had a negative and significant impact on ROA and ROE. Moreover, board gender diversity had a positive and significant impact on ROE, and board committees had a negative and significant impact on ROE. A study for market-based measures found that board meetings had a positive and significant impact on TQR, whilst board committees and board expertise had a negative and significant impact on TQR.

As the country’s e-commerce has been experiencing phenomenal growth, to assess the impact of social media on the same, we designed a questionnaire to assess five criteria based on relevant studies and collected data from 356 respondents in the positions of Head and Deputy of sales, marketing, and customer services departments of 80 typical and small and medium e-commerce enterprises. The results showed that Vietnamese enterprises did not know how to use the loyal customer community to influence potential customers on social networks and leverage the intelligence and creativity of customers for business operations. In addition, most Vietnamese enterprises spent a large sum of money on social networking activities but had low interaction because they often used too much text and very little visual content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempted to identify the criteria for assessing the impact of social media on the online businesses of Vietnamese enterprises.

Methodology: The study employed the Markov-switching dynamic regression model as a regime-switching methodology to investigate the nonlinear response of fuel price returns to monetary policy. The study considered monthly oil and natural gas prices from January 2005 to July 2019. The monthly call money rates and forward premia from January 2005 to July 2019 were extracted from the RBI database. The final data sample consisted of 175 monthly observations. The study used Stata statistical software for data analysis. Findings: The gasoline returns showed a noteworthy correlation between call money rates and forward premia. However, according to the model fitting tests, monetary policy variables only seemed to impact oil price returns during a crisis. In the same way, for natural gas, the present return was only affected by the lag return when things were calm. Additionally, fuel returns persist longer during a crisis, a sign of increased use and a dearth of substitutes for the good. Practical Implications: The study’s conclusions have policy ramifications for monetary policy instruments like forwarding premia and calling money that can be used to influence the price of oil. Government and regulatory agencies may consider substituting natural gas for fossil fuels in the entire fuel mix, making it more environment friendly.

Specifically, the study examined the relationship between municipal services and financial performances in the three metropolitan municipalities in the Gauteng province of South Africa using secondary and primary data from a survey conducted in 2019. The study is based on the theory of social contract. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative techniques to examine the level of public satisfaction on municipal services delivered to the urban residents in the study areas. Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews and the annual financial statements from the three metropolitan municipalities in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The results from financial ratio indicators confirmed that the metropolitan municipalities were in a good financial position. However, the findings from financial ratio analysis should be used with utmost caution due to the major limitations and drawbacks associated with such financial measures. The content analysis in the study revealed that the demand for basic municipal services would remain high, costly, with severe backlogs, insufficient, and often with unresponsive management practices in the study areas. Moreover, the lack of entrepreneurial, innovative, and problem-solving skills and expertise among municipal managers compromised the provision of basic municipal services, and the residents remained unsatisfied in the three metropolitan municipalities of Gauteng Province.

This case focused on the functioning and various challenges faced by a hypothetical private sector bank, that is, Indian Sterling Bank, on account of overexposure to a specific industry. It highlighted the importance of risk assessment and continuous learning in managing risks. Findings: Banks are exposed to various types of risk like credit, market, operational, liquidity, and earning risk, to name a few. Overexposure to a particular sector exposed a bank to concentration risk. Any adverse conditions like demand fluctuation, policy changes, and changes in customer preferences affect the earnings and, ultimately, the viability of an industry. This, in turn, affects the banks which have taken exposure to that industry. Practical Implications: Banks are exposed to various types of risks, which could impact not only their earnings but also their survival. This case study highlighted the importance of proactive risk management and the potential consequences of excessive concentration in a specific sector. The identification of concentration risk within the technology sector for Indian Sterling Bank underscored the critical importance of proactive risk management strategies. Banks should continuously monitor industry trends, economic indicators, and regulatory developments to anticipate potential risks. Implementing stringent risk assessment practices, stress testing, and scenario analysis would enable the bank to effectively identify, assess, and manage concentration risk, ensuring sustained financial stability and safeguarding against adverse sector-related events.

Corporate governance and ownership structure have a direct influence on firm performance. This research paper examined the relationship among three variables: CG, ownership structure, and firm performance. Methodology: CG mechanisms included board independence, CEO duality, and audit committee independence. Insider ownership and foreign ownership determined ownership structure. Return on assets and return on equity were used to assess a company's performance, and Tobin's Q was used to assess market performance. A sample of 50 NSE-listed firms was taken. STATA 14.1 was used for analysis, and multiple and hierarchical regression were used. Findings: The findings indicated that CG variables and ownership structure positively affected firm performance. To elaborate, CEO duality, audit committee independence, insider ownership, and foreign ownership were positively related to firm performance. However, board independence was the only variable that influenced firm performance negatively. Practical Implications: One of the study’s essential findings was the negative impact of board independence on firm performance. This had some practical implications because only a few persons are qualified to act as independent directors.Hence, one person is appointed in many companies simultaneously, leading to biased decision-making. Thus, companies must ensure that independent directors are appointed after proper screening and deliver their duties as expected.

Methodology: The independent variables of CFP, namely return on sales, return on asset, return on capital employed, return on equity, and Tobin’s Q and the variables of CSP ESG Score, environmental, social, and governance score individually and control variables firm age and net worth were considered. Causality and influence between CFP and CSP and vice-versa were tested through Grangular causality and panel data regression analysis, respectively, using E-views12. Secondary data were drawn from Integrated Annual Reports of the NSE-rated 27 top disclosure IT & ITeS companies selected on census sampling. Findings: It was demonstrated that there was a bidirectional correlation between ESG and social and governance and unidirectional causality between Tobin’s Q and ESG, ESG to net worth, and ESG to return on sales. IT and ITeS firms support the traditional view that sustainability costs constrain financial performance. Practical Implications: It was suggested the companies consider the elements of sustainability equally to make rational, sustainable investments to augment ESG. Establishing a standard ESG framework would serve as a guide for effective implementation. Originality: The connection and causation between CFP and CSP, as well as vice versa, were examined in the current study.

In this regard, the GRI disclosure framework (non-financials) has recently attracted a lot of attention, and listed Indian companies are about to comply with this disclosure framework. Accordingly, this study attempted to gain insights into the extent to which recorded Indian companies adhere to the GRI disclosure framework. For this purpose, we captured the sustainability reports of Indian listed companies from the GRI Sustainability Disclosure Database (SDD) for a span ranging from 20 years from 2000 onwards. The results from this study indicated that of the million listed companies in India, only a few (425 companies) submitted their sustainability reports with GRI in compliance with the guidelines. However, another interesting finding is that majority of these compliant companies are long-listed and from the ESSI industry classification. As GRI disclosure compliance gives away companies’ ethical solid governance practices, it is pretty surprising that exceptionally few Indian companies choose to do so consistently. In line with the findings of this study, we discussed practical and research implications. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The study particularized how scholarship payment impacted financial behaviour and how financial behaviour affected the financial well-being of scholars. Design/Methodology/Approach: Data (N = 94) was collected by an offline survey conducted at Banasthali Vidyapith, a fully residential women’s university. By using a detailed self-structured questionnaire, primary data was obtained. From the target population of 300, the sample size of 150 scholars was taken through convenience sampling. Descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation, and linear regression were used with the aid of SPSS software to infer outcomes. Findings: This study stated that in the “Family Financial Socialization” (FFS) model, scholarship payment was not the only factor affecting research scholars’ financial behaviour. It means that they are not financially independent with scholarship payments. Furthermore, good and risky financial behaviour ensured a picture of financial well-being in life. So, in research scholars’ lives, the mostly financial role was played by their parents, and with their help, they choose to use good financial behaviour, which resulted in financial well-being in the future. Originality/Value: This kind of research is the first to examine the relationship between financial behavior and financial well-being using the scholarship payments of research scholars based on family financial socialization theory. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Further, the study analyzed the impact of external shocks like the global pandemic, in addition to various determinants of cash holdings. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study examined the financials of 38 non-financial firms listed On the National Stock Exchange’s broader market index, Nifty, for eight years from 2014 to 2021. Panel data regression methods like fixed effects, random effects, pooled OLS, and GMM were used in the analysis. Findings: The study found that cash holdings significantly affected the financial performance of companies measured by ROA but not on Tobin’s Q. Further, the global pandemic did not impact cash holdings. Also, financially unconstrained companies held more cash than financially constrained companies. Further, free cash flow, age, and capital expenditure determined cash holdings. However, dividend payment, working capital, and leverage did not show any significant impact. Results of the GMM validated the dynamic nature of cash holdings, and Indian companies took 3 years to adjust their cash holding position. Practical Implications: The study would help managers understand how factors, particularly external shocks like the global pandemic, affected firms’ cash holdings. It would also assist managers in determining the optimal cash-holding ratio of total assets to enhance a company’s value. Originality/Value: The study’s findings provided new evidence of the relationship between cash holdings and financial performance.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The current study adopted a survey method and purposive sampling technique to collect the data from 315 respondents using Google Forms. For analysis, a two-stage analysis approach was adopted. In the first stage, regression analysis was used for hypotheses testing, and in the second stage, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was adopted to validate the regression results. Findings: The impact of the neurotic trait was found to be significantly positive on short-term investment decisions and significantly negative on long-term investment decisions. Conscientiousness was found to be a positive and significant predictor of long-term investment decisions and an insignificant predictor of short-term investment decisions. Among demographical variables, education was the only variable that positively and significantly impacted short-term investment decisions. In determining the long-term investment decisions, the role of all four demographic variables was found to be insignificant. Practical Implications: This study found its relevance among retail investors as this study would assist them in knowing their personality type before making investment decisions. Originality/Value: Determining the investment behavior of Indian retail investors by debating their personality traits and demographic variances made this study novel.

The study analyzed financial data from 2000 – 2019 and employed the hierarchical linear modeling technique of regression as firms are a subset of industries. The output demonstrated that a few capital structure determinants either did not have any impact or had the same effect in both pre and post-crisis periods. However, a few determinants such as short-term liquidity, firm profitability, and Z - score had a conflicting impact on leverage in the two time periods. Determinants such as median industry tangibility, median industry leverage, industry munificence, industry liquidity, and industry dynamism had a significant impact in one period and an insignificant impact in another period. This showed that the direct effect of capital structure determinants changed when equity market and credit supply conditions varied. We showed that industry-level factors moderated the relationship between leverage and firm-level factors. Further, it was exhibited how economic conditions affected not just the direct influences of firm and industry level factors but also the indirect influences of industry-level factors.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the internal and macro factors affecting Vietnamese commercial banks’ capital adequacy from 2007-2018. Applying the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimator, our results showed that return on equity (ROE) and bank size (SIZE) had the significantly opposite impact on Vietnamese banks’ capital adequacy. However, return on assets (ROA), customer deposits (DEP), credit risk (CR), and liquidity (LIQ) had similar direction effects and were statistically significant on banks’ capital adequacy. For the macroeconomic factors, the inflation rate positively impacted the capital adequacy of Vietnamese commercial banks. Besides, our results revealed that Vietnamese commercial banks need to control internal factors and improve their performance to ensure capital adequacy according to Basel standards in globalization. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This study also looked into how corporate governance practices affect the growth of an innovative ecosystem in the Indian market. Methodology: We evaluated data of the 77 non-financial companies listed on the BSE 200 index using the fixed effect panel data regression technique. The experimental phase lasted six years, from 2016 to 2021. The market value of the company was determined using the price-to-book ratio.

Furthermore, inter-determinant relationships were established, and a hierarchical structure of the identified determinants was constructed using total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) and Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC) analysis. Findings: According to the study, maintaining government guarantees in control and having a solid deposit insurance scheme are essential for the banking sector’s stability. Furthermore, depositor awareness and knowledge are known to achieve effective market discipline. Bank disclosure and transparency contribute significantly to the improvement of market discipline. Additionally, these characteristics encourage additional determined elements for increased attention and surveillance by depositors. Practical Implications: The analysis helped identify determinants according to their ability to influence and get influenced by other determinants. The determinants classified as independent factors, viz., deposit insurance system, knowledge of depositors, and presence of government guarantee, should be strengthened to bring about better market discipline.

The basis of their merger was not in the public domain. However, it was understood that the underlying reason was to obviate the need for repeated recapitalization of these banks due to the deterioration of their financials and the resultant erosion of their capital. The rising non-performing assets (NPAs) seemed to have impacted the financial performance of banks adversely, necessitating their restructuring. Therefore, the consolidation of the public sector banks aimed to make them bigger and stronger, enabling them to gain operational efficiency and access the market for their capital requirements. This study analyzed the impact of gross NPA (GNPA) on important financial ratios of public sector banks, including profitability ratios like ROA, ROE, and NIM, through correlation and regression analysis. An attempt was also made to find similarities in financial performance among different groups of amalgamated banks. Methodology: The sample of two merged bank groups with Punjab National Bank and Union Bank of India as anchor banks were put to statistical tests on the basis of secondary data for the period from 2011–2020. Tools like ratio analysis, descriptive stats, Pearson correlation, and linear regression were used to evaluate the extent to which GNPA impacted the financial performance of PSBs. Findings: The results indicated a negative correlation between the GNPA of PSBs and other key financial variables like CD ratio, NIM, ROA, ROE, and CAR. Also, the study highlighted the merger of weaker public sector banks with stronger ones. Practical Implications: On the basis of the factors and model of our study, the Government of India can decide to restructure some more banks in the future by way of mergers with banks already restructured or through the privatization route as earlier announced by the Finance Minister in her Budget speech of 2021.

Methodology: The methodology adopted in this paper could be divided into two parts. In the first part, the event study method was used to analyze the aggregated impact of war on the currencies of the two groups of nations. In the second part, a dynamic conditional correlation–generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model (DCC-GARCH) was used to analyze the dynamic correlation between the two groups of currencies in aggregate. Findings: From the first part of the analysis, it was found that the Russian ruble declined for both groups after the initial economic sanctions, but the recovery afterward was more robust against the currencies of the non-aligned group. The second part of the analysis revealed a significant increase in the time-varying dynamic conditional correlation between the returns of the two groups after the war, indicating a contagion. Practical Implications: Managers are recommended to be cautious of the impact of the increased interrelation of exchange rates among the two diplomatic groups on international business transactions. Policymakers are recommended to consider the fact that economic sanctions not uniformly supported by all major nations cannot have their intended impact.

For that, the economic data of six NSE-listed automobile companies from 2016–17 to 2020–21 were utilized. In the analysis, the dependent variable is the log number of stock prices, and the independent variables are a log of EVA, Tobin’s Q, and return on assets (ROA). In addition, an OLS regression econometric model was used to determine whether or not the independent variables explained the dependent variable in a statistically significant manner. The analysis showed a very high statistical significance at both levels; the overall regression model and individual coefficient levels, as seen from their p-values. This outcome cemented the view that EVA is not to be discounted in the Indian automotive sector and that it positively affected the stock price. With multiple challenges of the 21st century, disruptive technologies, and structural issues of supply and demand transformations, automotive companies would do well if they operated with EVA as their key performance measure. Moreover, new sustainable products, such as launching electric vehicles (EVs), might become a game-changer for many automotive firms in the coming years.

The case presented immediate probing issues to the investors as key stakeholders, the first being the factors that played the role of catalyst leading to a blow-up of the IL&FS financial crisis and the second being the identification of preventive measures to create a robust vigilance system. The case also outlined how the default of IL&FS on some of the debt instruments triggered the domino effect in the money market, equity market, bond market, and mutual funds in the ever-increasingly connected financial world. It highlighted crucial internal and external factors which acted as key drivers in the IL&FS financial crisis. This crisis also exhibited strong interconnection of financial markets as troubles in one market spread across other markets. The study brought to the fore the role of regulatory bodies, independent audit agencies, and credit rating agencies in the development of such a crisis. It contributed by creating a critical platform to raise essential points for further discussions related to the emergence of the IL&FS crisis, the factors driving this crisis, and its impact on the sustainability of the financial ecosystem of India. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The study examined the effect of financial literacy on financial behavior via financial attitude. Methodology: The study adopted an explanatory research design that investigated the interrelationship between financial literacy, attitude, and financial behavior. A survey method was used to collect the data with a structured questionnaire from university students from Surat, Gujarat. Data analysis was performed using a structural equation modeling approach with the help of SPSS and AMOS version 21. Findings: The study found that university students’ financial literacy scores were high. The students scored an average of 70% while answering questions related to financial literacy. The results of two hypotheses in the study revealed that university students with high scores on financial literacy had positive financial attitudes, which leads to more desirable financial behavior. Practical Implications: Universities and governments should develop a mechanism to identify students with poor financial literacy levels and offer opportunities for skill-based training to upgrade their financial knowledge. Furthermore, marketers of financial products and services might develop financial awareness programs for students with poor financial literacy, which would lead to targeting their future potential customers. Marketers might also use their level of financial literacy to segment their future marketing strategies for this cohort. Originality: The study revealed the relationship between financial literacy, attitude, and behavior among students in an emerging market in India. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.

Attitude toward investment (AT) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were considered as the mediating factors related to the same, while social factors (SF) and subjective norms (SN) were considered as independent factors. Design/ Methodology/Approach: A Google form was used to collect primary data; 401 valid responses were considered for the present research work. G* Power 3.1.9.2 software was applied to determine the sample size. The research applied a non-probability convenient sampling technique for collecting the data through a questionnaire. Initially, convenience sampling was used, followed by snowball sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to our friends and acquaintances in five Indian states (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Gujarat, and Maharashtra). Then, friends and acquaintances were asked to circulate the same survey to their friends and acquaintances in their respective cities, and so on. This research used confirmatory composite analysis to observe linear compound interrelationships. The SmartPLS software was utilized in order to conduct an analysis of partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings: Financial literacy had the highest positive effect on investment intention (β = 0.435). AT and PBC, which are the mediating variables, had a total positive effect of (β = 0.403) and (β = 0.275) on investment intention, respectively. FL had a total positive effect of (β = 0.358) and (β = 0.614) on AT and PBC, respectively. SF had a total positive effect of (β = 0.118) on AT, and SN had a total positive effect of (β = 0.219) on investment intention.

This study examined the MSME knowledge, usage, and preferences about several digital financial technologies. Further, the paper discussed the impact of demographic variables on DFS adoption. Methodology: Primary data were gathered for the study. The questionnaire had three parts. The first part covered demographic variables. The second part identified questions related to DFS awareness and the reason for adopting DFS. The last part covered DFS adoption in various financial activities. Findings: DFS awareness in the MSME sector was high but far from the required level. Demonetization and COVID-19 also increased the awareness of DFS in the Indian MSME sector. The DFS adoption was found to be affected by the age and experience of the owner/manager. Also, the educational level of the owner/manager did not always impact the DFS adoption. Practical Implications: Digital financial service providers should increase customer satisfaction and reduce administrative expenses by making their website or application user-friendly to attract MSMEs.

Mann – Whitney U test was used to compare the risk of companies with high ESG scores and low ESG scores. Ordinary least squares regression was used to find the impact of ESG on systematic, unsystematic, and total risk. Mann – Whitney U test showed that the firms with high ESG scores had lower total and unsystematic risk. The difference in systematic risk of high ESG and low ESG firms was insignificant. The regression results showed that systematic, unsystematic, and total risk was negatively related to the composite ESG score. Individual environment and the social and governance scores showed a negative association with total and unsystematic risk, but only social performance showed a negative association with systematic risk. In a nutshell, superior ESG performance reduced the risk of Indian consumer goods companies and helped increase shareholders’ wealth.

The findings suggested that, among various macroeconomic variables, debt servicing, inflation, and military expenditure are the key determinants of debt in India. Moreover, as expected, economic development has a negative relation with public debt, suggesting that public debt accumulation tends to decrease with the progress in economic development. It is acknowledged that the improvement in socioeconomic conditions is likely to enhance the overall welfare of the people and thereby create more productive resources in the economy.

Consistency in the exchange rate has become a key objective of the economic policy of developing nations. However, more integration of financial markets under flexible exchange rate policy led to an increase in capital mobility affecting exchange rate volatility. This paper addressed the issue of variation in the exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the US dollar under a flexible regime using monthly data spanning from January 2005 to December 2020. By employing an autoregressive integrated moving average model, the study found that volatility in the exchange rate had the potential to affect the exchange rate for a duration of almost three years, which is quite a long duration. The study’s findings suggested that apart from other factors, the sharp changes in the exchange rate should be controlled by the economy because their effect will be reflected in the next period and thus create a chain event to bring further instability to the exchange rate. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The increased worry of investors, regulators, and dealers about stock market volatility produced by worldwide integrated stock trading has focused on the symmetric and asymmetric volatility caused by the cross-listing of tradable assets that has damaged the domestic stock market. Methodology: The analysis for the study incorporated the longitudinal time series of daily closing prices from January 01, 2011, to December 31, 2021, of the sample indices taken from the Bloomberg terminal. The study used GARCH, EGARCH, and PARCH models to analyze the return and volatility spillover among the Indian and cross-listed stock markets. Findings: The findings indicated that prior index return volatility was significant and impacted current index return volatility. The findings also suggested that volatility exhibited asymmetric behavior, with positive shocks to volatility having different impacts than adverse shocks. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange was negligible in all models, implying it is exogenous. Practical Implications: It was suggested that investors use information from another market to forecast the behavior of one market. The current analysis supported this assumption by demonstrating the market dominance of the United States. By focusing on market activity in the United States, preventative measures could be taken to minimize worldwide shocks.

The study’s goal was to determine whether volatility clustering exists and how it responds to both positive and negative shocks to Brazil’s capital market. Methodology: The emerging markets information services database was used to obtain the closing prices of nine Brazilian stock indices from 2012 to 2022. Four well-known calendar anomalies were examined using the dummy variable regression approach: the trading month effect, Halloween impact, day of the week effect, and month of year effect. GARCH-based models, including GARCH-M and T-GARCH techniques, have subsequently been used to conduct tests on the nature of volatility clustering. Findings: The results proved that there is volatility clustering. For Brazil, the only noteworthy anomaly found was the month-of-the-year effect, which indicates that the sample indices only showed meaningfully positive returns in April. Finally, the results showed that, in contrast to positive shocks, negative shocks exhibited more pronounced clustering throughout the second moment. Practical Implications: The study has implications for regulators and market players. While market participants might use this anomaly to develop profitable trading strategies for Brazil, authorities can investigate whether calendar oddities are caused by regulatory inefficiencies or issues with microstructure.

Economic policy uncertainty showed that uncertainties persist in the economy and may affect economies, industries, and companies. The stock market of any economy is very volatile, and it can be easily affected by any small changes in the economy on a national and international level. We argued that EPU also significantly affected the Indian stock market. Design/Methodology/Approach: We analyzed the relationship of economic policy uncertainty with stock prices and market volatility using linear and logarithmic regression. Findings: Our study found that economic policy uncertainty had a positive correlation with market volatility and a significant negative relationship with returns on the Indian stock market. Further, EPU had negative impacts on the performance of firms. We also found that economic policy uncertainty did not have a similar impact on every sector. Sectors dealing with discretionary products and services like automobiles were more negatively impacted than sectors like fast-moving consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. Practical Implications: An investor must understand the impact of uncertainties on equity investments and different sectors to make sound decisions during such times. This information can be used both by firms and retail investors to act accordingly when the future trajectory of the economy is uncertain. Also, the authorities should try to reduce such risks as these can negatively impact the economic growth of a country.

The microstructure of the market was largely composed of trading volume, stock index returns, and implied volatility. Understanding the microstructure of the market is crucial because it gives investors important knowledge about its dynamics and empowers them to make wise decisions. Methodology: For the years 2018 through 2023, the study took into account the closing values of the Nifty, volatility index, and trading volume. To examine the dynamic link between the variables, quantile regression and Granger causality models were applied. Findings: The findings suggested that the volatility index’s lag returns cause fluctuations in the current returns of the Nifty. The Nifty returns and changes in trading volume are unrelated. It is observed that Nifty returns have an asymmetric relationship with returns from the volatility index and a positive association with trading volume. Markets responded more strongly to negative news shocks when the Nifty had negative returns. Practical Implications: The volatility index would be used by investors as a hedging tool to forecast near-term Nifty volatility as well as diversify the risk in their portfolio.

However, after more than half a century of research, the debate over the determinants of dividend policy in firms is inconclusive. Therefore, the current study attempted to contribute to the literature by exploring new insights into the dividend decisions of Indian firms by employing machine learning. Methodology: This study is based on secondary data, and empirical analysis has used a novel dataset of 919 listed Indian nonfinancial firms from 1999-2019. The study utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression methodologies. Findings: The findings revealed that the idiosyncratic variables are critically significant for dividend announcements by Indian firms. The results demonstrated that large, profitable, liquid, and firms with high market share were more likely to announce dividends in India than small, loss-making, illiquid, and low-market share firms. The direct relationship between Tobin’s Q and the likelihood of paying dividends is a new insight into the dividend decision for Indian firms.

"Price Discovery Mechanism in the Indian Agricultural Commodity Futures Market – An Empirical Analysis","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180463407&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2023%2fv17i12%2f172823&partnerID=40&md5=acb365fede857c79f58cf0008a2f99b3","Purpose: In India, commodity futures markets are the best alternative to the securities markets because of their familiarity with risk hedging. It makes sense that information regarding futures contract pricing is provided by the way prices behave in the futures market analysis. The relationship between futures contract prices and commodities spot market prices is made clearer by the price discovery process. The current study provided an example of how 10 agricultural prices were determined. Methodology: The present study adopted exploratory and causal research designs based on cash and near-month futures contract prices of the selected agricultural commodities chosen through the purposive sampling method. The study used the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test, co-integration analysis, Granger causality test, and vector error correction model (VECM) to comprehend the efficiency of the price discovery mechanism of agricultural commodity futures markets in India. Findings: The study’s statistical findings demonstrated that the cash and futures markets possessed comparable proficiency in terms of price discovery methods for chana, jeera, maize, moong, and soybean. However, the cash market drove the futures market for coriander and cotton cake, and the futures market directed the spot market for price discovery for barley, turmeric, and wheat. Practical Implications: The study’s findings will be beneficial to market participants in adopting a range of arbitrage and trading techniques as well as to policymakers in confirming the consistency of both spot and futures markets, given the growing state of the commodity futures market in India. Originality: The novelty of the present study is the selection of sample agricultural commodities that were actively trading and highly liquid in the commodities market using the purposive sampling method. The statistical results have highlighted the effectiveness of price discovery in spot and futures markets for all the commodities covered in the study. Traders thus profited from the study’s conclusions when they periodically framed their trading strategies. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Volatility Spillover Effects on Foreign Exchange Rates","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196618184&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2024%2fv18i6%2f173966&partnerID=40&md5=6b2b99f71a9cddc51aa1218366d3091f","Purpose: The study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on exchange rate volatility in five major emerging economies: the Indian rupee, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan, and South African rand. Advanced statistical analysis techniques, including the GARCH (1,1) model and asymmetric volatility models, were employed to uncover significant insights. Design/Methodology/Approach: The influence of unfavorable COVID-19 news on exchange rate volatility in the five key emerging nations described above was examined using sophisticated statistical analytic approaches, such as the GARCH (1,1) model and asymmetric volatility models. Findings: The study found that past-day volatility greatly impacted current-day volatility, supporting the existence of the ARCH effect. Surprisingly, external independent variables—LBR, LCY, LMP, and LSR—demonstrated no significant impact on the volatility of LIR, highlighting susceptibility to internal shocks. The results of further using asymmetric volatility models to evaluate long-term consequences indicated that COVID-19 did not affect these variables. Exchange rate returns were not volatile even in the face of bad pandemic-related news. Practical Implications: The study enhanced the body of knowledge on COVID-19’s effects on currency exchange rates while offering managers and marketers useful advice on navigating currency volatility. Originality: In contrast to other research, this study contributed to the body of knowledge by examining the effects of COVID-19 on exchange rate volatility within important emerging markets using advanced statistical approaches. It sheds light on the intricate dynamics of currency changes during crises, providing new insights that are beneficial to scholars and experts in the field of international finance. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The paper included five exchange rates (USD-INR, EURO-INR, GBP-INR, CNY-INR, and JPY-INR) and seven (automobile, banking, energy, FMCG, infrastructure, information & technology, and pharmaceutical) sectoral indices in this study. Methodology: The study used the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) model for modeling volatility. T-GARCH model was used to estimate the leverage effect; and DCC-GARCH was used for analyzing the spillover effect of exchange rates on select sectoral indices. Findings: The study found that leverage effect existed in all the series as the sum of α and λ of T-GARCH is less than 1, and the model was found acceptable. In the long-run, there was a spillover effect from all the exchange rates to all the sectoral indices. A short-run USD-INR spillover was observed on five sector indices, excluding banks and infrastructure. For every sectoral index, the DCC α of EURO-INR was determined to be negligible. Therefore, there was no transmission of short-term volatility from the EURO-INR to sectoral indices. Indexes of the FMCG, infrastructure, and IT sectors were not affected by the short-term volatility of the GBP-INR. DCC α and DCC β of CNY-INR were found to be significant for all the indices, which revealed transmission of information in the short-run as well as in the long-run. The three indices for which DCC α of JPY-INR was found insignificant are the bank, FMCG, and pharma sectors. Implications: The results of this study shall aid policymakers and regulators in formulating investor-friendly rules and regulations to maintain a steady stock market. Prospective stakeholders shall also benefit from this research by using it to make reliable and well-informed investment decisions and portfolios. This study could be used as a reference document in other research and academic discussions as well. Originality: Foreign exchange rates and sectoral indices, the focus of this study, have received relatively little attention in the literature despite the fact that research on stock markets has gained a lot of attention recently. This research will be a trailblazer in examining how fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact India’s sectoral indexes. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

This study investigated Bitcoin’s persistence and hedging properties in the pre-COVID era to establish its efficiency and safety by testing relevant data. We evaluated the role of persistence in Bitcoin trading to highlight its efficiency. The GPH estimator and ARFIMA were used to map the evolving efficiency of the Bitcoin price. Our analysis of intra-day data exhibited the presence of an anti-persistence effect, following the popular conclusion of momentum and speculative trading in the Bitcoin market. The second section of this study evaluated whether Bitcoin played the role of a hedge and an asset of protection in a global portfolio manager’s portfolio during extreme market volatility. Using the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH), we evaluated the trading correlation between Bitcoin prices and four major indices, namely S & P 500, FTSE, Hang Seng, and Nikkei, on daily and weekly data. We identified the time-varying hedge and safety properties of Bitcoin: Volatility, speculation, less-traded history, and lack of regulatory infrastructure. Our findings added to the literature by testing the efficiency of Bitcoin in major developed economies using returns of high-frequency data, along with daily returns. We also considered extreme movements in the currency to check its hedging and protection properties in a portfolio of developed market stocks. We recommended that investors be cautious when combining this currency with different stock markets based on our findings. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

When an investment is made in a WOS, the entity must focus on several factors that would ensure profitability in the long run. Methodology: The overseas investments to the WOS are made through equity, loan, and guarantee or a combination of the same. The study considered the total overseas direct investments to the WOSs. The performance of the total overseas investments was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The short-run and long-run associations between the total overseas direct investment and the macroeconomic factors of the home country were estimated by employing the Granger causality test and Johansen cointegration test. Findings: The results proved the existence of a short-run association between select macroeconomic factors and overseas investments. A long-run association also existed between the variables. Practical Implications: Apart from firm-specific factors, several macroeconomic factors should also be considered before investing. In this context, the study focused on the performance of the ODI from India to the WOS in particular and the home country’s macroeconomic factors that should be evaluated before investing in a foreign country.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH model was employed to analyze the behavior of time-varying conditional correlation during the time of COVID-19. For examining the financial contagion, regression analysis was performed on the dynamic conditional correlation and the conditional volatilities of the different markets. Findings: The DCC model showed a sharp increase in correlations between markets during the COVID-19 wave. It also suggested the presence of financial contagion between the crude oil and gold markets and the different equity sectors. It also indicated that the COVID-19 effect on the conditional correlation between gold and equity sectors was temporary. In contrast, it increased the correlation between crude oil and the equity sectors. Practical Implications: The findings of this study have implications for portfolio diversification methods because higher correlations lower the benefits of diversification. Originality: This study examined the financial contagion during COVID-19 from crude oil and gold to equity sectors.

As the interest in investing in the stock market is growing day by day, the need to test the performance of technical indicators is also enhanced. Methodology: The closing prices of three indices from the sample markets were investigated for 14 years, from January 2008 to December 2021, by applying the 30/70 rule of the RSI. The whole period of sample data from 2008 to 2021 has been divided into two smaller sub-periods of 7 years each in order to test the performance of the oscillator during the short period. Sub-period I is from January 2008 to December 2014; Sub-period II is from January 2015 to December 2021. While comparing the buy and hold strategy with RSI, one form has assumed that once the buy or sell decision is made, the same will be held for 10 days. Findings: A 1% significance level was used to find the majority of the results to be statistically significant. Twenty-seven places, or 50% at the 1% level, and three results, or 5.55% at the 5% and 10% levels, were determined to be statistically significant out of the 54 total results. At various levels, 61.12% of the long, short, and long-short positions are determined to be statistically significant. Practical Implications: RSI is the most frequently used oscillator by investors for making investment decisions; thus, it becomes essential to minutely study the profitability of the oscillator academically. Our study is not free from limitations and allows scope for future researchers to study the performance of oscillators along with other techniques of technical trading rule, and it can be tested on different samples of markets.

The analysis revealed that the majority of the companies had been practicing an aggressive working capital investment policy. Similarly, the difference between the efficiencies and investment policies of DPCs and MNPCs was also not statistically significant. The regression coefficients found in the study provide directions to managers to reduce the ratio of aggressive investment policy and conservative investment policy and enhance the working capital efficiency during the boom period. The negative coefficients of correlation also supplemented this finding. The value of R-square showed that the major variations in the efficiency index during the boom period were caused by investment policies. During recession and recovery periods, because of positive beta coefficients, the management of the DPCs should infuse more investments in current assets. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Improved performance and production lead to increased efficiency for the firms. In this study, data envelopment analysis was used to evaluate the efficiency using financial data of 11 years of all the 13 S&P BSE 500 listed textile firms. Consistent with the relevant literature, three inputs (power, fuel, & water charges; compensation to employees; and raw materials, stores, & spares) and one output (profit before tax) were selected. Additionally, outcomes from the DEA analysis were used to perform the regression analysis. Out of the 13 units analyzed for efficiency, two textile units were found to be operating efficiently. The results of the regression analysis showed that an increase in employee compensation will lead to an increase in profit since the increase in the compensation helps to increase motivation from job satisfaction. Besides adding value to the efficiency assessment literature, the research findings of this study also provide meaningful business insights for the practitioners for improving productivity performance by finding the core action area in resource planning decisions. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This paper empirically measured the effects of finance functions on the cash account. The results revealed that the effect of cash flow on dividend decisions was statistically significant, while the effect of cash on capital budgeting and capital structure decisions was of limited relevance. Subsequent analysis unfolded that capital budgeting and capital structure decisions are inherently related; indeed, big size investments are linked with the mobilization of funds. While financing the investments, firms prioritized borrowing, and comparatively lower priority was given to mobilizing new equity capital. This observation confirmed the application of the pecking order hypothesis in the financing practice of Indian firms. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Day-end pricing for 2015-2019 included periods of rising, falling, and stable volatility. The resulting four rule algorithm produced positive results on out-of-sample data and outperformed a buy and hold strategy. As the general procedure followed for rule development was not country specific, it was applied to options on China's SSE 50 index, where the algorithm was found to outperform a hold-to-expiry strategy in every year tested.

Banks are also striving hard to introduce innovative deliverables to lure and retain their customers on one hand and to reduce cost and increase profit on the other hand. As the Indian banking sector is trying to match its technical and manpower capabilities to meet new challenges, complaints from customers are bound to increase. This has made customer happiness a major concern in the banking sector. Thus, the grievance redressal mechanism has become an important component of banking operations. Taking note of such a scenario, the Banking Ombudsman Scheme was brought to light by the Reserve Bank of India in the year 1995. This scheme acts as the grievance redressal mechanism at the highest level which is parallel to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanism. An effort was made in this paper to analyze the efficacy of this scheme over the years. Various parameters were studied with the help of trend analysis to conclude the findings. Findings of 10-year data showed that this scheme worked effectively for the urban and metropolitan customers, but is yet to achieve the desired results for rural and semi-urban customers. Among the categories of banks, foreign banks were found to be doing good in keeping their customers satisfied. The analysis also concluded that mainly retail customers have used this scheme to resolve their issues. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

One school of thought argues that when multinational firms relocate production facilities abroad, it reduces the likelihood of concurrent investments in the home country, resulting in reduced domestic output. In this case, the outward FDI would harm the domestic investments. The other argues that the outward FDI would be more advantageous for the domestic investment when firms internationalize for entering into new markets and/or to import intermediate goods, wherein outward investments boost the returns in the home country, leading to a positive impact of outward FDI on domestic investment. The influence of the outward FDI on the domestic investment of any country or a region state cannot be generalized as each country is unique, and the drivers of investments would differ for different countries at the different development phases of each country.

It analyzed the impact of gross advances and gross non-performing assets (NPAs) on the total number of restructured debts of the sampled banks. Panel data regression modeling was applied, where the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) was used as an estimation method. Granger causality test and Pearson correlation analysis were also employed. The results confirmed that gross NPAs and gross advances were highly statistically significant and positively impacted the total number of restructured loans at 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively. It was also confirmed that all the years jointly and each year individually had a significant time-fixed effect on the total number of restructured debts. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

One school of thought believes that with age, the organizations' learning capability matures, and the processes improve to deliver the best financial performance. The other school argues that with advancing age and rigidity of processes, the decision making ability and response to the market reduces. Thus, these two schools of thought present diametrically opposite ideas related to performance of firms with age. This research took panel data for 5 years (2012-16) on various performance parameters such as income, asset, compounded annual growth, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), net profit margin, return on net worth, and return on capital employed for 3719 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The companies were categorized into 12 sectors. Each financial parameter was compared with age of the companies across sectors to find any significant correlation. The study found that the (a) age and performance parameters were not normally distributed, (b) most of the companies showed negative financial performance on chosen parameters across sectors, (c) asset, income, and compound annual growth rate had weak, negative, but significant correlation with age, (d) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization margin had a weak but positive correlation with age. Thus, the older companies indicated better operational efficiencies compared to the market competitiveness. The study covered a period where the Sensex was consistently rising.

The sample was 11 Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia. The data used were secondary data compiled from financial and annual reports for the period from 2009 – 2017. The data were then processed using multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling with WarpPLS tool. The study demonstrated that banks’ social distribution activities were not used to control risk. The role of the Sharia Supervisory Board (SSB) was not found to be effective in improving banks’ social performance. Meanwhile, the role of independent commissioners was able to increase the distribution of qardh al-hassan (interest free loans) and distribution of qardh (interest free financing). The level of profitability was only able to increase zakah expenditure (religious donations) and EDI was proven empirically to have a positive influence on the distribution of zakah funds and qardh financing. Islamic banks are required to demonstrate performance in terms of social concerns that is well aligned with the achievement of financial performance. The social activities that are a part of the performance of Islamic banks are concrete evidence of bank participation in improving people's welfare, reducing poverty, and caring for the environment. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

While these strategies tend to perform well in equities, their effectiveness and performance in the currency market is yet to be tested, which is generally inefficient and predictable. The purpose of this study was to select the pairs for pairs trading in the forex market of select currencies: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/INR, USD/JPY, and USD/NZD during the period starting from October 1, 2010 – October 20, 2020. The research was organized into three parts to determine the possible pairs of six currencies over different time periods. First, the closeness of potential pairs of six currencies was established using the distance approach for 10 years, 5 years, and 2 years. After that, the Engle – Granger two-step test for cointegration was applied to examine the validity of the top 10 closest pairs of currencies for pairs trading in the study.

The 2016 changes are effective beginning financial year 2017, the compliance outcome of which will be known only in 2019. The frequent reviews and modifications of the Code reflect, among other things, the willingness and the ability of various stakeholders in The Netherlands to keep their corporate governance principles and practices in line with the latest thinking and developments on the subject. Furthermore, the almost 100% compliance of the Code by the listed companies is really heartening and reflects its widest possible acceptance and, therefore, the highest success rate of its key principles and provisions of best practices.

But despite growth in account ownership, inequality persists. The objective of the present study was to examine the current status of financial inclusion and to further explore the factors leading towards the lower level of financial access among the households. The study was conducted in four districts of the National Capital Region in India namely, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurugram, and Faridabad, with a sample size of 300 respondents between the period of 2018 – 2019. The study is unique in nature, as the survey was conducted both in rural and urban areas. The factor analysis technique was applied to explore a large set of variables into few factors affecting the financial inclusion. Further, the households were grouped into three degrees on the basis of their financial behavior and attitude. Finally, the study concluded that supply-side and demand-side factors were the main factors for the lower access to basic banking services. Furthermore, financial attitude, financial knowledge, and financial behavior were the factors shaping the minds of the respondents. The results revealed that majority of the respondents fell under Degree 1, that is, having access to banking products, but their level of financial literacy and active usage of bank accounts was significantly low. Therefore, it is concluded that though a sufficient number of people had a formal bank account, there existed a low level of financial literacy due to which they were not active users of financial services. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Based on the existing literature, three determinants were employed to study the tax compliance behaviour: tax knowledge, tax penalties, and electronic filing. To examine the impact of these independent determinants on compliance (dependent variable) by taxpayers, we collected survey data from 247 corporate taxpayers with a net worth less than ₨ 100 crores in Delhi and NCR in India during the period from January – July 2019. Cronbach's alpha test and one-sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov test were used to check the reliability and normality of the data set, and a linear multiple regression model was used to test the hypotheses and check the relationship. The findings confirmed that tax penalties and electronic filing had a statistically significant influence on the corporate taxpayers’ tax compliance, while tax knowledge did not show a statistically significant relation with tax compliance. The results could provide insights into progressive tax policy tools and administration strategies to augment taxpayer compliance, which will increase the nation’s tax revenues.

However, the middle and small capitalization indices were not weak form efficient, even after accounting for structural breaks. The notion of adaptive or evolving market efficiency was also supported in this study. The traders will not get abnormal economic profits by trading in the large capitalization space. However, outside the large capitalization space, there is potential for abnormal economic profits. This study supports the assertion that if the structural breaks were not considered, weak form of market efficiency tests might give misleading results. The present study is different from most other studies in the Indian market by accounting for the structural breaks in the weak form of efficiency tests. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of microfinance on women empowerment from the decision-making perspective. The study was conducted on 512 SHG members belonging to the Aravalli and Mehsana districts of North Gujarat in 2019. The respondents from 12 villages of Bayad, Bhiloda, Kadi, and Mehsana talukas of North Gujarat participated in the study. The study was performed using paired sample t-test and empowerment index. The results of paired sample f-test revealed that after joining the SHGs, the decision-making ability of women was empowered significantly. Furthermore, it was observed that those women who participated in SHGs for longer duration and attended more meetings in a year were more empowered as compared to other women. The study has implications for SHG members. More women should be encouraged to join the SHGs as it empowers women on their decision-making ability. The members should conduct regular meetings by fixing a common time so that all the members can attend the meetings. The SHGs should focus on the sustainability of the women to continue as members. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The Health of any country can be defined by the condition of the financial system which is going to be reformed. Reforms have been done from time to time on the ground of several committees introduced in the banking sector such as the first Narasimham Committee (1991), Verma Committee (1996), Khan Committee (1997), second Narasimham Committee (1998). The growth and efficiency of the country can be determined through the financial performance of the banks. The main task of this paper was to do a comparative analysis of the financial performance of selected public sector and private sector banks. Besides this, the study tried to acknowledge the financial stability, liquidity, profitability, and other financial aspects of the banks. For the study purpose, three public sector banks (State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and Punjab National Bank) and three private sector banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank) were chosen as they have the largest financial base. The overall study is based on the secondary data collected from the annual reports, newspapers, magazines, and online sources for the period of 5years from 2015-2019. It was found from a comparative analysis that the public sector banks have made a significant progress, but they still do not meet the performance benchmark set by the private sector banks. Private sector banks (2.02300%) were found to be more successful in controlling the non-performing assets (NPA) in comparison to the public sector banks (5.12133%). © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

To address the challenges of infrastructure provision, several countries are exploring the possibility of procuring infrastructure through public–private partnerships (PPPs). Against this background, the current study had a primary research objective of identifying the rationale and factors that support the implementation of PPPs as a means to build infrastructure. Further, the study also aimed to discuss the benefits associated with the PPP modality of procuring infrastructure. For this purpose, the present study relied on a comprehensive review of existing studies using systematic literature review method. Based on qualitative analysis of articles published during 2006 – 2020 using Quirkos software, the following four key rationales supporting the implementation of PPPs were identified: low quality of existing infrastructure, widening infrastructure deficits, market and non-market failures, and budgetary constraints of the governments. Further, the results highlighted that PPPs provide several benefits, including access to financial resources and expertise of the private sector, better risk allocation, efficiency gains, enhancement or value for money, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and timely infrastructure development. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This study tried to revalidate two hypotheses namely, information signalling hypothesis and liquidity hypothesis in the Indian stock market in context of bonus issue announcements. Price reaction and trading volume on and around the announcement as well as ex-date were investigated during the study period (2004 - 2016). The study also measured the market depth through augmented liquidity tests around these two dates. The findings of the study observed significant positive abnormal reaction on the day of announcement as well as ex-bonus date. The presence of significant positive abnormal reaction in the pre-announcement period indicated the existence of insider trading and/or information leakages. The significant negative price reaction observed during the post ex-bonus day indicated the presence of bonus stripping practices in the study period. The study observed abnormally high trading volume around the announcement date and the ex-bonus date. The augmented liquidity tests, that is, stock's trading volume, stock’s relative trading volume, and liquidity ratio revealed that stocks traded on NSE experienced enhanced liquidity in the post bonus issue period.

A sample of 232 public listed firms was selected from Tiger Cub Economies for the data period ranging from 2012 to 2016. Using system generalized method of moment (GMM) estimation, a negative relationship was found between dividend payment and CEO overconfidence, a finding that is consistent with the findings of past research. Moreover, the research finding was robust when a more stringent measure of CEO overconfidence was adopted. Other significant determinants of dividend payment were asset growth, firm leverage, earnings growth, and firm size. The findings indicated reduction in dividends associated with CEO overconfidence in firms with declining asset growth, lower firm leverage, higher earnings growth, and largerfirm size. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The daily data of selected 36 companies of different sectors over the period from 2000 - 2016 were considered for the analysis. We estimated standard capital asset pricing model for each company for: (a) the entire period, (b) each of the financial years, (c) 30 trading-days before announcement of the budgets, and (d) 30 trading-days after the announcement of the budgets. We found that Ps of different companies varied over different time periods. The estimation of average excess return and cumulative average excess return of 30 trading days before and after the budgets over 16 years showed that the Indian stock market was informationally efficient in a semi-strong form. The short-term under-reaction/over-reaction represented by average excess return around the event period provided opportunities to earn abnormal profits and validated Shiner’s argument. The cumulative average excess return converging to zero over the 30 trading days before and after the budgets also lent support to Fama’s efficient market hypothesis. The study found that the budget is an important event for the Indian stock market, at least in the short time period. It is not necessarily required to trade/ invest in high B stocks; rather, some trading/ investment strategies may be formulated to earn excess returns, particularly around the event. The arguments on market efficiency of both the schools of thought (Fama and Shiller) seemed to be visible and suggested that the Indian stock market may be “efficiently inefficient”.","Budget effect; Capital asset pricing model; Efficient market hypothesis; Event study; Stock market",""

The objective of experiment design is to understand the economic market and represent almost all risk suffering levels. The research outcomes strengthened arguments of prospect theory in terms of both slope and reference point. This research found evidence for the hypothesis that the utility curve reference point lies in the positive domain. This suggested that in the case of low profitability, investors could still prefer risk over certainty, but they shall be more risk averse as returns are increased. Besides, the relationship between loss aversion and other behavioral biases was also examined, and evidence of strong relation between loss aversion and anchoring and overreaction was found, while there existed no clear correlation between loss aversion and overconfidence.

PPPs leverage private finances with public funds, thereby meeting infrastructure requirements of countries. PPPs also provide advantages of improved service quality and proper risk management. However, literature posits that PPPs are characterized by the presence of an array of challenges, making such projects vulnerable to distresses and/or cancellations. For instance, during the period from 2005-2018, 76 projects were declared cancelled/distressed, out of which 17 projects were in India alone, that too in a single year, that is, 2012. Against this backdrop, the objective of the present study was to identify the critical challenges pertaining to the lifecycle of PPP projects to enable policymakers formulate policies which minimize the risk of distress in PPP projects. The research methodology adopted was to rely on multiple case studies of PPP projects that had experienced challenges across the three phases of their project life cycle. Phase-1 of the cycle, known as the project development phase, was prone to challenges such as insufficient bids, inadequate competition, and poor feasibility analysis. Select challenges arising in Phase-2, the construction phase, were land acquisition, delays, and cost overruns. Finally, in Phase-3, which corresponded to the operational phase, challenges such as market demand risk and lower than expected revenues existed. Primarily relying on PPP projects in the transport sector, case studies were selected from countries such as India, Ghana, and Australia. Based on the enriching analysis from 12 such case studies, the paper concluded by providing a broad policy perspective. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Our study identified the structural breaks for all the markets and then explored the asymmetric volatility spillover between the US and all Asian markets by using an extended TGARCH model. The findings of the study reflected that shocks and information transmission from the US stock market were significant from 2007-2010, which was the period of the global sub-prime financial crisis, which confirms the notion that during the financial crisis, the degree of dependence between the stock markets increased. Besides this, volatility persistence was also observed from the stock market of the US to all the sample stock markets for all structural break periods, and this persistency was highest from 2015-2017. Further, the extent and durability of the reactions to volatility coming from the US stock market were not uniform across all Asian stock markets.

However, as a consequence of financial sector reforms, these banks faced a firm competition from several quarters on the account of gushing technical expertise, prudential guidelines, custom-built central banking systems, and a deregulated and market focused banking system. Consequently, cooperative banking organizations gradually advanced and prepared themselves to efficaciously meet recent challenges by reconceiving their operational strategies. One such change which came in a big way was the diversification of their loan portfolios - the movement from agricultural intensive loaning to retail loaning. Although profit was considered a forbidden word for cooperative banks, yet in view of the above changes, it became imperative to measure the change in the profitability performance of the cooperative banks. This paper made an attempt to study the outcome of retail loaning on the functioning of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) of Punjab by using secondary data. The paper examined the profitability of selected DCCBs in Punjab by determining the differential yield rate which is the difference in weighted average rate of return on total loans and weighted average rate of return on retail loans and further also determined the differential earnings resulting due to retail lending.

Indian data sample consisting of 732 transactions made by 405 angel investors from 2014-2018 were collected from the established data sources. Relevant data of other markets were taken from published journal articles and reports. We found that Indian angel investors are predominantly male, middle-aged, well-educated, and metro-cities residents. They preferred the preseed stage, technology sector, and closely located startups. Generally, they invested about $20,000 in an interval of one-and-half years and strongly preferred syndication. We also identified a significant heterogeneity between the angel investors in emerging and developed economies. Unlike emerging economies, the developed economies have comparatively older angels with more female presence and varied educational backgrounds. They make larger investments in lesser time intervals, about $28,200 in eight months. The widespread investors make long distanced investments in diversified sectors, thereby stimulating balanced growth, geographically and across sectors. This heterogeneity can be attributed to structural, economic, institutional, legal, and cultural differences between different economies. The definition describing the Indian angel investors, specifically reflecting the emerging economies and heterogeneity nature identified among the angel investors of different economies, is the key contribution of this paper. These findings would help entrepreneurs finetune their fundraising strategies and aid policymakers in promoting a robust startup ecosystem to facilitate angel investors’ active participation and the resultant growth of entrepreneurship and the economy. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

"Macroeconomic determinants of gold prices: A bounds testing approach","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089676281&doi=10.17010%2fijf%2f2020%2fv14i2%2f150554&partnerID=40&md5=aac18eb759dcfe692be239ffa24bd84f","Despite the demise of gold as a long-standing anchor in the international monetary system, it keeps on alluring its producers, consumers, investors, and speculators over the globe. India is the largest consumer and importer of gold in the world. The investment demand for gold is ascending in India since it is considered as a safe haven. Notwithstanding, high instability in gold prices brings up an issue on its supporting properties. Thus, an attempt was made to identify the macroeconomic determinants of gold prices in India. The study was set to examine the long run as well as short run relationship between gold prices and some macroeconomic variables like BSE Sensex, wholesale price index (WPI), and index of industrial production (IIP) as a proxy of gross domestic product, interest rates, Indian rupee - U.S. dollar exchange rate, and gold reserves of the country. Using the monthly data from April 1995 – March 2018, the relationship was explored empirically by using the autoregressive distributed lag model and error correction model. The ARDL results suggested that the long run cointegration between the prices of gold and the macroeconomic variables during the period of the study and gold reserves of RBI, BSE Sensex, WPI, exchange rate, and IIP were found to be significantly affecting the gold prices. However, interest rates were found to be statistically insignificant during the period of the study. The error correction term, which was negative and highly significant, confirmed the convergence to the long run equilibrium. The results of this study have important implications for the Indian economy and will be helpful for policy formulation. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The sample was constructed from Eikon database of Thomson Reuters considering 500 largest market capitalization firms listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). Initially, firm level determinants were examined separately for firms’ cash holding and net debt. Then, four subsamples were formed based on the twofold criterion of firms’ debt level and cash flows. These subsample firms were categorized as financially-constrained firms, no cash hedging firms, growth firms, and declining firms. Firm level determinants for cash holding and net debt were examined separately for all the four subsamples. For the complete sample of the firms, larger number of independent variables demonstrated statistically significant relationship with net debt than cash holding. The results confirmed that for financially constrained firms, net debt was more relevant for firms’ financial policies than cash holding. Negative relationship between firm size and cash holding was ubiquitous, signifying economy of scale for cash holding. Relevance of cash holding and net debt was analogous for declining firms. The findings revealed that growth firms placed relatively more emphasis on net debt; whereas, no-cash hedging firms gave more weightage to cash holding. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Sound liquidity management can reduce the probability of serious problems. Ideally, a bank needs to maintain enough high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs to withstand all kinds of possible stress situations. During the early phase of the 2008 financial crisis, many banks did not manage their liquidity prudently. These banks experienced major difficulties despite adequate levels of capital reserves. The Indian banks responded to the crisis by adopting cautious liquidity management policies. Alternatively, higher liquidity could work unfavorably for banks and mean smaller business. In this context, the present study attempted to understand the liquidity management by Indian banks and its impact on their business. The study focused upon selected large public and private sector banks so as to analyze and compare the liquidity and business performance of banks before the financial crisis (2001-02 - 2007-08) and after the crisis (2008-09 - 2018-19). The results revealed that Indian banks preferred higher liquidity in the post-crisis phase.

The scope of the study included all publicly listed manufacturing firms in India for the time period between 2009–2018. Suitable pooled OLS regressions were run for each hypothesis. In all regressions, the dependent variable was the percent change in market capitalization for each firm for each year. In the group classification of risk and profitability, the variables regressed were the levered beta, return on assets, return on equity, debt to equity ratio, and a dummy variable indicating the financial crisis. For the group of variables under compensation to investors, variables selected were earnings per share, dividend paid per share, and interest paid divided by total assets. For the asset efficiency group, the variables selected included total assets, current assets, asset turnover ratio, cash turnover ratio, and cash flow to sales ratio. Finally, for the investment policy decision group, firms were segregated on the basis of being conservative to aggressive on the basis of investments in assets and the difference in the investment level between conservative and aggressive firms (CMA) were regressed against the dependent variable.

The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity dynamic conditional correlation (GARCH -DCC) was used to reveal the return volatility and conditional correlation. The volatility spillover was examined by using the variance decomposition technique. The empirical outcome clearly revealed the presence of ARCH and GARCH effect on gold, realty, and U.S. dollar. Additionally, the results also manifested that the returns of these variables were not moving away from their means in the long run. On the other hand, the consequences of volatility spillover reported that real estate was the most dominating among all markets. This is so because returns on real estate had a significant contribution to the return volatility of the other markets. Finally, it was also found that return volatility of U.S. dollar was most affected as it was the net receiver of volatility, while return volatility of gold seemed to be neutral in the Indian financial market.","GARCH DCC; Gold; Spillover; U.S. dollar volatility",""

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of mergers on the short run market performance and long-run operating performance of ICICI Bank, one of the leading private sector banks in India. The present study distinguished itself from others by analyzing three essential measures simultaneously: (a) short run abnormal returns to shareholders, (b) long term operating performance of acquirer, and (c) strategic similarity analysis. Event study methodology, ratio analysis, and strategic similarity analysis were applied to study the short term and long-term performance of ICICI Bank. The findings revealed that the shareholders of ICICI Bank did not respond positively surrounding the announcement of its merger. However, the post - merger financial performance of ICICI Bank improved as was evident in its post-merger ratios and strategic similarity analysis.

The paper investigated the impact of futures prices on market efficiency and price discovery in India in HRITHIK stocks from 2017 – 2020. The current study comprised the daily near-month futures and daily spot closing prices of the HRITHIK stocks from January 1, 2017 – December 31, 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic period. The paper used the vector autoregression (VAR) Engel Granger causality test to test the short-run equilibrium between spot and futures prices and the vector error correction model (VECM) to test for long-run equilibrium. A bi-directional relationship was found among six stocks out of the seven HRITHIK stocks. This confirmed the causal relationship that futures prices have on the spot prices. The VAR Engel Granger causality test indicated that the spot market narrowly led the futures despite a bi-directional flow of information. The results from the VECM model proved that the futures market acted as the dominant market in the long-run. Usually, researchers have leveraged sector-wise stocks to provide insights into the futures market’s function in price discovery. For the first time, HRITHIK stocks were analyzed to examine the cause-and-effect relationship for individual stocks in India’s futures and spot markets. The study considered the pre-COVID 19 and the post-COVID 19 periods and investigated the impact of the pandemic on these stocks. The research used daily closing prices of HRITHIK stocks; however, intraday data could be more conclusive and accurate in revealing the dominant market. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The paper is about the trend in audit fee in the Indian setting, with the backdrop of two regulatory changes: mandatory auditor rotation and the implementation of Ind AS, the converged version of IFRS. Examining the determinants of audit fees, the paper categorized the explanatory variables into three attributes; auditee (size, risk, and complexity), auditor (auditor size, tenure, joint audit, and auditor rotation), and regulatory (mandatory auditor rotation and IFRS). The sample consisted of all non-financial companies listed on the National Stock Exchange for a period of 10 years from 2009–2018 resulting in 12,419 firm years. The paper deployed panel data regression with fixed effects with audit fee as the dependent variable. The key findings suggested that audit fee was positively associated with the size of the auditor and the auditee and the ratio of accounts receivable. The paper also indicated that with the tenure of the auditor, the fee tended to increase, and auditor rotation had a significant impact on the auditor's fee.

Towards that, we undertook the analysis of long-run and short-run efficiencies separately and used Engle – Granger’s error correction mechanism (ECM) so that a clear picture of short-run efficiency in terms of speed of adjustments could emerge. The rigour manifested in the analysis of up to 412538 data points that bred from the choice of five different time intervals spanning from 1-minute to 120-minutes. Most of the price discovery took place in the futures market, and the spot market followed it mostly with a lag of 9 minutes. However, it took 35 minutes to completely return to the desired relationship once a drift had taken place. The increase in the speed of adjustments, as compared to the speed documented in previous studies, could be attributed to the large-scale adoption of the high-frequency (i.e. algorithmic) trading in recent times.

The key takeaway is that happiness matters for the corporates as happiness impacts performance, it is about good corporate citizenship, and it is possible to measure happiness. Corporates need to include happiness in the accounting and other performance measurement systems. The implication is to take happiness more seriously as it impacts performance, helps in brand building and reputation, and also is the right thing to do as a good corporate practitioner.

Moreover, the impact of the main determinants on the parameter used to measure insolvency risk namely, Z-score was also analyzed. Our study clearly showed that the insolvency risk of all these banks increased significantly since the value of Z-score dipped substantially overtime. Further, the analysis also revealed that the current level of regulatory capital of the banks was not enough to overcome the potential threat of insolvency risk. Finally, percentage of nonperforming assets to total advances pertaining to the industrial sector was found to be an important determinant that aggravated the insolvency risk of banks. All these findings clearly highlighted that it is not the opportune time for the Reserve Bank of India to ease-off the regulatory capital norms regarding the capital risk adequacy ratio (CRAR). Besides, there is an urgent need for commercial banks to improve the quality of lending pertaining to the industrial sector of the economy along with stepping up their credit business regarding the personal loan segment. Moreover, too much government intervention distorts the automatic functioning of financial institutions. Rather, a mechanism should be devised to make these institutions more accountable. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Dividend payment is one of the major financial decisions, which has potential to influence the value of companies. As part of ownership structure, which is the main independent variable of the study, we considered shareholding of promoters, foreign institutional investors (Flls), and domestic institutional investors (Dlls) and investigated the impact of their shareholding on dividend payout decisions, which is the dependent variable in this study. We used return on assets (ROA), debt equity ratio, and size of companies as instrument variables. Our results indicated that ownership structure of Indian non-financial companies is of concentrated type and chiefly concentrated in the hands of promoters and groups. Using two-stage least squares regression model and with the help of instrument variable method, we found promoters, foreign institutional investors, and domestic institutional investors - all to be sharing a significant negative relationship with dividend payment decisions of companies, demonstrating the dominant shareholding type of companies engaged in sharing profits with shareholders in the form of dividends at lower rates and preferring to retain major chunk of profits forfuture investments and capital requirements. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The six explanatory variables, that is, firm size, growth opportunity, profitability, tangibility, liquidity, and business risks were employed to explain financing decisions across different firm scales. Using data panel analysis, we found that the associations between leverages and determinants diverged across different firm scales amongst secondary sectors, as the industry characteristics controlled the relationship mechanisms. In general, profitability and tangibility had essential roles in leverage determination, although these variables were more influential for large firms. Further, the pecking order theory was more influential in explaining the financing behavior of both types of firms. Nevertheless, there was no evidence to deny the applicability of trade-off theory and agency theory. Indeed, the pecking order hypothesis seemed more pronounced for large firms compared to medium-scale businesses among secondary sectors. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The study selected a sample of 123 publicly listed Indian firms across different sectors. The research identified the determinants of CEO compensation in an emerging economy, India using data from FY 2012–18, a period that witnessed various changes in the executive compensation structure post the implementation of Companies Act, 2013. A panel data regression of select variables indicated that in India, a firm’s performance with respect to its profitability affected the retirement benefits given to CEOs, while its leverage and size significantly affected CEO’s salary as well as total remuneration. In addition, we found that firm’s size had a significant relationship with bonus component, and contribution to provident fund for key executives. However, none of the variables except firm’s size were found to have a significant relationship with the perquisites paid to the CEOs.

Banks being the key stimulators in an economy create an enabling environment in order to run on the pathway to inclusive growth. It is difficult to give form to any of the initiatives if the banks do not mediate. They are the lifeline of a financial system that knits the prevailing gaps by linking the unbanked segment with the vision of financial inclusion. Providing timely and comprehensive financial services and products through a panoply of channels and institutions has always been accorded as a priority by the banks. The Government of India announced three major schemes, that is, Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, and Atal Pension Yojana in the past specifically designed for targeting industrial workers so as to link them with the financial system. The onus of implementation lies on the shoulders of the bankers, and therefore, it is necessary that there should not be any hurdles in the implementation phase. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the various problems faced by bank employees in implementation of the selected financial inclusion schemes for the industrial workers. For the same, data were gathered from 107 bank officials working in Delhi and NCR using semi-structured personal interviews during the period of March-June 2018.

Day-to-day price movement and price movements in two sub-periods: the off-market-hours and the market-hours were considered separately for the analysis. It was also tested whether Twitter activities had an asymmetric impact on stock returns on days with positive and negative sentiments. The study was carried out with data of over 2.4 million tweets about 437 Indian firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange for 124 trading days. Panel data analysis with random and fixed effects was employed to test whether the Twitter activity is a significant price mover. The results showed that all three measures of Twitter activity significantly impacted stock returns on a day-to-day basis, especially during the overnight period. However, during market hours, only tweet-count had a significant impact on stock price movements. Further, the results revealed that Twitter activity had the most significant impact on the price of a stock when the market sentiment about the stock was negative.

Alternate financing channels identified this void and have started making their presence felt in the recent years. Within the alternate financing options, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are best suited to cater to the credit needs of retail customers and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). This paper tried to estimate the credit demand for six major segments (across 'retail' sector and MSEs) and compared it with the trend in credit supply in order to estimate the demand-supply gap. Annual data from 2004 to 2016 was used for the forecast as reliable data for some of the above variables is not available after that. The credit demand was forecasted at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2022. Subsequently, the current P2P landscape in India was explored along with the regulatory structure in place. Whether P2P platforms will be able to fill the credit gap left by traditional banking channels or not will depend on how different stakeholders, that is, leading industry players and banking and capital market regulators provide a nurturing environment to the sector. With active participation from key stakeholders, P2P lending has the potential to create a sustainable, complementary market to the traditional credit intermediation instruments. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Some authors attributed these problems to the significant financial infrastructural gap in Africa. This study, therefore, investigated the determinants of fintech spreads in a panel of five emerging, 24 frontier, and three fragile African economies from 2002 – 2018. The dynamic panel system GMM estimation technique based on the epidemic and rank theories revealed heterogeneity and significant difference in internet and mobile banking penetration rate among economy types in Africa, with emerging markets reporting higher intercept and lower slope than frontiers and fragile markets. Also, information spread promoted penetration across units; whereas, population growth and literacy only increased it among frontiers and fragile economies but dampened it in emerging economies. This means that users of fintech among emerging markets began to diversify to new innovations aside from those used in this study, hence the decline. Moreover, Africa’s average fintech adoption rate stood at 24%; in South Africa and Morocco, it stood at 43% and 40%, respectively, compared to the global benchmark of 33%. We, therefore, recommend that banks should collaborate with fintech companies to enhance their benefits in Africa. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The change in notional behavior and size of such behavior was examined, and the contribution of trading volume and open interest in the behavior of the futures contract prices were investigated. Methodology and Approach: This study included a sample of daily prices for the period from 2011 – 2019 for 33 futures contracts from Indian futures markets, which included stock and commodity indices, commodities, government securities, and currencies. This study involved a two-stage methodology. In the first part, the E-GARCH model was used to investigate the disproportionate volatility response to various types of shocks. The second part of the methodology focused on investigating the coexistent relations between open interest, trading volume, and volatility using multiple regression analysis. Findings: The results showed that trading volume and open interest affected volatility, but the direction and quantum of impact depended on various variables. It was also found that trading volume and volatility had positive coexistent relations for most futures contracts. Practical Implications: These findings have substantial inferences and repercussions for portfolio managers, analysts, and investors for investment assessments and decisions regarding asset allocations in futures markets. Higher volatility will lead to a higher level of fretfulness among market participants and investors, which will push them to be more risk-averse. The results of the study also have pertinent effects for policymakers with respect to the Indian stock market and global countries.

The data were examined using Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction (VEC) model, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, and Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GJR-GARCH) model to measure the price discovery and volatility spillovers. For price discovery, most of the sample cases had a long-run equilibrium relationship between their spot and futures prices, and the futures (spot) market led the spot (futures) market in the long-run in most sample periods (post-ESDC period). In case of volatility spillover, most of the results concluded the dominance of the futures market over the spot market except crude oil in the post-ESDC period. All these factors made the futures market more efficient and cost-competitive in terms of price discovery. So, it can be concluded that the market participants may depend on the futures market’s price changes for their investment and trading decisions. The results of during and post-crisis periods may be helpful for the current investors for modification of their optimum portfolio.

The main objective of this paper was to investigate the impact of macroeconomic variables on nonperforming loans by categorizing the Indian scheduled banks into four categories namely public, private, foreign, and SBI associate banks. Altogether, five macroeconomic variables were taken focusing on economic growth, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and exchange rate vulnerabilities. Using GMM model, the findings showed that macroeconomic variables differed for all the categories of banks as for public sector banks, including State Bank of India and its associates, all the variables were significant ; whereas, for private banks, inflation, growth rate, and interest rate were significant factors. On the contrary, foreign banks were more affected by exchange rate fluctuations apart from other macroeconomic variables. The findings of the study provided insights about how this relationship between macroeconomic variables and NPAs changed among the different categories of banks on the basis of ownership, thus assisting bankers and policy makers in taking precautionary measures while drafting banking and monetary policies as ownership of the banks plays a key role in the overall banking management, which we can also see from the analysis that over the years, private and foreign banks have considerably reduced their share of nonperforming loans from the overall share of NPAs in Indian commercial banks. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This study used a sample of 29 pairs of acquiring and target firms involved in M&As during the period from April 1,2000 to March 31,2010. The study developed four hypotheses examining separately the impact of M&As on shareholder value of acquiring, target, and combined firms. The study reported little but significant positive abnormal returns accruing to the shareholders of acquiring firms, while shareholders of target firms were found to have suffered significant losses over a 41-day event period around the announcement of M&As, which is contrary to existing literature in Western countries, which has stated that only the targets create value, and the acquirers are value destructive. This is an important contribution to the existing literature that the theories in the Western countries may not necessarily hold valid in India, and they need to be reassessed before being implemented in the Indian context. Another important findings of the study was that M&As overall were found destroying value for the shareholders of the hypothetical combined entity.","Abnormal returns; Acquirers; Acquisitions; Combined entity; Event study; Mergers; Shareholder value; Targets",""

Therefore, during the period of crisis, international investors tried to diversify their investments in more promising countries. BRICS countries, being a global market hub, have been growing faster than the world growth rate and saw more investment movements during and after this period. The present study attempted to evaluate the impact of the financial crisis on BRICS countries' stock markets. The impact was examined by analyzing the growth rate of BRICS countries' stock markets index prices in the pre and post crisis period (from 2002-2015) with the application of a dummy based model considering time as a dummy. Our results revealed that the BRICS were subject to a spillover effect during and following the financial crisis. Brazilian, Russian, and Chinese markets had a negative growth in index prices and captured more volatility and thereby, increased the risk of investors; whereas, the Indian and South African markets captured some degree of shock in the beginning of the crisis, but showed a positive momentum. We further found that in the long run, these nations recovered successfully from the crisis as they invited more foreign investments in their markets to recover. © 2018 Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The disclosure of accounting practices have developed in accordance with the changing economic, political, technological, and social environments to fulfill the objectives of financial reporting. There are two major types of corporate disclosures: (a) mandatory disclosure and (b) voluntary disclosure. Reporting mandatory disclosure is compulsory as per laws and regulations, and disclosure which is not compulsory, but recommended to be disclosed with mandatory reports, is said to be voluntary. In the present study, a total of 435 investors and 150 managerial employees were selected as the sample size for the study. Simple random sampling technique was used for investors, and judgmental sampling technique was used for managerial persons. The statistical tools used for the analysis were univariate oneway ANOVA and multivariate discriminant analysis. Univariate ANOVA was used to identify the significance of the differences in the levels of perception between the two groups. This test was preferred over t-test (as there were two respondent groups) as test of equality of group means is a pre-requisite for running discriminant analysis. The discriminant analysis was used to identify the variables that were important in group separation. It was concluded that CFR was important for investors, and disclosure status of most of the mandatory and voluntary items in corporate annual reports was good, but with significant differences in such opinion levels between the two groups, which may be attributed to inconsistency in the disclosures. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The results showed the existence of a strong relationship between promoter ownership and firm performance, whilethe non linearstudyshowed a slight U shaped relationship, indicating a slight reduction in performance of the firm to a certain point with an increase in promoter ownership and then a gradual increase in firm performance with an increase in promoter ownership after that point. The results of the non linear study were significant as it showed that the performance of the firms was maximum when the promoter holding in the firms was the highest. This goes against the theory of promoter entrenchment and justifies the craze of Indian investors for promoter led firms with substantial holdings.

We performed sectoral as well as overall analysis of a sample of 174 deals. We analyzed performance in three ways; in the form of growth of shareholder wealth of acquirers in nominal terms, growth of shareholder wealth of acquirers in real terms, and finally, a one on one comparison of performance in nominal terms vis a vis real terms.

The study covered a period from April 1,2012 to March 31,2018. The violations of LBCs indicated that options were underpriced (mispriced). The frequency and magnitude of mispriced signals were examined according to liquidity and maturity of the options contracts. This was done with the view that mere mispricing of options does not indicate inefficiency of the market. It is the opportunity to extract abnormal profit (arbitrage) from these mispriced signals which poses a serious threat to the market efficiency. It was observed that most of the mispriced signals were concentrated at the thinly traded region and options which were going to get expired. The magnitude of mispriced signals at the thinly traded region and options which were going to get expired was significantly larger than the moderately and highly traded levels and options, which were far away from the maturity date. Furthermore, in order to validate whether the differences in the magnitude of violations were statistically significant, the hypotheses were formulated and tested for both the call and put options. The results of the study suggested that the Indian index options market during the period of study was efficient as most of the mispriced signals were not exploitable due to lack of liquidity. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Some countries have opted for ""convergence"" - adoption with modifications for merging with domestic standards. Some companies (particularly those listed on stock exchanges) have adopted IFRS voluntarily.

ARCH, GARCH (1, 1), and bivariate GARCH - BEKK model was applied to examine and explore the volatility behavior and its spillover from one country to another. The results of the study indicated that the Chinese market suffered the greatest fluctuation and the Indian financial market was the most stable market amongst the chosen markets. A strong regional economic integration and analogous growth pattern was observed between Hong Kong and India. The results further hinted that previous volatility had more impact on the current volatility in comparison to the shocks or news coming to the markets as GARCH coefficient was found to be much larger than ARCH coefficient for each of the markets. The stock market of China was less sensitive to its past shocks; whereas, the stock market of Japan was the most sensitive to its own past shocks. The GARCH coefficient was highest for China. Therefore, it may be concluded that volatility was more persistent in Chinese markets. According to GARCH - BEKK, information was shared swiftly between stock markets of all the countries, however, with a varied degree. The cross market ARCH effect was strongest between China and Japan followed by Hong Kong and Japan, and it was weakest for China and India. Persistency of cross market volatility was highest for the pair of China and India followed by Hong Kong and India, and lowest for China and Japan. © 2018 Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

'Push' factors were seen as the reason for capital flows to an economy and found a high proportion of synchronization of GCFs across financial markets, well-exemplified in the asset bubble (AB) formation, and financial crisis of 2008 (Ghosh, Qureshi, Kim, & Zalduendo, 2014). The role of financial linkages and transmission channels in the spread of the crisis was examined by Blanchard, Dell'Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) and Dungey, Osborn, and Raghvan (2013). In India, RBI manages the impact of GCFs on the economy and its effectiveness depends upon the efficacy of the transmission channel, especially the asset price and credit channel. Therefore, conditional to an efficient transmission channel, should the RBI contemplate an interest rate response to contain plunging asset prices during an AB formation, making it imperative to investigate the working and effectiveness of the asset price channel in India. The current paper scientifically probed this question, 'Can the RBI manage asset prices in the event of a bubble?' The study used monthly time series data of various variables of BSE from January 2004-2013 and checked the causality between them. Results established causality between GCFs to India and BSE turnover with a 2-month lag. Results of pairwise Granger causality concluded that repo rate Granger caused BSE Sensex returns with a 3-month lag, which is relatively a long-lag, if RBI wants the mechanism to work during a crisis situation. The credit channel was most sluggish (32-month lag), implying that if RBI slashed interest rates to increase availability of credit in the market, then its move might not be impactful as banks might not pass on the cut to the customers/real economy. © 2018 Indian Journal of Finance.","Asset bubbles; Global capital flows (GCFs); Granger causality; India; Monetary policy",""

In recent years, the Indian stock market has witnessed a tremendous growth in all the facets of trading, that is, number of companies listed, market capitalization, membership, value of trading,volume of trading per day, and so forth. The Indian benchmark stock index SENSEX by June 2015 had grown massively to over 27,780.83 from 3,658 in January 1998. This unprecedented growth in the Indian stock market raises the interest over the efficiency of the stock market. The present paper tested the weak-form of market efficiency in the Indian stock market by testing the random walk hypothesis in the return series. According to the random walk hypothesis, the stock movements are random and unpredictable. Weighted index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (SENSEX) was examined for the study from 1998 to July 2015 by using daily data and weekly data. A battery of tests were applied on the data, that is, autocorrelation test, unit root test, and variance ratio test. The empirical evidence found from the autocorrelation test conclusively rejected the serial dependency in the series observed, and hence proclaimed the existence of the random walk hypothesis in the Indian stock market. ADF, DF-GLS, PP, and KPSS tests were performed to find the significance of unit root, and the results from the unit root test were consistent with the autocorrelation test. Similar and very strong evidence was found from the results of the variance ratio test also. Reasonable empirical evidence was found to prove the weak-form of market efficiency in the Indian stock market through this paper. © 2017, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.

It provides a competitive response of futures prices which are derived from spot prices. Basically, a commodity derivative is multifarious in a growing country like India. India is one of the leading producers of agriculture commodities. The main aim of this study was to find out the effectiveness of commodity derivatives in price discovery in agriculture commodities in India. The price discovery relationship of 10 agricultural commodities was investigated. The daily price information of 10 agriculture commodities namely wheat, sugar, chili, mustardseed, chana (Bengal gram whole), pepper, turmeric, soybean, barley, and maize were taken from NCDEX for the period from 2005 to 2015. The study used simple descriptive statistics, ADF test, PP-test, Johansen co-integration, and Granger causality test to find the answers. We found that there is long-run equilibrium relationship established in 10 commodities. The outcome of the Granger causality test showed unidirectional Granger lead-lag relationships between spot and futures markets in all agricultural commodities in which there were two co-integrations and causality. The findings of the study have important policy and regulatory implications for the Indian commodity futures market.

Panel data models were used to validate Lintner models of dividend policy. The explanatory variables such as EPS, lagged dividend, cash flow, and capex were found to be the most important variables that affected the current dividend policy of the Indian banks.

The average equity multiplier (EM) was 1.434 which shows that companies had used significant amount of debt to finance the purchase of assets. The study demonstrated that a fixed effect panel data analysis is much better than the pooled OLS regression results to explain variation in RoE. RoE is not only influenced significantly by RoA, but also by company specific characteristics which the conventional model fails to capture. Hausman test was run to decide on whether a fixed effect model or random effect model will be suited for the analysis.

Similarly, studies that have investigated hospital efficiency using multiple operational inputs and outputs abound. In this study, however, there was an attempt to explore the intervening effects of hospital efficiency on the nature and magnitude of the relationship between financial & non-financial ratios and cash-flow from operations (CFFO) as a hospital financial performance indicator in India. In view of the afore-mentioned purpose, this study used multivariate panel-data regression technique on the data gathered from 28 standalone multi-specialty private sector hospitals in India for the time period between the years 2012-2013 to 2014-2015.Predictor variables were selected logically based on prior research findings and regressed against CFFO using a fixed effect model with hospital efficiency condition acting as a moderator. Relative hospital efficiencies were calculated using data-envelopment analysis (DEA) technique. The relative efficiency scores were then converted to binary moderator values. The findings from this study indicated towards a direct positive and significant relation between predictor variables, in particular, debt-equity ratio (DER), capital-employed turnover (CET), net-revenue per patient (NRP), and occupancy rate (OR) with CFFO. Further, this study also found a negative and significant relationship between patient's average length of stay (ALOS) and CFFO. Furthermore, this study also found that hospital efficiency conditions significantly moderated the relationship between the above mentioned variables in their expected direction of relationship. This study also offered insights into the nature, significance, and managerial implications that emerged from the empirical findings of this study.

There is lack of such studies, specifically in the context of India, that provide any empirical support on either positive or negative impact of GST. Thus, the present study sought to empirically analyze the performance of companies after one year of GST implementation. Probability sampling was used to get the relevant sample. A total of 192 BSE listed companies were taken for analysis. Financial parameters (total assets, profit, and market capitalization for FY2017 and FY 2018) and demographic variables (size and experience of companies) were used to analyze the impact of GST roll out. The results indicated that among all three financial parameters, only total assets were significantly different from the pre GST time (FY2017). Further analysis highlighted that age and size of the company also affected the equation and were found significant in influencing the performance of companies after GST implementation. Detailed analysis and results were subsequently discussed in this paper.

In India also, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) converged its accounting standards with IFRSs and accordingly, corporate financial statements beginning accounting year 2016-17 started disclosing financial figures based on fair value measurement. One of the purposes of fair value measurement is to narrow the gap between balance sheet value and market value of a company. Fair value measurement aims at fair recording of a business transaction so that the financial statements are able to show a true and fair view of the profitability and financial position. Fair value measurement can be applied to different elements of financial statements. I put this measurement basis to test through a case with reference to fair value mechanism applicable to purchase of current investments and their continuing holding on the balance sheet date. The results clearly supported the philosophy behind the fair value measurement basis. To sum up, it was found that the FV measurement does away with window dressing, makes the financial statements more transparent, closer to real market value, less volatile, and more predictable in accordance with the principle of substance over form, which is becoming all pervasive now. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the financial, operational, and managerial health of selected largest scheduled commercial banks in India with different ownership structure, such as public (State Bank of India), private (ICICI Bank), and foreign banks (Standard Chartered Bank). To achieve this objective, panel data was collected from authentic websites for the period from 2001-2002 to 2010-2011 for banks judged with globally accepted ratio based CAMEL model parameters and average of sub-parameters. In addition to this, one-way ANOVA (parametric test) was applied to statistically measure whether mean variance existed among these banks' ratios and performance. The findings revealed that these banks performed satisfactorily overall after the adoption of reforms. However, SBI was positioned at the top followed by SCB and ICICI Bank in India.

In the course of such analysis, it brings to light some departures from rational decision making by investors which are termed as biases. In cognitively complex situations, individuals use biases to take the most optimum, but not the most rational decisions. The purpose of creating archetypes of investors is to customize investment advice based on biases exhibited by the individual investor. The benefit of archetypes is that they help in communicating a lot of information without much explanation or analysis. Hence, this is a very practical tool to assist financial service providers to understand the investment decision making process and develop more effective financial products that would help investors in achieving their investment goals. Design/Methodology: The research was primarily descriptive in nature and quantitative in approach. Survey technique through the use of a questionnaire was used to collect numerical data, which was empirically investigated via statistical computation techniques. An initial inventory of 24 items pertaining to 21 biases was assessed for validity, was subjected to pilot tests, and subsequently to various rounds of modification. The final data were collected from 389 respondents using a questionnaire that captured the biases. The archetypes were created using principal component analysis. Findings: The research came up with archetypes of investors based on heuristics and biases they exhibited. The archetypes were thus named by us as: The Stereotypical Investor, The Nervous Investor, The Imitator, The Naïve Investor, The Cautious Investor, and The Passive Investor. Practical Implications: The paper provided a very practical tool not only to investors to understand their own biases, but also to portfolio managers about how investors differ behaviourally. This will give investors a better chance to achieve desired outcomes in the stock market. This will not only result in improving the quality of their advice, but also help them in structuring better asset allocations customised to suit the investor. © 2018 Indian Joural Of Finance.","Behavioral finance; Biases in investing; Factor analysis; Investor archetypes",""

For this purpose, we studied insurance development indicators, that is, insurance density and penetration and investigated their link with GDP growth. Later, we checked the role of demographic factors such as age dependency ratio, urban population growth, life expectancy, and adult literate population in explaining insurance density and penetration. Using Toda Yomamoto VAR Granger causality framework, the study found two-way causality between insurance development and economic progress supporting a feedback hypothesis on two-way association between insurance development and economic growth. Further, using ARDL bounds approach, we found a long run causality between life expectancy and insurance development. The study concluded by pointing the role of risk aversion caused by life uncertainty in promoting insurance development. It also brought out the importance of insurance development in economic growth, with scope of further research on similar lines by considering the role of insurance and its broader investigations. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This study dealt with a comparative evaluation of four Value-at-Risk models namely, historical VaR, normal VaR, GARCH (1,1) VaR, and volatility weighted historical simulation (VWHS) VaR in terms of their prediction accuracy for an active portfolio of Indian equities. Daily NAVs of 34 Indian equity growth mutual fund schemes for a period of 10 years were used to calculate 95% VaR and backtest the results using Kupiec's POF test for all four VaR models. To identify the better performing VaR methods accurately, the analysis was performed in two phases: pre-crisis analysis and post crisis analysis. We concluded that there was a significant (insignificant) difference in performance of different VaR models if market conditions during VaR calculation and VaR backtesting periods were in contrast (congruence) to each other. The study found VWHS to be a better methodology for measuring VaR of an active portfolio of Indian equity stocks in both phases of the analysis. The results are relevant for traders & retail and institutional investors who hold stocks of Indian companies in their portfolio and need to calculate VaR as a measure of market risk for their positions.","Backtesting; GARCH (1,1) VaR; Historical VaR; Kupiec's POF test; Normal VaR; Value at risk; Volatility weighted historical simulation VaR",""

More than 70% of Indian citizens are located in rural areas. For India's economy to be strong, the rural India needs to grow. Financial inclusion is a crucial driver for such growth by providing the financial products/services and information to large sections of society and ICT (information and communication technologies) has an imperative role to play. Usage of ICT in rural financial arena would help in attaining the goal of financial inclusion at an affordable timely and efficient manner. Various ICT based interventions/models have been initiated by RBI and a number of financial institutions in the industry. But there is lack of financial intervention that has been co-created in conjunction with local farmers/people. Inspired by the success of one of such co- developed participatory model in rural procurement and marketing infrastructure that is popularly known as E-Choupal, we attempted to replicate the experience in the financial sector. The study conceptualized an E-Choupal Rural Financial Intervention Model with an aim to deliver financial products/services and information by leveraging ITC's E-Choupal network that must be tested for feasibility, efficiency, and sustainability. The proposed rural financial inclusion model would use the E-Choupal and Choupal Sagar networks to increase admittance to various financial products/services and information in the intervention areas.

In order to serve the development needs of the country, nearly 20 commercial banks were nationalized between 1969 and 1980. This brought nearly 80% of the banking industry under the government control. For two decades, public sector banks dominated the banking space and exhibited enhanced performance. However, in the late 1980s, the performance and growth of public sector banks started waning, confronted by problems of low productivity and high costs. This called for an urgent need for reforms in the banking industry. After the introduction of financial sector reforms in 1993, the public sector banks could not sustain competition from new-generation techsawy private banks. Despite attempts of the government to revive the banking industry, public sector banks continued to show poor performance and accumulating NPAs. After the global financial crisis in 2007, India witnessed economic slowdown and subsequent recession. During this phase, private banks started eclipsing the banking scenario, surpassing the performance of public sector banks. With major share of public sector banks in the country's banking business, it becomes imperative to examine the financial performance of the public sector banks in India. Time series data were engaged for the study. Financial performance of the public sector bank group was examined and evaluated on the basis of selected financial parameters. The entire time period of the study from 1995-96 to 2016-17 was fragmented into two phases, Phase I being the period immediately following reforms and before the financial crisis set in (1995-96 to 2006-07), and Phase II coinciding with the post global financial crisis period (2007-08 to 2016-17). The study concluded that all indicators of financial performance of the public sector bank group showed positive trends during the first phase; whereas, they exhibited falling trends over the second phase of the analysis period. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Previous research has showed that the financial risk tolerance (FRT) of an individual is influenced by several demographic factors of the individual such as age, gender, marital status, education, profession, income, number of dependents in the family, etc. The capacity also varies from country to country and place to place within a country. Hence, knowledge of the demographic data of the individual can help researchers to understand how each of these factors impact the retail investors residing in a particular place, city, or a state in taking financial risk. In this paper, we collected primary demographic data from 2000 residents of Kolkata, Asansol, and Durgapur, the three major cities of the state of West Bengal in India with an aim to find out the impact of each of these demographic factors of the respondents (the potential retail investors) on theirtolerance to financial risk.

The data collected for the study consisted of the daily closing prices of S&P CNX Nifty index options contracts from April 1,2012 to March 31,2017. The study demonstrated a frequent violation of box-spread parity. However, when the frequency and magnitude of the mispriced signals (violation of box-spread parity) were observed in light of specified liquidity and maturity levels, it was observed that most of the mispriced signals were concentrated at the illiquid levels and options which were going to get expired, and the magnitude of mispriced signals at the illiquid levels and options which were going to get expired were significantly larger than that of the liquid levels and options which were far away from the maturity date. Further, in order to verify whether the differences in the mean magnitude of the mispriced signals at different liquidity and maturity of the options contracts were statistically significant, the hypotheses were formulated and tested. The results of the study suggested that the Indian index options market during the period of study was efficient as most of the abnormal profits from the mispriced signals were not exploitable due to lack of liquidity. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

As the recession is prominent in the developed and the developing countries, therefore, this condition can provide respite in the form of a path to be followed to arrest recession. In order to analyze this condition, five variables were taken in this study namely; exports, imports, GNI, exchange rate, and world income. The annual data were collected from the World Bank database. All these variables were tested for stationarity and then for cointegration via SAS and finally, OLS technique was applied in order to find the import and export elasticity. The condition was tested separately for India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and then the comparisons were drawn. The results showed that this condition was satisfied in all three countries, but there were still certain important differences in the scenarios in the countries which led to the justification of the Marshall-Lerner condition.

However, mispricing between futures and spot markets of commodities has persisted from time to time due to market inefficiencies, which are taken care by rational investors and arbitrageurs present in the market. The study aimed to examine the speed, magnitude, and significance of error correction in the presence of arbitrage opportunities and the causality relationship between the spot and the futures markets of selected highly traded agricultural commodities namely, cardamom, cotton, crude palm oil, and mentha oil traded on the leading commodity exchange of India, that is, MCX. The results of vector error correction model provided empirical evidence that there existed significant error correction and causality between the futures and spot prices of selected agricultural commodities in India. Even though the futures and spot prices of these commodities were co-integrated in the long run, but in the short-run, there arose a disequilibrium resulting in exploitable arbitrage opportunities. Trading by the arbitrageurs in these markets leads to significant error correction, thereby bringing the markets into equilibrium again. Also, bi-directional causality between the markets was observed for all commodities with futures markets Granger causing spot markets more strongly.

This study attempted to study the impact of macroeconomic determinants on the non-performing loans of BRICS countries covering the period from 2000-2016. The BRICS bloc was considered for the study as various previous studies showed that trading blocs also get affected by inter country non-performing loans' issues. This study used dynamic panel data approach for analysis using the fully modified ordinary least square model (FMOLS) along with cointegration analysis, and for robustness checks, this model incorporated the fixed and random ordinary least square methods. The results showed that unemployment had a positive relation with non-performing loans; whereas, growth and financial soundness of a country had a negative relation with non-performing loans. Saving rate of households also had an inverse relation with non-performing loans and inflation rate also showed a negative relation with default loans. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Using data from a sample of 42 listed companies from the Indian auto-component industry for the period from 2008 - 2013, this study applied the most attractive IC measurement model known for its practical and empirical validity (Zeghal & Maaloul, 2010). This measurement methodology is called the modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (M-VAIC) propounded by Nimtrakoon (2015). This is an optimized framework that improvises the popular and widely - used Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC™ ) model of Pulic (2000, 2004, 2008) as addition of new variables to the VAIC™ model improves its explanatory power. Findings: The Indian auto component manufacturing companies seemed to be performing effectively by utilizing their IC as seen by the empirical results during the period from 2008 - 2013 in spite of the economic recession of 2008 and its aftermath. Research Limitations/Implications: The results suggested that stakeholders still perceive the performance of firms in terms of tangible assets as the sole driver of organization success and less in terms of IC.

Practical Implications: There is an imperative need for researchers, academics, business practitioners, and policy makers to get aware of IC and pitchfork it into the core of business. This study would benefit all stakeholders to achieve financial performance. Originality/Value: This is one of the pioneering attempts to measure IC and its relationship with the traditional measures of corporate performance in the Indian auto - component industry.

The entire credit goes to the regulatory framework, which maintains an effective surveillance on the banks in India on an emulative extent. However, the claim of a well-knit banking framework has not translated itself into its capability to insulate the banks from potential credit risk. The accumulation of bad loans poses a threat to the impending erosion of otherwise productive assets within the banks. Though the Indian banking system has moved enormously on the competitive side, from its conventional social banking approach, ever since the new economic policy regime in the early 1990s, non-performing assets (NPAs) still remain an unresolved issue in the country. The present study examined the chronological trends in NPAs in the Indian banking system in the new millennium. The various dimensions of NPAs of public sector banks, private sector banks, and foreign banks in India were examined. The pre-and-post global meltdown trends were compared as part of the study. Fifteen years of data pertaining to NPAs of the financial institutions under study were obtained from the CMIE database and were subject to statistical analysis using SPSS.

According to India Forensic Consultancy Services, at least 1200 companies listed on domestic stock exchanges counterfeited their financial statements. The increasing rate of such undesired acts laid path for the investigation into such practices. This empirical research work was conducted to predict the signs of earnings manipulation of companies listed with the BSE 100 index by using the probabilistic Beneish M score eight variable model. Time frame for the investigation of financial statements' data was confined to 2011 to 2016 to calculate the M score. Based on M score results of each year, the companies were classified into two groups: likely manipulator and non-likely manipulator. Then multinomial regression technique was used to find the most significant variables that affected manipulation. The outcomes of the results revealed that three ratios, namely TATA (total accruals to total assets), DSRI (daily sales in receivables index), and SGI (sales growth index) variables could be considered as signals of earnings manipulation by companies. The present work contributes to the literature through identification of probable earnings manipulators in BSE 100 index companies which investors prefer the most for their equity investments. The research findings may be an eye-opener for regulators/policy makers to implement stringent checks on auditing of financial results of the companies. Furthermore, the research would be useful for the investors to go for face validation of companies instead of relying on misrepresentation of their true value. © 2018 Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Therefore, the aim of this paper was to examine the executives' perspectives on IR in the Malaysian context regarding their awareness, benefits, costs, training requirements apart from ascertaining how organizations are preparing themselves towards adoption and disclosure of the IR. Using a simple random sampling method, 150 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia agreed to participate in the survey, however, responses were received from 50 companies only. Derived from literature review, a questionnaire was used to collect the data during April-June 2017. Majority of the respondents were senior managers and managers from accounting and finance functions. The responses were measured on a Likert scale. The findings revealed that none of the surveyed companies had yet adopted IR as the new reporting tool, yet 56% of them were considering adopting IR due to potential derived benefits. In Malaysia, the level of knowledge about IR is still at a lower level due to users' general lack of familiarity with the IR model. Therefore, training will benefit the companies' executives to increase their awareness and knowledge of IR gradually. This gives us positive and integrated thinking towards IR in Malaysia. The Malaysian Institute ofAccountants (MIA) emerged as the leading agency for enforcement of IR and is to be made a mandatory requirement for financial reporting in Malaysia. The study suggested that future studies may be targeted to the executives who have primary responsibility for preparing IR, in addition to focusing on determinants of IR adoption and implementations. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

It plays a vital role in various socioeconomic activities. A strong banking sector is essential for a robust economy. The poor performance of the banking sector in terms of financial risk management may adversely impact the other sectors of the economy. In India, non - performing asset (NPA) is a key factor that enhances the credit risk substantially for any bank. The performance of the public sector banks in risk management in the recent past years has been declining in view of NPAs. The ability of the banks to identify defaulters before lending is paramount for minimizing the incidence of NPAs as well as developing effective mechanism to proactively deal with potential defaulters. Various financial indicators such as quick ratio, profit after tax (PAT) as percentage of net worth, total net worth, and cash profit as percentage of total income will enable the concerned authority to spot possible defaulters and take appropriate corrective measures. With this background, an attempt was made in this paper to study key factors leading to non - performing assets. This research study focused on how the key factors impact NPAs based on insights derived from three important classifications and predictive models namely random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and logistic regression.

The sporadic surge in capital inflows have caused a great deal of fluctuations on the domestic exchange rate. Considering this, we analyzed different channels through which the RBI intervened in the foreign exchange market to provide greater leeway in conduct of the monetary policy. The study found that after the global financial crisis, RBI has proactively been engaged into selling of foreign currency concurrently with buying of dollars in the forex market so that the Indian rupee can be stabilized, and currency volatility can be diminished. However, prior to the crisis in the aftermath of unprecedented capital inflows, foreign reserves were accumulated to stabilize the exchange rate. We investigated the extent of sterilization of capital inflows by deploying a sample of quarterly data over the period from 2002 - 2015 and found that reserve money was sterilized to a significantly higher degree during the pre-crisis period (2002-2007) than the post-crisis period (2008-2015). The impact of direct intervention by the central bank was found largely effective in the post-crisis period. Further, this study highlighted various challenges emanating from sterilization to the economy in terms of burden of interest payment on the government securities and less availability of funds as needed for developmental expenditures. Full sterilization of reserve money may reduce exchange rate volatility and can provide much control over domestic monetary conditions; however, the risks of financial instability remain present. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

In the next section, implications of current demonetization (2016) were discussed. The media reports indicated that 80% of the money transactions are based on physical cash which, in turn, opens the door for the problems like corruption, black money, terrorism funding, etc. Cashless economy (which means use of minimum cash and the rest of the transactions through different electronic modes of transactions) will greatly solve the above problems. Adding to this, the ideology of Bokil Anil of Arthakranthi Foundation on cashless economy and their benefits, if implemented, were also discussed.","Cashless economy; Cashless economy; Demonetization; Ideology of Arthakranthi; Implications",""

For a long-time, economists were looking for plausible explanations for wide spread poverty, inequality, and unsustainable growth in many parts of the world. When financial inclusion programmes started as a policy response for exclusion, the contents of the programme touched upon some basic issues such as access through an account, creation of awareness, and use of various banking products so that the excluded persons acquire the skill sets to manage money wisely and improve their financial well being. The present study was undertaken to ascertain the product awareness of account holders getting inducted to the formal financial system through one of the largest financial inclusion programmes of the world currently in operation in India under the name of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Programme (PMJDY). A survey was conducted during August 2016-May 2017 by administering a questionnaire on 453 account holders covering 18 out of 30 districts in Odisha, a state located in the eastern region of India. The findings of the study revealed that while gender influenced the awareness of account holders, general awareness levels of account holders about various basic financial products and services was found to be low, calling for suitable interventions for realizing the full benefits of the programme. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This resulted in the establishment of International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) which issued International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a global standard for company financial statements. More than 120 countries, including European Union, Australia, Canada have already adopted IFRS. India was expected to converge with IFRS from April 2016 for listed and unlisted companies with a net worth of more than rs 500 crores. However, few Indian companies listed internationally are voluntarily reporting IFRS. The present study aimed to understand the effect of this voluntary reporting of IFRS on key financial ratios of four selected IT sector companies. The study compared 12 major financial ratios under IFRS and Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (IGAAP) as reported in their financial statements for a period of 5years from 2009-10 to 2013-14. For the purpose of the study, financial ratios representing four key dimensions of companies namely liquidity, leverage, profitability, and efficiency were considered. To understand the statistical significance of the difference between the ratios, Wilcoxon signed rank test, a non parametric test was used. Of the 12 ratios analyzed, 10 were found to be statistically significant. Further, the study explained the financial statement items which cause the difference in the ratios of these companies. The results indicated current liability and shareholder's equity to be significant at the 10% level, thus explaining the difference in financial statement items under IFRS.","Convergence; Financial markets; International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)",""

The enactment of the IRDAI Act in 1999 brought in a lot of opportunities with the rising presence of private and foreign players in the country's life insurance sector. On the flip side, the Indian life insurance sector experienced severe setbacks in terms of low profits and negative investment yield post 2007-08 owing to the contagion effects of the global financial crisis that erupted in U.S. during the year 2007-08. At the same time, the liberalization of the country's life insurance sector has further raised concerns for the life insurers in ensuring financial soundness for timely payment of assured returns to the policyholders' besides protection of the policyholders' interests. The present study provided an assessment of the financial soundness of 18 life insurance firms in India during the post-deregulation study-period from 2008-09 to 2014-15 in the backdrop of the U.S. financial crisis. In this regard, the ratio-based CARAMELS framework was used in line with the financial soundness indicators (FSIs), as proposed by the researchers of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The present study pointed out the impressive performances of the private life insurers in overpowering the dominance of the state-owned LICI, besides highlighting the contagion effects of the global financial crisis on the country's life insurance sector.","CARAMELS; Financial soundness; IRDAI; Life insurance; US financial crisis",""

With this rationale, service firms were selected for the study for the time frame from 2011 to 2015, and the nature and determinants of their capital structure are studied. Since interest expense gives tax shelter to firms, the trade-off theory suggests that firms may be incentivized to use these shelters and thus increase leverage. Therefore, this theory was put to test here. The pecking order theory which states that the firm will raise capital from internal accruals followed by debt and finally equity was supported by the research in this paper. Further conclusion derived from the study was that capital structure, as measured by debt-to-asset ratio, remained stable in the 5- year period with an industry average of about 0.31. This study also tested the hypothesis on the trade off model of capital structure, which stated that there is an optimal capital structure which firms tend to move toward, and several approaches were adopted to measure if this hypothesis was true. While firms' debt level in a year could be reasonably predicted by the debt-to-asset ratio in the prior year, the fit of the OLS regression became progressively worse as the number of lagging years was increased, suggesting that capital structure was sticky. The industry debt-to-asset ratio, while statistically significant as a predictor of firm debt level, resulted in a regression with a poor overall fit. While there is evidence to accept the pecking order hypothesis, there was not enough evidence to reject the trade-off model of capital structure for Indian service firms in the selected time period.","Debt-to-asset ratio; Mean reversion; Pecking ordertheory; Static tradeoff theory",""

The study used data of 41 Indian listed firms excluding financial services firms listed on Nifty indices on National Stock Exchange over a time frame of 14 years. The dependent variables taken for financial leverage were EBITDA to interest expense, equity to total assets, and long - term debt to total assets. The capital structure composition was studied across various dimensions, that is, profitability, tangibility, growth, size, volatility, ownership pattern, etc. along with other external dimensions such as taxation policy. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics, correlation, and stepwise regression analysis. Three different models were constructed for analysis through stepwise multiple regression to deduce a unique set of explanatory variables that affected the leverage measure of firms. These models helped to analyze the maximum number of significant factors that had an impact upon the capital structure composition during the post liberalization period in India. The findings of this study suggested that all the explanatory variables studied in the three models were statistically significant with leverage.

Theoretically, composition of capital structure has a significant stake in determining the earnings available to equity holders and thereby, the market value of a firm. If it is so, a better understanding about the determinants of capital structure is inevitable to manage the decisions of a firm. This study attempted to identify the determinants of capital structure of passenger cars companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) of India. The long-term debt to total capital ratio was considered as the dependent variable representing the capital structure. The determinants of capital structure which were considered as the independent variables are: (a) size of the firm, (b) profitability, (c) tangibility, (d) growth in assets, (e) non-debt tax shield, (f) debt service capacity, and (g) dividend payout ratio. A panel regression was run to identify the determinants by following a logical procedure for establishing the relationship. Though the independent variables were sensibly and carefully chosen from the existing literature, none of these determinants were found to have a statistically significant relationship with capital structure in the case of passenger car companies in India. However, the overall F - statistics confirmed that the specified model with the above explanatory variables had more predictability power and could explain more than what the intercept only model could explain. © 2007 - 2018 Associated Management Consultants Private Limited.","Capital structure; Debt-equity ratio; Determinants of capital structure; Leverage",""

Few studies have focused on the adoption of electronic banking by SMEs in India. Hence, it is imperative to understand the perception of SMEs to adopt e-banking services. The purpose of this paper was to empirically study the direction of relationships between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived convenience, perceived self-efficacy, trust, perceived risk, government support, and intention to adopt online banking. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was carried out to gather quantitative data from 132 SMEs in Karnataka. The data were analyzed using the PLS method of structural equation modeling. The results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and perceived ease of use determined e-banking adoption. Trust was positively related to perceived risk of e-banking transactions. We found that perceived self-efficacy affected perceived ease of use that, in turn, determined perceived usefulness. Hence, the banks should provide training programmers to improve self-efficacy and allocate more resources to create an easy-to-use system and adopt risk reduction measures that inhibit identity theft and fraudulent activities over the Internet to foster trust among prospective SMEs. Unlike existing studies, our model included additional variables namely trust, perceived risk, perceived self-efficacy, and government support. This model could be applied to SMEs in other developing countries that are in the initial phases of adoption of online banking. © 2018 Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The importance of access to finance by one and all on an equitable basis for sustainable development of a nation has been well documented in the literature. However, mere opening of a savings account cannot serve the purpose of complete financial inclusion unless the financial services are used on a regular basis by the people. In this context, this paper made an attempt to study factors which are associated with financial inclusion by way of two parameters - using a bank account for deposit/withdrawal and using credit from institutional sources in rural India. For this purpose, data were collected from Bundelkhand region of India where farmer suicides is one of the most burning issues.

Corporate governance ratings are being published for the ease of investment decisions, and corporate governance indexes are prepared by regulatory & non-regulatory agencies and researchers. In the present study, a corporate governance index for banks in India comprising of six sub-indexes was prepared and a comparison of selected public and private sector banks was done. Using the values of the index, the relation between corporate governance and banks’ performance was ascertained using regression. It was found that corporate governance scores for private banks were greater than that of public sector banks, and when comparing the sub-indexes, private sector banks scored more in all of them, except risk management.

Factors such as an audit firm's brand and its reputation and the skills and experience of auditors' are some of the important variables influencing the audit service fee. There is a lack of evidence of a relationship between an audit premium and audit quality or the monopoly of an audit firm. In addition, a significant increase in the non-audit service fee has posed a dilemma to auditors' ethical principles. It appears that the auditors have compromised their independence, objectiveness, and professionalism to provide the financial statement assurance in order to maximize their revenues. This impression has triggered the focus of this research to revisit the determinants that control the audit and non-audit fee and empirically explore whether the above claim is valid in the context of Malaysia's business environment. This research is crucial due to increasing corporate scandals recently reported in Malaysia. The analysis was undertaken on the Annual Reports of 2012 using the partial least square (PLS) for a sample study of 100 firms listed in Malaysia's stock exchange. The analysis revealed that only the firm characteristics of foreign shareholding, market capitalization, and foreign operations have a significant relationship with both the audit and nonaudit fee.","Agency theory and corporate governance of client characteristics; Audit fee; Non audit fee",""

Profitability is a yardstick of the overall financial health of a business concern, and a very useful guide for the management, owners, shareholders, and creditors. In this paper, an attempt was made to assess profitability of115 micro manufacturing enterprises in the district of Dibrugarh in Assam with firm level data collected through field survey. The techniques of cost-volume-profit analysis and profitability ratios were employed in the study. The results indicated that majority of the firms operated above the break-even point. However, although the micro enterprises operated at safe margins and were able to break even, they were operating with very low profit margins. The category-wise analysis revealed that the worst performing sectors were agro based enterprises and weaving and textiles based enterprises, both in terms of break even analysis and profitability analysis. This led us to recommend that the government's support measures must specifically target these two weakest sectors among micro enterprises, with emphasis on financial inclusion. Also, operational efficiency in all categories needs to be improved through more investment on training in management and administration and research & development in small-scale enterprises. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Sometimes, a well - designed policy is not enough to safeguard the interests of all the stakeholders. One such prominent and time - honored modus operandi to face contingencies is the rate of provisioning to be set aside annually to meet any contingencies. The proposed study attempted to report the chronological trend in provision in Indian banks in the latest decade. Data for the study were collected from CMIE online database. Bank size and nature of ownership were considered to be the predictors of provision. The findings of our study revealed that the size of the banks influenced the rate of provisions set aside. The study also revealed a clear distinction among the banks ranked high on the basis of size than medium and low ranked banks. We also recognized the global economic downturn as an incontestable constituent to increase the percentage of provisions across all the sectors of the financial industry.","Banking failure; Banking provision; Distressed loans; Financial performance; Indian banks; Loan-loss provision; Loan-loss reserve; NPA",""

Aside from a secular trend, volatility clustering and calendar effects are two commonly occurring sources of such variation. To analyze volatility clusters in India's implied volatility index (Nifty VIX), daily closing levels for the Nifty VIX were gathered covering trading days from January 2010 through January 2014. ARIMA and GARCH models applied to the de-trended Nifty VIX time series were found to be of limited use for describing this data with its episodic clustering and periodic events. However, an alternative modelling approach using Fourier analysis and Butterworth filters successfully split the time series into two logical parts, one with both clusters and periodic behavior and one with near-white noise. The likely origins of major clusters in India's Nifty implied volatility index appeared to be linked to important global financial events external to India during the study period, thereby supporting evidence of temporal spillover into the Indian market. The half-lives of implied volatility clusters were measured and compared with those in the U.S. market. The full range of Nifty VIX behavior for the study period was seen to consist of four distinct elements: trend, periodic events, clusters of volatility, and noise. When combined, these elements provided an empirical model able to produce successful forecasts for 60-day-ahead periods.","Fourier analysis; Implied volatility; India; Nifty; Nifty VIX; Volatility clustering",""

In the absence of a formal financial system, people are forced to go to local money lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates from poor people. Financial untouchability also creates the problem of social discrimination. The only solution to fight with the evil of financial untouchability is promotion of financial inclusion, which may be defined as the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost. Financial inclusion can be achieved by ensuring access to financial services, affordability of services, and actual utilization of financial services. In order to promote financial inclusion, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched across the country. It is a mission mode project of the Government of India.

Design/Methodology/Approach: A sample of 332 individuals was considered for the study. Various socio-demographic and attitude factors were considered to find out their association with financial behavior. Regression analysis was done on these factors against financial behavior. Findings: The results of the research showed that age, marital status, household annual income, ownership of real estate, duration of investments, and frequency of review of portfolio are the most significant socio-demographic factors that determined financial behavior. The most important attitudinal factors that determined financial behavior are interest in financial matters and tendency towards savings. Practical Implications: The disposable income of an average household has increased in the past decade or so. An average household now requires professional advice to manage its funds. This has led to an increase in competition in the financial sector for acquiring individual investors/ customers. A financial institution would always like to know who its target customer is so that it can it can focus its energies towards its target customer only. This study would help in identifying the factors an institution can look at while designing its acquisition strategies. Originality/Value: Though various studies have been done to understand consumer behavior in financial services globally, not much has been done in the Indian context. The various studies that have been conducted in the Indian context have looked at the individual factors like demography and attitude. The present study is an attempt to fill this important gap in literature and looked at both these factors cohesively.","Attitude factors; Consumer behaviour; Financial services; Socio-demographic factors",""

But the situation drastically changed since the beginning of the year 2000. With the development of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) Act in 1999, private players started entering into the Indian life insurance market. At the end of the FY 2014-15, the market share of LICI stood at 73.48% with the number of private players having risen to 23 in the country's life insurance sector. One of the reasons for such a decline in the market share of LICI during the post-reform period could be attributed to the increasing competition from the private players in the country's life insurance sector.

The current research work investigated the rapport among Nifty index returns in India and the Indian exchange rate in consideration with the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate volatility generates volatility in the stock market, which creates confusion in the minds of domestic investors as well as for foreign institutional investors. The main purpose of conducting this research was to find out the impact of change in the exchange rate in India on the trading volume and returns of Nifty index.

Though the graphical analysis showed indications of higher fluctuations in returns in times of pessimistic sentiments and moderate and calm period of volatility regimes with moderate positive sentiment in the market, from further investigation, we observed that the effect of sentiment was significant only in case of the volatilities in medium and small cap portfolio returns. On examination of temporal dependency, based on ARDL modeling, we noticed significant long-term relationship between return volatility and irrational sentiments in case of such portfolios. An initial shock in the sentiment component was found to create varying magnitude of responses in volatility over the months and was observed to be disappearing after four to five months. These observations necessitate the incorporation of sentiment factors in the pricing models of assets as well as in risk estimation, especially in case of those stocks with the characteristics that are sensitive to market sentiment. Along with this, in order to pinpoint the causes of the persistence of sentiment effects, further investigations on : the nature and trading behavior of investors who participate in such market segments, level of trading and fund flows, sophistication of trading mechanism, and effectiveness of policy level initiatives to eliminate market inefficiency in these segments is recommended.","ARDL modeling; Behavioral bias; Impulse response; Market sentiment; Return volatility; Temporal dynamics",""

The beneficial effects of the financial sector on economic activity is that access to external finance may allow firms to have better capacity to acquire necessary working capital and technical inputs that could allow small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to improve profitability performance. Therefore, financial market imperfections can reduce the efficiency of this transmission mechanism and it can have serious impact on enterprises' real activities and harm their profitability. This study examined the effects of access to bank credit on SME profitability using evidence from the Ethiopian Central Statistics Agency (CSA) Manufacturing Industries Survey data for the period from 2005 to 2012. The study showed that access to bank credit does not affect SME profitability. Hence, the findings support the null hypothesis that bank credit has no significant effect on SMEs' profitability improvement in Ethiopia. The findings contribute to the often contradictory and inconclusive literatures on finance and SME performance. The results are also consistent with various prior studies and pecking order theory that proposes firms will only seek external finance when they have exhausted all sources of internal finance, but it contradicts trade-off and cash flow theories.","Bank credit; Ethiopia; Interest rate; Performance; SMEs; SMEs' profitability",""

To fulfill its objectives, this study used the most advanced autoregressive distributed lag on transformed natural log returns of these countries' benchmark indices monthly closing values. This was conducted by estimating regression equations by ordinary least squares and subsequent For Wald test, then after establishing co-integrations, it estimated conditional ARDL, and lastly obtained the short-run dynamic adjustments by estimating an error correction model. Long-run co-integration results showed that there were enough portfolio diversification opportunities for the Indian investors in Asian and Latin American markets in the overall study period. However, during the crisis period, both Indian and international investors had less number of profitable diversification opportunities as most of these international stock markets were co-integrated. In the short-run, these markets showed dynamic adjustments, especially in the post-crisis period, generally within one month, which neutralized the arbitrage opportunities.

To measure this effectiveness of microfinance training, we developed a tool in the form of a test which was administered to both trained and untrained respondents. The sample was drawn randomly from members of SHGs in rural areas of Ramanagar and Bangalore Rural District during the month of March 2015. The test contained questions on numerical ability, awareness of SHG guidelines, knowledge of government schemes, and basic awareness regarding banking and micro insurance. The results of the test were analysed using t- test and chi square. The study also revealed some important and interesting aspects apart from achieving the main objective of the study. The tool also studied the degree of difficulty faced by the respondents in answering each of the questions. Since the focus of the Indian government is on financial inclusion and financial literacy, the findings of the study will be especially useful for the designers of microfinance training.","Financial literacy; Microfinance plus; Microfinance training",""

The price discovery function was examined by using Johansen's test of cointegration (1991), vector error correction model (VECM), Wald chi-square test, and Granger causality test. The risk-management function was examined by using ordinary least squares (OLS) method and VECM to estimate optimal hedge ratio (OHR) and hedge effectiveness (HE). The study used secondary data consisting of daily closing prices of spot and futures markets for a period of 10 years (2004 - 2013) for three agricultural commodities, that is, Chana, Chilli, and Turmeric, which are traded in National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (NCDEX). It was found that there is a long-run association between commodity spot and futures prices of Chana, Chilli, and Turmeric. The VECM results revealed that there is a long-run causality running from futures prices to spot prices, which enable the spot market to adjust its short-run deviations from long-run equilibrium path with nearly 2.17%, 2.78%, and 4.41 % speed of adjustments in Chana, Chilli, and Turmeric, respectively. The Granger causality test results revealed that there is only a unidirectional causality from futures returns to spot returns of commodities - Chilli and Turmeric. However, in the case of Chana, there is a bidirectional causality between futures and spot returns. According to hedge ratios of OLS and VECM results, it was found that the commodity futures provide 50%, 56%, and 55% variance reduction in their spot prices of Chana, Chilli, and Turmeric, respectively. It is observed that the commodity futures are more effective in hedging, and the near month futures contracts are suitable for hedging.","Commodity futures; Price discovery; Price risk management; Price volatility",""

The rural sector of a developing country requires more attention than the urban sector as most of the population resides in rural areas. The government should make effective and productive steps for achieving the growth objective of the rural sector by initiating new policies and schemes. One of such initiatives taken by the government was the initiation of Swaranjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY). Benefits of this scheme are received by the poor who can be divided into categories, that is, self help group (SHG) swarozgaris and individual swarozgaris.

This study attempted to fill this gap first, by proposing a multi-dimensional index and then identifying the determinants of financial inclusion. Following similar methodology used to construct the Human Development Index (HDI), data on several dimensions of financial inclusion were used to develop an index lying between 0 and 1. The Euclidean distance formula was applied to extract the normalized indicators. The findings of the study showed that only one district in Bangladesh, that is, Dhaka achieved high stated financial inclusion, and five districts achieved medium stated financial inclusion during 2009-2013, while very low financial inclusion was observed across the remaining 58 districts out of 64 districts of Bangladesh. The empirical findings also showed that 47 districts out of 64 witnessed an improvement in the IFI score of financial inclusion. However, the extent of progress of financial inclusion in these 47 districts was found to be insignificant to change their status from low financial inclusion to medium or high financial inclusion. Among the socio-geographic variables, rural population, household size, and literacy rate; among the infrastructure variables, paved road networks, Internet; and among the banking variables, deposit penetration were found to be the significant determinants of financial inclusion. One of the major contributions of this study is that it will invoke the governments and policy makers across the world to develop a financial inclusion index for their respective countries, and thereby undertake such policies to promote financial inclusion.","Financial inclusion; Human development index; Multi-dimensional index; Normalized inverse euclidean distance",""

It means stock market volatility may tend to be greater in a declining market than in a rising market. This behavior of stock return volatility is known as asymmetric volatility or leverage effect of volatility. A healthy and vibrant capital market is important for economic development of a nation. In the present Indian scenario, stock prices in India frequently deviate from fundamental values, and it is believed that these variations are mainly due to the presence of the most dominant investment group - foreign portfolio investors. This paper attempted to analyze the stock return volatility, especially the asymmetric effect of Indian stock market return volatility and contribution of foreign portfolio investment to that volatility. The present study was conducted by taking daily data for a period of 12 years from April 1,2003 to March 31,2015 consisting of 2898 trading observations. To study the leverage effect and impact of FPI on stock market volatility, the study used ARCH family models; GARCH, E-GARCH, and TARCH. The results of the study confirmed the existence of volatility clustering and leverage effect in the Indian stock market. Hence, it was observed from the study that the investment activities of FPIs have had a significant impact on the volatility of the Indian stock market.","E-GARCH, TARCH models; Foreign portfolio investment (FPI); Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs); GARCH; Leverage effect; Stock return volatility; Volatility clustering",""

The decadal growth of the number of subsidized SHGs and loan size under these schemes indicate the fact that SHGs are more attracted towards subsidy. However, the key question that has been asked in many research studies is about the relationship of subsidy with that of longterm sustainability of MFIs/SHGs. With the help of randomly selected 150 subsidized SHGs operating in one of the eight states of North East India, that is, Meghalaya, the study established that subsidy has negatively influenced the long-term sustainability of the SHGs. In case the subsidy is withdrawn, the SHGs would be less sustainable-operationally as well as financially. Furthermore, the withdrawal of subsidy would increase the onward lending rate manifold so as to discourage the members to take any loan from the group, thus threatening the entire program.","Microfinance; Self- help-groups; Subsidized programs; Subsidy; Sustainability",""

This study investigated different theoretical approaches that have been deployed to understand this phenomenon. This article extracted the important aspects of the compensation structure and covenants required to set in the contract between venture capitalists and their limited partner (LP) in order to meet the agreed-upon proportion of return distribution and proposed a VC compensation model. Various studies were analyzed to get evidence on various aspects of a VC deal, such as the reasons why professional VCs exist, and factors that determine the design of a contract. Private ownership, information asymmetry, and illiquidity associated with a VC investment are key explanatory factors, which make VC - LP partnership agreement different from other financial contracts. The findings of this study could be alienated into two constituents. First, the compensation that a VC receives from its LP is performance based, which varies according to the size of the fund, experience of VC, past performance of VC, and signalling function. Second, some important covenants are generally mentioned in such a contract during raising funds for investments, though these are heterogeneous in each deal and their contribution in compensation allocation varies with each deal. In this study, we have proposed a compensation model for venture capitalists as a general partner by their limited partner, which is based on a principal-agent model. Also, this study focuses on contractual covenants, which are responsible for imparting flexible incentive provision and provide control over VC activity. The arrangement of VC compensation and covenants depend upon the management support and effort of VCs. This study can contribute to resolving the conflicts - between venture capitalists and their investors - that arise due to the agency problem and bring to light the compensation arrangement and provision of covenants used in the contract between VCs and their LPs.","Contractual covenants; Limited partner; Principal-agent model; VC contract; Venture capitalist compensation",""

Further, the Twelfth Finance Commission proposed incentives for State Governments in order to bring in fiscal discipline at the state level. This paper examined the long term profile and impact of high fiscal deficit, consequent debt to GDP ratio, and the need for fiscal consolidation in India. It also presented the reasons behind non-attainment of the fiscal targets set underthe FRBM bill.

There are certain issues of concern that affect their performance and efficiency. One of the major issues is the credit risk involved in the banking sector. According to the Narasimhan Committee, non performing assets (NPAs) are considered as one of the important indicators of profitability and efficiency of any bank. Lesser NPAs indicate a better position of a bank in terms of solvency. More NPAs lead to less profit because of non repayment of interest and principal amount of loan by the creditors, thereby effecting the overall profitability of a bank. Under the Self Help Group (SHG) Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP), the self help groups are linked to a bank where these groups are provided financial services for the benefits of their members. Credit disbursed to a SHG under this scheme is without collaterals. The credit disbursed under this scheme increases the risk for the banks. The main purpose of this study was to compare the public and private sector commercial banks on the basis of NPAs under the SHG Bank Linkage Programme. This paper also tried to study the region wise differences in the amount of NPAs of the public sector banks.","Bank linkage; Banking industry; Financial inclusion; Non performing assets (NPAs); Self help groups",""

The present study is the first one which explores the validity of equity market timing for the Indian market. The paper tried to overcome the limitations of previous studies by capturing the individual year effect and by categorizing the firms into three sectors of the economy- primary, secondary, and tertiary. The present study broke the myth about the capital structure decisions, in which it is believed that market timing plays a dominant role, while all other variables are not considered as important as market timing. The period of the study ranges from the year 1992-2011 and the findings revealed that Indian firms have started relying more on their internal firm level characteristics like profitability rather than on market timing for their capital structure decisions. The results were similar when the firms were classified into three sectors, even though the effect of equity market timing was more pronounced for secondary sector firms as compared to the primary and tertiary sector firms. Therefore, the decision-makers should focus on strengthening the firm level characteristics (like profitability) rather than relying solely on equity market timing.","Capital structure; Equity market timing; IPO; Three sectors of an economy",""

Multiple regression was used to test 12 hypotheses, using the data collected from the same annual reports. The results revealed that the intellectual capital disclosure level had increased as compared to the prior studies in Malaysia that suggests increased corporate awareness regarding intellectual capital disclosures, though the disclosure level was lower as compared to the other advanced countries. The results provided evidence that company size, leverage, and industry type significantly affected the intellectual capital disclosure levels. However, the intellectual capital disclosure levels did not have a significant relationship with return on total assets, board independence, audit committee independence, company age, complexity, foreign shareholding, institutional shareholding, and auditor size.

This study, therefore, investigated if there is a significant difference between the performance of firms with and those without FIDs. The paper observed that a non- significant relationship existed between the tested parameters. This non-substantial difference is likely to be due to the fact that international directors have a tendency to adjust to the socio-organizational values of the location in which they function from. The study, therefore, recommends that FIDs should be encouraged because of their different backgrounds. This will enable them to add to the firm's values and various skills which some domestic board members do not possess.

GST is considered to be a mechanism to enforce the indirect tax on manufacturing, sales, and consumption of goods and services across India, to replace the existing taxation schemes implemented by the Central and State governments. The simplicity of this tax would lead to easy administration and enforcement of the tax. The biggest advantage of the GST is estimated to be in terms of the reduction in the overall tax paid by the consumer currently, free movements of the goods from one state to another, and minimization in the paperwork up to a large extent. This paper analyzed the effect of the GST Bill on the Indian economy in general and for small, medium, and large enterprises in specific.

Savings rates have been progressively rising and have been impressive throughout the planned economic period. In contrast, the growth rates have been increasing slowly and are unpredictably low. Economic growth has failed to keep pace with the high savings rates in the economy. Upward sailing savings rates are often paralleled with sharp dips in growth rates. Hence, the progress of savings rates does not get reflected in the growth scenario. This phenomenon of 'high savings and low growth' made it imperative to investigate the nature and direction of causal influence between savings and growth in India. Hence, there was a need to empirically explore whether saving causes growth, or growth leads to savings, or if there was a bi-directional causal relationship between saving and growth, or did they really share any relationship at all. An examination of the causality issue between saving and growth would enable policymakers to devise such economic policies as may be fruitful in meeting the planned targets. This study examined the association between savings and economic growth in India over the planned economic era from 1950-2013 by engaging Granger causality (VECM) estimation technique using the cointegration approach. The empirical results indicated a bi- directional mutual causality between saving and income (both total and non-agricultural income) in the short-run. In the long- run, nominal national income Granger caused gross domestic savings uni-directionally, but savings shared a two-way causal relationship with nominal non-agricultural income.","Causality; Cointegration; Growth; Saving; Unit root",""

The objective of the current study was to test whether the agricultural commodity market in India was efficient or not. This objective was achieved by measuring the relationship between futures and spot market prices of seven major agricultural commodities traded at the National Commodity & Derivative Exchange in India. Research Design: In the current study, the efficiency of the futures market for seven agricultural commodities was explored by using Johansen's cointegration analysis and Granger causality test. Unit root test such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller and non-parametric Phillips-Perron test were initially applied to test stationarity of spot and futures prices. Findings: The results showed that their existed cointegration in futures and spot prices for all the selected agricultural commodities. This confirms a long-term relationship between futures and spot prices for all the agricultural commodities like wheat, castor seed, chilly, jeera, pepper, mustard, and soybean. The causality test further distinguished and categorized the commodities based on direction of relationship between futures and spot prices. Granger causality results showed unidirectional causality, where futures market prices lead to spot prices for wheat, castor seed, and jeera as compared to chilly, pepper, mustard, and soybean, where bi-directional relationships existed in the short run. Practical Implications: The findings of this study have some important implications for market participants and policy makers. The direction of relationship between futures and spot prices showed that in general, the direction of causality was stronger for futures prices to spot prices in case of three commodities namely wheat, castor seed, and jeera, suggesting that futures prices tend to affect spot prices in the short run. In case of wheat, castor seed, and jeera, futures price discovery can play an important role in market decision making for stakeholders in these commodities.","Agriculture - commodity futures; Causality; Cointegration; India; Market efficiency",""

For the firms listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange under the textile industry, from 2008-2012, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to construct a frontier to measure firm efficiency. Efficiency risk hypothesis and franchise value hypothesis were tested to find out the effects between efficiency and leverage. The results suggested that ownership structure and leverage had a positive relationship (efficiency risk hypothesis) between them. The agency cost hypothesis supported the positive effect of leverage on efficiency.

It explores the hypothesis that value relevance, of various accounting variables, varies depending upon the business sector to which the firm belongs. Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper verified the above objective in the Indian context for firms in the BSE SENSEX using annual data for the period from 2000-2013 and generalised least squares regressions in the log-log form, with stock prices as dependent variables and the contemporaneous BSE SENSEX as the control variable. Book value of equity, revenue, profits after tax, and dividend were the chosen accounting items whose value relevance was examined (independent variables). Sector wise, cross sectional regression analysis was performed. To examine the significance of each of the independent variables on the stock price, univariate regressions were undertaken. Findings: The regression results indicated that the value relevance of the chosen accounting variables varied depending on the business sector. While profits after tax significantly influenced the stocks of all chosen sectors except for automobile ; additionally, revenues in the case of IT and FMCG and book value of equity in the banking sector influenced the prices of their stock prices. In the case of automobiles, 'revenues' is the only significant explanatory variable of stock price. Originality/Value: This paper adds a new dimension to the literature of creative accounting. It suggests that the choice of the creative accounting variable might depend on the business sector to which the firm belongs to create the desired positive impact on the stock price.","Accounting information; Creative accounting; Discretionary accruals; Earnings management; Firm level; Forensic accounting; Generalised least squares method; Stock price sensitivity; Value relevance",""

There are two contradictory theoretical views relating to this issue. While the competition fragility view states that competition and bank stability is negatively associated, the competition stability view describes this relationship to be positive. Empirically, researchers have also observed mixed results. This paper examined the influence of market competition on the financial soundness of Indian listed commercial banks. For this, 39 banks including both public and private sector banks were taken into consideration for a period from 1999-2013. In this study, we employed the PRH-statistics to measure the degree of competition. For measuring bank soundness, we used return on assets and market to book ratio. The present effort also examined the influence of customer capital on the financial soundness of Indian banks. The study found that Indian banks are working in a monopolistic free market structure and the degree of competition in public sectors banks is more than that of private sector banks. Employing fixed effect regression model and quantile regression model, the study found that the competition is inversely associated with the banks' financial soundness, which supports the traditional 'competition fragility' view. Furthermore, the positive impact of customer capital efficiency on bank soundness indicates the importance of maintaining good relations with the customers for enhancing bank performance in a competitive environment.","Financial soundness; Indian banks; Market competition; P R H-statistics",""

For all the six test portfolios considered, the market factor and size factor premiums had statistically significant coefficients throughout the study period. In the pre-break point period, four of the six portfolios had a statistically significant coefficient for the value factor premium, while for the post break point, all the six test portfolios had a statistically significant coefficient for the value factor premium. The evidence, therefore, pointed to an increasing importance for the value factor.

The results from the ARMA- GARCH models applied in the study proved that volatility of most of the underlying stocks decreased with the listing of equity options and futures. © 2016 All rights reserved.","ARMA; Equity futures; Equity options; GARCH; NSE; Volatility",""

Secondary data for 28 Indian states for the years from 2001 and 2011 was used. A multiple regression model was used to examine the determinants. Though India has witnessed an increase in percentage of people accessing banking services, particularly deposits in the post-reform period, a large exclusion of rural people from banking services is still a concern. The regression analysis suggested that the increase in the number of bank accounts availed by households is determined by factors such as the number of bank branches, population dependency per branch, and industry concentration in the state. Socioeconomic factors like per-capita income of the state, literacy rates, and urbanization did not emerge to be significant factors. Branch penetration has played an important role in financial inclusion in India. Effective implementation of the financial literacy programmes and leveraging existing bank branches will help in achieving greater financial inclusion.

The modern financial models like CAPM argue that the investors are fully rational, and the market is fully efficient as no individual can take the advantage of arbitraging. Studies advocating behavioral finance have confirmed social influences and psychological biases which deviate individual investors from their calculated and predetermined decisions, and reject the hypothesis of individuals being fully rational while taking decisions related to stock markets. Through this review paper, the concepts related to behavioral finance were illustrated by using various studies, and a conceptual framework showed the influential factors related to behavioral changes impacting the individual investors' decision making, that is, creating irrational investors and inefficient markets. Through the review of various studies, we observed that social factors like herding, emotional contagion, imitation, and information cascades along with psychological patterns like representativeness availability and anchoring heuristics are the basic key factors that determine individual decisions.

So, the Fund's economists deliberately claim that full capital market liberalization helps cross-country smoothing of any adverse shock. However, ironically, the above-mentioned proposition is true when capital flows are counter cyclical. In reality, capital flows pro-cyclically because of the credit market imperfections, giving rise to a natural set of non-convexities.

This is because shares generally represent a riskier investment than do the fixed return investments. Hence, the problem of deriving a suitable basis for the evaluation of ordinary shares has been at the forefront of investment analysis. Usually, share prices are determined by the interaction of the supply and demand subject to imperfection of the stock market. In this context, the major problem is the identification and measurement of different factors which influence supply and demand.

The ordinary least square (OLS) procedure is then employed to verify the link between export growth and the volatility of exchange rate. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) suggests that both real and nominal exchange rate volatility exerts a significant positive impact on export growth, irrespective of different measures of volatility employed.

It was for the first time in the history of securities market regulator that a company planning to get listed needed to get a grading of its issue. The rationale behind the mandatory grading was that the retail investors who are usually at a disadvantage of having inadequate information about the issue would get an indication about the fundamentals of the company. The belief that ""Higher Grades lead to better IPO performance both in the pre and post listing period"" has been proved to be a myth over and over again. Lately, there has been a debate over the significance and relevance of IPO Grading.

In this context, this paper examined the export performance and its determinants during the period from 1981-2011. The export growth has been higher in the post reform period as compared to the pre - liberalization period. The highertrade GDP ratio indicates that the Indian economy is more deeply integrated with the world economy. However, declining export-import ratio reflecting a deteriorating trade balance has been a cause of concern for the country. An ARDL bound testing approach to cointegration was adopted to identify the determinants of export performance. The empirical results indicated a long run as well as short run relation between the exports and the GDP, income of foreign countries (FGDP), real and effective exchange rate (REER), trade liberalization index (TLI), and foreign direct investment (FDI). While the impact of RGDP, TLI, and REER were positive; the impact of FGDP and FDI were found to be negative. The policy implication of the negative effect of the FGDP is that the government should take initiatives to improve the quality of local products and should reduce the average cost of production to increase the share of Indian exports in the world market. To realize the advantage of FDI for export growth, the government should provide infrastructural facilities and remove all barriers to attract more export oriented FDI, as is the case with China and Singapore.","Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach; Cointegration; Export; Exports; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Trade liberalization index (TLI)",""

Using panel OLS regression methodology on a panel data of 266 firms drawn from BSE 500, this research paper investigates empirically how agency cost determines debt maturity decisions in the Indian corporate sector. The agency cost hypothesis established that agency problems caused by the conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders can be mitigated through short-term debt maturity. Therefore, debt maturity is inversely related. The research finds that the coefficient of growth options is positive and significant as against the empirical prediction that debt maturity and growth options are inversely related. However, the positive and significant coefficient on growth options reveals the severity of agency problems in the Indian corporate sector. The research findings lead to the conclusion that debt- equity conflicts over the exercising of growth options are mitigated by not issuing short-term debt. Maturity matching, long-term debt with call and sinking fund provisions, bank debt, secured debt, and debt with covenants are the corporate borrowing strategies adopted by the Indian companies to deal with agency problems, information asymmetry, and liquidity risk.","Agency cost; Agency problems; Capital structure; Debt maturity; Leverage",""

The true value of a share is determined by many factors, which are considered in various proportions to assess the demand in the market. The book building process, adopted throughout the world, helps in identifying the strength of the value of a share, but still, in many ways, to a researcher, finding the true value of a share is an art and not an absolute science. The study aimed at understanding the decision making capabilities of the retail investors based on the information available to them. The study mainly examines how and why information asymmetry exists between the informed and retail investors and whether the winner's curse exists in the Indian stock markets. Asample of 177 IPOs were considered for the study, with the time period of the study being from 2008-12. Stepwise regression analysis, correlation, and Granger's causality tests were conducted. The study found conclusive evidence to support asymmetric behavioural theories. The study revealed that retail investors took clues from institutional investors before investing in the primary markets, but they did not conduct any market research, nor did they consider credit ratings as an important component before entering the primary markets.","Granger causality; IPOs; Primary markets; Retailinvestors; Stepwise regression",""

In India, since the middle of 2003, significant increase in the inflow of foreign institutional investments has made it the most important source of portfolio investment. The Indian business newspapers repeatedly point out that the actions of foreign investors have an impact on the movement of the share prices. However, previous literature (before 2003) on Indian data established that stock returns influence the movement of foreign institutional investment, and not vice versa. However, these studies looked at the period before 2003, and given the structural change in share prices and net foreign institutional investment flows since the middle of 2003, it would be sensible to re-examine their relationship using more recent data. Also, as equity markets gets stuck by weaknesses in transparency and information disclosure policies, its reliability is said to be improved by raising firms' disclosure. Hence, in this present study, using firm-level Indian data from 2001 to 2008, we show that both concurrent and lagged foreign institutional investment flows and voluntary disclosure are negatively related to returns volatility. Our empirical results are consistent with the previous literature. Supporting our speculation that institutions herd on disclosure quality (signals), we tried to find out whether the correlation between volatility and foreign institutional ownership is higher for firms with higher voluntary disclosure. At the end, we tried to find out the direction of relationship among all of these three variables, and attempted to see whether there exists any moderating or mediating effect of one variable over another on volatility. The results are robust to many control variables. We analyzed the annual reports of selected Indian listed companies in constructing firm-specific voluntary disclosure measures and used panel data for regression purposes.","Foreign institutional investment; India; Volatility; Voluntary disclosure",""

So, a strong banking sector is very important for the growth of the economy. This sector witnessed a lot of changes in our country after the 1991 economic reforms - popularly known as the era of ""LPG,"" that is, liberalization, privatization, & globalization. The reforms focused on branch expansion, granting credit to the weaker sections like agriculture, SSI, education loans, housing, and so forth. However, in recent times, the banks have become very cautious in extending loans due to mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) and nowadays, managing NPAs is one of the major concerns forthe banks as NPAs reflect the performance of the banks. Ahigh level of NPAs suggests high probability of a large number of credit defaults that affect the profitability and net-worth of banks, and also erode the value of the asset. The NPA growth involves the necessity of provisions, which reduce the overall profits and shareholders' value. The present paper explored the primary reasons for the growth of NPAs in scheduled commercial banks of Punjab and also suggested the measures for controlling the same.","Growth; Measures; Non performing assets; Primary; Profitability",""

The discussion is often emphasized by the financial press due to the visible evidence of their contemporaneous nature at times of economic crisis. Relationship between foreign institutional ownership and volatility is largely inconclusive. Although the literature in business newspapers and also some previous empirical studies suggest that institutions tend to destabilize prices by increasing turnover levels, there are some good reasons to believe that higher levels of institutional ownership could be negatively related to volatility.

On the other hand, the volatile market has turned most of the investors to hold stocks with calculated risk, in the shape of mutual funds, to save themselves from the volatile market. Keeping this scenario in mind, understanding the investors' perception of mutual funds has become imperative as mutual funds can now prove to be the most preferred financial avenue, provided they are put forth before investors in the desired form. Investors' purchase decision for mutual funds is influenced by a chain of factors. Out of the list of factors, the perception of risk and satisfaction from returns have been found to be dominant. Other factors accountable for their final decision are quality of service delivered, cost of transaction, name familiarity, and so forth. The present paper aimed to identify the perceived relationship between investors' (respondents) risk, returns, service quality, and investment decisions. Furthermore, it investigated the impact of three factors - the perceived quality of services, name familiarity, and price - on respondents' mutual fund selection decision. It also studied the impact of the respondents' age, income, education, risk and returns perceptions on the choice between various financial avenues. Data were collected from 250 respondents using a structured questionnaire with pre-explained objectives of research. Reliabilities were tested using Cronbach's alpha. Furthermore, ranking and rating methodology was also used to prioritize the respondents' preferences.

Unbridled and protectionist use of anti - dumping duties has impacted the international trade negatively in the form of trade loss, trade restriction, trade deviation retaliations, hardship to the consumers on account of choice of variety, and price of the products. While WTO in general advocates for free trade, the concept of dumping appears contrary to the very purpose for which WTO was created. However, free trade should be fair trade also, and therefore, the concept of free trade should not lead to a situation where an established industry in the importing country collapses and dumping by foreign exporters results into monopolization of markets in due course. Certain loopholes in the GATT/WTO agreement on anti - dumping are: No definition of like products, low prices charged for sales in the domestic markets are normally ignored to boost up the domestic sales price, investigating authorities typically follow accounting practices of the importing country, confusion of date of sale and exchange rates, fixation of dumping margin and circumvention lead to controversial practices and methodologies. Particularly, the ""Zeroing Methodology"" used by the industrialized countries in calculation of the dumping margin has further aggravated the situation. The fact remains that the anti - dumping actions are increasing substantially. During 1.1.1995 to 30.6.2014, total 4627 anti - dumping investigations were made throughout the world, and 2966 antidumping actions are in force. Base metals & articles (1328 cases) and chemical and allied products (928 cases) are the most targeted sectors facing anti-dumping actions worldwide. India has imposed 529 measures and is also facing 104 anti - dumping measures on its products. The U.S. has imposed 326 measures and is facing 157 anti-dumping measures. Out of the 106 disputes pending in DSB on anti-dumping, the U.S. is involved in 57 cases, and India is involved in 17 cases. Trading countries are almost engaged in a trade war and anti - dumping measures are being challenged at the WTO frequently, but no solution has been found so far to restrict the anti - dumping war. The present paper presented a workable solution in the form of a proposed theory - The New Anti - Dumping Theory of Cost Averages or NATOCA.","Antidumping; DSB; NATOCA; Trade war; Workable solution; WTO",""

From there, the route was traced to India and Southeast Asia. It was India which began producing sugarfollowing the process of pressing sugarcane to extract its juice and boil it to get crystals. A business needs profit not only for its existence, but also for expansion and diversification. The investors want an adequate return on their investments, workers want higher wages, creditors want higher security for their interest and loan, and so on. The objective of thisstudy is to analyze whether the overall profitability of the selected companies inthe Sugar industry depends on their age, size, and region to which the company belongs based on their margin on sales. From the analysis, it was found that the southern region companies had a higher profitability than the northern region companies, and the companies having paid-up share capital less than Rs 26 crores and greater than Rs 26 crores had, on an average, the same amount of profitability, and the three groups of companies based on their age-new, moderate, and old-had, on an average, the same level of profitability in terms of margin on sales. It is suggested that to increase their profitability, the companies need to effectively monitor and control their expenses and effectively use their by-products. The companies can also adopt a framework for monitoring the profitability at all levels.","Margin on sales; Paid-up share capital; Profitability; Sugar industry",""

All economic activities happening in the country and outside the country lead to a change in the market conditions. Different market players who invest their money in stocks are not only interested to know about the rise and fall in the stock market, they are keen to know about the various economic events / activities that are going to take place in the near future. The stock market reacts depending on how the investors interpret the economic activities. The Union Budget is perhaps the most watched event in economic policy making in India. The core fiscal issues -taxation, expenditures, and the fiscal deficit- are obviously important for macroeconomics. In addition, governments have often chosen to use the Budget speech as a mechanism for announcing important new policy initiatives, and for outlining some plans for economic policy in the coming months. The stock market response to a Budget is often viewed as an important summary statistic of the 'quality' of a Budget in terms of improving the macroeconomic prospects. In this research paper, I intended to find an interplay between the Budget and the stock market, in the areas like informational efficiency and implications for portfolios and trading.

The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of a set of behavioural and institutional factors on the likelihood of defaulting on water bills. Based on a survey of households in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana (GARG), our empirical analysis suggests that an improvement in institutional factors such as monitoring and control measures and behavioural factors such as service quality, service value, and corporate image has a significant effect in minimizing the likelihood of payment default. Other factors considered in the analysis -transaction time, billing issues and customer satisfaction - do not seem to have an effect on estimated default likelihood.

Borrowing costs in general are recognized as an expense. However, in certain situations, borrowing costs, that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset, form a part of the cost of that asset. This is where the recognition and measurement of borrowing costs becomes crucial as their treatment directly impacts the determination of profitability and valuation of the corresponding liability. The main issue in the treatment of the borrowing costs, therefore, revolves around costs to be capitalized. The treatment as provided in ""Accounting Standard 16"" (AS 16: Indian, existing) has been totally revamped by the ""Indian Accounting Standard 23"" (Ind AS 23), based on the concept of effective interest rate method, issued in convergence with the corresponding International Financial Reporting Standard-IAS 23. This paper identifies key distinctive features of Ind AS 23 ""Borrowing Costs"" corresponding to the existing AS 16 and IAS 23, which measures the impact of accounting treatment as per Ind AS 23 on the financial position and performance of an enterprise, and analyzes the financial consequences thereof. It is found that implementation of Ind AS 23 will result in an understatement of borrowing liabilities in company balance sheets, overstatement of borrowing costs in the statements of profit and loss, understatement of profits to that extent and.therefore, revenue loss to the government.","Accounting standards; EIRM; IAS; IFRS; Ind AS",""

What guides their choices among alternatives, what are their investment objectives, constraints, and risk profile; and ultimately, what influences their decision making during the stock selection process. Behavioural finance deals with the psychology of the investor. It tries to explain how an investor makes an investment decision and how behavioural and other factors influence the decision making of an investor. Behavioural factors primarily include behavioural biases and personal characteristics of an investor, that is, personality, attitude, risk tolerance, and demographic factors, while other factors include external contextual factors like accounting information, market situations, brand image, and so forth, which have a bearing on decision making. The present paper provides an in-depth review of literature of prominent studies in the area of behavioural finance. The first part of the paper explains the concept of behavioral finance, the second part gives a detailed discussion on the classification of behavioural biases, and the third part discusses the effect of behavioural biases on the trading behaviour of the investors and the feelings of investors after experiencing the outcomes of investment. Towards the end, a comprehensive framework has been formulated representing the influence of behavioural biases on investment behaviour of an investor. The paper concludes that behavioural biases play a significant role in the decision making of the investors, and these biases not only shape the current investment decisions, but also influence investors' future decision making.","Behavioural biases; Disposition effect; Endowment effect; Heuristics; Loss aversion; Prospect theory; Regret aversion",""

Banking reforms have brought sea changes in the banking space and public sector banks are no exception to this. The major concern in the Indian financial sector has been the profitability of the commercial banking industry. The opening up of the banking sector for private players has put pressure on better performance of public sector banks. The private and foreign banks with advanced technology and management skills have put pressure on the profitability of public sector banks. Hence, these public sector banks need to be equipped enough to counter the pressures, otherwise, repercussions are likely to be great. With this background, the paper investigates the impact of banking reforms on the performance of public, private, and foreign banks. The performance of a bank can be measured by a number of indicators. Profitability is the most important indicator which assumes a greater importance in the ever-changing scenario of financial sector reforms.

Moreover, the measures linked to a reward system, but not as per the strategic direction of the firms, will also flunk the performance measurement system. Thus, this empirical research explored the emphasis of performance measures in relation to the reward system among different categories of Malaysian firms' strategic orientation. The study was conducted during 2011, and the findings revealed that the emphasis differed among the three categories of Miles and Snow strategic orientations. The firms which adopted a prospector strategy orientation placed a greater emphasis on non-financial performance measures tied to the compensation schemes, and differed from the other two Miles and Snow strategy orientations - analyzers and defenders.

This is an unresolved question in the literature of acquisitions. This study analyzes the value creation of acquirers in India on an acquisition announcement and the sensitivity of the stock markets during an acquisition announcement. Most of the literature in the West concludes that, on an acquisition announcement, only the targets create value, and the acquirers are value destructive. This study uses a sample of 78 acquirers in the manufacturing industry who acquired targets in the calendar year 2012. The study develops four hypotheses and uses the event study methodology (market model/ ordinary least square model). The results of the study suggest that acquisitions are neither value creative to Indian acquirers and those acquirers with prior acquisition experience create more value than single acquirers. Surprisingly, the results show that acquirers using cash generate negative returns, which may be due to the presence of the hubris effect. Another important finding of the study is that the acquirers using stock as a method of payment are no longer value destructive, which is contrary to the literature which states that acquirers using cash are value creative and acquirers using stock are value destructive. This is an important contribution to the existing literature of the method of payment, and it implies that the theories in the West may not necessarily hold well in India, and they need to be reassessed before being implemented in the Indian context.","Abnormal returns; Acquirers; Acquisition; Event studies; Method of payment; Takeovers; Value creation",""

The study used a structured questionnaire, in which potential households were questioned about their reactions to some specific situations. The results of the study revealed that among the socio-demographic factors, gender and number of dependents were found to be statistically significant; while age, educational level, and marital status of the household heads were insignificant - that unlike most previous findings, they did not have any explanatory power on households' saving behavior in the study area. With regards to economic factors, average monthly income, occupation, and home ownership were statistically significant, which implies that they had an explanatory power in determining the savings behavior of the households.","Economic factors; Microfinance institutions; Potential households; Saving behaviour; Socio-demographic factors",""

However, India did not face a full - blown recession, but only experienced an economic deceleration, which is normally considered as a temporary phenomenon. Analysis of the financial parameters of corporate India revealed intersectoral as well as intrasectoral differences among them in respect of their financial fundamentals during the period of crisis, which could be attributed to many factors. The Banking sector found an opportunity for growth during the period of crisis, the credit of which goes to wise and judicious policies of the central bank of the country. The Automobile and construction sector were hit most adversely by the crisis due to their high capital intensive nature and stringent measures taken by the lending institutions by cutting back of credit to individuals for adding luxuries to their personal lives. Our IT industry is more exposed to the U.S. and European markets; hence, the financial crisis in these advanced economies affected the export earnings of this sector. However, sharp depreciation of the Rupee helped them to compensate in aggregate what they lost due to the crisis in the global market. Domestic market orientation and not being very capital-intensive are among the factors that insulated the FMCG sector from the downturn. The degree of shock exerted by the global financial turmoil on the performance of the Indian corporate sector was also not the same. While some companies under a particular sector were severely hit by the crisis, fundamentally strong companies could unshackle themselves from it.","Economic growth; Financial performance; Global financial crisis; T test",""

Data for a 7-year period (2005-2012) were used for portfolio construction. The study showed that by using this model, the investors can minimize their overall risk and maximize the returns over any period of time. It was found that even companies with high rates of return were not included in the portfolio as the risk involved in such companies was high. It was also proved that SIM has been useful to create an optimal portfolio by diversifying almost all the unsystematic risks.","Beta; Cut-offrate; Diversification; Excess return to beta ratio; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe's single index model; Systematic risk; Unsystematic risk",""

Implied volatility and its variations are important to understand as the pricing of many financial assets and derivatives depend upon this variable. A novel modeling approach to this task uses Fourier analysis for the first time in the literature of implied volatility and calendar effect modeling. For this purpose, daily closing levels for the Nifty VIX Index were gathered covering trading days from 2010 through January 2014. Time series of VIX levels after removing a trend line were tested for normality, stationarity, and autocorrelation. Nifty index and Nifty VIX data were also tested for two-way Granger causality. Detrended Nifty VIX levels were Fourier analyzed to determine primary Fourier frequencies contributing to VIX periodic behavior. A Fourier model of VIX movements was constructed using four primary frequencies from the Fourier power spectrum. This model showed surprising accuracy in identifying the temporal location of VIX peaks and troughs. The probable origin of one recurring VIX calendar frequency was traced to India's earnings release cycle.","Calendar effects; Fourier analysis; Implied volatility; Nifty; Nifty VIX",""

The current economic environment makes it difficult to sustain trade balance among developing countries with a flexible exchange rate system among emerging economies. Theoretically, depreciation will bring positive impact on trade balance. However, it is only possible when the sum of the elasticities of demand for export and import goods is greater than unity. Accordingly, the present study first analyzed the effect of depreciation on trade balance among 14 Asian economies and found no evidence that depreciation improves trade balance. This was perhaps due to the fact that exports did not respond as expected, mainly due to the decrease in primary exports as well as manufactured products. An increase in import burden may also affect trade balance. However, the above result was challenged when we focused only on eight Asian countries that are relatively bigger, industrialized, and stable economies, and eventually we found that depreciation improved trade balance among the second group of countries.","Devaluation; Export; J-curve effect; Marshall-Lerner condition; Trade balance",""

Based on the results of multiple regression, this study finds that the spread between yield to maturity and market rate and exchange rate influence the corporate entities in issuing bonds. This study also investigates the relationship between the spread between yield to maturity and market rate and issued amount of corporate bonds. The result shows that there is a relationship between the spread between yield to maturity and market rate and issued amount of corporate bonds. We can conclude that the corporate entities depend on the spread between yield to maturity and market rate in order to raise funds from the market. This study suggests that less fluctuation of spread between yield to maturity and market rate and exchange rate can encourage the corporate entities to mobilize funds from the market. The concerned organizations in the Thai bond market should carefully control the factors that obstruct the market participants to participate in the market.

Optimal capital structure is a financing-mix which maximizes the firms' value/the shareholders' wealth or minimizes its overall cost of capital. An appropriate capital structure acts as the basis for sound operations of a State Financial Corporation. The resource mix of APSFC mainly consists of equity share capital, reserves, bonds and debentures, refinancing from the IDBI and the RBI, and loans in lieu of share capital, and so forth. Linking the borrowing powers with equity as per the provisions of the SFCs Act helps in the potentiality of the Corporation in lending operations. The Corporation heavily depends on debt finance by issuing bonds and debentures. A high degree of debt component in capital structure increases the risk and may lead to financial distress in adverse times. A high cost of funds employed makes it very difficult to improve the profitability of the Corporation. Normally, the cost of bond financing of the Corporation is cheaper as compared to raising funds through equity because interest on debt is allowed as an expense for tax purposes. Therefore, a good and complete exercise on resource planning forshort-term as well as long-term periods is a need of utmost importance for the Corporation in order to cater to the growing financial needs of industrial concerns. The present paper focuses on measuring the efficiency of the Corporation in terms of its resource mobilization. Some important aspects for measuring the efficiency of resource mobilization are examining the - trends in resources and sanctions by the Corporation, cost of various sources of funds, cost of debt funds, weighted average cost of capital (LME-lndex), and equity multiplier. The paper also provides some viable and useful suggestions to fine tune the performance of the Corporation for efficient fund management by the APSFC.","Capital structure; Cost of debt; Cost of equity; Development financial institutes; Efficiency index; Equity multiplier; Refinance; Resource mobilization; Weighted average cost of capital",""

The forward premium anomaly is a condition when the forward rate is not an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate.

The manufacturer needs to pay input VAT when the raw materials are bought, and it is realized till the goods are disposed-off. Under the preview of the VAT system, the dealers either setoff the input VAT against the output VAT or lodge a claim with the government for the excess input VAT. The present research work tries to explore and confirm the factors responsible for the delayed VAT refund. Five factors are extracted which were accountable for the agglomeration of the VAT refund. Conceptual factors were found to be the main factor responsible for the delayed VAT refund. The refund mechanism under the VAT regime is not very effective not only in our country, but also in the neighboring countries where the VAT system has been adopted.

However, the foremost objective of the VAT implementation by almost all the countries in the world is to cope with the unwanted leakage of taxes in the form of fraud and tax evasion. VAT is used as a tool to bring harmony in the taxation system of the countries. However, it could not bring uniformity in India; rather, it has caused divergence in the volume of the VAT refund in the states.","Accumulated VAT; Input VAT; Output VAT; Refund",""

The duration of study is of 10 years - from the financial year 2003-04 to 2012-13. The results revealed that long term funds comprised of 86.69% of the total funds as compared to the short term funds, that is, 13.31% during the entire period under study. The company was using more owned funds, that is, 59.90% on an average than borrowed funds (26.79%). As per the results obtained, it can be concluded that Hindalco mostly preferred equity financing, so the financial risk of the company was low. But the company was not enjoying the benefits of capital gearing. The trend of interest coverage ratios were mixed, but the interest payment was fully covered by the earnings before interest and taxes. Hence, the study concluded that to enjoy the benefits of financial leverage, Hindalco Industries Limited should tap into the debt funds.","Capital gearing; Capital structure; Financial leverage; Leverage ratio; Long term solvency",""

With the opening up of economic barriers, better governance practices flowed from good governed to relatively badly governed countries. Now, with increased industrialization and opening up of economies for trade and commerce, political boundaries of nations have been transgressed by businesses. However, this opportunity of making money abroad may also bring some inconvenience to the parent company as it might suffer losses or receive eroded profits when the foreign currency is converted to the local currency at prevailing rates (Pandey, 2010). There may be several other examples like this in real and hypothetical scenarios, and these need to be addressed with prudence. This topic does the same as it calls for attention towards these risks and precautions/remedies available for the same. Apart from the MNCs, there are people who enter into the currency markets for speculative gains. These traders do not require these foreign currencies, but they buy/sell them for making profits from the existing market situations. The proportion of these traders is much larger than those who need foreign currency to make payments, give wages, and so forth. The present paper intends to provide an econometric model for the traders in the currency market which could, up to a reasonable extent, anticipate the fluctuations in major globally transacted currency pairs. This would be handy for the traders and for large businesses running overseas (which have to deal in different currency regions) as they can accordingly decide whetherto invest in a particular currency or not.","Currency pairs (majors); Econometric model; Fluctuation of currency value; Foreign exchange management and risk; Forex market; Multivariate data analysis technique; Political economy; Risk and risk mitigation",""

If not completely, to a great extent, the socioeconomic status of women has been growing in the positive direction. Obviously, their investment decisions and risk perceptions are also changing positively. Unlike previous studies, the present research aims at understanding the risk perceptions of women exclusively. The main aim of the study is to quantify the risk appetite score of women grouped on various socio-demographic bases. The study is based on the sample survey of 120 women in Mysore city. A questionnaire comprising of a 14-item financial risk-tolerance scale developed by Grable and Lytton (1998) (but slightly modified) was used. Risk appetite score was assigned to each respondent on a 5- point Likert summated scale. The respondents were grouped on the basis of the obtained score. The results show that two-thirds of the respondents were above the average score of risk tolerance. Correlation between investment objective and occupation shows a slightly negative relationship. Correlation between risk appetite score and various independent variables allowed us to have a regression model. The regression model suggests that there is a negative influence of age of women on their risk tolerance levels, a finding which is supported by many studies. Only age and education had a positive influence on the risk appetite of women. The study has great implications for the government and investment industry in framing various policies.","Determinants; Investment; Investment portfolio; Risk appetite; Women investors",""

Against this background, the present study was conducted with randomly selected 330 firms to examine the currency risk management practices of select export firms on three dimensions: exposure management, hedging decisions, and derivative decisions. Through this study, an evaluation was made of their knowledge levels, requirements, and usage of suitable hedging tools apart from analyzing their risk management policies and practices. As the firms varied in their practices, a classification of firms using K-means clustering, based on the strategies used by them, was attempted, resulting in three discriminated groups. A prediction of future group associations of firms with the given risk management outlook, using discriminant analysis, yielded results with 98% accuracy. Profiling the export firms based on their risk management practices could be used by financial institutions, legal advisors, auditors, and so forth to render advice effectively regarding financial products.","Derivatives; Exposure management; Hedging; Risk management; Riskanalysis; SMEs",""

The basic purpose of it is to transfer the price risk from one party to another, and mitigate the risk arising from the future uncertainty of prices. It is generally used as an instrument to hedge risk, but can also be used for speculative purpose. Prices in an organized derivatives market reflect the perception of the market participants about the future and lead the prices of the underlying to the perceived future level. This research is an attempt to find the efficiency of the sentimental indicators of financial derivatives in predicting the trend of the market (behaviour of NIFTY index). Participants in the stock markets believe that the amount of open interest (OI) in a particular contract has a bearing on the behavior of the price of the contract. This perception is put to test in the present research using the end of the day data (historical data) from August 2011 to February 2012, and examined the correlation between the cumulative percentage changes in open interest and cumulative percent change in the price of future contract of NIFTY index. The put-call ratio (PCR) is widely used by technical analysts as an indicator of the investor sentiment concerning future equity price trends. Many stock market experts cite the put-call ratio as an important indicator of investor sentiment, with a low (high) value indicating excessive optimism (pessimism). It is believed that the ratio is a useful contrarian indicator for future stock market behavior. In the present research paper, the value of the put-call ratio as an indicator of future stock market trend is put to test.

Ourfindings from the pooled regression indicate that the impact of financial reforms is negative for most of the industries. However, a significant difference is observed in the manner in which these industries reacted to counter this negative impact. The decline in the leverage ratio was offset by a corresponding increase in external equity proportion in the case of a few industries, and by an appreciation in the internal capital proportion for the remaining industries.

The long-term survival depends on the satisfactory income earned by it. Asound liquidity leads to better profitability, and in turn reduces the probability of default risk in the future. Further, the risk and return are very important aspects to be considered while making any decisions regarding a company’s finances. Predicting enterprise failures constitutes one of the most important activities in supervising enterprise risks and/or variables. The term enterprise failure is a definable phenomenon: which encompasses, for instance, failure to cover external debts, exceeding budget limits, failure to effect payment to suppliers, incurring losses, etc. Therefore, a study of liquidity, profitability, and their association with risk, assessing the financial position (financial distress/bankruptcy) is very much necessary to evaluate the financial strength of a company. Financial distress is a tight cash situation in which a business cannot pay the owed amounts on the due date. When a firm is under financial distress, the situation sharply reduces its market value, and larger customers may cancel their orders. A firm in financial distress may face bankruptcy or liquidation leading to delay in meeting its liabilities. This paper attempts to study the association between liquidity, profitability and risk factor. The Altman’s Z-score model has been employed by the researcherto predict the risk of financial distress of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, from the year 2005-2011. The results indicate that the liquidity and solvency position of the company have been satisfactory.

Line charts and unit-root tests were applied to check the stationary nature of the series; Regression Analysis, Granger's Causality Model, Vector Auto Regression (VAR) Model, and Variance Decomposition Analysis were performed to find out the linkages between the markets under study. The analysis revealed that the stock markets under study were influenced by each other, but not to a great extent. It implies that there exists opportunities for diversification of the investors among the stock exchanges of BRICS.

Thus, from the year 1999, the new corporate information relating to buybacks started arriving at the stock market in India. This study aims at enquiring about the reaction of the stock market to the buyback announcements for a period of 10 years from 2000-01 and 2009-10 by taking S&PCNX 500 companies in terms of returns among Open Market Repurchases (OMR) and Fixed Price Tenders (FPT). By applying standard event study procedure, the information signalling of buybacks and semi - strong efficiency test to verify the absence of abnormal returns continuously has been taken up. Having recorded a statistically significant abnormal return of 1.32% on the announcement day, and a cumulative abnormal return of 5.13% in -10to +10 event frame, the OMRs end up with a cumulative abnormal return of 6.11% for a 61 days event window to have a strong signalling to the market. The near same abnormal return of 1.30% in FPT announcements was not statistically significant on the announcement day. The cumulative abnormal return of 2.13% in -2 to +2 frame and the negative 15.64% observed in a 61 days window evidenced a weak signalling of FPTs. In spite of having strong signalling to the market, the OMRs recorded mixed abnormal returns in a positive and negative spread around the shorter version of the event window (-10 to +10), thereby curtailing the opportunities of earning abnormal returns on a sustainable way to support the semi-strong efficiency of the market. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

However, stock markets of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries have received little attention separately despite the rapid growth and liberalization among these countries. So, the present study examines the relationship and co-integration of stock prices of BRIC countries' stock markets. To investigate the relationships, the researcher examined the stock indices of BRIC countries and employed the daily closing price data (all converted in to Indian Rupees) in two different phases. The first phase was from April 2002 to March 2007 (Pre-crisis period); the second phase was from April 2007 to March 2012 (Crisis Period). However, the crisis period was actually till 2010, but to have an equal observation, the study used five years' data. Stock price linkages were examined through Correlation analysis and the Engel Granger co-integration test was also used to study the long term equilibrium relationships. The results revealed that the Indian market has a strong positive correlation with Brazil and Russia, and further, India has a long term equilibrium relationship with China and Russia, which means that Investors have no diversification opportunity in these countries. Furthermore, the Indian market had no long term equilibrium relationship with Brazil, so the Indian investors have an opportunity to earn more in the Brazilian stock market.","",""

Banks lubricate the entire monetary and financial system and ensure smooth operations. With the initiation of the processes of liberalization and globalization of the economy, the financial sector, particularly the commercial banks, not only in urban areas, but also in rural areas were the first to experience the winds of change. However, these changes were experienced more in urban areas than in rural areas. The most pertinent issue today is how well is the rural banking sector positioned to cater to the continued growth of the banking sector as a whole In India, more than 50 percent of the population is based in rural areas. Though the Indian banks are penetrating the rural areas to meet the rural customers' needs, but still, they have not achieved the set target. In this light, there was a need to evaluate the performance of the banks working mostly in rural areas and compare with those that are not operating, or are involved on a very low scale in rural areas. The present paper throws light on the performance of the Scheduled Commercial Banks that have more branches and fewer branches in rural areas. The paper also highlights the main issues and suggests measures for the banks to penetrate the rural sector so that the Indian economy can grow as a whole. © 2012 Associated Management Consultants Private Limited.","Credit deposit ratio; Foreign banks; Net profitability ratio; Non Performing Assets (NPAs); Private sector banks; Public sector banks; Rural areas; Scheduled commercial banks",""

It refers to a portion of the total fund which finances the day to day working expenses during the operating cycle. Management of working capital is one of the most important functions of corporate management. It is rightly said, “Inadequate working capital is advantageous, whereas redundant working capital is a criminal waste”. As a large manufacturing industry, working capital management in the steel industry involves a large portion of the company’s total assets. The optimum working capital ensures the success of the business, while its inefficient management will lead to the down fall of the company. Hence, this paper analyses the working capital management of selected steel companies in India. Further, to measure the effective utilization of the working capital, Operating Cycle and Cash Conversion Cycle were used. To measure the determinants of Cash Conversion Cycle, the Kieschnick model has been used. Finally, it was concluded that the size of a company plays a vital role in determining the efficiency of its working capital management. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The methodology applied is the CARAMELS framework developed by the International Monetary Fund to understand financial strengths and weaknesses of different sectors like banking, insurance etc. In fact, the CARAMELS model acts as a framework which considers different parameters for determining the soundness of organizations spread across different industries. The study on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance gave mixed results. Several areas have been identified which require a lot of improvement. This study is one of the unique studies on the financial soundness aspect in the insurance sector.","Caramels; Financial soundness; Life insurance; Private players",""

With respect to the changing scenario and roller coaster ride of the banking industry, the Reserve Bank of India announced guidelines for implementation of Basel-II norms for all banks and made it compulsory for all scheduled commercial banks to implement the Basel-II norms. Implementation of Basel II is seen as a topsy-turvy situation for banks and has created challenges in the sector in many jurisdictions. There is a need for bank employees to have sufficient understanding of the Basel-II accord in order to guide the banking growth rate in the positive direction. Lack of understanding among employees regarding the new Basel-II accord affects banks negatively as these are the basis for any banking action. The objective of this paper is to find out the awareness level, as well as the perception among bank employees about the Basel-II norms, and also examines the efforts made by them for implementing it in their banks.","Basel II; Credit risk; Market risk; Operational risk; Risk management",""
"Macroeconomic factors (Other than the FIIs) affecting the Sensex: An empirical analysis","2012","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008165021&partnerID=40&md5=42f12f06531e89e0888e11e2d1df8687","This paper attempts to investigate the impact of various macroeconomic factors upon the movement of the stock market index, i.e. the BSE Sensex. The researchers opined that since liberalization, the FIIs have played a bigger role in the movement of the Indian stock market, but whether the FIIs are responsible for both the upward and the downward state of the Sensex remained to be seen. To get an answer to the posed question, the researchers made a correlation analysis between the top ten rises and the top ten falls of the Sensex with the corresponding net flow of FIIs to know exactly the dependency of the Sensex upon the FIIs. The results showed that FIIs have a higher correlation with the Sensex at the time of its downward spiral rather than upward growth. So here the question arises, can India stabilize the Sensex at the time of FII withdrawal by promoting any other factor? Thus, the researchers tested the impact of other macroeconomic factors along with FIIs affecting the Sensex for the last 10 years from March 2001 to April 2011. Correlation and multiple-regression models were used for this study and the results depict that IIP and Exchange Rate (INR/USD) have a higher influence (than FIIs) on the stock markets. The findings suggest that by improving the HP figures and by controlling the Exchange Rate, the Sensex can be stabilized at the time of heavy selling by the FIIs in the Indian stock market. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

But the utility of fixed assets cannot be judged unless an analysis of fixed assets is made with respect to their productivity, efficiency, performance and profitability, irrespective of their share in the capital employed because there may be cases where the fixed assets occupied a major proportion of the total capital employed, while the profitability was very low and vice versa.

The Capital Conservation Buffer is simply a top up over and above the stipulated capital levels of 8%. And, the discretionary Counter-Cyclical Buffer aims to dampen the credit cycle in a booming economy to reduce the systemic risks. This paper argues that on the one hand, the recoup of capital conservation buffer would be difficult once it gets depleted and on the other, the banks would find it attractive to further boost up the credit growth in order to reduce the impact of additional capital requirements. The other adverse impacts of discretionary buffers would be upsetting growth plans of the industry, caution among investors and effect on banks' asset quality. On the contrary, the release of discretionary buffers is only leverage enhancing enabling factor and is not by itself amount to increase in cash flows and liquidity for credit growth.

In developed nations, its burgeoning development is very much obvious, but in developing countries, the scenario is not that rosy. One important reason for low aptness of e-banking may be attributed to differences in the socio-psychological factors in these nations. Therefore, it is imperative to study the factors that are considered by the users of banking services before selecting any distribution channel. In this context, the present paper attempts to analyze the customers’ perspective towards those qualitative aspects that e-banking must possess as its e-bankqual. The study is based upon primary data collected from 225 users of e-banking services. The internal consistency of data has been evaluated by Cronbach’s Alpha test and sample adequacy has been tested by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of sampling adequacy as well as Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity. The questionnaire comprised of 26 questions, out ofwhich 19 were related to the qualitative aspect of e-banking. As the degree of correlation detected the problem of multicollinearity, therefore, factor analysis was conducted. The analysis resulted in six variables, which are vital for securing the adhesion of customers to e-banking. These factors are Easiness In Transactions, Customer Relations, Efficient Processing, Secure Transactions, Availability of Services and Reporting (maintenance of records).

An Anchor Investor is a Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB), who can invest up to 30% of the QIB quota, subject to a minimum corpus of? 10 crores as investment, and a lock-in period of at least 30 days. This measure was introduced to protect shareholder wealth during market volatility such that big institutional investors do not sell off their shares as soon as they foresee a plunging market. This paper, therefore, using the data for 17 of the IPOs issued between July 2009 and March 2011, attempts to find whether this directive by SEBI actually served its purpose of boosting investor confidence and providing stability in a volatile market. Whilst this was a welcome step, our results indicate that anchor investors neither guarantee share price stability, nor incite investors to follow their lead as they enter and exit the fund in spite of substantial subscription in the IPO. Our findings are in congruence with Mathur and Subramaniam (2011), Venkatraman and Khemka (2010), and Ram (2009). © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The basic reason for this being its unique physical properties. Gold as a commodity, as a currency, continues to play its ancient role as the only true standard of value in times of war or crisis. History tells us that only gold retains its value during war; change of empires and govt. and at the time of crisis. Although now officially, gold held to be of only industrial value, gold is the oldest and most respected currency in the world and only one respected currency in the world when national paper money lose value. That is why every central bank of any significance buys and holds goods in reserve in a world of almost universal paper money. The monetary use of gold, along with silver has been very wide spread since ancient times. Gold and silver coins have been most readily acceptable medium of exchange due to intrinsic values of the two metals. The major problem in this use of gold as a coinage metal is its short supply. It is produced only by a few countries mainly South Africa (producing 3/4th of the total world production) Soviet Union, Canada, USA, Ghana, Philippines and Australia. In India gold has maintained an important presence since very early times. © 2010 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Mutual fund is one of these. Mutual funds in Indian context are a recent phenomenon. In a short span of less than one decade, it has changed the investment pattern of medium and small Investors in India. The origin of the Indian mutual fund industry can be traced back to 1964 when the Indian government, with a view to augment small savings within the country and to channelise these savings to the capital markets, set up the Unit Trust of India (“UTI”). The UTI was setup under a specific statute, the Unit Trust of India Act, 1963. The Unit Trust of India launched its first open-ended equity scheme called US 64 in the year 1964, which turned out to be one of the most popular mutual fund schemes in the country. In 1987, the government permitted other public sector banks and insurance companies to promote mutual fund schemes. Pursuant to this relaxation, six public sector banks and two insurance companies viz. Life Insurance Corporation of India and General Insurance Corporation of India launched mutual fund schemes in the country. Subsequently, in 1993, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (""SEBI"") introduced The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1993, which paved way for the entry of private sector players in the mutual fund industry. © 2010, Associated Management Consultants Private Limited.

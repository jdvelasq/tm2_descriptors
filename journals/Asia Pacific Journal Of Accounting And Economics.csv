"Volatility and jump with intraday periodicity and truncated power variation in Chinese yuan-US dollar exchange rates","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187148267&doi=10.1080%2f16081625.2024.2326408&partnerID=40&md5=fcec50221d7ec2906af96489934c5fa5","This study analyzes the discrete jump volatility of the Chinese yuan/U.S. dollar exchange rate returns using high-frequency five-minute returns from June 2012 to April 2021. Using periodicity filters of volatility, we conduct volatility jump tests for finite and infinite exchange rate jumps, and the truncated power variation does not exhibit upward or downward jumps. We use combined intraday jump statistics with local robust variance. All empirical results show that if we do not include periodicity filters of volatility, such as MAD and ShortH, the five-minute returns of the Chinese yuan/US dollar exchange rates have much lower intraday jump probabilities. Thus, the volatility and jumps of the Chinese yuan/US dollar ratio will be underestimated if we do not consider the periodicity filters of the volatility in the 2010s. We need to include periodicity filters of volatility and jumps to reduce forecast errors in future Chinese Yuan/US dollar exchange rates so that we obtain a better measure of current volatility and generate better hedging strategies for future volatility. © 2024 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Exchange rate; jump; maximum outlying Gumbel statistics; periodicity; volatility",""

The exclusion is greater for firms with larger institutional ownership and for firms with higher analyst following, where analysts have strong incentive to forecast economic earnings that are free of earnings management. Although auditors ultimately adjust the same earnings management from reported earnings, analysts are able to timely disseminate firms’ economic earnings to the market. Our study sheds light on analysts’ informational role in the capital markets and extends the boundary of the earnings management literature by investigating the earnings management adjusted by auditors instead of the earnings management remaining in reported earnings. © 2023 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Analysts earnings forecast; audit adjustments; earnings management",""

In addition, we find the CSISC’s negative impact on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), firms with worse internal and external corporate governance, and regions with stricter tax enforcement. Further analyses reveal that the improved information environment is a potential channel through which the CSISC inhibits corporate tax avoidance.

Based on the data of Chinese companies listed on SME board from 2010 to 2020, this paper empirically examines the impact of digital transformation on the financing constraints of SMEs as well as its mechanism. The study finds that digital transformation significantly eases the financing constraints of SMEs, and the conclusion remains valid after considering endogeneity issues and conducting robustness tests. The mechanism analysis manifests that SMEs improve the quality of external information disclosure through digital transformation, thereby alleviating financing constraints. In addition, the impact of digital transformation on the financing constraints of SMEs demonstrates prominent heterogeneity. The mitigation effect of digital transformation is more pronounced in areas where digital financial is well developed, in state-owned enterprises, high-tech enterprises and long-term oriented enterprises. In the context of SMEs, this paper reveals the relationship between digital transformation and corporate financing, enriching the studies on the organizational performance effects of digital transformation. © 2023 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","China; digital transformation; financing constraint; Smes",""

In a sample of 135 publicly-held U.S. banks that acquired failed banks in the period January 2009-April 2012, I find that bargain purchase gains are positively associated with acquirers’ future stock market and operating performance.

Whether this conclusion is also suitable for environmental information, however, is still unclear. Therefore, we examine the effect of short selling on environmental disclosure by using empirical data from China. We find that pilot firms, after being added to the pilot short-selling list, disclose less environmental information than non-pilot firms do. Further examination shows that the pilot firms’ internal and external monitoring mechanisms can affect managers’ decision-making regarding environmental information. The results suggest that when a short-selling mechanism is implemented, it is important that the appropriate regulatory department mandatorily receives environmental information disclosure. Simultaneously, the pilot firms’ internal and external monitoring mechanisms should be strengthened to mitigate the negative disclosure behavior of managers. © 2020 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","disciplining hypothesis; environmental disclosure; monitoring mechanism; price pressure hypothesis; Short selling",""

I conclude that when the incentive misalignment and information asymmetry  are both sufficiently small (great), the manager and investor both prefer the fair disclosure (selective dislcosure) regime. On the other hand, if the information asymmetry and incentive misalignment are intermediate, the manager prefers the selective disclosure regime and the investor prefers the fair disclosure regime, showing the necessity of taking the heterogeneity of firms into consideration when implementing Reg FD. Furthermore, I show that the small investors prefer the fair disclosure regime when the market size of large investors is sufficiently large, showing that the rgulator should pay attention to the conditions under which the small investors will be worse off after the implementation of Reg FD. © 2019 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","fair disclosure; incentive misalignment; information asymmetry; Reg FD; Selective disclosure",""

However, when the intention for auditor switching is undetected by investors, ERCs would do not differ depending on whether firms switch auditors for OS or not. We find that firms switching auditors for OS have lower ERCs than non-switching firms or those that switch for other reasons, suggesting that investors perceive auditor switching for OS as evidence of impaired auditor independence. © 2020 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","audit quality; auditor change; auditor independence; capital market perceptions; Opinion shopping",""

Using a sample from 78 countries over the 2003–2012 period, we document a positive association between corruption and Big 4 audit market concentration, suggesting that in more corrupt countries, the audit market at the industry level is dominated by one or two Big 4 audit firms rather than shared equally. To provide further understanding about how corruption is associated with Big 4 audit market concentration, we conduct a path analysis and find that corruption has an indirect effect on audit market concentration through collusion. These results are consistent with the notion that corrupt governments do not effectively control collusion and thus decrease market competition, leading to a decrease in the perceived severity of information leakage and a lower concern about sharing a common auditor. Finally, we conduct a battery of sensitivity tests.

Three major findings are documented. First, larger equity-based compensation aligns the interests between audit committees and shareholders in S&P 1500 firms, leading to lower restatement likelihood. In contrast, larger equity-based compensation induces audit committees to compromise independence in non-S&P 1500 firms, leading to higher restatement likelihood. Second, S&P 1500 firms increase equity-based compensation to both AC chairs and other AC members following restatements to enhance the alignment effect. Differently, non-S&P 1500 firms reduce equity-based compensation paid to audit committee chairs rather than other members following restatements to mitigate the entrenchment effect. Importantly, restating firms adjust equity compensation only to audit committee members but not to CEOs or other board committee members. Finally, reducing (increasing) audit committees’ equity-based compensation is effective in improving non-S&P 1500’s (S&P 1500’s) quality of financial statements after restatements. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity, including corporate governance variables, dropping firms who discharge auditors and CEOs, and considering nonlinearity.

We exploit the unique variations in China’s capital market integration to study the effect of capital market internationalization on the cost of equity financing. Using firm-level panel data from China, we measure capital market integration at the corporate level using the degree of co-movement between a company’s share price and the international capital market. After controlling for year effects and industry effects, we find that the growing integration of the capital market is significantly increasing Chinese companies’ equity financing costs. This surprising result still holds after controlling for the endogeneity problem. One possible explanation is the asymmetric approach of China’s capital market internationalization, i.e. while the Chinese capital market is increasingly open to international investors, it remains difficult for Chinese investors to invest abroad. Consequently, while international investors bring more risk into the Chinese market, domestic investors in China lack effective ways to diversify the risk in the global market. This additional source of non-diversifiable risk demands a higher return to capital, which raises the equity financing costs in China. © 2017 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Capital market integration; China; equity financing cost; non-diversifiable risk",""

This process enables controlling shareholders to be incentivized to depress stock prices during this period and thereby alleviate tax burden. We discover that the firms that have stock gift transactions in the sample significantly decrease their discretionary accruals in the quarters that precede and/or overlap with the valuation period. Earnings management that decreases income is statistically significant when stock gifts are made for individuals who are the related parties and family members of controlling shareholders.

Our study investigates the effect of CSR on information asymmetry between firms and creditors. Using Chinese listed firms as samples, our paper adopts propensity score matching to reconstruct the new samples to randomly assign CSR reportage to firms. We then use a differences-in-differences approach to construct our hypotheses as follows. First, firms that employ CSR strategies possess higher leverage than firms that do not. Second, the presence of CSR reports reduces the speed of capital structure adjustment, and the adjustment speeds of above-target leverage firms tend to be slower than those of below-target leverage firms. Third, CSR reports provide long-term predictions to creditors, enabling firms that issue them to maintain higher long-term leverage compared with firms that do not incorporate CSR into their operations. In summary, on the basis of causal inference, we conclude that CSR can considerably reduce information asymmetry between firms and creditors. © 2017 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","capital structure; Corporate social responsibility; target leverage",""

The Korean economy is characterized by the ‘Chaebol’ and dominated by a creditor-oriented financing system, such that creditors have strong control over firms’ investment decisions. We believe that our own empirical results illustrate an interesting case study of the Chaebol-/bank-dominated economy, and provide additional data in this regard for academic research. Our results show that firstly, and as expected, accounting quality and competition mitigate against investment inefficiency. Managers of firms that have a higher level of accounting quality make capital investment decisions more efficiently, and their BODs monitor managers’ decision-making more effectively. For a higher level of competition in a given industry, high liquidation risks force managers to decide on capital investment more efficiently.

Notwithstanding, the value implications of compensation costs are consistently higher for high-tech firms. Furthermore, the changes in value implications for high-tech firms throughout the economic trends are more volatile than those observed for low-tech firms. When differentiating between investors on and outside the exchange, we find consistently stronger value implications of compensation costs for the latter. It seems that throughout the economic cycle more informed and sophisticated investors have a higher assessment of the role of a firm’s investment in HC in value creation. Another important implication of our results is that, in response to economic changes, investors modify their valuations of HC quickly rather than gradually, which is unexpected given the strategic value and complexity of the human aspect of the firm’s intangibles. © 2015 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","compensation cost; economic cycle; economic trends; human capital; valuation",""

Data collected from samples of Taiwanese auditors, public prosecutors, and investors revealed that as compared to the auditors, financial statement users ascribe different connotative meanings to a Chinese term that was originally proposed, and one that was chosen as its replacement after objections from the accounting profession. Further, the words’ connotative meanings significantly mediated the link between the local term and financial statement users’ judgments about auditor legal liability. Significantly, the connotative meaning that financial statement users ascribed to the replacement term was associated with a higher level of ascribed auditor liability, such that in successfully pushing for a wording change, members of Taiwan’s accounting profession may have increased, rather than reduced, their exposure to liability from audited financial statements.

Specific types of bank connections–executive and cross-shareholding connections–are further examined and we find that the effect only exists in firms with executive and bank-holding connections, not in firms connected to banks as shareholders. This demonstrates that having bank connections prompts firms to undertake more risk-taking projects and increases the magnitude of corporate risk-taking. © 2015 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Bank connections; corporate risk-taking; financial environment; financing capability; related loans",""

Perks are positively associated with firm value, but to a much lesser extent than monetary compensation. This suggests that if perks are converted to cash compensation, shareholder wealth can be further enhanced.

Accounting experts on audit committees may require higher audit efforts, while auditors may assess audit committees with accounting financial experts as effective, decreasing audit efforts.

First, the optimal entry mode for firm N in the absence of IPR protection is FDI when the innovation size is large but the variance of demand and the fixed setup cost are small, while selecting exporting otherwise. Second, the enforcement of IPR in the South can promote FDI when the innovation size is small, while discouraging FDI when the innovation size is moderate and large. Third, the enforcement of IPR protection will most likely decrease the total output and the welfare level in the South under international licensing, while the reverse may occur as a result of changing the firm N’s entry mode from FDI to exporting. © 2016 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","entry mode; foreign direct investment; informational advantage; international licensing; IPR protection",""

Does the IFRS regime help make accounting a better business language than do other accounting regimes? That is our research question, and to answer the question we examine the effect of IFRS adoption on readability of firms’ financial disclosures. As a global accounting regime, the IFRS puts greater emphasis on understandability in financial reporting than do any other existing accounting standards. In many countries, however, adopting the IFRS involves the process of translating the original IFRS into local non-English languages, and apparently, the IFRS Foundation sticks to word-for-word or literal-translation policy to ensure an adopter country’s complying with the original IFRS. Understandability and literal translation, however, might be less than a good match. It is, therefore, timely and relevant to examine whether financial statement understandability has improved under the IFRS regime in non-English speaking settings. Korea serves as a real-world setting for research on readability of accounting information because Korea has two concurrent accounting regimes for two years before her complete IFRS adoption. We compare the 57 IFRS adopter firms and 943 non-such firms for readability of their disclosed financial statement footnotes. The univariate and multivariate results indicate that the IFRS-based financial statements have significantly lower, not higher, readability than those based on the local accounting standards. Results also show that minority shareholder population and firm age have significantly positive influence on the association between IFRS adoption and financial statement readability.

Prior studies find that on average, managers issue more pessimistic guidance before than after grant dates. They interpret this asymmetric pattern as representing managers' opportunistic behavior. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this pattern reflects managers' selective timing of bad news disclosures or a deliberate misrepresentation of underlying firm performance. This paper extends the literature by examining the effects of managerial stock option incentives on the accuracy and the information content of firms' voluntary earnings guidance. We find that pre-grant guidance significantly improves existing consensus earnings forecasts, and is similar in bias and accuracy to post-grant guidance. Moreover, investors and analysts react similarly to pre-grant vs. post-grant guidance, suggesting that the main consumers of earnings guidance view these two types of guidance to be equally informative. Our results are consistent with the notion that managers may opportunistically select the type or the timing of disclosures, but when they opt to disclose, they do not misrepresent the underlying firm performance. On the contrary, the seemingly opportunistic guidance before option grants improves overall firms' information environment, because it is at least as truthful and informative as post-grant guidance, and is issued more frequently than by managers who do not have incentives to report bad news before earnings announcements. © 2013 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","earnings guidance; incentives; information content; stock options",""

This study finds that the market reaction to share repurchase announcements is contingent on minority shareholder protection. The signaling effect of repurchase announcements is weak for firms subjected to poor minority shareholder protection, especially for the repurchase purposes of converting debt to equity and signaling undervaluation. Moreover, the results show that poor minority shareholder protection is negatively associated with the long-term operating performance following repurchase announcements.

We measure culture using Hofstede’s four cultural dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and masculinity. We follow extant literature to measure firm investment efficiency. Our results indicate that individualism is positively correlated with firm investment bias and that uncertainty avoidance and masculinity are negatively correlated with firm investment bias. In addition, the influence of national culture on firm investment efficiency was more pronounced during the global financial crisis of 2008. Our results show that national cultures have significant influence on firm investment efficiency.

We employ quantitative and qualitative measures for the IC personnel, and the ARL is measured by the time between the fiscal year-end and the audit report date. We find an insignificant association between the quantitative measure (the number of IC personnel) and ARL. On the other hand, we find that the qualitative measure (the average experience of the IC personnel) reduces the audit time, thereby decreasing the ARL. This result highlights the importance of qualitative aspect in investments in IC personnel, which could be useful for firms that desire to reap the best result from the investment. Further analysis shows that investments in IC personnel at other departments as well as accounting and finance department increase audit efficiency.

Through an empirical study using Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database and Patent Application Database from 2004 to 2007, we found that the expansion of SOEs negatively affected the innovation of private enterprises. Chinese private enterprises usually do not have extensive assets or strong ability to obtain debt financing, and thus are less likely to maintain investments in R&D when SOEs expand. Considering private enterprises are the main contributors of innovation in China, it is important to note the negative effect of the expansion of SOEs on the innovation of private enterprises. We further distinguished the SOEs along two dimensions: holding type and affiliation type. Based on the first dimension, we divided the SOEs into absolutely controlled SOEs and relatively controlled SOEs (RSOEs); based on the second dimension, we divided the SOEs into those belonging to higher level governments (central or provincial) (HSOEs) and those belonging to lower level governments such as municipal governments (LSOEs). We found that only RSOEs and LSOEs expanded rapidly from 2004 to 2007, and that it is the expansion of RSOEs and LSOEs that led to a decrease in innovation of private enterprises. Moreover, we found that the expansion of SOEs increased the average interest rate faced by private enterprises and that the increase in average interest rate was the primary reason for the decrease in innovation of private enterprises. © 2015, © 2015 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","expansion; innovation; interest rate; patents; private enterprises; SOEs",""

In particular, we employ the most general differentiation setting with four firms by introducing a new parameter describing the highest degree of differentiation. We analyze how the degree of product differentiation affects the emergence of sequential mergers and find that when the value of this new parameter decreases, sequential mergers are more likely to emerge. Furthermore, we also provide welfare and numerical analyses to discuss the product differentiation ranges that would or would not lead to sequential mergers or no mergers in equilibrium. Consequently, policymakers can use this new parameter as a rule-of-thumb parameter in predicting the future merger structure. © 2016 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","merger policy; merger waves; product differentiation; Sequential mergers; three differentiation levels",""

Unlike results in developed countries, clients of both the failing auditor (Deloitte) and other foreign (Big 4) auditors experience more negative stock market reactions than local non-Big 4 auditors’ clients at the disclosure event pertaining to Kelon. Negative effects are more pronounced for companies in Kelon’s industry. Shareholder losses are moderated by government ownership.

In contrast to most other trade measures, TBT have both trade promotion and trade restriction effects. Due to their theoretical complexity and data scarcity, TBT have been considered as one of the most difficult non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to quantify. In this paper, we construct a TBT database from 1998-2006 to examine the influence of TBT imposed by China on the country's imports. When using the frequency index, we find that TBT are trade restrictive: a one unit increase in TBT will decrease import value by about 0.8%. However, when the coverage ratio is used, we find that the negative effects of TBT are not statistically significant based on the entire period. However, if the focus is shifted to data from 1998-2001, we find that TBT have trade promotion effects. A one unit increase in TBT will increase import value by about 0.2%. Finally, China's TBT (measured by both frequency index and coverage ratio) are trade restricting for agriculture goods but trade promoting for manufacturing goods.","China's trade; Coverage ratio; Frequency index; Non-tariff barriers; Technical barriers to trade",""

Firms that enter a foreign market by exporting are able to capture consumer surplus by introducing a differentiated product with characteristics that the incumbent cannot match. In relatively globalized product space, in contrast, consumers perceive an entrant's difference to existing products as less pronounced so a consumer's virtual distance costs in product space are lower and a merger with an incumbent (horizontal FDI) offers pricing power that allows the entrant to extract consumer rent. Lower physical trade costs of shipping make Bertrand price competition fiercer in differentiated product space and can provide an additional incentive for a merger. A basic product space model with a linear Hotelling setup can therefore explain why FDI has become more frequent in recent periods in the presence of falling trade costs. Cross-border merger and acquisitions data support the model's prediction that horizontal FDI grows relatively faster than exports in differentiated goods industries, compared to homogeneous goods industries. © 2014 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","differentiated product space; Horizontal foreign direct investment; monopolization strategies; oligopoly in imperfect markets; trade under imperfect competition",""

We examine the motives and characteristics of companies that revalue PP&E and their choice of assets for revaluation. First, we find that Korean companies are more likely to revalue PP&E to improve their financial position or reduce debt contracting costs rather than lessen political costs or signal better future prospects. Second, we report a pecking order in the choice of assets to revalue. Companies prefer land for revaluation to other depreciable assets. When companies select depreciable assets for revaluation, most of them revalue land at the same time suggesting that companies are likely to select depreciable assets for revaluation only after they select land. Third, we posit and find that revaluing companies are more likely to elect depreciable classes of PP&E when they are highly levered, experience equity depletion, and report losses.

The development of air transport, however, varies significantly across regions in terms of growth and competition with ground transport.

We show that, after taking into account the endogenous choice of listing formats and the characteristics of the sellers and the items, an authorized product has a 7% higher trade probability than that of a parallel import and, if there is a sale, the transaction price as a ratio of the manufacturer's suggested retail price is 0.093 higher. A small number of less-experienced parallel import sellers, in an attempt to maintain a price comparable to the authorized product, list their items in pure auction with unusually high starting bids. This accounts for the overall lower trade probability for the parallel imports.

We allow for the fact that investor demand for dividend paying stocks is time-varying and the market pays a premium for such stocks when the demand is high. Moreover, when the dividend premium (DP) is high, dividend increases could be due to managers catering to high demand for dividends by investors. We find that when the DP is low, there is a significant positive relation between dividend increases and unexpected future earnings changes, consistent with the signaling theory of dividends. However, when the DP is high, the relation between dividend increases and unexpected future earnings changes is insignificant. This finding suggests that when the DP is high, managers increase dividends primarily to cater to investors' demand for dividends rather than to signal an increase in the future profitability of the firm.

Nevertheless, questions regarding price negotiation and the determinants of importing firms' profitability remain unanswered. Using firm-level data, we attempt to address these issues in the context of the Chinese steel industry. Despite being the largest producer of steel in the world, the Chinese steel industry has maintained a very low level of profitability. This paper suggests that the low profitability of Chinese steel producers results from the abnormally high degree of market segmentation in China. Using a recently developed econometric method in panel data spatial analysis, we explain the level of geographic fragmentation in the Chinese steel industry. Our results reveal that local steel production depends only on local demand rather than on cross-regional demand. Production is responsive, as a 10% increase in local GDP induces more than 8% increase in local steel production, while the cross-province spill-over demand is insignificant under several reasonable model specifications. Less efficient firms survive because of the segmented market. As a result, Chinese steel producers realize lower profit in the face of high input prices. © 2013 Copyright City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Chinese steel industry; market structure; spatial analysis",""

After the FTA, patent lifetimes are expected to be extended. During such extension periods, Korean generic drug makers will not be able to sell their drugs, and consumers will have to pay more because of higher prices. The new concepts of effective patent term and price-change mechanism were employed, and patent data for the Korean pharmaceutical industry were used to estimate the parameters needed to measure the welfare effects. The empirical results indicate that the welfare effect will be much smaller than suggested by previous studies. These methods to evaluate the welfare effects can be applied to the cases of other recent FTAs and other kinds of IPR negotiations in international economics. © 2012 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","Free trade agreement; Intellectual property rights; Korea; Welfare effect",""

We find that acquiring firms deflate earnings in order to increase the numbers of shares to be issued to the target firm's shareholders. Furthermore, the level of earnings deflation is systematically related with the controlling owner's expected benefits measured in several different ways. We also find that the stock price reaction to member-firm merger announcements is negatively correlated with the pre-issue-period earnings deflation.

If the marginal cost of the high-quality firm is relatively high (low), fixed-fee licensing is superior (inferior) to royalty licensing from the viewpoint of the licensor. Surprisingly, consumers are worse off if the quality difference between the two firms is small.

Do CEOs receive large pay because of their unique abilities? We examine those questions using one such ability - the ability to forecast future firm risks - because over the last 40 years, firms' survival and success has become highly dependent on firms' preparedness to face uncertain future business environments. We measure CEOs' risk-forecasting ability by the information contained in their personal equity trades. We find that CEOs' earlier-than-normal stock-option exercises often represent modifications of their personal portfolios in anticipation of future risks unknown to the market today. These results suggest that on average, CEOs can forecast at least some future firm risks better than the market can, and they use that information to modify their personal portfolios. Additional tests show that firms design incentive-compatible compensation contracts by tying high-powered components of CEO compensation to their risk-forecasting abilities, arguably, to competitively sort and attract CEOs with better risk-forecasting abilities and/or to motivate them to expend greater efforts on forecasting risks. We conclude that increases in CEO pay over the last 40 years can be explained, at least partly, by the increasing importance of risk-forecasting skills, especially because firms have become smaller and are more susceptible to failure due to sudden changes in the business environment, but are also more likely to benefit from opportunities created by those changes. © 2013 © 2013 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.","CEO compensation; CEO talent; firm risks; forecasting; long-range planning; stock options",""

Although this evidence typically has been attributed to biases in investors' expectations of earnings, omitted risk factors constitute an equally plausible potential explanation of the delayed returns. For this reason, our paper evaluates whether the earnings expectations implicit in securities prices weight the information in analysts' forecasts, prior-year earnings, and prior securities returns in a manner consistent with their historical relations to earnings. We find that securities prices reflect a significant over-reliance on historical earnings and a substantial under-reliance on both analysts' forecasts and prior-year securities returns. Composite earnings forecasts that are based on the historical relations of realised earnings to analysts' forecasts, prior year earnings and prior year returns have significantly lower forecast errors than do composite earnings forecasts that are based upon inferred investor weightings of these same information variables. Moreover, significant size-adjusted returns are achieved with hedge portfolios based upon errors in investor earnings expectations that are predicted from differences in the historical and investor weights of these complementary information variables. A disproportionate part of these delayed returns occur in earnings announcement months. Overall, these findings lend credibility to the interpretation that biases in investors' earnings expectations, rather than omitted risk factors, underlie at least a portion of the delayed securities returns. © 2004, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","earnings expectations; market mis-pricing; omitted risk factors",""

Audit Requirement Law in Korea. The law requires that firms with assets larger than 6 billion won file audited financial statements regardless of the listing status. Since most private firms in Korea have concentrated ownership by individual owners who are also managers, the agency problem for these firms is small and, therefore, external audits are less likely to be beneficial, as the agency theory suggests. Consequently, small private firms may have little incentive to have external audits. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we find evidence that small private firms manage assets downward to avoid the regulation. Our finding is consistent with the predictions of agency theory that external audits are more beneficial when information asymmetry is large. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","agency cost; asset size reduction; information asymmetry; mandatory audit; small private firms",""

Specifically, controlling for firm- and country-level factors, I document that analyst following is more strongly associated with the extent of note disclosure than the comprehensiveness of the basic financial statements. I further find that analyst following is greater in environments with active IPO markets, suggesting that analysts value the potential for future revenues. Finally, I show that analyst following is negatively related to firm ownership concentration. This is consistent with concentrated ownership changing the nature of the agency problem and reducing the value of analyst-provided services. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","analyst following; disclosures; international; IPO; ownership structure",""

We use a simple model to show that although the latter argument applies in some cases, it is false in others. Specifically, we show that the presence of contingent economic rents is not sufficient for auditors to compromise their independence, nor is the lack of contingent rents sufficient to imply auditors' independence. We also show that contingent rents could increase audit quality and strengthen independence when the risk of misstatements is less than 50 per cent. Our paper provides definitions of independence in appearance and independence in fact. Although the issue of independence relates to the dual notion of appearance and fact, regulations generally focus on appearance. In contrast, the literature on auditors' independence has focused on independence in fact. We bridge the gap by formalising a definition of independence in fact, and a definition of independence in appearance. © 2004, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","audit quality; auditors' independence; securities regulation",""

It is found that dumping is generally more prevalent and the dumping margin is larger with revenue redistribution, as a consequence.

To neutralise the potential confounding effects of cross-border differences, we investigate the relative quality of Big Four vs. non-Big Four audits within each country separately so that each country serves as its own control.

Second, the informativeness of reported earnings is a decreasing function of venture capitalists' ownership of firm equity and a decreasing function of venture capitalists' board representation. Third, stock prices of venture capital backed firms reflect future earnings to a lesser extent relative to non-venture capital backed firms. Our findings support the hypothesis that venture capitalists manage the flow of public information to capital markets and preserve short-term interests arising from specific investment and ownership horizons. This evidence suggests that the benefits of receiving venture capital financing are not without costs.","Earnings informativeness; Investment horizon; Ownership structure; Venture capital",""

Furthermore, when regional free trade blocs remove trade barriers, whether the countries can impose discriminatory road tolls between the local users and the traded-good traffic can affect: With uniform tolls, road tolls, while being regarded as a domestic (internal) policy, may serve partially as strategic trade policies.

Specifically, pro forma compensation expenses disclosed prior to the new accounting regulation are negatively associated with annual stock returns, suggesting that the market interprets these expenses to have negative valuation consequences. In contrast, recognized stock option expenses from using the fair value approach mandated by the HB 3870 are positively associated with stock returns, indicating that the market now interprets these expenses as a type of ""asset"" that contributes positively to firm valuation. Overall, the evidence suggests that the mandatory expensing of employee stock options increases the perceived quality of financial statements and mitigates the perception that firms use stock options opportunistically.

By contrast, the large accounting literature on incentive mechanism design has focused solely on production-related effort, making the implicit assumption that omitting non- production-related effort is without loss of generality. In this paper we develop a model with both types of effort in order to endogenously determine whether non-production-related effort impacts the ability of the firm to achieve its goal through incentive contracts. We show that while introducing non-production-related effort to the principal/agent model limits the power of contracting - meaning that the firm cannot guarantee that it can achieve its desired production- related effort and profit goals - that is not to say that the firm will always be worse off. Depending on the nature of the interaction between the two kinds of effort and their impact on the worker's utility, it is also conceivable that both firm and worker become better off than the standard principal/agent model would predict.","Incentive compensation; Non-production-related effort; Resistance to change",""

This paper utilises the uniqueness of the Australian regulatory setting to investigate whether equity accounting has greater value relevance than the cost method and whether it provides information incremental to the cost method during the “note disclosure period”. The results of both the valuation and returns models provide evidence that equity accounting has value relevance that is incremental to the cost method. Direct comparison of the two methods of accounting provides less conclusive evidence. Equity accounting is found to have statistically greater value relevance than the cost method for the valuation models, but not for the returns models. Differential reporting practices during the period of this study allow an extension of the study to consider two related issues. The first issue looks at the use of supplementary financial statements to report equity accounting as a signal by management of the relevance and/or reliability of equity accounted values. The results indicate that supplementary financial statements do not convey additional relevance or reliability to the market for equity accounted figures. The second extension of the study considers the effect of market value disclosure on the value relevance of equity accounting for companies with investments in publicly traded associates.

However, the lack of obvious and objective metrics for many of the non-financial variables in the Balanced Scorecard means that it remains unclear how the Balanced Scorecard should be implemented, what its usefulness will be and how it should be incorporated into performance evaluation. In this paper, we explore how the information provided by the Balanced Scorecard changes the perceptions of managers and workers about how effort input is translated into output and profit. Within a principal/agent setting, we show that even when the Balanced Scorecard is not explicitly linked to compensation, it can have an implicit effect since the scorecard increases the information content of the metrics that are used by managers when determining pay-for-performance compensation, and managers cannot credibly commit to ignore that information. We identify circumstances where this effect reduces risk, enabling lower cost contracts to be written between the firm and the worker. However, the top-down approach inherent in a Balanced Scorecard implementation may also result in increased ambiguity and perceived risk in worker compensation, a possibility that is not recognised in the Balanced Scorecard literature. This phenomenon, by contrast, can undermine the benefits of implementing the Balanced Scorecard. © 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Balanced Scorecard; pay for performance",""

This is less surprising for ASBE-compliant income, because although ASBE standards are based on IAS, they lack important asymmetric rules, such as lower-of-cost-or-market, and impairment of long-term assets. More striking is the absence of timely loss incorporation in financial statements certified by international auditors as IAS-compliant. IAS resemble common-law standards and are widely believed to increase financial reporting quality. The timely incorporation of losses has become perhaps the single most important feature of income reporting under common law (Basu (1997), Ball, Kothari and Robin (2000)). We attribute the result to the comparatively low incentive of managers and auditors to recognise economic losses in a timely fashion and, conversely, to comparatively high political and tax influences on financial reporting practices.

Accordingly, we predict and find that managers are more likely to recognise (rather than just disclose) revaluations when the revaluation estimate is more reliable. The recognition criteria contained in Australian GAAP implies that market participants will rationally infer that revaluations recognised in the balance sheet are more reliably measured than those disclosed in footnotes. An analysis of share market effects finds that the market discounts disclosure compared to recognition of real estate revaluations. This effect becomes insignificant when controls for the reliability of revaluations are included in the analysis, and we therefore conclude that the value relevance of recognised revaluations is not due to recognition per se, but rather to the fact that the assets being revalued are more reliably measured. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Disclosure; recognition; reliability; Revaluation",""

This study examines insider transaction activity for a sample of 842 companies sued in lawsuits alleging a violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to ascertain whether net insider selling during the litigation class period is unusual in amount and timing relative to net insider selling at other times and at other firms. We find that class period net insider selling for the litigation sample significantly exceeds net insider selling before and after the class period and exceeds net insider selling around the same dates for a sample matched on industry. The more pronounced differences are for firms with a greater asymmetry of information between insiders and outsiders, namely, smaller firms and firms with lower analyst coverage. We also document a significant, positive association between net insider sales and short interest, particularly for smaller firms and for firms with lower analyst coverage and find that the level of insider transaction activity immediately prior to a corrective disclosure is not elevated to a statistically significant degree once we control for short interest and other information variables. These results augment the financial literature by providing evidence of information-based selling by insiders around a disclosure event that leads to securities litigation. From a legal perspective, these results support the view that plaintiffs self select issuers whose patterns of class period insider selling diverge from historical or industry norms. The study is unable to distinguish whether the elevated class period insider selling is the result of insiders' use of material non-public information or insiders' (and short traders') legal use of costly public information. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","class action litigation; insider selling; securities fraud",""

We find that abnormal accruals estimated using a modified version of the Jones (1991) model are associated with lower valuation weights placed on earnings.

Our empirical analysis, conducted on a sample of 803 firm-year observations, supports our hypothesis and provides evidence on management's use of the flexibility afforded under current minimum disclosure requirements to exercise discretion in reporting earnings. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","disclosure quality; earnings management",""

Opponents of inter-period tax allocation argue that in a growing firm most components of the DTL, most notably depreciation, will never reverse or will reverse only in the far future, which reduces their present value to zero or very close to zero. In recent papers, Sansing (1998) and Guenther and Sansing (2000) claim that DTL and DTA have value, though the value does not depend on whether or when it reverses. In this study, I demonstrate that while certain components of the DTL (DTA) have value, the depreciation-related and similar components of the DTL (DTA) have no value whatsoever, irrespective of the reversal period of these temporary differences. I reconcile my results with those of Sansing (1998) and show that once the asset is properly valued at its value to the firm, the DTL becomes redundant. Finally, I show that for those deferred taxes that have value, it is the timing of tax cashflows rather than the timing of their reversal that affects their value. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","accelerated depreciation; deferred taxes; economic depreciation; reversals; valuation",""

However, the evidence varies across type of forecast (good or bad news) and whether the forecast is an initial forecast or the continuance of previous forecasting behavior. Overall, managers' forecast accuracy is linked to a combination of their inside information regarding performance, their incentive to self-select to forecast, and their ability to manage earnings. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2000, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","earnings management; forecast accuracy; inside information; voluntary disclosure",""

Working within a framework that categorises switches as resulting from auditor-client realignments, disagreements over accounting decisions, or dissatisfaction with auditor/client service quality, we find that auditor switches are associated with smaller, higher risk clients. Several other factors such as the issuance of securities and the existence of a modified opinion also increase the probability of an auditor switch. Notably, testing a subsequent time period to DeFond and Subramanyam (1998), we do not replicate their findings that clients with negative prior year abnormal accruals are more likely to switch auditors once other controls are in place. Further, our evidence suggests that clients that switch auditors move closer to the industry norm abnormal accruals in the subsequent period than non-switching clients, regardless of the sign of the prior period abnormal accruals. This result differs from DeFond and Subramanyam (1998) who report larger income increasing abnormal accruals for switchers. In general, we find that abnormal accruals add little explanatory power to models of auditor switching in our sample. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","auditor switching; client risk; discretionary accruals; opinion shopping",""

Finally, it compares the market shares-based measures and the alternative measure with audit firms' postings of their industry specialisation in their home pages on the World Wide Web. The numbers indicate that the auditors' self-reported specialisations are not correlated with market shares for most auditors.

Test results provide evidence that blockholding effect differs not only between state versus legal person ownership, but also between ownership by financial versus non-financial institutions. Majority ownership by state (legal person)-dominated financial institutions is found to have a negative (positive) impact on firm performance. Outside directorship and CEO independence are found to have a positive effect on firm performance, and the effect is stronger for state-dominated than legal person-dominated firms. The size of supervisory committee (part of the two-tier board structure) has a positive effect on the performance of both state and legal person-dominated firms.

Secondly, almost half of chairpersons do not candidly disclose problems that are apparent when they write their statements. Thirdly, prospective disclosures are more optimistic than disclosures about past performance despite significantly worse performance after the chairpersons' statements. Finally, chairpersons' compensation is negatively associated with bad news disclosures. Overall, the results indicate that chairpersons in failing companies hide bad news, and they have incentives to do so. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","disclosure; failing; self-serving",""

Understanding the bias and measurement error properties of discretionary accrual estimates is particularly important because the empirical evidence in many earnings management studies is based entirely on these estimates. The evidence in this study is consistent with structural changes causing measurement error in discretionary accrual estimates. The evidence also shows that the measurement error is correlated with the level of earnings and other variables that have commonly been used by earnings management researchers to partition samples into groups with different earnings management incentives. Such a correlation provides evidence of a strong potential for bias in these estimates. Since the empirical results from many studies are based entirely on these estimates, some earnings management studies may lack valid empirical support. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","discretionary accruals; earnings management; Models selection",""

The auditor's legal exposure was reduced under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and there is evidence that risk-management policies were relaxed after 1994, resulting in riskier clienteles and less conservative reporting strategies for both Big Six and non-Big Six auditors.

We employ a continuous dependent variable to find that accounting discretion is exercised through estimates of goodwill's economic life (amortisation period) in a manner that reflects the firms' underlying growth options. These results are consistent with managers using accounting techniques to reflect firms' investment opportunity sets (IOS). We find that the goodwill accounting decision has a stronger association with IOS variables than with traditionally applied contracting variables. Also, the IOS variables make a greater marginal contribution to the explanatory power of models of goodwill amortisation periods than do traditional contracting or opportunism variables. © City University of Hong Kong. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","accounting choice; contracting; growth options; investment opportunity set",""

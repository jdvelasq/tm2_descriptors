"The impact of the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis on the capital structure of firms in Europe: do SMEs, and listed firms respond the same?","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169685783&doi=10.1080%2f1351847X.2023.2244553&partnerID=40&md5=52cef0c826437181f6bc43a5d3901b4f","This study examines the evolution of the capital structure of European firms during the global financial crisis and European debt crisis. We compare the experiences of SMEs, listed firms and private firms in different industries and investigate the role of country and institutional factors in affecting capital structure. We find that SMEs, private firms, and non-listed firms experience lower declines in leverage relative to large firms during the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. During these crises’ periods, SMEs experience steeper declines in debt maturity, which suggests reliance on short term debt that carries high roll over risks. This behaviour is protracted for firms in the agriculture industry. Both the global financial crisis and EU debt crisis have asymmetric effects on leverage, long term debt issuance and debt maturity across different industries, and across firms of different sizes. Moreover, in countries with more developed financial systems, stronger frameworks for insolvency, resolving firm insolvency, and strong systems for shareholder suits, and director liability, SMEs experience much lower reduction in leverage and debt maturity. This finding suggests that institutional factors help attenuate adverse capital supply shocks. © 2023 The Author(s).

Here we propose the channel and spatial attention convolutional neural network (CS-ACNN) for price trend prediction. It utilizes the attention mechanisms to focus on specific areas of input images that are the most relevant for prices. Using exchange-traded funds (ETF) data from three different markets, we show that CS-ACNN–using images constructed from financial time series–achieves on-par and, in some cases, superior performances compared to models that use time series data only. This holds true for both model classification metrics and investment profitability, and the out-of-sample Sharpe ratios range from 1.57 to 3.03 after accounting for transaction costs. The model learns visual patterns that are consistent with traditional technical analysis, providing an economic rationale for learned patterns and allowing investors to interpret the model. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attention; convolutional neural network (CNN); image; interpretability; Price trend prediction",""

Firstly, our results indicate that financial leverage is positively related to EPU, with this relationship being moderated by uncertainty avoidance, institutional quality, and financial development. Secondly, corporate debt is positively related to corporate diversification. This relationship is stronger for unrelated than for related diversification. In addition to the direct effect, both types of diversification indirectly moderate the positive influence of EPU on leverage, with this effect being stronger for unrelated diversification. Our results show that debt and uncertainty avoidance, institutional quality, and financial development work as substitute mechanisms to alleviate the agency costs caused by EPU and that corporate diversification reduces the informational gap between firm insiders and outside investors exacerbated by EPU. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency theory; Capital structure; corporate diversification; economic policy uncertainty; institutional conditions",""

We find some similar evidence for banks led by CEOs that trace their origin to more individualistic societies.

Additionally, we find that high-unionization firms are in better financial condition prior to covenant violations than low-unionization firms. Our study confirms the existing literature by showing that long-term abnormal stock returns after covenant violations are significantly positive. However, our results also show that high-unionization firms experience smaller stock returns compared to low-unionization firms. Furthermore, we provide evidence that high-unionization firms tend to manipulate earnings downward before covenant violations. These findings suggest that firms may strategically violate debt covenants to gain bargaining flexibility and force labor unions to make concessions in subsequent negotiations. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","covenant violation; debt covenant; earnings management; Labor union; union election",""

Firms exposed to CSI incidents are likely to increase their board gender diversity for reputational purposes. Simultaneously, gender diversity adds skills and networks to boards which supports their monitoring function and should reduce CSI incidents. Econometrically, this relationship is plagued with reverse causality. Consequently, we propose a Granger-style reverse causality minimisation procedure. Our procedure involves three steps. Firstly, we regress board diversity (BD) on lagged CSI to separate diversity into two components, one driven by CSI (BDDCS) and another unrelated to CSI (BDUCS), with the latter being the sum of the intercept and the disturbance term. Secondly, we confirm that BDUCS experiences a near-zero correlation to CSI and that a Granger causality F-test for CSI affecting BDUCS is clearly insignificant. Thirdly, we regress CSI on lagged BDUCS, lagged CSI and its interaction term. Applying our procedure to 2,880 US firms between 2007 and 2016, we find that boards with higher diversity, for reasons other than CSI, were significantly better than their lower diversity counterparts in reducing CSI incidents once encountering them.

We consider a generic smoothing mechanism and numerically analyze how it impacts the risk-return characteristics of a traditional life insurance contract distinguishing between pathwise volatility (of the annual returns) and the volatility of terminal wealth. We find that pathwise volatility is significantly reduced while the distribution of terminal wealth is hardly affected. We conclude that using multiple segregated cover funds (that come with different asset allocations) as building blocks for more complex products enables insurers to offer a variety of risk-return profiles of terminal wealth in combination with a rather low pathwise volatility (compared to investments without smoothing mechanism). This increases subjective attractiveness for a typical consumer. We consider a variety of such products (static and dynamic investment products) and compare them to similar purely market-based products that do not use an insurer's cover fund. Analyzing risk-return characteristics, (objective) utility, and (subjective) attractiveness under Cumulative Prospect Theory and extensions of it, we conclude that products that become possible by implementing multiple segregated cover funds can increase both, objective utility and subjective attractiveness. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collective assets; cumulative prospect theory; insurer's cover fund; Retirement savings; return smoothing",""

Moreover, a macroeconomic factor is incorporated into the MMGBMs. The model complexity is resolved through the introduction of an endogenous intensity function and a recovery rate under the TFHRM. A semi-closed-form solution for pricing defaultable bonds is derived along with a pricing formula for credit spread. A credit cycle is constructed to reflect changes in industry characteristics and macroeconomic factors.

We develop a portfolio-choice model to investigate how capital regulatory reforms influence the risk-taking behavior of financial institutions with different capital adequacy levels. The model predicts that as regulation becomes more stringent, either all firms reduce their risk-taking, or there exists a capital-adequacy threshold below which risk-taking increases. The Chinese insurance solvency regulatory reform provides a unique natural experiment to examine firms’ risk-taking responses to the capital shock driven by the reform. We find that increasing regulatory pressure–i.e. a more stringent regulation–induces greater risk-taking for less capital-adequate insurers, the insurers whose risk-taking the regulator most wants to reduce. We rule out the potential reverse causality that insurers’ risk structures prior to the reform determine their degrees of capital shock and that insurers target low capital-adequate positions by taking more risks prior to the reform. Our results suggest that reinforcing the qualitative risk assessment, increasing the penalties of insolvent insurers, and increasing the risk sensitivity of capital requirements could be effective policy remedies for this backfiring problem. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capital requirements; insurance; portfolio choice; Risk-taking; solvency regulation",""

We use 5-minute high-frequency data to construct two proxies of daily crash risk and apply spillover analysis and network graphs to show that overall connectedness among commodity uncertainties is most significant in the aftermath of COVID-19. High intra-group connectedness and low inter-group connectedness are observed. Since there is an inter-commodity disconnection and intra-commodity connection, the findings suggest that commodity investors diversify crash risk by choosing commodities from different commodity groups rather than picking from within the commodity group. Interestingly, copper and gas exhibit a disconnection from their respective groups, making them suitable diversifiers for other commodity groups and individual commodities in their own groups. Moreover, this property of copper and gas is not much affected during COVID-19. Crash risk connectedness is asymmetric regarding long- and short-run investment horizons, and fear of 2nd wave of COVID-19 signifies pronounced long-term connectedness.

The agent only needs to specify her choice of the physical measure, and we demonstrate both frequentist and Bayesian approaches for this selection. Utility maximization can be seen as a specific method for choosing the physical measure. The resulting likelihood ratio is log-utility optimal with respect to all benchmarks, aligning our approach with finding the growth optimal portfolio described in the literature. Notably, the expected log return corresponds to the relative entropy between the physical and risk-neutral measures, establishing a fundamental link to information theory.

To measure investor preferences for ESG assets, we consider whether the company’s headquarters is located in a Democratic or Republican state and how the state scored in an Environmental survey from Yale University. When investors strongly prefer responsible investments (Democrats), the abnormal returns on ESG investments in these states are negative. Since ESG-motivated investors gain additional utility by holding green assets, they are willing to sacrifice a portion of their returns to incorporate the ESG factor into their portfolio. Conversely, when investors do not value ESG factors to the same extent (Republicans), abnormal returns are not significantly different from zero. We also divide states according to their opinions on environmental issues using a survey and perform the same analysis, confirming the previous results. Our methodology gains validity since the U.S. is in a home bias context. As a result, people tend to invest more in their home state; thus, the returns will reflect their preferences. Furthermore, the results of our research agree with existing theories connecting preferences for ESG investments and expected excess returns. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental awareness; ESG; ESG preferences; portfolio performance; responsible investing",""

Applying our climate risk indices to an asset pricing test framework, we document the emergence of economically significant transition and physical risk premia post-2015. From a firm-level analysis, using firms' GHG emissions, GHG emissions intensity, environmental, and ESG scores, we find that rises in transition (physical) risk are typically associated with an increase (decrease) in the return of green (brown) stocks. Firm-level information is used by investors to proxy firms' climate-risks exposure, especially for transition risk since 2015, whereas the sectoral classification appears to proxy firms' exposures to physical risk.

We establish causality by applying a propensity score matching difference-in-differences (PSM-DiD) method and an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Exploring the underlying mechanisms, we find that financial constraints, information transparency, and agency costs are three plausible channels by which short selling affects employment growth. Furthermore, a series of cross-sectional tests suggest that the effect of short selling on employment growth is concentrated in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), firms with higher operating risk, firms with lower governance quality, firms in regions with weaker labor protection, and in periods prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, our study offers novel evidence on the consequences of short selling on employment growth in an emerging market, complementing the literature on short sales and labor market outcomes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Employment growth; financial constraints; information environment; short sales",""

To help motivate our empirical analysis we initially draw insights from a mean-variance model of optimal portfolio allocation with three tradable asset classes defined by increasing risk, and establish a link between borrowing restrictions and portfolio allocation in the presence of background risk. Our main contribution, however, lies in estimating the role that borrowing constraints play in shaping households' financial portfolio allocation. This is achieved using an ordered fractional probit model. In addition to revealing the significant empirical role played by household borrowing constraints in determining portfolio allocation, our analysis helps us to resolve ambiguity surrounding the behaviour of the medium-risk asset in our motivational theoretical framework. Further, the empirical distribution of medium-risk assets is found to be remarkably similar to that for high-risk assets, suggesting the presence of a more general ‘risk puzzle’, which our borrowing constraints measures partially explain. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, when EPU and ESG ratings are combined, we show that ESG ratings mitigate the detrimental impact of EPU on leverage. Our results also indicate that higher EPU levels force firms to increase their speed of adjustment due to tighter financing requirements, while ESG ratings overcome that issue and enable firms to maintain lower SOA.

We follow the Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR) of Engle and Manganelli (2004) to measure the tail risks and consequently, we produce results for both 1% and 5% VaRs across four variants (Adaptive, Symmetric absolute value, Asymmetric slope and Indirect GARCH) of the CAViaR. Thereafter, we use the “best” fit tail risks in the return predictability of the selected advanced stock markets. For the forecasting exercise, we construct three predictive models (one-predictor, two-predictor and three-predictor models) and examine their forecast performance in contrast with a driftless random walk model. Three findings are discernible from the empirical analysis. First, we find that the choice of VaR matters when determining the “best” fit CAViaR model for each return series as the outcome seems to differ between 1% and 5% VaRs. Second, the predictive model that incorporates both stock tail risk and oil tail risk produces better forecast outcomes than the one with own tail risk indicating the significance of both domestic and global risks in the return predictability of advanced countries. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advanced equity markets; forecasting; Stock returns; tail risks",""

This implies hedge fund managers actively seek arbitrage and inception opportunities, when market conditions are recovering with competition heated up. We also find new hedge funds tend to open in a less popular investment area when investor sentiment is lower and/or it has greater potential to grow in the future. Furthermore, funds, launched in a more competitive market when market condition is poorer, tend to perform better in the subsequent months, with multi-strategies hedge funds showing strong results. Important determinants include minimum investment value, initial fund size and redemption fee.

By employing the method of seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess, the proposed indicator successfully detects the global financial crisis, the Eurozone debt crisis, the Chinese stock market crash, the Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, compared with the traditional topological indicators (e.g. global efficiency, average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and network density), the proposed indicator demonstrates the outstanding characteristics of higher identification accuracy, wider application range and faster response speed. Lastly, the robustness of the Laplacian energy measure in the financial crisis detection is further confirmed in the US, UK, German, French and Spanish stock markets. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complex network; Financial crisis; Laplacian energy; network structure; seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL)",""

To this end, several easily applicable self-managed withdrawal rules are commonly recommended by financial advisors. We cast doubt on the viability of these self-managed withdrawal rules, particularly in an environment with increasing life expectancies and low interest rates. Further, we show that a mixed rule which combines the fixed percentage and the remaining lifetime rule can significantly improve retirees' welfare in an expected utility framework compared to other simple self-managed withdrawal rules.

Since existing studies focus on listed firms, little is known of the case of private firms, in spite of their relevance in both developed and developing economies. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap. We develop an empirical study on the impact of the WACC on private firms' investment rates. We exploit accounting information on a panel of around 1700 French private corporate groups in the non-farm, non-financial sectors, covering the period 2005–2015. We overcome the challenge posed by the lack of observable information about the cost of equity for private firms by developing a methodology that relies on estimates for comparable public firms. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in the WACC (2 percentage points) leads to a 0.7 percentage point decrease in the investment rate the following year. Increases in both components of the WACC, namely the cost of debt and the cost of equity, are associated with lower investment rates. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the heightened WACC following the euro area crises reduced the aggregate corporate investment rate of French private firms by a cumulative 1.6 percentage points over 2009–2015. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Corporate investment; cost of equity; debt; privately held firms; WACC",""

Upper echelons theory argues that better managerial education attainment fosters a higher ability to process complex information and tolerate ambiguity.

A multinomial probit model analysing firms’ choice between convertibles, seasoned equity, and straight bonds provides evidence consistent with this hypothesis. A one-level increase in a CEO’s highest academic degree raises the likelihood of substituting convertibles for non-hybrid securities by 2.86%, after controlling for standard corporate security choice determinants.

We have constructed a composite ERM index of 76 variables based on the responses from the chief risk officers (CROs) of 44 insurance entities in one of the EU’s largest insurance markets, namely, Spain. The results show that the higher the degree and quality of ERM implementation there is, the better the return on equity (ROE) and risk-adjusted return on assets (ROAadj) there is. We find that risk governance makes performance standards higher and more stable. Finally, our results suggest that models that run on Solvency II penalize small companies, meaning that improvements in management can offset the costs involved in its implementation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ERM; Insurance companies; Performance; Risk Governance; Solvency II",""

This paper considers the issue of attracting new entrepreneurs to agriculture from behavioral decision theory perspective and suggests celebrity branding as a tool of agricultural entrepreneurship fostering. Through the application of multi-criteria decision analysis, the paper proves that celebrity branding has a significant positive effect on attractiveness of entrepreneurship in agriculture and on expected financial and non-financial benefits from entrepreneurial career in the sector. Also, the paper reveals that financial motivation plays the most important role for individuals attracted to urban spheres of entrepreneurship and is the second most important factor (after self-realization) for individuals attracted to the agricultural sphere of entrepreneurship.

The result implies that the pandemic results in a higher possibility of suffering extremely large losses in the stock prices of the global banking sector.

This generates a sizable downturn during the lockdown due to the indirect effects of the shock (network-based financial accelerator). In the second scenario, only those upstream firms located in the ‘red zone’ are forced to contract production. In this case, the recession is milder and the recovery begins earlier. Upstream firms hit by the shock, in fact, will be abandoned by their customers who will switch to suppliers who are located outside the red zone.

The conclusion is that P2P debt plays a unique role in accommodating the outside entrepreneurial capital needs of these SMEs wanting medium term funding. The empirical work employs a sample 1,249 small, private SMEs that received P2P loans with maturities of up to five years 2013–2015 from Funding Circle, the leading UK P2P business lender. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bank debt; Debt crowdfunding; Marketplace lending; Peer-to-peer lending; SME finance",""

We first employ an asymmetric power ARCH-based ADCC model on an extended dataset employed by Kenourgios et al. (2016). Our sample ranges from July 2007 to June 2021 covering the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the European Sovereign Debt Crisis (ESDC), and the COVID-19 pandemic. Econometric tests suggest strong evidence of coupling in the bulk of Islamic equity indices. A handful of emerging market indices constitute exceptions. Qualitatively similar results emerge from time–frequency analysis via wavelet tools, revealing pervasive coupling in both returns and volatility series. The linkages are scale-dependent in only a few pairs. In contrast, Sukuk indices are uncoupled from their global fixed income counterparts and relevant risky debt portfolios. In sum, the risk-return characteristics of Islamic equities (especially in developed economies) remain coupled to major global benchmarks and therefore are unlikely to appeal as safe haven candidates. The converse applies to Sukuk, which promises potential portfolio diversification benefits and safe haven status in ‘normal’ and crisis periods. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; Financial Crisis; financial risk management; Islamic assets; Islamic stocks; safe haven; Shariah-compliant investment",""

We show that even though industry effects have been looked at in the various capital structure determination studies, they have not been thoroughly studied in capital structure literature. We apply an interaction effects methodological approach and show that capital structure determinants do differ in terms of magnitude and direction across industries, concluding that industry specifications should be investigated more thoroughly when exploring the capital structure determination puzzle. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Capital structure; financial leverage; industry differences; interaction effects",""

Results confirm that individuals with higher reliance on Type 1 (or Type 2) and expressive suppression (or cognitive reappraisal) exhibit lower (or higher) preferences for the selection of value versus growth stocks.

Due to performance bonuses in fund managers' rewards, there is a highly non-linear relationship between the wealth of the client and the fees that the manager receives. We demonstrate that jumps in equity returns can lead to a conflict of interest between the investor and the manager in such a setting. Specifically, the managers' option-type payment structure can incentivise them to not account for the downside risk induced by jumps, especially if the fund manager is only in post for a few years; thus managers may pursue a more aggressive asset allocation strategy than their clients desire. Our key policy recommendation is that regulators should consider imposing a negative fund fee in times of very poor absolute fund performance to mitigate against suboptimal fund management asset allocation decisions. © 2022 The Author(s).

Our results show that none of our banking-health variables have explanatory power on the cross-section of European stock returns. These findings contrast those for the US.

Notably, it is found that the dependencies among European stock indexes are generally stable, even during the crisis periods. Then an influence measure is proposed for each individual market based on the tail dependence. Interestingly, the influence ranking is also stable for both the whole period and two big drawdown days in crisis periods. To be specific, AEX (Netherlands), FCHI (France), and GDAXI (Germany) always show the most significant influences, while SPX (USA) is always the least influential one. Finally, an equal-weighted portfolio is built to measure the systemic risk in the European stock markets. It is found that both patterns of risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are different from the time-varying tail dependence. There exist obvious inverted spikes on 16 October 2008 and 16 March 2020.

In addition, the latent impacts of the recent US–China trade war on spillovers are also explored. We conclude that crude oil is an information transmitter while Bitcoin is an information receiver in terms of the static and time-varying between-market transmission of three types of risk. The effect is affected by the occurrence of the trade war such that the information content of Bitcoin is enhanced once it begins.

In contrast, banks with compete- and create-dominant organizational cultures are more likely to utilize discretionary LLPs when competition increases. Moreover, banks use discretionary LLPs to smooth income and signal private information to outsiders. Banks with collaborate-dominant organizational cultures exhibit less income smoothing.

However, empirical evidence has come mostly from controlled experiments, and evidence from real data is rare. This paper uses panel data from a nationally representative survey in China to test whether prospect theory can explain stock market participation.

After real income and other factors are controlled for, the relative loss between expected and real income increases by 10,000 RMB, the probability of holding stocks increases by 0.77% and stock investment increases by 11.78%. The mechanism behind this is that relative losses motivate individuals to take excessive risks to hedge losses, while relative gains increase risk aversion and the holding of safe assets. These results can explain the puzzle of limited stock market participation. Participation costs are the main factor that restricts the low-income group from participating in the stock market, while the high-income group often faces relative gains, which leads to increased risk aversion and unwillingness to hold stocks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","expected income; Prospect theory; reference dependence; risk aversion; stock market participation",""

We evaluate their performance against that of a random walk using two criteria: Root Mean Square Error ratios and the Clark-West statistic.

To this aim, we rely on a flexible dynamic econometric model that not only features time-varying coefficients, but also allows for the entire forecasting model to change over time to capture the time variation in the exposures of major digital currencies to the predictive variables. Besides, we investigate whether the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in an already diversified portfolio leads to additional economic gains. The main empirical results suggest that cryptocurrencies are not systematically predicted by stock market factors, precious metal commodities or supply factors. On the contrary, they display a time-varying but significant exposure to investors' attention. In addition, also because of a lack of predictability compared to traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies lead to realized expected utility gains for a power utility investor. © 2022 The Author(s).

Debt adjustment costs render the leverage commitment a double-edged sword. High-levered firms benefit from the commitment due to active debt repurchase. However, such debt buyback incurs a heavy burden and constrains financial flexibility. With high debt adjustment costs, it could be inefficient for the enterprise to maintain a firm-optimal debt policy. Interestingly, the incentive alignment effect from commitment makes shareholders act as if creditors in normal times. For instance, shareholders exhibit precautionary motives and overinvest. Finally, we show that dynamic risk management exacerbates the debt-equity conflicts and improves the commitment value.  Highlights The firm-optimal debt policy eliminates the leverage ratchet effect by accelerating debt repayment should the firm's fundamental deteriorates.

Increased attention, therefore, has been directed to central bank policy tools which can affect liquidity, even as policy rates approach the zero lower bound. This study examines the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council’s communication in influencing financial market liquidity. A specialized lexicon is used to extract sentiments on (i) monetary policy and (ii) economic outlook from ECB Governing Council statements between 2006 and 2016. The analysis reveals that ECB sentiments on ‘economic outlook’ are more consequential for money market (MM) liquidity than for currency, equity and bond (CEB) liquidity. Sentiments on ‘monetary policy’ produce a statistically significant effect on CEB liquidity; with more ‘hawkish’ sentiments leading to declines in liquidity. Volatility in global financial markets, however, plays a relatively more robust role than ECB sentiments in influencing market liquidity. The results are corroborated using an alternative and more generic quantifier called the Loughran and McDonald (LM) sentiment quantifier. The specialized lexicon provides richer inferences than the LM quantifier, however, since it captures the ‘hawkishness’ or ‘dovishness’ of monetary policy tone and the ‘positivity’ or ‘negativity’ of the Governing Council’s sentiments on economic outlook. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, none of the existing studies has looked at the interaction effect of the two on poverty. Our contribution to this literature is manifold. First and foremost, we investigate whether financial development and financial stability are substitutes or complements in reducing poverty and find evidence in favor of the former: Financial development has greater effects on poverty alleviation in a more fragile financial system and vice-versa. Second, using two different measures of financial stability, we show that financial stability is associated with lower levels of poverty. And finally, while previous studies have presumed that the effect of financial development on poverty is homogeneous at various levels of poverty, we show that financial development and financial stability both exert heterogeneous effects on poverty depending on the level of poverty considered. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Financial development; financial stability; heterogeneous effects; poverty",""

The bail-in regime was designed to make banks efficiently resolvable in order to abolish Implicit Government Guarantees (IGGs). We use a seemingly-unrelated-regressions framework to estimate the effects on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and equity returns of key events associated with the two cornerstones of the European bail-in regime, the Bank Recovery & Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM-R), and other relevant events. Contrary to the regulations’ objectives, we find that regulatory events associated with the implementation of BRRD and SRM-R led to tighter CDS spreads and higher equity returns over the 2009–2017 period. The pattern varies with bank heterogeneity and is particularly pronounced for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), i.e. banks whose systemic risk profile is deemed to be of such importance that the bank's failure would trigger a wider financial crisis and threaten the global economy, suggesting that the regime does not effectively solve the systemic problem of bailout expectations in the European banking sector. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bail-in; bank recovery & resolution directive (BRRD); European banking regulation; global systemically important bank (G-SIB); implicit government guarantee; single resolution mechanism (SRM); too-big-to-fail",""

Gross directional spillovers suggest that shadow policy rates have more ‘to give than to receive’, while those from and to cryptocurrency returns are naturally volatile. There is also strong interconnectedness between monetary policy in either the US or the Eurozone and the UK, and between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Capital shocks are nevertheless transmitted into liquidity positions through balance sheet adjustments. Addressing bank-level balance sheet policies, we find that the banks de-risk assets by replacing corporate loans with financial securities, especially if the shock takes place during periods of heightened central bank interventions. Moreover, asset-side-dominant risk-reducing behavior goes against regulatory intent and indicates that regulatory arbitrage considerations affect banks’ responses to shocks. Finally, we document heterogeneous responses by banks depending on their size, type, and country.

The tendency to hold losers is partially offset with literacy: a university degree reduces the propensity to hold on to loser funds, in addition to greater financial knowledge and stronger math skills. Literacy also plays a role in shaping the way experience affects this bias.

The result is robust to alternative tests and analysis of subsamples. We also find that differences in uncertainty between host and home countries are informative of bidders’ payment choices.

We shed new light on this issue by analyzing both regulatory and accounting standards, i.e. capital requirements and loan loss provisions. Examining a sample of large European banks for the years 2002–2015, we show that regulatory risk sensitivity, i.e. the response of Basel risk weights to asset volatility as our measure of a bank's asset portfolio risk, is substantially higher than what has been shown so far in the literature. Despite the occasionally bad reputation that risk weights have, we provide new evidence that they are adequately calibrated for banks with low or medium levels of risk. For crisis periods and for high-risk banks, however, risk weights still do not adequately reflect the actual portfolio risk. This results in insufficient capital, even with the stricter Basel III minimum capital requirements. Regarding loan loss provisions, we establish a theoretical link between expected losses and asset volatility. We document a strong empirical association, which fits well to the theoretical model.

We model the flow of market orders, limit orders, and cancelations by a self- and crossexciting multitype marked Hawkes process with state-dependent baseline intensities. The marks carry the order sizes and the state of the book is summarized by the ‘limit-order-book imbalance’. We specify the model very carefully–with few a priori assumptions: we select the non-zero excitements (the ‘Hawkes skeleton’), the shape of the decay kernels, and the shape of the impact functions in a nonparametric manner. Furthermore, we show that our data exhibit perfect bid–ask symmetry. We observe that the imbalance of the order book explains the probability for a bid (ask) market order–given the occurrence of a market order–in a perfectly linear manner. Thus, we include a term involving the imbalance in the baseline intensity of the process. We calibrate the specified parametric model by maximum likelihood estimation and discuss the results. Finally, we apply the fitted model in order to estimate the conditional distribution of the next order type. This opens the door to order-type prediction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Hawkes graph; Hawkes process; limit-order book model; MLE; nonparametric estimation",""

However, speculators’ heterogeneity occasionally vanishes, e.g. due to panic-induced herding behavior, yielding extreme returns. Lasting regimes with high volatility originate from the fact that speculators extract stronger trading signals out of past stock price movements when stock prices fluctuate strongly.

A multi-agent model is employed to build an artificial economy with households, firms, and banks where occasional liquidity crises emerge. The systemic importance of banks is captured by a score-based mechanism reflecting banks' characteristics in terms of size or interconnectedness. We compare three degrees of heterogeneity in the configuration of financial networks related to different banking concentrations in the loan market. The main findings suggest that: (i) reducing the heterogeneity of the banking network stabilizes the economy by itself; (ii) the identification criteria of systemic-important institutions are affected by the heterogeneity of networks; it is preferable applying systemic capital surcharges to the largest banks under high heterogeneity and targeting those most interconnected under low heterogeneity; (iii) the effectiveness of systemic capital buffers is preserved under high heterogeneity when a common asset holding contagion channel is added. However, simple measures based on risk-weighted assets capital ratios appear to be more effective in low heterogeneous systems. Thus, we argue that prudential regulation should account for the characteristics of the banking networks and tune macroprudential tools accordingly. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agent-based model; capital buffers; capital requirements; financial networks; macroprudential policy; systemic risk",""

Our results indicate that R&D subsidies reduce financial constraints irrespective of ownership type; however, the reduction appears more pronounced for private-owned enterprises (POEs) compared with state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Further analysis reveals that the impact of R&D subsidies on R&D investments depends on the interactive effect between financial constraint and ownership type. For financially constrained SOEs, subsidies spur net R&D investment whereas this is not the case for financially constrained POEs. We also examine the potential factors through which ownership types and financial constraints affect innovation input, namely, institutional development and industrial competition. Our evidence indicates that, in a more institutionally developed province, the effect of subsidies on net R&D input is negative for SOEs, but positive for POEs. In a more competitive industry, SOEs tend to face less agency risk and stronger monitoring, while POEs depend more on their financial slack.

In this approach, we directly relate state variables to portfolio weights, rather than firstly modeling the return distribution and subsequently estimating the portfolio choice. The method captures nonlinearity among the state (predicting) variables and portfolio weights without assuming any particular distribution of returns and other data, without fitting a model with a fixed number of predicting variables to data and without estimating any parameters.

We find that, irrespective of previous business ties with the target firm, target prices become more optimistic (and, as a consequence, less accurate) in the run-up to an investment banking transaction for target firms located in countries with weaker enforcement regimes. In contrast, for firms in countries with stronger enforcement regimes, we observe the opposite to be the case. Furthermore, we find that analysts’ optimistic biases have been mitigated, but not fully eliminated, since the implementation of the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in 2007 in low-enforcement countries.

This opens the way to unconditional reactive portfolio optimization when there are not enough points to calibrate dynamical conditional covariance models, which happens, for example, when new assets appear in a market. The method is a k-fold boosted version of the Bootstrapped Average Hierarchical Clustering cleaning procedure for correlation and covariance matrices. We apply this method to global minimum variance portfolios and find that k should increase with the calibration window length. We compare the performance of k-BAHC with other state-of-the-art covariance cleaning methods, including dynamical conditional covariance (DCC) with non-linear shrinkage. Generally, we find that our method yields better Sharpe ratios after transaction costs than competing unconditional covariance filtering methods, despite requiring a larger turnover.

This is because severe information asymmetry results in high uncertainty surrounding China's P2P lending industry. Specifically, we examine three behavioural aspects of P2P lending: lending sentiments, herding, and speculation. Using a sample of 918 P2P platforms from October 2015-September 2019, we document that positive P2P news release in the media (sentiments) encourages P2P lending; P2P platforms herd on their peers in making lending decisions; and P2P lending contains speculative elements and is driven by real estate bubbles. Moreover, we find that these behavioural effects are less profound if P2P platforms adopt a fund custody mechanism in which commercial banks provide custodian services for investor funds used for P2P lending. This result suggests that behavioural factors are more important in explaining P2P lending when information asymmetry is more severe. We obtain these results by controlling for other usual factors that can explain P2P lending, including characteristics of P2P platforms, macroeconomic variables, and other variables reflecting features of P2P operating environment.

However, cf exerts a negative but negligible impact on housing prices in the short-run; it has a strong and positive effect in the long-run. Further, controlling for effects of economic policy uncertainty strengthens the interactions between housing prices and the two credit components. Our results are robust and suggest that close monitoring of credit allocation to housing demand and supply sides, as well as the extent of pump-priming resource allocation to the real economy, should be of interest to policymakers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Business cycles; Credit disaggregation strategy; Economic policy uncertainty; International housing price dynamics; Panel VAR",""

We consider two scenarios. In the first one, because of the lockdown, all the upstream firms are forced to cut production. This generates a sizable downturn during the lockdown due to the indirect effects of the shock (network-based financial accelerator). In the second scenario, only those upstream firms located in the ‘red zone’ are forced to contract production. In this case, the recession is milder and the recovery begins earlier. Upstream firms hit by the shock, in fact, will be abandoned by their customers who will switch to suppliers who are located outside the red zone. In this way, firms endogenously reconstruct (at least in part) the supply chain after the disruption. This is the main determinant of the mitigated impact of the shock in the ‘red zone’ type of lockdown. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credit network; financial accelerator; lockdown; Supply chain",""

Consistently, my findings suggest that high-customer-risk firms are particularly more likely to be subject to (stricter) borrowing base provisions, which tie the value of a credit line to that of some eligible collateral (notably accounts receivable).

We model the double bind problem that providers of banking services for the poor face as they struggle to achieve economies of scale to drive down average fixed financial infrastructure costs, while average account balances are low due to insufficient income. This model is applied to the Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojna (PMJDY) financial inclusion scheme in India, that was started in 2014. An innovative approach based on cross sectional bank level data from 2014 till 2017 is used to quantify the incentives and costs involved in targeting unbanked households. This gives a monetary estimate of the economic shortfalls or surpluses for participating banks, measured as bank balances relative to outlay costs and subsidies per PMJDY beneficiary. A lack of economic viability of PMJDY accounts is found in the majority of Indian public sector banks, a matter which is problematic in view of their extant financial fragility. We provide evidence for cross subsidization of rural bank accounts by urban accounts. We use fixed effects panel methods to determine what cost public sector banks bear and also quantify the extent to which account ineffectiveness is ameliorated by exogenous factors, primarily the tie up of PMJDY accounts with bio-metric Aadhar cards and electronic direct benefit transfer of G2P payments. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","account ineffectiveness; direct benefit transfer; economic viability; Financial inclusion; fixed effects panel regression; funding gap",""

Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI.

We construct a sentiment index based on news stories that follow the announcements of four macroeconomic indicators: GDP, unemployment, Consumer Price Index (CPI) and durable goods. By controlling for a number of potential biases we determine as to whether each of the series' have a significant impact on Bitcoin returns. While an increase in positive news surrounding unemployment rates and durable goods would typically result in a corresponding increase in equity returns, we observe the opposite to be true in the case of Bitcoin. Increases in positive news after unemployment and durable goods announcements result in a decrease in Bitcoin returns. Conversely, an increase in the percentage of negative news surrounding these announcements is linked with an increase in Bitcoin returns. News relating to GDP and CPI are found not to have any statistically significant relationships with Bitcoin returns.

Career concerns of banking analysts cause an upward bias in forecast revision and deterioration in forecast accuracy only if the potential employer is a systemically important bank (SIB). We find consistent evidence linking competition among banking analysts with optimistic and inaccurate forecasts, which is consistent with analysts seeking to use inflated forecasts to curry favour and attract businesses to their brokerage house around the time of operational risk disclosures.

To motivate our approach and to establish the need for such research, we first review the increasingly important literature on emotions in financial markets. While emotions influence investors in financial markets, there is a lack of precision concerning the exact nature of these influences. To remedy this, we identify and address a number of issues deriving from the current state of the finance literature. One issue concerns the lack of clarity in defining different emotion constructs. Another is the lack of a general emotion-based account of financial behavior. Our contribution is a classification of emotion-related phenomena and an emotion-based account of how anticipatory and anticipated emotions interact to determine investors’ buy and sell preferences in asset markets. Preliminary experimental results support our emotion-based account. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Emotion; financial market; investor; preference",""

We employ daily Google search activity on sleepiness terms (e.g. sleep deprivation) to develop an index and find that a one-day lagged sleepiness index is related negatively to US stock market returns. When investors lack sleep, stock market returns are relatively low. This pattern could be explained by sleep deprivation causing an increased level of investor anxiety and risk aversion. We find that this relation is most pronounced on days with high uncertainty in the market. Sleep is negatively related to stock market returns even after controlling for sentiment.

We claim that the Brexit outcome could realistically have been predicted hours before the market adjusted to the outcome. This inefficiency is identified by comparing the market-implied probability of a Brexit outcome with a separate probability, estimated by a standard Monte-Carlo algorithm based on a simple linear regression model, representative of what should have been easily possible in real time. The core of the method is the real-time re-calibration of ex-ante ‘pollster’ predictions for the voting district outcomes by regressing the observed voting results onto them. For comparative purposes, a study of the MXNUSD exchange rate in the 2016 US Presidential Election was done, finding that the market-implied and model-estimated probabilities moved more consistently toward the Trump outcome. Put together, this identifies a somewhat anomalous breakdown in market efficiency in the case of the Brexit vote, which we attribute to its novelty as well as a kind of political bubble and subsequent crash, generated by confirmation bias and social herding. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","efficient market hypothesis; market failure; natural experiment; Prediction",""

Also, there are several empirical works showing that a stochastic volatility model driven by the fractional Brownian motion well approximates at-the-money volatility skew near expiration. In this paper, we choose the log-normal SABR model with fractional stochastic volatility to valuate variance and volatility swaps. We derive a closed-form exact solution for the fair strike price of the variance swap by using fractional Ito calculus, while we obtain an approximate solution for the fair strike price of the volatility swap by exploiting the shifted log-normal approximation. Also, solution formulas for the variance and volatility option prices are derived. Their accuracy is confirmed through numerical studies.

An integral pricing formula of call options is derived when the default intensity follows an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. For practical purposes, we work under the default intensity captured by Cox–Ingersoll–Ross and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes respectively, and numerical results show that the differences in the values of vulnerable options under these two intensity processes are tiny.

In addition, the economic policy-making of governments has been shown to have a significant impact on financial markets. In this paper, for the first time, we combine these two findings to examine whether, and if so how, culture and economic policy uncertainty have an impact on style investing, and more specifically on the popular momentum investing. We also extend previous studies in that we employ additional cultural dimensions, rather than just individualism, such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation (Hofstede [1980].

Our results indicate a strong link between cultural dimensions, economic policy uncertainty, and momentum investing in international financial markets. We argue that this link is not affected by differences in the economic cycle, and/or global variables such as oil prices and global market-related uncertainty, and that apart from individualism, there are other cultural elements, which may influence momentum investing. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural dimensions; Economic policy uncertainty; international equity markets; momentum investing",""

Denmark offers a unique setting providing solid identification for testing risk incentives from deposit insurance under strong capital regulation. The Danish system is a universal system without strong risk exposure regulation. Commercial banks and savings banks have different ownership structures but are subject to the same set of regulations, but savings banks have no incentive to increase risk after the implementation of a deposit insurance scheme. We show that commercial banks did not increase their risk at the introduction of deposit insurance compared to savings banks. We attribute this to strong capital requirements and a firm closure policy. The results also hold for large commercial banks, indicating that the systemic risk did not increase either. Finally, there is no evidence that commercial banks increase their risk by allowing their customers to increase their leverage (risk) compared with customers in savings banks. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Deposit insurance; difference-in-difference; moral hazard",""

As the conversion risk in CoCos is closely associated with the issuer's capital structure and the stock price at conversion, we model both equity and credit risk to frame this optimisation problem. This study aims to answer two questions that (i) how investors should optimally allocate their financial wealth between a CoCo and a risk-free bond; and (ii) which approach–investing in a CoCo or in a stock issued by the same bank–could result in higher expected returns. First, we derive the dynamic of a coupon-paying CoCo price under a reduced-form approach. We then decompose the problem into pre- and post-conversion regimes to obtain closed-form optimal strategies. A comparative simulation leads us to conclude that, under various market conditions, investing in a CoCo with a risk-free bond provides a higher expected growth than investing in stock. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contingent convertible bond; Growth portfolio optimisation; sensitivity analysis; statistical comparisons",""

In this paper, we assess the impact of a natural disaster (Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004) on the aggregate supply of credit to provinces throughout Thailand. The results of our investigation suggest that the tsunami has long-lasting negative effects on bank lending, albeit the effects are spread unevenly across geographic areas with most of the reduction in aggregate lending occurring in severely affected provinces. We also find that the presence of bank branches in affected regions mitigates some of the adverse lending effects that follow the tsunami. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bank lending; credit supply; difference-in-differences; Indian Ocean Tsunami; natural disaster; Thailand",""

We analyze the data by using cross-tabulations, chi-square tests, logistic regressions, and a marginal effect analysis. The results show that male students, students who keep expense records, or their father is highly educated are more financially literate. We also examine the dimensions of financial fragility, and the results show that financially literate students are better able to cope with an unexpected financial shock.

On one hand, they could be seen as a tool to reduce the system’s dependence on banks and increase the availability of credit for start-ups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). On the other hand, there is the counterweight of disadvantages that investors may face by investing in crowdfunding (i.e. complex and incomplete laws, and weak protection). This paper is primarily intended as a primer on the use of tax incentives for crowdfunding in Europe. In this study, we first examine the implementation of tax incentive schemes in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. Then, we analyse and compare the characteristics of such schemes along three dimensions: the incentives structure; the business characteristics; and the type of investor. We find that tax incentive schemes for crowdfunding vary widely in their form and other features of their design. Moreover, the most used forms of tax incentives are those that provide for an up-front tax credit on the amount invested in early-stage ventures. These incentives have an immediate effect on the annual income tax of the investor. A central implication is that the more tax incentive schemes are properly designed and tailored for crowdfunders, the more investors, start-ups and other firms with low liquidity could use crowdfunding as a source of funding. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Crowdfunding investment; Entrepreneurial finance; European countries; Government Policy and Regulation; Tax incentives",""

We argue that unlisted firms, which are smaller, face a greater wedge between the cost of external and internal finance and as a result they need to rely more on the later. Relying on internal funds means that firms have a precautionary motive to hold cash. We test our theory using an unbalanced panel of mainly small medium enterprises within the euro area over the period 2003–2017 paying special attention to the role of financial pressure, financial constraints and the recent financial crisis. Our findings reveal that unlisted firms hold more cash than their listed counterparts due to precautionary motives. In addition, when considering the effect of financial pressure, the results show that the difference in cash holdings between listed and unlisted firms exhibit a ‘U-shaped’ relationship. Finally, unlisted firms have a higher sensitivity to save cash out of cash flow than listed firms.

In this paper, we provide a novel approach for solving the problem of optimal portfolio selection for asymmetric distributions of the stock returns, by putting it into a framework of a mean-variance-skewness measure. Moreover, our optimal solutions are explicit and are closed-form. In particular, we provide an analytical portfolio optimization solution to the exponential utility of the well-known skew-normal distribution.

In a perfect market, with self-less management, aiming to maximise shareholder wealth, it may be expected that hedging would improve firm performance and add value. Our major contribution in this paper is that we first demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which hedging can increase or decrease firm value. Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005–2017.

The key proposition of the paper lies in the treatment of the financial statements as a matrix of codetermined information constrained by double entry, where the expected value of each of the individual items that comprise the financial statements will be mirrored elsewhere in the system with a different sign. Given that the change in net operating assets shares the same variation as the change in net financial claims, it is shown, by formally identifying the articulation, that empirical application will yield increased precision and improved efficiency by comparison to the more traditional methods that fail to specify the structural double entry property. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Double entry constraint; financial econometrics; financial statements; identification; structural systems",""

Empirical analysis based on FTSE 100 stock price data for the five year period ending in 2017 shows that the scale of the errors in computed abnormal returns will hinge on the volatility of the returns generating process but will be particularly pronounced for relatively low stock prices. Although our principal focus is with comparing abnormal returns on the GBM and Feller diffusion, we also simulate logarithmic returns for the Uhlenbeck and Ornstein (1930) process, several interpretations of the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) process and the scaled ‘t’ process of Praetz (1972) and Blattberg and Gonedes (1974). Taken in conjunction with the GBM and the Feller diffusion, these processes underpin virtually every equilibrium based asset pricing model which appears in the literature. However, computing abnormal returns for any of these processes using the expected logarithmic returns formula for the GBM inevitably leads to errors in the abnormal returns. Hence, an important principle which emerges from our analysis is that it is crucially important for researchers and others to test the compatibility of empirically observed returns with the distributional assumptions on which the empirical analysis is based if the complications arising from mis-specified modelling procedures are to be avoided. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Abnormal return; feller diffusion; geometric brownian motion; logarithmic return",""

Moreover, a market is assumed to be efficient only if no dominating strategies exist. Empirically, many studies of the pricing kernel find non-monotonicity, apparently ruling out market efficiency.

Analysis conducted using the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the prospectuses from 1997 to 2011 show that VC-funded firms are less optimistic in tone. VC-financed firms do so to reduce litigation risks and protect their reputational capital; the effect of conservative tone management is more pronounced when they hire large auditors, receive more analyst coverage, operate in high-tech sectors and in industries with high litigation risk. Further, tone is not related to the conveying of private information as IPO firms that received VC funding experience larger surprise unexpected returns and perform better than non-VC-backed offers in the long run. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Equity offerings; litigation; textual analysis; venture capital",""

This paper investigates the effect of the overall bank regulatory reform, considering each associated individual announcement, on Credit Default Swaps (CDS), bank stocks and stock futures during 2012–14. Announcements related to the implementation of the supervisory mechanism, as well as those on the new resolution framework, led to a surge in bank CDS spreads, while having a detrimental effect on the wealth of banks’ shareholders. The CDS market response to sub-events associated with the ECB’s 2014 Comprehensive Assessment (CA) was positive and reflected in a decrease in bank CDS spreads. Furthermore, CDS of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) demonstrated a significant reaction to the implementation steps in the BU. Banks’ stock prices reacted in a consistent manner with the CDS market. The stock futures market did not reveal any strong reaction to the changes in the European regulatory landscape. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that bank capitalization is positively associated with responses of G-SIBs’ CDS spreads, but is inversely related to responses of CDS spreads for other bank groups. Weak underlying credit quality is also a relevant factor in explaining abnormal increases in CDS spreads. For the stock market, positive associations of the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) with capital levels and with the business model orientation are revealed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CDS; European Banking Union; regulatory reform; stock futures market; stock market",""

While the results on loan spreads are mixed, we find consistent evidence that unionization has significant effect on loan covenants with industry and firm level unionization data as well as the instrument variable analysis. Labor unions’ risk preference is similar to that of creditors. Therefore, it helps align the interests between banks and labor unions, thus reducing the cost of bank loans in terms of loan covenants. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bank loans; Labor unions; loan covenants; union election",""

The aim is to analyze, from a macroeconometric point of view, if credit growth rate is simply affected by bad loans stock variation or if there are other proxies of credit worsening that could have an influence on it. We use a factor model approach to capture all the pervasive factors that could affect the cyclical dynamics of the credit market, and we take into account the structural breaks induced by the Great Recession using quarterly data for the period 1998:4–2014:4. We reach the conclusion that new bad loans entry rate is the credit quality proxy that seems to express a significant and robust impact on lending dynamics. An increase of this ratio seems to cause a loans contraction after only 3 months and this evidence is useful in formulating some policy conclusions about banking system stability. We provide also results on new bad loans entry rate dynamics, finding a significant relation with GDP at infra-annual period (6 months). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credit deterioration; Credit market stability; empirical finance; factor models; FAVAR",""

The scope of the paper is to analyze determinants of distress by focusing the attention on trade-credit chains as the key source of contagion effects in 2009–2013. Financial and liquidity imbalances propagate along the supply chain: firms respond to late payments from customers by defaulting on payments to suppliers. The novelty of our approach consists of applying spatial econometric techniques to assess spillover effects of trade debt. We employ a representative sample of around 12,000 Italian manufacturing firms that combines balance sheet items with information collected in the Credit Register of the Italian central bank. Our proxy for supply-chain interconnections is a matrix of firm-to firm transactions which mirrors the networked structure of the industrial system. Estimates show that trade debt has been affected by spillover effects during the great crisis of 2009–2013. Moreover, trade debt and financial indebtedness exerted an impact of almost identical magnitude on firms' distress likelihoods. This evidence sheds light on the importance to move away from a static view of the trade-credit phenomenon, and to integrate solvency models with detailed information on firm-to-firm transactions which is increasingly available through big data collection. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contagion; insolvency; network; spatial model; Supply chain; trade credit",""

Future expected returns for both the funded part and the buffer fund of the PAYG are simulated through the non-overlapping block bootstrap technique. Second, in the case of partial financial sustainability, we design different optimal strategies, that involve variables such as the contribution rate, age of retirement and indexation of pensions, to restore the long-term financial equilibrium of the system. We show that the adjustments needed to ensure sustainability for the mixed pension systems are less severe than the pure DB PAYG but the total replacement rate for the former is lower in most of the cases studied.

Computation of projections with maximal kurtoses in univariate financial time series is simplified to a eigenvalue problem. Projections with maximal kurtoses in multivariate financial time series best separate outliers from the bulk of the data, under a finite mixture model.

Practical relevance of these theoretical results is illustrated with univariate and multivariate time series from several financial markets.

Initial inequality of households is modeled by a random variable determining initial endowments. These initial endowments can be used to invest instantaneously in human capital and financial assets. Human capital translates into income based on a strictly concave production function, suggesting optimal levels of investment. Financial assets earn yields which do not depend on the amount invested by individuals. Theoretical predictions are tested using the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) for 2011 and 2013. Initial conditions modeled by a random variable are replaced by an actual distribution of income or assets to derive theoretical predictions regarding the proportion of the population that might benefit from financial inclusion. Financial inclusion does mitigate under-investment in education–but formal loans do not contribute. Income inequality worsens if households rely on formal or informal loans, whereas access to bank accounts improves households' prospects in the future income distribution.

They share an equivalent research process with the former’s intellectual point of departure being statistical inference and the latter’s being the data sets themselves. Two challenges arise, however, from digitalisation. First, the ever-increasing computational power allows researchers to experiment with an extremely large number of generated test subjects (i.e. p-hacking). We argue that p-hacking can be mitigated through adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing where appropriate. However, it can only truly be addressed via a strong focus on integrity (e.g. pre-registration, actual out-of-sample periods).  Second, the extremely large number of observations available in big data set provides magnitudes of statistical power at which common statistical significance levels are barely relevant. This challenge can be addressed twofold. First, researchers can use more stringent statistical significance levels such as 0.1% and 0.5% instead of 1% and 5%, respectively. Second, and more importantly, researchers can use criteria such as economic significance, economic relevance and statistical relevance to assess the robustness of statistically significant coefficients. Especially statistical relevance seems crucial, as it appears far from impossible for an individual coefficient to be considered statistically significant when its actual statistical relevance (i.e. incremental explanatory power) is extremely small. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; econometrics; Financial data science; novel datasets; risk measurement",""

Different board and diversity features have a positive impact on bank performance (size, tenure, and employee representation); the relationship is non-linear, with the effect of diversity being more relevant when there is a significant proportion of minority representatives. While substantial board internationalisation has a negative impact on bank performance, the presence of foreign directors appears to be less detrimental during the Eurozone crisis and in countries that are more welcoming towards diversity. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bank performance; board composition; board diversity; Corporate governance",""

This paper studies the ban’s impact on the 13 large financials with credit default swaps (CDS) and 20 smaller stocks without CDS. The results reveal that returns of banned stocks Granger cause CDS returns in the pre- and post-ban periods, but causality runs from CDS to stock returns during the ban period. Underlying risk proxied by the CDS probability of default increased during the ban and the immediate pre- and post-ban periods which highlights an endogeneity problem ignored in some studies. This increased risk provides a plausible rationale for why CDS and related equity bid-ask spreads - which increased during the ban period–failed to fall significantly in the post-ban period. Panel regression results indicate that probability of default was an important economic determinant of stock bid-ask spreads during the ban period. Finally, our results suggest that the ban offered direct price support for the smaller non-CDS stocks during the ban period and indirect support for CDS stocks from their pre-ban to their post-ban levels. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bans; CDS spreads; limits to arbitrage; short sales",""

The question is of great relevance because, while the vast majority of the empirical literature compares VC backed IPOs with non-VC backed ones, most VC funding is provided by syndicates of two or more financiers. We construct alternative measures of size as well as diversity based on several VC characteristics such as age, geographic location, type and affiliation of VC firms and find that larger and more diverse syndicates are associated with higher underpricing and lower valuation at the IPO date. Furthermore, we provide evidence that that diversity and size are negatively correlated to the long-term performance of the IPO firms and this finding is robust to several alternative measures of long-term performance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate governance; crisis; IPO performance; IPO valuation; Syndicates; venture capital",""

The analysis focused on the structure, rather than the level, of executive compensation by applying a sample-selection model and panel data regression. Consistent with our hypotheses, shareholders favour long-term stock and stock option plans but oppose short-term cash-bonus payments. However, the positive effect of equity compensation decreases as the share of the total remuneration increases, suggesting that the alignment effect is limited. The negative effect of bonus payments on the voting results is stronger in cases in which the voting approval of the supervisory board is low. Thus, investors who are discontent with the bonus payments eventually punish the supervisory board in charge of negotiating the contract. The supervisory board reacts to such cases by reducing the bonuses and increasing the equity payments in the following year, but the total compensation or fixed annual salary is unaffected. Hence, Say-on-Pay in Germany affects the structure but not the level of compensation.

The process of extrapolation plays a fundamental role in this area of analysis, being essential to empirically fit a convenient distribution that describes the available data as closely as possible. For comparison and illustrative purpose, we analyse distribution models used in the financial literature for modelling such dataset, and then the practical application is carried out again on a more updated dataset from the same financial index. In addition, a brief simulation study is developed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposal procedure. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","distribution models; financial market index; genetic algorithms; goodness-of-fit; SMI returns",""

The model is developed such that the convertible bond price explicitly depends on the credit rating at the time of issuance. Key ideas explored in this study include terminating the simulated sample path immediately when the issuer defaults on the bond at time t, which is the same as the investor and the issuer optimally exercising their options and discounting the resulting cash flows at a risk-free rate. In turn, the defaulted group of sample paths belongs to the bottom xth percentile of the realized stock prices at each time, which is exogenously given by the cumulative or marginal default probability of a firm that has the same rating as the issuer. Upon calibrating the model, we can see that the moneyness of convertible bonds is strongly responsible for influencing the convertible bond price when the rating changes. Furthermore, the effects of stochastic interest rates are shown to be possibly significant when the interest rate risk’s market price is not zero. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","default-triggering stock price level; Least squares simulation; marginal default probability; market price of interest rate risk; moneyness of convertible bond; optimal decision rule",""

As an external policy shock to IPO firms, this Reform was designed to convert non-tradable shares into tradable shares, with the potentials to restore the distorted supply–demand relationship of newly issued shares and reduce the information asymmetry in Chinese stock market. Analysing a sample of IPOs in China from 2000 to 2011, we find that the split-share structure reform significantly reduced the magnitude of IPO underpricing since 2005. It had different impacts on the IPO shares issued by state-owned enterprise (SOEs) and non-SOEs. While IPO shares issued by SOEs and non-SOEs had similar underpricing rates before the Reform, non-SOE IPOs show lower underpricing than those of SOEs after the Reform. Furthermore, compared with IPOs issued by SOEs controlled by the central government, those issued by local governments controlled SOEs are more underpriced after the Reform. © 2015, © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","IPO underpricing; split-share structure reform; state-owned enterprises",""

The firm can invest in the current technology and upgrade to the new technology after its arrival (sequential investing), or it can bypass the current technology and invest directly in the new technology (leapfrogging). The main result is that, in the presence of market risk, future technological uncertainty has a non-monotonic effect on investment, with the investment trigger being a U-shaped function of the expected speed of arrival of the new technology. In this U-shaped relationship, the investment trigger starts rising later if the new technology is more attractive and also when volatility and interest rate are high and growth rate low; thus, technological uncertainty is more likely to have a positive effect on investment under these conditions. Finally, we apply the model to the sequential versus leapfrog investment decision, and find that leapfrogging becomes more attractive relative to sequential investment when interest rate and new technology earnings enhancement are higher, and when market volatility, growth rate and new technology investment cost are lower. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Continuous-time model; investment trigger; leapfrog; real option; sequential investment; technological uncertainty",""

We propose that in a context of weak property rights protection such as China’s, the opportunity for family owners to attain transgenerational control is subject to the additional risk of state predation. We consequently expect economic goals to prevail over family-centred non-economic goals in Chinese family firms and hypothesize that their reported R&D expenses increase with family involvement due to severe Type II agency problems.

Our results provide evidence to support the three hypotheses. Interestingly, we find that the larger the size of the board of directors, the larger the supervisory board size. Moreover, we find that the higher the proportion of INEDs, the smaller the supervisory board size and this implies that INEDs are perhaps a substituting mechanism for the supervisors’ monitoring role. Finally, we argue that as the Chinese governance structure combines both the German and the Anglo-Saxon models, this creates a conflict between the two boards with respect to the monitoring role.

The Asset Quality Review was severe with banks operating in non-core countries, while medium-sized banks were either riskier or were treated severely in both exercises. The analysis leads to a puzzle: comparatively, the assessment per se led to significant adjustments for solid banks and large shortfalls for weak banks.

Our results show that cash-financed M&As of listed targets that have relatively illiquid stocks are associated with an increase in acquirer risk-adjusted returns. These gains are equivalent to those realized from comparable private target M&As. When engaging in stock-financed listed-target M&As, acquirers with liquid stocks enjoy significant gains when the targets have relatively illiquid stocks. This result holds especially when the deal is announced during periods of deterioration in the overall stock market liquidity.

Once it is shown that the comovements are time-varying, the question is to find whether a global index such as the Euro Stoxx can be considered the main source of risk. To that end we estimate and test for time-varying global pair covariances and for time-varying remaining pair covariances once the effect of the Euro Stoxx is removed. The empirical results are obtained considering locally stationary variables, a family that includes variables with first and second time-varying moments. Under that framework time-varying means and covariances can be estimated using a spline-based procedure and Wald-type statistics can be computed to test for time-variations. A simulation study shows that the role of the mean estimation part is crucial to the good performance of the tests for second moments. The empirical results evidence that all global pair covariances for the European countries analyzed are time-varying, but also that the Euro Stoxx can be considered as the driving source of risk for these time-varying dynamics.

Our findings reveal that enhanced competition reduces lending cost thus encouraging the entry of new customers in credit markets. Also, that the transportation cost that loan applicants are required to pay to reach the bank of their interest shrinks with respect to the degree of competition. We further lend support to the view that stiffer competition has an increasing impact on the level of credit risk. Notably, we find that competition strengthens the incentives of banks to engage in screening activity and that screening serves as a protection mechanism that can provide banks with a shield against bad loans. Overall, when market conditions are substantially distorted, this has a dilutive impact on the incentives mechanism of banks to screen their applicants.

Our results reveal that value creation–captured by firm profitability, labor productivity, and asset utilization efficiency–is superior when the firm’s largest ultimate shareholder controls a larger fraction of voting rights. Ownership by managers and by countervailing shareholders both improve value creation, yet only in privately controlled firms. In state-controlled firms, value creation is better when independent directors occupy a larger fraction of board seats. As to the proportional distribution of the generated value, operationalized by related-party transactions (RPT) and by cash dividends, we note that RPT are more extensive when the government controls a larger fraction of voting rights. In state-controlled firms, the wedge between the government’s voting rights and cash-flow rights is also positively associated with RPT, while negatively associated with the firm’s disbursement of cash dividends. Ownership by managers helps curb RPT in state-controlled firms, while it stimulates cash dividends in privately controlled firms. Regardless of who controls the listed firm, ownership by countervailing shareholders contributes to the proportional distribution of the firm’s generated value.

Third, some categories of hot money have a temporary influence on local stock market returns while the others have a permanent influence, supporting the explanations of both price pressures and information advantage. Finally, local stock market returns in half of our sample countries, which have tightened capital controls during the late 2000s global financial crisis (GFC), are more affected by hot money than in the other half.

More specifically, we test whether there are visible differences between commercial and cooperative banks in the sensitivity of those provisions to the business cycle. Our results show that whereas loan-loss provisions are procyclical in both cases, the procyclicality is particularly prominent and stronger in the case of commercial banks, than of the cooperative banks. Additionally, in contrast to existing findings, we establish that the negative impact of the business cycle on loan-loss provisions is greater in the case of small banks than of medium or large ones, this feature being common for both commercial and cooperative banks. We have identified two factors which affect procyclicality of loan-loss provisions in different ways for commercial and cooperative banks. The first factor is the empirical importance of capital adequacy ratio size. In commercial banks, the capital ratio size exerts a statistically significant impact on the procyclicality regardless of capitalization. The other factor is discretionary income-smoothing, as we find that the statistically significant increase of procyclicality due to the high discretionary income-smoothing is present only in cooperative banks. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bank size; capital ratio; discretionary income-smoothing; Loan-loss provisions; procyclicality",""

There is clear evidence that commercial banks in China, especially regional commercial banks, have lent significantly to the real estate sector. The recent slowdown in the housing market in China and the increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) in China's commercial banking sector motivated us to investigate the connection between real estate markets and banking stability. This paper proposes three testable hypotheses linking the growth of investment in real estate and the stability of regional commercial banks in China, measured by NPLs. Our empirical results reveal a close connection between the growth of investment in real estate and the NPLs among regional commercial banks, and its sensitivity to real estate market cycles. When real estate market activity declines, our results suggest, regional commercial banks can find themselves in trouble if they have significant exposure to one type of (real estate) asset.

Crashes tend to efficiently bring back excess bubble prices close to a “normal” process. Then, the RE condition implies that the excess risk premium of the risky asset exposed to crashes is an increasing function of the amplitude of the expected crash, which itself grows with the bubble mispricing: hence, the larger the bubble price, the larger its subsequent growth rate. This positive feedback of price on return is the archetype of super-exponential price dynamics. We use the RE condition to estimate the real-time crash probability dynamically through an accelerating probability function depending on the increasing expected return. After showing how to estimate the model parameters, we obtain a closed-form approximation for the optimal investment that maximizes the expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky bubbly asset and a risk-free asset.

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms, we document that a firm, on average, increases its CP significantly during a period of political uncertainty (e.g. when there is a new local communist party secretary or mayor). In addition, we report that, on average, a firm’s donation in year t is positively correlated with its amount of government subsidies, corporate income tax reduction, and short- and long-term bank loan amounts in year t + 1.

Participants on STPs can be categorized into trade leaders and copiers, where the former execute unique trades and manage the funds allocated to them by the latter in return for compensation. Given limited individual capacity and the competition to attract copiers, we investigate whether the scopic regime produces excess and perpetual conformism among trade leaders. Using data from a popular STP, and from an anonymous traditional foreign exchange broker, we show that the scopic regime produces excess levels of herding. Under the scopic environment, we find that herding is high when market information is scarce, which is evidence of herding due to informational cascades. We find herding to be relatively low among risk-seeking trade leaders, which may be a sign of overconfidence. Herding is high for larger trades, suggesting that traders herd to avoid the disappointment associated with underperforming on large positions. Finally, we show that herding in the scopic environment persists at much higher levels compared to traditional environments.

Using data from four national household surveys, we find that in Italy–the country with highly asymmetric gender role prescriptions–women's risk-taking behavior responds to this non-supportive environment. Consistent with the theory of social identity, Italian women refrain from stock market participation more than their self-reported risk tolerance levels would suggest. In contrast, in the three countries with a lower asymmetry in gender role prescriptions, no exaggerated female backing off from investing in stocks is observable.

Since rational investor behavior is thought to imply that additional risk is rewarded with additional return, the alleged higher growth rates of low beta versus high beta stocks has been termed a ‘Low Beta Anomaly’ (LBA). However, it is premature to conclude that these observed LBAs are due to stocks’ differential growth rates, because the tested portfolios are traded. Stochastic Portfolio Theory (SPT) shows that traded portfolios’ growth rates can exceed the growth rates of their stocks. This paper presents several SPT models of an LBA that do not require investment constraints, irrational investor behavior, or that low beta stocks have higher growth rates than high beta stocks. These LBAs are due to reconstitution relative volatility capture that favors portfolios of low vs. high beta stocks. They result from trading profit, not differential growth rates between low and high beta stocks.

Fraud revelations can increase a firm’s information and credit risk, and are therefore expected to significantly affect future bank loan conditions. The Chinese economy provides a unique setting from which to study the influence of state-ownership on debt contracting because it is dominated by state-owned banks (SBs) and firms. Using a sample of bank loans and enforcement actions announced between 2001 and 2012, we find that, after fraud announcements, the cost of private debt increases significantly, but not for loans issued by SBs to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Moreover, we find evidence that SBs grant, and SOEs receive, lower interest rates. Additional tests show that SOEs that received a more favorable interest rate after the announcement of fraud from a SB perform worse than other firms. These results indicate that despite the bank reforms SBs continue to favor SOEs and this could lead to sub-optimal lending. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; corporate fraud; cost of debt; State-ownership",""

The procedures typically entail three main phases: splitting, hedging, and liquidation. Together, these ensure the regularity of the settlement process through the prudent and orderly liquidation of the defaulters’ portfolios. Traditional approaches to CCPs’ margin requirements typically assume a simple closeout profile, not accounting for the ‘real life’ constraints embedded in the management of a default. The paper proposes an approach to assess how distinct closeout strategies may expose a CCP to different sets of risks and costs taking into account real-life frictions. The proposed approach enables the evaluation of a full spectrum of hedging strategies and the assessment of the trade-offs between the risk-reducing benefits of hedging and the transaction costs associated with it. Using an unexplored set of transactional level data, the proposed framework is evaluated assuming the hypothetical default of a real CCP clearing member. We consider the worst-case loss of a large interest rate swap portfolio observed over the past 10 years (i.e. 2005–2015) and show that an efficient hedging strategy which minimises risk may not be optimal when transaction costs are taken into account. The empirical analysis suggests that transaction costs are a significant factor and should be accounted for when designing a hedging strategy. Specifically, it is shown that the risk-reducing benefits arising from more tailored hedging strategies may introduce higher transaction costs, and therefore may change the effectiveness of the strategies. © 2018, © Bank of England 2018.","CCPs; closeout procedures; initial margin; market liquidity",""

The empirical results show that the impact factors of housing cycles are market risk and the switching factor. Furthermore, the impact factors of jump risks include the bursting of the housing bubble and financial crises. Therefore, in this paper, we employ the Markov switching model with jump risks to value the MI contracts and analyze the influences of housing price cycles, jump risks, risks of market interest rate, and the prepayment risks on MI premiums. The results of sensitivity analysis show that more volatile housing price index returns, as well as longer periods of higher volatility in housing prices, raise MI premiums. Moreover, the MI premium is positively related to the absolute value of the average jump amplitude and the shock frequency of abnormal events.

We find larger economies in the Euro area tend to have closer upper tail dependence in terms of positive shocks, while smaller economies tend to have closer lower tail dependence with respect to negative shocks. The R-vine copula results underline the complex dynamics of financial stress relations existing between Euro Area economies. The estimated R-vine shows Spain, Italy, France and Belgium are the most inter-connected nodes which underlying they might be more efficient targets to treat in order to achieve a quicker stabilizing. Our results relate to the fact that Eurozone is not a unified policy making area, therefore, it needs to follow divergent policies for taming the effects of financial instability to different regions or groups of economies that are more interconnected. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Euro area; Financial stress; FSI; GARCH; regular vine; vine copula",""

ΛVaR appears attractive for its potential ability to solve several problems of VaR. This paper provides the first study on the backtesting of ΛVaR. We propose three nonparametric tests which exploit different features. Two tests are based on simple results of probability theory. One test is unilateral and is more suitable for small samples of observations. A second test is bilateral and provides an asymptotic result. A third test is based on simulations and allows for a more accurate comparison among ΛVaRs computed with different assumptions on the asset return distribution. Finally, we perform a backtesting exercise that confirms a higher performance of ΛVaR in respect to VaR especially when it is estimated with distributions that better capture tail behavior. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","backtesting; hypothesis testing; model validation; risk management",""

Using a unique database of Portuguese individual investors, we find that investors prefer to repurchase stocks that were associated with a gain during their previous roundtrip (i.e. prior winners) and have suffered price declines subsequent to their last sale. Consistent with the extant literature based on the US market, our results suggest that different market characteristics do not seem to affect investors’ preference regarding stock repurchases. Moreover, we find that this preference increases with the magnitude of the prior gain or the decline in price following the last sale. We also demonstrate that larger and more visible domestic stocks are more likely to be repurchased and that less active, under-diversified and home-biased investors are more likely to engage in such behaviour. Finally, we find that repurchased stocks yield poor post-performance–approximately 267 basis points less than newly purchased stocks. Our main conclusion is that repurchases are essentially emotionally driven and penalize investor’s performance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","individual investors; investment decisions; portfolio choice; Repurchasing behaviour; securities trading",""

Using the price adjustment process as a control variable, we find that the intertemporal risk-return relation is positive conditional on bad market news, but is non-positive conditional on good market news. This implies that good (bad) market news weakens (strengthens) the positive risk-return relation. The pattern in the distortion of the risk-return relation is consistent with short-term mispricing in which investors overvalue (undervalue) the stock market in reaction to good (bad) market news. We also show that ignoring the price adjustment process in the estimation of the risk-return relation leads to model misspecification and induces an upward (downward) bias in estimates of the relative risk aversion parameter conditional on good (bad) news. Our model of the asymmetric risk-return relation along with the price adjustment process is capable of generating the return dynamics that is attributable to technical trading profits. We suggest that the profitability of technical trading rules is not a violation of market efficiency, but a consequence of trading rules exploiting the asymmetric effect of price changes on the risk-return relation, along with the persistence property of price changes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arbitrage asymmetry; Intertemporal risk-return relation; investor behavior; overpricing; technical trading profits; underpricing",""

A common ‘remedy’ is to replace the zeros with a small (in the absolute sense) non-zero value. However, this renders estimation asymptotically biased if the true return is equal to zero with probability zero. Here, we propose a solution. If the zero probability is zero, then zero returns may be observed because of non-trading, measurement error (e.g. due to rounding), missing values and other data issues. The algorithm we propose treats the zeros as missing values and handles these by estimation via the ARMA representation.

The evidence suggests that there exists a common long-term cointegrating trend among these three components of the shadow banking system. Any disequilibrium in this long-run relationship among these variables is corrected by movement in the financial assets of money market funds. The Beveridge-Nelson decomposition from the estimated cointegrating relationship shows that the cyclical component of money market funds is large and captures huge swings in these markets during the financial crisis.

Moreover, we construct real interest rate measures using alternative approaches, including a Markov regime-switching procedure, which is consistent with the forward-looking nature of inflation expectations formation.

Besides, the most common buyer has no previous stake in the firm. We find no evidence that the buyers pay, in median, for a seat on the board of directors, but the variability of the premiums for those blocks is higher and shows that buyers that had no control position in the target firm pay more for being among largest shareholders (partial control) and less for not being among them (influence). © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","block premium; block trades; board of directors; market for corporate influence; market for partial corporate control; market rule",""

Representation formats partially overlap with those mandated by regulators and used within the financial industry. Results show that the perceived riskiness of financial products is affected by the way information is disclosed. Perceived complexity of the financial information disclosure intensifies perception of riskiness of the product solicited.

However, when we adopt a time-varying decision rule, the ratio becomes a statistically significant predictor of equity market corrections. The two time-varying decision rules are: (i) predict an equity market correction when the ratio exceeds a 95% one-tail confidence interval based on a normal distribution, and (ii) predict an equity market correction when the ratio exceeds a threshold computed using Cantelli's inequality. These new decision rules are robust to changes in the two key parameters: the confidence level and the forecasting horizon.

We take a novel approach to tackle this research question, by looking at the role, if any, played by the number of lending relationships in initial public offerings (IPOs).

Throughout, we use a relatively refined, focused, and synchronized minute-by-minute data set on ADRs and all other variables. ADRs from all countries with regular trading hours that overlap with those of the US are considered individually and in clusters. We analyze the interplay of several factors that influence ADRs pricing patterns. Further, we investigate whether such patterns vary by currency, ADR, industry, and emerging/developed market classifications. Our findings indicate that synchronized returns on underlying shares comprise 68.5–74% of the explained returns in ADRs. The remaining 31.5–26% of returns are generated by movements in currency rates. These results are robust across the several models and estimation methods employed. Our findings also show persistent small price discrepancies between ADRs and dollar-adjusted underlying shares on a minute-by-minute basis, implying possible arbitrage opportunities. However, we conclude that trading and ADR conversion costs render such opportunities unattractive. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ADRs; American depositary receipts; arbitrage; contemporaneous; price discrepancy",""

Quadratic Gaussian models beat affine Gaussian models both in-sample and out-of-sample. A Black-type model best fits the shortest maturities and the extremely low yields since 2013, but worst fits the longest maturities. Even for quadratic models we can infer the latent factors from some yields observed without errors, which makes quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimation feasible. New specifications of quadratic models fit the longest maturities better than does the ‘classic’ specification of Ahn et al. [2002. ‘Quadratic Term Structure Models: Theory and Evidence.’ The Review of Financial Studies 15 (1): 243–288], but the opposite is true for the shortest maturities. These new specifications are more suitable to QML estimation. Overall quadratic models seem preferable to affine Gaussian models, because of superior empirical performance, and to Black-type models, because of superior tractability. This paper also proposes the vertical method of lines (MOL) to solve numerically partial differential equations (PDEs) for pricing bonds under multiple non-independent stochastic factors. ‘Splitting’ the PDE drastically reduces computations. Vertical MOL can be considerably faster and more accurate than finite difference methods. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","affine Gaussian models; Black model; extended Kalman filter; quadratic Gaussian models; quasi-maximum likelihood; sequential splitting; vertical method oflines",""

Reopenings represent new debt offerings, which are characterized through identical configurations as an already outstanding bond, but with a market-adjusted price. Their advantage lies with the fact that fewer preparations are required compared to a new regular offering. For a set of European companies our results suggest that stockholders respond less positively to the announcements of reopenings than to regular offerings. This effect is stronger, the higher the pre-issue bond price run-up, and the stock price reaction is directly linked to the change in the firm’s debt value. Additionally, the prices of the reopened bonds drop on the announcement day. Therefore, in line with the window of opportunity theory, the firm’s management appears to use reopenings as a fast and inexpensive way to raise debt capital, which leads stockholders and bondholders to suspect an overvaluation and therefore to adjust their price expectations. The analysis also reveals that the redistribution of wealth from bondholders to stockholders is a major determinant for the observed price changes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Debt offering; market timing; reopening; wealth transfer; window of opportunity",""

We also seek theoretical justification for why value shares tend to outperform glamour shares. No convincing arguments based on the efficient market hypothesis have been put forward to show that the outperformance of value shares might be due to their being fundamentally riskier.

Numerical sensitivity analysis shows that the presence of a post-investment abandonment opportunity makes the investment opportunity appear to be more attractive because of the abandonment option value, but not by a considerable amount.

In finance theory, volatility is synonymous with risk and as such represents the dispersion of asset returns about their central tendency (i.e. mean), measured by the standard deviation of returns. When individuals make investment decisions, influenced by perceptions of risk and volatility, they commonly do so by examining graphs of historic price sequences rather than returns. It is unclear, therefore, whether standard deviation of return is foremost in their mind when making such decisions. We conduct two experiments to examine the factors that may influence perceptions of financial volatility, including standard deviation along with a number of price-based factors. Also of interest is the influence of price sequence regularity on perceived volatility. While standard deviation may have a role to play in perception of volatility, we find evidence that other price-based factors play a far greater role. Furthermore, we report evidence to support the view that the extent to which prices appear irregular is a separate aspect of volatility, distinct from the extent to which prices deviate from central tendency. Also, while partially correlated, individuals do not perceive risk and volatility as synonymous, though they are more closely related in the presence of price sequence irregularity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","mean absolute price change; price sequence; risk; standard deviation; Volatility",""

Our empirical evidence, based on time-varying measures of overconfidence derived from computational linguistic analysis and directors’ dealings in their own companies’ shares, supports this hypothesis.

Our experiments show that it is possible that people taking decisions involving risk not always act the way to maximize wealth (in our case points), sometimes they are happy enough when they achieve some level of wealth. We also found that people act in a different way when they know how much is missing to achieve their goal and when they do not.

Importantly, the model is analytically tractable. In this sense, I solve the pricing problem corresponding to standard-start, as well as to forward-start European options through the Fast Fourier Transform. To illustrate the practical performance of the model, I calibrate the model parameters to the quoted prices of European options on the VIX index.

Such funds have been gaining significant market share and were recently set as default choice of asset allocation in numerous defined contribution schemes or related old-age provision products in several countries. Hence, an assessment of life-cycle funds’ risk-return profiles–that is, the probability distribution of returns–is essential for sustainable financial planning of a large group of investors. This paper studies the risk-return profile of life-cycle funds in particular compared to simple balanced or lifestyle funds that apply a constant equity portion throughout the fund's term instead. In a Black–Scholes model, we derive balanced funds that reproduce the risk-return profile of an arbitrary life-cycle fund for single and regular contributions. We then analyze the accuracy of our results under more complex asset models with stochastic interest rates, stochastic equity volatility and jumps. We further show that frequently used ‘rule of thumb approximations’ that only take into account the life-cycle fund's average equity portion are not suitable to approximate a life-cycle fund's risk-return profile. Our results on the one hand facilitate sustainable financial planning and on the other hand challenge the very existence of life-cycle funds since appropriately calibrated balanced funds can offer a similar (often dominating) risk-return profile. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","balanced funds; life-cycle funds; risk-return profiles; stochastic modeling",""

Using income determinants in rural China as the measure of the GR hypothesis, this paper provides a direct test of the widely accepted claim that China has followed a GR strategy. In the sense that reform deepens, production factors should become more important income determinants over time. Our difference-in-difference analysis, based on a large panel dataset from fixed-site rural surveys conducted between 1986 and 2002, shows that the efficiency of return to production factors deteriorated over time instead. Households that had more production resources, such as land and labor, or that devoted more labor and time to entrepreneurial activities experienced better income growth in the 1980s, but households with better political status did so in the 1990s. Further difference-in-difference analyses show that these income patterns are related to an inefficient credit allocation due to government interference in the 1990s compared to market mechanisms in the 1980s.

By modeling the conditional mean of LGD as a function of PD, which also varies with systemic risk factors, this model allows an arbitrary functional relationship between PD and LGD. Based on this framework, several specifications of stochastic LGD are proposed with detailed calibration methods.

Governments seeking to motivate early final stage investments might lower final stage project volatility or specify project value decline over time, unless prospective owners are willing to pay the real option value (ROV) for concessions.

This study is the first to apply it to a real-world pension scheme, and the first ALM model of a pension scheme to maximize the Sharpe ratio. We disaggregate pension liabilities into three components–active members, deferred members and pensioners, and transform the optimal asset allocation into the scheme's projected contribution rate. The robust optimization model is extended to include liabilities and used to derive optimal investment policies for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), benchmarked against the Sharpe and Tint, Bayes–Stein and Black–Litterman models as well as the actual USS investment decisions.

In particular, we adopt two modes of analysis. The first focuses on the impact of diversification strategies on performance, lending and funding strategies at the province level. The second one examines how the increase of big banks' local presence affects single-market bank performance and lending strategies. Our results show that geographical diversification strategies can reduce performance, the adjusted Lerner Index of banks and lending activities, but increase the Lerner Index in deposit markets.

The empirical analyses show that acquirer banks with a concentration of shares owned by financial intermediaries and non-financial firms experience larger risk changes during acquisition years. In contrast, the risk changes of acquirer banks with a concentration of capital investors and state ownership are lower.

The existence of two regimes is transversal to the assets studied. One regime is marked by high volatility and the other by low volatility. In both regimes, most of the commodities exhibit returns that are not statistically significantly different from those of the stock market regime. The exceptions are oil and natural gas during the low-volatility regime. The analysis of regime synchronization shows that our stock market proxy has low synchronization with commodities, which suggests potential diversification value from adding commodities to an equity portfolio.

Third, we test for convergence in EU28 bank productivity as well as in the inefficiency of individual bank inputs.

The regulator decides whether or not to regulate hedge fund strategies, and location of key service providers (KSPs). The manager then decides (a) which KSP to choose, (b) whether to choose a safe or risky strategy, and (c) how much effort to exert in affecting the strategy’s success probability. We consider the effect of expected future fund flows on the manager’s incentives. Furthermore, we consider economic and behavioural factors affecting the regulator’s decision-making. Finally, we discuss how our two cases (myopic versus far-sighted managerial behaviour) may inform the debate over regulation over the entire financial market-cycle.

However through a time-varying procedure, we show that each precious metal market goes through periods of significant predictability as well as periods of unpredictability. Therefore this finding suggests that return predictability does vary over time and is not a static, all-or-nothing condition and therefore is consistent with the adaptive market hypothesis.

Second, observing several structural breaks with changing correlation and Granger causality patterns, we find that the euro and the British pound have contributed varying levels of stress. Third, we find that stress in US markets tends to spill over into European markets, while the reverse influences are of lesser importance.

Three basic sentiment indexes are constructed starting from three lists of words defined by historical market news response and by a discriminant analysis. Models are evaluated in terms of their predictive accuracy to forecast out-of-sample Value-at-Risk of the STOXX Europe 600 sectors at different confidence levels using several statistic tests and the model confidence set procedure of Hansen, Lunde, Nason [(2011). “The Model Confidence Set”.

Liquidity shocks due to delayed payments must be financed using cash or short-term debt. Debt holders provide an irrevocable credit line given a firm's expected insolvency risk, and equity holders select optimum cash holding. The model demonstrates the trade-off between cash holding and investing in fixed assets. Introducing uncertain cash flows leads to precautionary cash holding if debt holders impose financial constraints. Precautionary cash holding, in turn, reduces insolvency risk enhancing access to short-term finance. The theory shows that credit rationing can occur in the absence of market frictions. Using U.S. data from 1998 to 2012, empirical findings suggest that the decline in credit lines has contributed to the increase in cash holding in line with theoretical predictions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cash holding; credit rationing; financial constraints; working capital management",""

A numerical study shows that the use of moment information makes it possible to significantly improve the (unconstrained) VaR bounds.

One of the modeling components is the loss-given default (LGD): it represents the credit loss for a bank when extreme events occur that influence the obligor ability to repay his debts to the bank. Among researchers and practitioners the use of statistical models such as linear regression, Tobit or decision trees is quite common in order to compute LGDs as a forecasting of historical losses. However, these statistical techniques do not seem to provide robust estimation and show low performance. These results could be driven by some factors that make differences in LGD, such as the presence and quality of collateral, timing of the business cycle, workout process management and M&A activity among banks. This paper evaluates an alternative method of modeling LGD using a technique based on advanced credibility theory typically used in actuarial modeling. This technique provides a statistical component to the credit and workout experts’ opinion embedded in the collateral and workout management process and improve the predictive power of forecasting. The model has been applied to an Italian Bank Retail portfolio represented by Overdrafts; the application of credibility theory provides a higher predictive power of LGD estimation and an out-of-time sample backtesting has shown a stable accuracy of estimates with respect to the traditional LGD model. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","actuarial techniques for finance; basel 2; credibility theory; credit risk modeling; loss-given default forecasts; quantitative finance; rating model",""

Our tests indicate that Portuguese companies generally move from lower cost to higher cost financing sources, but they do not exhaust each type of debt before moving on to the next funding source in the pecking order. Such behavior is consistent with a loose interpretation of pecking order financing, but not a strict interpretation of the theory.

The results show that the hedging with derivatives generated an average premium of 1.53% and that foreign currency debt generated 7.52%, with respect to company value approximated by Tobin's Q, while operational hedging does not affect company value. Moreover, in half of the observations corresponding to companies that hedged with derivatives, the value premium was between 0.08% and 0.99%. In the case of foreign currency debt, the range was between 1.79% and 10.37%. It demonstrates that the contribution of currency hedging to company value fluctuates considerable according to the volume of financial hedging. Thus, an empirical study of this aspect which only analyses the decision to hedge through dummy variables to define financial hedging, as empirical previous studies, can lead to biased results in terms of estimated premium amounts, because it assumes a homogenous treatment of companies regardless of hedging volumes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","currency hedging; derivatives; dynamic panel framework; foreign currency debt; Tobin's Q",""

The sensitivity of different banking balance sheet and income statement variables to the business cycle is diversified and may be prone to increasing integration of financial markets. In this paper, we address the problem of the influence of financial integration on the transmission of economic shocks from one country to another and consequently on the sensitivity of loan loss provisions (LLPs) to the business cycle. The application of the seemingly unrelated regression equations (SURE) approach to 13 OECD countries in 1995–2009 shows that the procyclicality of LLPs is statistically significant almost in the whole sample of countries. Regardless of the econometric specification, the income-smoothing, capital management and risk management hypotheses are hardly supported by the data. However, in SURE specification, the relationship of bank-specific variables is of higher statistical significance than in the country regression approach. Hence, cross-country interconnectedness is not only economically, but also empirically important when analyzing cross-country diversifications of LLPs. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","capital management; income smoothing; loan loss provisions; procyclicality; risk management",""

The model construct is based on classical cash flow accounting and cost–benefit analysis. In the model, the flows of cash (private investors) and the flows of costs and benefits (public investors) are integrated in a single framework. The model shows that within the ecosystem the investors' (public vs. private) social, economic and financial targets are not necessarily coinciding.

This paper presents a review of the use of the skew-normal distribution and its extensions in finance and actuarial science, highlighting known results as well as potential directions for future research. When skewness and kurtosis are present in asset returns, the skew-normal and skew-Student distributions are natural candidates in both theoretical and empirical work. Their parameterization is parsimonious and they are mathematically tractable. In finance, the distributions are interpretable in terms of the efficient markets hypothesis. Furthermore, they lead to theoretical results that are useful for portfolio selection and asset pricing. In actuarial science, the presence of skewness and kurtosis in insurance claims data is the main motivation for using the skew-normal distribution and its extensions. The skew-normal has been used in studies on risk measurement and capital allocation, which are two important research fields in actuarial science. Empirical studies consider the skew-normal distribution because of its flexibility, interpretability, and tractability. This paper comprises four main sections: an overview of skew-normal distributions; a review of skewness in finance, including asset pricing, portfolio selection, time series modeling, and a review of its applications in insurance, in which the use of alternative distribution functions is widespread.

Specifically, we consider six alternative explanatory variables that have been proposed in the literature as early warning indicators of a currency crisis. Our findings suggest that the RS models are, in general, more accurate than the Random Walk model in terms of both statistical and especially economic evaluation criteria for exchange rate forecasts. Our three-state RS model outperforms the two-state models and among the variables considered in our analysis, the short-term interest rate is the optimal variable, closely followed by imports. Results are more promising for one-month predictions and are qualitatively robust over sample spans.

Using different techniques to compute home bias, this paper investigates whether countries with lower home bias experience faster economic growth. Additionally, the analysis extends to the link between (decreasing) home bias and international risk sharing and income inequality. The results suggest that financial integration, proxied by the decreasing equity home bias, is positively associated with economic growth and international risk sharing.

Generally, UK unit trusts do not, in fact, consistently track declared styles but subject their funds to style switching or rotation. Nor do funds switch to become simple index trackers, as has widely been reported, but exhibit a mix of behaviour that we refer to as ‘market-momentum styling’. Our contribution is to offer a coherent, end-to-end picture of the evolution of investment styles over an economic cycle. In so doing we evidence that fund style positioning is subject to rotation and becomes subordinated to past portfolio performance or style momentum. Even this result is conditional as we go on to demonstrate that style investment is very likely to be driven by broader economic conditions, thereby creating market-momentum styling by default.

We ask whether the impact of executive pay inequality is a function of board size, rendering the CEO pay slice measure problematic in this context? We then question whether the interaction of board size and corporate performance, as measured by shareholder returns, explain variations in the sensitivity of the pay–performance relationship for UK FTSE 100 executives.

Phrased differently, domestic investor protection replaces the world average corporate governance in the construction of the relevant measure driving international portfolio choice. If the weight attached to the domestic factor in the construction of the average measure is large enough it can determine, almost completely, the world average corporate governance.

Adopting robust control and perturbation theory techniques, we study the problem of a long-horizon investor with recursive preferences that faces ambiguity about the stochastic processes that generate the investment opportunity set. We find that ambiguity impacts portfolio choice, with the relevant channel being the return process. Ambiguity about the volatility process is only relevant if, through a specific correlation structure, it also induces ambiguity about the return process. Using the same long-run US data, we find that ambiguity about the return process may be empirically relevant, much more than ambiguity about the volatility process.

Specifically, the discount is greater among firms with relatively more Chinese than English press coverage. We also find this effect more pronounced among firms with less analyst following and less institutional ownership. This implies that media coverage compensates for limitations in analyst coverage and is more influential among less sophisticated investors.

The differentiation of family size allows us to analyze competing effects at the family level such as economies of scale as well as organizational complexity costs and conflicts of interest. Our empirical results confirm diseconomies of scale at the winner fund level and indicate that only small winner funds with low inflows significantly outperform the four-factor benchmark on a net return basis. There are no universal benefits from economies of scale at the family level, but our findings suggest the existence of conflicts of interest in families offering a relatively large number of funds. Small winner funds in families offering a small number of funds significantly outperform while economies of scale only materialize among extremely small winner funds.

In the first one, the default happens at bond maturity, when the firm's value falls below a predetermined barrier. In the second version, the firm can enter bankruptcy at multiple predetermined discrete times. The use of a Markov chain to model switches in hidden external factors makes it possible to capture the effects of changes in trends and volatilities exhibited by default probabilities. With synchronous jumps, the firm's asset and state processes are no longer uncorrelated.

The Fokker–Planck (i.e. the Chapman–Kolmogorov) equation is then invoked to retrieve the steady-state (i.e. unconditional) probability distribution for the rate of inflation. Monthly data for the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) covering the period from 1988 until 2012 are then used to estimate the parameters of the probability distribution for the UK inflation rate. The parameter estimates are compatible with the hypothesis that the UK inflation rate evolves in terms of a slightly skewed and highly leptokurtic probability distribution that encompasses non-convergent higher moments. We then determine the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman fundamental equation of optimality corresponding to a monetary policy loss function defined in terms of the squared difference between the targeted rate of inflation and the actual inflation rate. Optimising and then solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation shows that the optimal control for the rate of increase in the money supply will be a linear function of the difference between the current rate of inflation and the targeted inflation rate. The conditions under which the optimal control will lead to the Friedman rule are then determined. These conditions are used in conjunction with the Fokker–Planck equation and the mean reversion process describing the evolution of the inflation rate to determine the probability distribution for the inflation rate under the Friedman rule. This shows that whilst the empirically determined probability distribution for the UK inflation rate meets some of the conditions required for the application of the Friedman rule, it does not meet them all. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Friedman rule; Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation; inflation; white noise process",""

Failing to incorporate leptokurtosis into asset returns also leads to downward biased estimates of risk, but this is less pronounced than the time-varying discount rate effect. Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns.

By using the Index, which has been successfully tested against country-level M&A activity in a time series analysis, we show that the drivers of M&A activity differ significantly at different stages of country maturity. Specifically, for mature countries, the quality of their regulatory systems, political stability, socio-economic environment and the sophistication of their physical infrastructure as well as the availability of sizeable assets all determine differences in country-level M&A volume and value activity. For countries at the transitional stage, it is instead their economic and financial health, socio-economic environment, technological developments and the quality of their infrastructure and the availability of sizeable assets which drive M&A activity. We also prove the predictability power of the Index, by a set of Granger causality tests, showing not only how country-level development drives future M&A activity but also how, to some extent, the inverse relationship is also true, i.e. that M&A activity can contribute to country development. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","country scores; emerging markets; forecasting; MAAIS; market development; mergers and acquisitions; transitional economies",""

Second, although restricted in product offerings, markets and their membership base, Japanese cooperatives secured both technical progress (a positive shift in the frontier) and a decrease in technical inefficiency (distance from the frontier). Third, the analysis highlighted that regulatory pressure to reduce non-performing loans will have an adverse impact on both output and performance. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","efficiency; Japanese cooperative banks; regulatory compliance",""

This paper also examines whether LLPs signal managements’ expectations concerning future bank profits to investors. Additionally, this paper traces the role of bank regulations and creditor protection systems in explaining income smoothing. Evidence drawn from the 1996 to 2006 period indicates that LLPs do reflect changes in the expected quality of a bank's loan portfolio for both groups of banks, and that earnings management is an important determinant of LLPs for EA intermediaries, whereas non-EA credit institutions use LLPs to signal private information to outsiders. The paper also finds that higher protection of creditors’ rights significantly reduces the incentives to smooth earnings for EA banks. During the recent financial crisis, EA bank managers are much more concerned with their credit portfolio quality and do not use LLPs for discretionary purposes, whereas LLPs at non-EA banks are used to smooth income more than for the purposes of managing capital ratios or conveying private information about future performance to the market. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","bank regulation; bank supervision; banks; capital management; income smoothing; loan-loss provisions; signaling",""

Our findings overwhelmingly support the direct effect. In particular, we find that the positive relation between IO and innovation post-SOX is mainly driven by passive and dedicated institutional investors. These investors benefit greatly from a reduction in the firm's information asymmetry but receive little gain from improvements in market liquidity, given their long-term trading horizon. Our results are robust to different model specifications, including difference-in-differences tests, which alleviate concerns about the impact of confounding effects on our conclusions.

We test this idea by studying the relation between announcement returns and acquirer's characteristics that proxy for the existence of growth options. Consistent with the contingent claims hypothesis, the private acquisition gains are associated with the combined effects of growth options (having higher runup before the acquisition announcement) with low level of leverage (near-all equity capital) and with uncertainty (measured by age and analyst coverage of acquirers). © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","acquisitions; analyst coverage; announcement returns; contingent claims; target status",""

[Modelling and Trading the Corn/Ethanol Crush Spread with Neural Networks. CIBEF Working Paper. Liverpool Business School. www.cibef.com], this investigation endeavours to expand the selection of forecasting applications by delving further into the realm of artificial intelligence and nonlinear modelling. The performances of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and higher order neural network (HONN) are gauged against a genetic programming algorithm (GPA). Further to this, a time-varying volatility filter is applied by leveraging during lower volatility regimes in order to enhance the trading performance of the spread while avoiding trading completely during times of high volatility. This paper models the corn/ethanol crush spread over a six-year period commencing on 23 March 2005 (when the ethanol futures contract was first traded on Chicago Board of Trade) through to 31 December 2010. The spread acts as a good indicator of an ethanol producer's profit margin, with corn being the principal raw ingredient used in a process called ‘corn crushing’ to produce ethanol as a means for alternative energy. Without leveraging, the GPA achieves the highest risk-adjusted returns followed by the HONN model. Once a time-varying leverage strategy is introduced, the ranking is maintained as GPA continues to be the most profitable model with the HONN registering the second best risk-adjusted returns, followed by the MLP neural network. On that basis, and without the benefit of hindsight as in the real world, a fund manager would have selected the GPA model regardless of whether he decides to leverage or not. Furthermore, it is also observed that the time-varying leveraging strategy significantly improves annualised returns as well as reducing maximum drawdowns, two desirable outcomes for trading and hedging. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","corn futures; ethanol futures; genetic programming algorithm; higher order neural network; leveraging; multilayer perceptron neural network; RiskMetrics; spread trading; time-varying leverage",""

On the one hand, improved estimators of the necessary moments have been developed, and on the other hand, heuristic methods have been generated to enhance the portfolio performance, for instance, the ‘resampled efficiency’ of Michaud [1998. Efficient Asset Management: A Practical Guide to Stock Portfolio Optimization and Asset Allocation. Boston: Harvard Business School Press]. We compare the out-of-sample performance of traditional mean–variance optimization by Markowitz [1952. “Portfolio Selection.” Journal of Finance 7 (1): 77–91] with Michaud's resampled efficiency in a comprehensive simulation study for a large number of relevant estimators appearing in the literature. In addition, we perform an empirical study to confirm the simulation results. Within the framework of the analyses we consider different estimation periods as well as unconstrained and constrained portfolio optimization problems. The main findings are that Markowitz outperforms Michaud on average but the impact of different estimators and constraints is significantly larger. Precisely, in most situations, the estimator of Frost and Savarino [1988. “For Better Performance: Constrain Portfolio Weights.” Journal of Portfolio Management 15 (1): 29–34] proves to work excellent. However, if the variance of estimators is large, for example, for short observation periods or large samples, it is recommendable to additionally implement constraints or to use the estimator of Ledoit and Wolf [2003. “Improved Estimation of the Covariance Matrix of Stock Returns with an Application to Portfolio Selection.” Journal of Empirical Finance 10 (5): 603–622]. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","capital market study; estimators of moments; mean–variance optimization; portfolio selection; resampled efficiency; simulation study",""

In the literature, these phenomena are often explained using a causality that runs from increased competition in traditional segments to lower margins to new activities. Using a comprehensive data set with bank-level data on over 16,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured US commercial banks for a period ranging from 1992 to 2010, this paper qualifies this chain of causality. We find that a bank's business model, measured using a multi-dimensional proxy of relationship banking activity, exerts a strong, positive effect on interest margins.

Regarding event-by-event results, the proportion of rating actions exhibiting a significant effect on risk is almost always observed between 20% and 30%.

Furthermore, it should be noticed that the decline in volatility in case of a rating affirmed is an insight of the certification role played by the agencies. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","DVR methodology; event study; rating agencies; rating changes stock prices; specific risk; systematic risk",""

We find that transfers to all three types of investors result in positive abnormal returns around transfer announcements, even when the transfers do not create a new controlling block holder and when transfers are between State entities. We also find that transfers from State entities to private entities result in larger increases in value and returns than transfers between State-controlled entities - consistent with the superior incentives and expertise of private investors. We conclude that corporate governance can be improved at State-controlled firms by improving incentives and expertise of controlling block holders. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","block-holder identity; China; partial corporate control; partial privatization; privatization; SOE; State ownership",""

We investigate how robust this assumption is by analysing the implications of allowing the cost of capital to vary stochastically over time. We use the Feynman–Kac functional to demonstrate how there will, in general, be systematic differences between present values computed on the assumption that the currently prevailing cost of capital will last indefinitely into the future and present values determined by discounting cash flows at the expected costs of capital that apply up until the point in time at which cash flows are to be received. Our analysis is based on three interpretations of the Feynman–Kac functional. The first assumes that the cost of capital evolves in terms of a state variable characterised by an Uhlenbeck and Ornstein (“On the Theory of the Brownian Motion.” Physical Review 36(5): 823–841) process. The second and third interpretations of the Feynman–Kac functional are based on the continuous time branching process. The first of these assumes that the state variable tends to drift upwards over time, whilst the second assumes that there is no drift in the state variable. Our analysis shows that for all three stochastic processes there are significant differences between present values computed under the assumption that the currently prevailing cost of capital will last indefinitely into the future and present values determined by discounting cash flows at the expected costs of capital that apply up until the point in time at which cash flows are to be received. Comparisons are also made with the environmental economics literature where similar problems have been addressed by invoking a ‘gamma discounting’ methodology. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","cost of capital; Feynman–Kac functional; gamma discounting; present value; wiener process",""

Existing literature confirms that foreign investors are more concerned about insider expropriation because of their information disadvantage relative to domestic investors. The split share structure of the ownership of Chinese listed firms created a conflict of interests between state and private shareholders. Since, before the reform, state shareholders held restricted shares that denied them any wealth effect from share price movements, they had a limited incentive to work with private shareholders to ensure that managers maximized the stock market value of the firm. By abolishing the trading restrictions for state shareholders, this reform has increased the incentive alignment between state and private shareholders, encouraging them to monitor managers. If foreign investors' concerns over the corporate governance implications of the split share structure at least partly contributed to their discounting of Chinese listed firms, then this discount should be reduced following the reform. Indeed, our evidence confirms this prediction, especially among Chinese listed firms with more state ownership or restricted shares. Our findings imply that this significant institutional reform of the Chinese stock market has benefitted minority investors. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","China; corporate governance; foreign share discount; ownership structure; Split Share Structure Reform",""

Moreover, the magnitude of this ‘flight to familiarity’ increases in the spread of an investor's ambiguity (about expected returns) between local and remote stocks. Our results prove robust to a number of alternative explanations of local bias. Specifically, we rule out a ‘home-field advantage’, where investors are able to translate information advantages about nearby companies into excess returns on their local stockholdings.

We estimate the implied discount of restricted shares to be 38.22% on average, which is in line with the empirical and theoretical findings in the literature, suggesting that the consideration is not systematically underpaid and the reform is fair at the market level. At the firm level, however, freely traded shareholders receive less consideration when their bargaining power is weaker. The impact of state shareholders on the size of consideration has been found to be non-monotonic. Consistent with the literature that state shareholders exaggerate the agency problem, they tend to exploit freely traded shareholders by offering less consideration when the latter's bargaining power is weaker. Meanwhile, state shareholders are under political pressure to carry out the reform as quickly as possible and to set a good example for other firms. They therefore refrain from offering underpaid consideration when their freely traded counterparts have strong bargaining power and are more capable of rejecting unfair schemes and substantially delaying the progress of the reform. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","bargaining power; China; consideration; restricted share; Split Share Structure Reform; state ownership",""

The results suggest that the exchange rate regime switch exerted the most significant impact on house and land returns at the national level, in terms of both returns and their volatilities. In contrast, its impact on China's stock market was moderate, with no structural change being detected in its returns and only weak structural change being found in the dynamics of its volatility.

Agency conflicts between equityholders and debtholders arise concerning the optimal patenting and market-launch timing and represent a classical moral hazard problem. We show that delaying patenting increases the value of the firm significantly in the absence of preemption risk. In the presence of preemption risk, the firm that aims to maximize the market exploitation period under patent protection accelerates the market-launch of the product. The use of debt financing reduces the incentives to delay patenting, but generates significant agency costs in terms of loss of firm value, debt capacity and increases in the fair credit spreads. When considered in terms of social effects, the impact of the agency conflicts is overall positive, as it accelerates patenting and market-launching the product and delays default. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","agency conflicts; commitment loans; patents; real options; social benefits",""

The average F-test can be applied to thousands of individual stocks and thus is free from the information loss or the data-snooping biases from grouping. This test is robust to ellipticity, and more importantly, our simulation and bootstrapping results show that the power of the average F-test continues to increase as the number of stocks increases.

There should be no presumption that option trading would not convey valuable information and indeed, the exercise of option rights is likely to signal insider knowledge. Our results from Granger-causality tests suggest that the actions of directors, officers (senior management) and the other groups, such as company lawyers, do indeed have predictive power for future returns. However, the actions of large shareholders have no additional information content over that which is publicly available. Evidence from predictive regressions largely supports these results, but is often weaker in significance. This seems to arise as the Granger-causality approach utilises a longer lag length and suggests that it takes time for the market to assimilate the information from insider actions. Overall, the results suggest that any outsider who can mimic the behaviour of certain insider groups could benefit in predicting future returns.

With two assets there is also a bound on the correlation between asset returns. Estimation with second moments of global stock returns supports our theoretical framework. Higher volatility in at least one market can increase comovement among markets. With globalization, covariances between two stock markets can also affect covariances between two other stock markets.

The effects of a company's idiosyncratic risk on its equity's value volatility and its credit risk are also examined. The findings indicate that when a company discloses a significant amount of information, it is likely to have a higher idiosyncratic risk and a lower credit risk, with no impact on returns on convertible bonds. The volatility of stock returns is positively related to returns on convertible bonds, and it is found that diversified strategies and returns on a company's equity help to improve its credit rating and that a better credit rating triggers an increase in returns on convertible bonds and idiosyncratic risk, indicating that evaluations of the value of convertible bonds must take pure bonds and equity (option) values into account. After excluding conversion values and estimating the idiosyncratic risk on daily, weekly, and monthly bases, this study suggests that there is a positive relation between returns on convertible bonds and information transparency when estimating idiosyncratic risk on a monthly basis and that a positive association also exists between credit rating, idiosyncratic risk, and returns on bonds. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","convertible bonds; credit risk; idiosyncratic risk; information transparency",""

This abnormal long-run performance is more severe for orphan IPOs (those without financial analysts' recommendations) than for non-orphan IPOs the first year following the offerings (a statistically significant difference). In contrast to the widely held belief, this evidence suggests that analyst coverage is indeed not important to the issuing firm. Investors pay more attention to non-orphan IPOs when they are not book built, venture capital backed, underwritten by a large syndicate and less underpriced. Over the 1991-2005 period, an analyst's affiliation does not appear to matter. This result is inconsistent with the conflict of interest hypothesis. During the first year of issuance, analysts' recommendations are associated with the success of a newly public firm.

We provide additional insight by examining the complex interlocking of three key variables that are important for regulators: the degree of market power, funding sources and bank performance. The results show that market power increases when banks use internal funding to diversify into non-interest income-generating activities. We also find that the high net-interest margins of banks in emerging and developing countries can be explained by the degree of market power, credit risk, and implicit interest payments. In addition, our results suggest that interest margins among banks with market power are significantly more sensitive to internally generated funds than they are to deposit and wholesale funding. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","bank funding; bank market power; developing countries; net-interest margin",""

While our focus is on IPO firms, we also examine the impact of firm size by differentiating between IPO and established DAX/MDAX firms and by analyzing the source of surplus cash holdings, that is, either from equity issuances or from operating cash flows. We further explore the impact of the regulatory environment. Our empirical analysis reveals significant differences between the IPO and DAX/MDAX subsamples regarding their repurchase motives, stock price performance, and explanatory factors. Standard corporate payout theories are essential in explaining the different valuation effects. Our empirical analysis suggests agency costs of free cash flow as the main reason for the observed valuation effects of both IPO and DAX/MDAX firms, yet for different reasons. While DAX/MDAX firms continuously generate high operating cash flows before and after repurchasing shares, IPO firms exhibit low operating cash flows during the entire period but large surplus cash holdings due to the mandatory equity issuance at their public offering. Overall, the repurchase decisions of IPO firms are best explained by the agency costs of cash holdings and the unique rules and regulations of the German stock exchange. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","initial public offerings; share repurchases; valuation effects",""

Rather than seeking competitiveness through standardization as is common to lean production, real-options reasoning explores opportunities to use supply-chain variability as a strategic weapon. We present an illustrative case study of a Swiss manufacturer of cable extrusion equipment supported by a formal real-options model that aids in valuing the embedded options that make up supply-chain flexibility: postponement, contraction, expansion, switching, and abandonment. Real-options reasoning provides a plausible retrospective rationale for the case firm's use of supply-chain flexibility that provided protection against competition from low cost, but less responsive competitors. Their intuitive real-options reasoning facilitated incorporating fuller information concerning volatility, flexibility, and control into choosing what products to make, in what quantity, and with work allocated to which supplier. The case study also highlights how competing through exploiting embedded real options requires a different managerial skill set than does competing through cost reduction.

Also, the above explanation is confined to certain time periods in the USA. Since we cannot establish a decent relation between momentum and macroeconomic risks, we suspect a behavior-based explanation to be at work. In fact, we find momentum profits to be more pronounced for portfolios characterized by higher information uncertainty. Hence, the momentum anomaly may well be rationalized in a model of investors underreacting to fundamental news.

This paper identifies, in the case of China, whether paying cash dividends is a means of protection or expropriation of minority shareholders' interests. With 4810 observations from companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange over the period 2004-2008, the authors find significant negative associations between cash dividend payments and the SBM of non-controlling large shareholders under the exogeneity assumption and the SBM of tradable shareholders under the endogeneity assumption. The findings suggest that cash dividends are used as a manner of tunneling by the controlling shareholder. This paper also shows that the SBM of non-controlling shareholders has a significant positive effect on cash dividends, especially for companies paying high and abnormal dividends. The results imply that in China's capital market, cash dividend payments are not only expropriations of minority shareholders' interests by the controlling shareholder but also coalitions of controlling and non-controlling large shareholders.

Tian for his comments, and for participating, together with students of the Financial Engineering program at York University, in the data preparation and the execution of the Matlab programs. In this paper, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for bid and ask prices of European options to be free of arbitrage, and derive from it an efficient numerical methodology to determine its satisfaction by a given set of prices. If the bid and ask prices satisfy the no-arbitrage (NA) condition, our methodology produces a vector of NA prices that lie between the bid and ask prices. Otherwise, our methodology generates a vector of arbitrage-free prices that is as close as possible, in some sense, to the bid-ask strip. The arbitrage-free prices detected by our methodology render the commonly used practice of using mid-points and then 'cleaning' arbitrage from them as unnecessary. Moreover, a vector of 'cleaned' prices obtained from mid-point prices may be outside the bid-ask spread even in an arbitrage-free market and, hence, in this case will not be representative of the current market. A new procedure of estimating implied valuation operators is also suggested here. This procedure is rooted in the economic properties of put and call prices and is based on Phillips and Taylor's approximation of a convex function. This approach is superior to common estimation techniques in that it produces an analytical expression for the implied valuation operator and is not data intensive as some other studies. Empirical findings for the new methods are documented and their economic implications are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","asset pricing; bond interest rates; contingent pricing; estimation; futures pricing; model construction and estimation; trading volume",""

With control of leveraged positions, illiquidity discounts increase with the volatility, and their size is greatly diminished.

Large discounts are documented in two forms of occasional transactions in restricted shares: namely auctions and transfers.

We find relatively stationary life insurance premiums in countries from the following groups: high-income, Europe, and common law origin; relatively stationary non-life insurance premiums exist in the following groups: low-income, Middle East and Africa, and common law origin. Evidence herein shows that different classifications, including income levels, geographic regions, regionally or economically integrated blocs, and legal system, affect the stationarity of life and non-life insurance premiums. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cross-country dependence; insurance premiums; Monte Carlo simulations; nonlinear panel unit-root test",""

We consider a firm that is located in a specific location, producing at a certain level of efficiency. With time, the firm can decide to change its location to a new and more efficient site, paying relocation costs. Moreover, we assume that these new sites become available according to a Poisson process, and that the levels of efficiency improvement inherent to each one of these sites are random variables. With this framework, we characterise certain parameters of the optimal relocation policy. In particular, we characterise the expected relocation time and we prove that it depends on the distribution of the level of efficiency improvement only through an expected value. Therefore, the optimal policy shows a kind of robustness in terms of the stochastic assumptions of the problem, which has a major impact in the application of relocation policies. In addition, we also characterise the optimal relocation time. Impacts on the final results driven by the characteristics of the firm's original location site, the market environment and the way in which risk is modelled are studied numerically.

It is well known that the presence of a herding mechanism in the model is not sufficient for non-Gaussian properties, which crucially depend on the details of the communication network among agents. The main contribution of this article is to show that certain hierarchical networks, which portray the institutional structure of fund investment, warrant non-Gaussian properties for any system size and even lead to an increase in system-wide volatility.

We find that although an average sample firm experiences some degree of financial constraints, state-ownership does not necessarily help in reducing the firm's financial constraints on investment. Further evidence shows that state-ownership does not lead to more borrowing from the Chinese banking sector, implying that state-ownership does not necessarily reduce the firm's financial constraints via the state-controlled banking sector. We consider not only the standard factors in the investment equation, but also the firm's equity financing behaviour explicitly. The result is robust to both the conventional proxy for financial constraints, i.e. the investment-cash-flow sensitivity, and a recently developed proxy for financial constraints, i.e. the KZ index. Our results suggest that China's corporatisation movement is effective in that soft budget constraints once enjoyed by former state-owned enterprises have been removed along with the progress of corporatisation.

Moreover, variations in the holding cost give rise to a host of investment decisions ranging from the standard real option solution for a zero-holding cost to a net present value solution for an infinite-holding cost. Not only does the holding cost mediate between these two poles, but it provides the option seller (usually a landowner or a government) with a policy instrument for influencing the extraction timing and thus the extraction profit of the option buyer. We derive the holding cost that optimizes the landowner's combined value of the option premium, holding costs and eventual royalties. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","convenience yield; escalating investment cost; oil extraction; real option-holding cost",""

Most dedicated studies have only been descriptive in nature, while the number of empirical studies is very limited.

Our paper aims to assess bancassurance performance gains (from both the banking and the insurance standpoints) in the Italian banking and insurance sectors over the period 2005-2006 by estimating cost and profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis. With regard to the banking industry, we do not show any strong evidence in favour of entering the life insurance business. The investigation into the insurance industry highlights the competitive viability of bancassurance as a distribution channel, especially in terms of cost efficiency. In terms of profitability, our findings suggest that the mix of products should be continuously revised to adapt to customer needs and the evolution of financial markets. As a consequence, ownership links are not necessarily the best bancassurance strategy, and the parties involved should also consider more flexible forms of cooperation, such as cross-selling agreements and non-equity strategic alliances. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bancassurance; banking; cost efficiency; life insurance; profit efficiency; stochastic frontier analysis",""

We find that the RRs of buyouts (amount recovered in proportion to SD outstanding) are in fact about twice that of PLCs during this period. Administration, surprisingly, has no effect on debt-RRs but seems significantly to reduce the time to recovery. A larger number of creditors which in theory should reduce RRs, again has no impact, nor does company size. Intriguingly, however, higher leverage consistently reduces the RR as (we hypothesise) more leveraged buyouts need to have recourse to lower quality assets for security. Finally, the time in recovery is negatively related to the date of distress onset (later years have shorter durations) and to the size of the firm (a concave relationship). © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Administration; buyout; financial distress; private equity-backed; public-owned; Receivership; recovery rate",""

Previous works on stochastic project and investment cost concentrate on geometric Brownian motions (GBMs) for driving the factors. However, when the project involved is linked to commodities, mean-reverting assumptions are more meaningful. Here, we introduce a model and prove that the optimal exercise strategy is not a function of the ratio of the project value to the investment V/I - contrary to the GBM case. We also demonstrate that the limiting trigger curve as maturity approaches traces out a nonlinear curve in (V, I) space and derive its explicit form. Finally, we numerically investigate the finite-horizon problem, using the Fourier space time-stepping algorithm of Jaimungal and Surkov [2009.

On basis of a vector autoregressive model capturing various dimensions of liquidity and their interactions, I simulate the effect of a large liquidity shock, measured by a very aggressive market order. I show that, despite the absence of market makers, the market is resilient. All dimensions of liquidity (spread, depth at the best prices and order book imbalances) revert to their steady-state values within 15 orders after the shock. For prices, a long run effect is found. Furthermore, different dimensions of liquidity interact. Immediately after a liquidity shock, the spread becomes wider than in the steady state, implying that one dimension of liquidity deteriorates, while at the same time, depth at the best prices increases, meaning an improvement of another liquidity dimension. In subsequent periods, the spread reverts back to the steady-state level but also depth decreases. Also, I find evidence for asymmetries in the impact of shocks on the ask and bid side. Shocks on the ask side have a stronger impact than shocks on the bid side.

Unlike the extant literature, which typically models mispricings through the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we introduce a nonlinear generalization of OU which jointly captures several important risk factors inherent in arbitrage trading. While these factors are absent from the standard OU, we show that considering them yields several new insights into the behavior of rational arbitrageurs: Firstly, arbitrageurs recognizing these risk factors exhibit a diminishing propensity to exploit large mispricings. Secondly, optimal investment behavior in light of these risk factors precipitates the gradual unwinding of losing trades far sooner than is entailed in existing approaches including OU. Finally, an empirical application to daily FTSE100 pairs data shows that incorporating these risks renders our model's risk-management capabilities superior to both OU and a simple threshold strategy popular in the literature.

However, it is crucial to take into account that most evolving gas markets, like the German spot market, lack liquidity. This implies that large-scale operation of storages reduces the achievable operating margin since storage operators will pay higher prices for injected gas and earn less on withdrawn gas. Optimal storage operation will take this into account. In this context, considering storage operators as price takers does not account for interdependencies of storage operations and market prices. This paper offers a novel approach to storage valuation taking into account the effect of management decisions on market prices. The methodology proposed within this paper determines the optimal production schedule and value by determining the stochastic differential equation describing the storage value and then applying a finite difference scheme. We find that limited liquidity lowers the storage value and reduces withdrawal and injection amounts. Further, we observe decreasing reservation prices for injection and withdrawing for growing illiquidity resulting in a left shift of injection and withdrawing threshold prices. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","asset pricing; limited liquidity; real option valuation; trading volume",""

We do not find clear contemporaneous relationships between FX order flows and stock market changes at high frequencies, but FX flows do appear to have significant power to forecast stock index returns over 1-30 min horizons, after controlling for lagged exchange rate and stock market returns. The effects of order flows from financial customers on future stock market changes are negative, while the effects of corporate orders are positive. The latter results are consistent with the premise that corporate order flows contain dispersed, passively acquired information about fundamentals. Thus, purchases of the dollar by corporate customers represent good news about the state of the US economy. Importantly, though, there also appears to be extra information in corporate flows which is directly relevant to equity prices over and above the impact derived from stock prices reacting to (predicted) exchange rate changes.

The java GP modelling environment is an implementation of the steady-state GP algorithm. This algorithm evolves tree-based structures that represent models of inputs and outputs. The motivation of this paper is to compare the GP algorithm with neural network (NN) architectures when applied to the task of forecasting and trading the ASE 20 Greek Index (using autoregressive terms as inputs). This is done by benchmarking the forecasting performance of the GP algorithm and six different autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) NN combination designs representing a Hybrid, Mixed Higher Order Neural Network (HONN), a Hybrid, Mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a Hybrid, Mixed classic Multilayer Perceptron with some traditional techniques, either statistical such as a an ARMA or technical such as a moving average convergence/divergence model, and a naïve trading strategy. More specifically, the trading performance of all models is investigated in a forecast and trading simulation on ASE 20 time-series closing prices over the period 2001-2008, using the last one and a half years for out-of-sample testing. We use the ASE 20 daily series as many financial institutions are ready to trade at this level, and it is therefore possible to leave orders with a bank for business to be transacted on that basis. As it turns out, the GP model does remarkably well and outperforms all other models in a simple trading simulation exercise. This is also the case when more sophisticated trading strategies using confirmation filters and leverage are applied, as the GP model still produces better results and outperforms all other NN and traditional statistical models in terms of annualized return. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","confirmation filters; evolutionary algorithms; genetic programming; HONNs; leverage; multi-layer perceptron networks; quantitative trading strategies; RNNs; system modelling",""

To illustrate this, we develop a simple model, motivated by the 2007-2008 crisis in credit derivatives markets. This shows how coordination on simple and apparently profitable rules may weaken regulatory constraints, rendering the whole system more fragile. The rule, in the specific example, consists in deciding not to exercise due diligence in the evaluation of complex credit derivative products, free riding on information and operational costs.

It argues that this can be achieved by using a stochastic process for the price that is sufficiently general to respond to supply and demand imbalances in the market for the resource. Once the individual decision rules are derived, the parameters of the process must be determined to ensure market equilibrium exists. For reserves of natural resources, this can be done by using a mean-reverting process for the price of the commodity and ensuring that the long-term price to which it reverts equals the trigger price for development of the marginal reserve. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","general equilibrium; mean reversion; real options",""

Within this framework, the different roles of the macroeconomic factor and investor heterogeneity in the determination of the exchange rate are examined explicitly. We show that this simple model generates very complicated market behaviour, including the existence of multiple steady-state equilibria, deviations of the market exchange rate from the fundamental one and market fluctuations.

This has stimulated the interest of both academics and practitioners in the development and application of more sophisticated models. By allowing for the presence of nonlinearities, complex dynamics, multiple equilibria, structural breaks and spurious trends, these latter models resemble more closely the properties of economic and financial time series. In this article, we illustrate the flexibility of a family of econometric models, namely the exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR), to encompass several of the above characteristics. We then re-assess the power of the ESTAR unit root test developed by Kapetanios, Shin and Snell ((2003)) in the presence of nuisance parameters typically encountered in the literature and compare its performance with that of the augmented Dickey-Fuller and the Enders and Granger ((1998)) tests. Our results show the lack of dominance of any particular test and that the power is not independent to priors about the nuisance parameters. Finally, we examine several asset price deviations from fundamentals and one hyper-inflation series and find contradictory results between the nonlinear fitted models and unit root tests.

By contrast, age and tenure diversity are associated with wealth losses surrounding acquisition announcements, while gender diversity does not lead to measurable value effects. Interestingly, boards with more banking expertise are not more effective at monitoring bank managers. Our results do not support calls for more representation of industry-specific expertise on bank boards and, instead, show that occupational diversity may play an important role in protecting shareholder wealth. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","age diversity; banks; board diversity; corporate governance; gender diversity; mergers; occupational background diversity; performance; tenure diversity",""

To check the adequacy of copula assumptions by which stochastic dependencies can be described, goodness-of-fit (gof) tests have to be carried out. These tests require (serially) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data as input. Due to autocorrelations and time-varying conditional volatilities, this prerequisite is usually not fulfilled by financial market returns. Within a simulation study, we analyze the influence of these violations of the i.i.d.-prerequisite on the rejection rates of gof tests. We find that in many cases the rejection rates are significantly different for non-i.i.d. data input than for adequately filtered data input. This finding questions the conclusions of early empirical studies applying gof tests for copulas to data without adequately filtering it before. Only in the majority of those constellations that in general yield very low rejection rates, no significant differences have been revealed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","autocorrelation; copulas; GARCH models; goodness-of-fit test",""

We found that to achieve a higher value by waiting, a delicate balance of precipitators of change against time until exercise is necessary (e.g. if there were just one or two precipitators, then waiting would certainly raise the value). Similarly, to achieve a higher value by staging, the entrepreneur needs to balance embedding against investment time. Thus, provided that investment time is less than 1 1/4 years, we found that embedding will raise the value.

We consider four distinct operating modes for the plant. Such a plant can be characterized as a real option on a spark spread: optimally converting natural gas to electricity. We use a Margrabe approach by using the market heat rate (the ratio of the electricity price to the natural gas price) as our underlying stochastic variable. We estimate a stochastic model for market heat rates that incorporates time of day, day of week, month, and the incidence or otherwise of a spike in heat rates. We use the model and its residuals in a bootstrap process simulating future market heat rates, and use a least-squares Monte Carlo approach to determine the optimal operating policy. We find that the annual average market heat rate is a good explanatory variable for the time integral of the plant operating margin, denominated in the natural gas numeraire. This allows us to express plant values in terms of the numeraire and convert to dollars by multiplying this by the natural gas forward curve and a forward curve of riskless discount rates. We also provide information about the optimal operating modes selected, the number of transitions between modes and how they relate to transition costs and the average heat rate for the year. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","capital budgeting; fixed investment and inventory studies contingent pricing; futures pricing statistical decision theory; operations research simulation methods",""

As a result of the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found to be characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formation process ending at some potential critical time [ttilde] c, which follows a mean-reverting stationary dynamics. Because of the heterogeneity of the rational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the optimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the survival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The explicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear transformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of bubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter estimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price dynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that are in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests have been performed on four financial markets, the US S&P500 index from 1 February 1980 to 31 October 2008, the US NASDAQ Composite index from 1 January 1980 to 31 July 2008, the Hong Kong Hang Seng index from 1 December 1986 to 30 November 2008 and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from 3 January 1920 to 31 December 1931.

For each portfolio, we build CFO structures that have different levels of leverage, and analyze both the stand-alone performance as well as potential diversification benefits (low systematic risk exposures) of investing in the equity tranche of these structures. We find that the unconstrained mean-variance portfolio yields a high performance, but greater exposure to systematic risk. We observe the exact opposite picture in the case of unconstrained optimization, where a skewness bias is added, thus proving the existence of a trade-off between stand-alone performance and low exposure to systematic risk factors.

Using US Bank Holding Company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding securitized assets choose asset portfolios of lower credit risks. Examining securitizations by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding securitization and risk taking is primarily driven by securitizations of mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer loans. Securitizations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit risk-taking behavior. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in securitization transactions, as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitization on the risk-taking behavior of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the transactions structure. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude of credit support provided by banks. This leads us to suggest that banks have typically viewed securitization as a financing rather than a risk management mechanism. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bank; risk taking; securitization",""

Moreover, the analysis of the temporal evolution of the price differences between equivalent bank-issued options reveals that they are not decreasing over time. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Bank-issued options; Market design; Options",""

To address this question, we use a heteroscedastic regression model to empirically examine the factors affecting the spread dispersion unexplained by easy-to-observe issue characteristics (such as credit ratings,size,maturity,etc.).Two main results emerge from the empirical analysis. First, variables that accurately predict the spread of the typical bond lose their explanatory power for worse-rated, subordinated bonds with longer maturity and smaller face value. This result suggests that investors price hidden information. Secondly, unexplained spread dispersion increases for open-priced offers and decreases with the number of banks involved in the syndicate, indicating that primary market characteristics affect the investors' ability to uncover hidden information. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Banks; Credit ratings; Market discipline; Opaqueness",""

The results suggest that mutual fund managers are not able to outperform the market, presenting negative or neutral performance. The incorporation of conditioning information in performance evaluation models is supported by our findings, as it improves the explanatory power of the models and there is evidence of both time-varying betas and alphas related to the public information variables. It is also shown that the number of lags to be used in the stochastic detrending procedure is a critical choice, as it will impact the significance of the conditioning information. In addition, we observe a distance effect, since managers who invest locally seem to outperform those who invest in the European market. However, after controlling for public information, this effect is slightly reduced.

Compared to unconditional alphas, fund performance sharply deteriorates when we measure conditional alphas. Given that stock returns are to some extent predictable based on publicly available information, conditional performance evaluation raises the benchmark for active fund managers because it gives them no credit for exploiting readily available information. Underperformance is more pronounced in the SDF framework than in beta-pricing models.

However, it is my contention that he should also be referred to as the 'founder of Modern Risk Management' since his contributions to portfolio theory formed the basis for how risk is currently viewed and managed. More specifically, Markowitz argued that a portfolio of securities should be viewed through the lens of statistics where the probability distribution of its rate of return is evaluated in terms of its expected value and standard deviation. Since the ultimate selection of a portfolio involves the evaluation and management of risk as measured by standard deviation, it is clear that Markowitz's process of portfolio selection represents the birth of modern risk management whereby risk is quantified and controlled. In this paper, I will first, introduce value-at-risk as a measure of risk and how it relates to standard deviation, the risk measure at the heart of the model of Markowitz. Second, I will similarly introduce conditional value-at-risk (also known as expected shortfall) as a measure of risk and compare it with VaR.

It proposes a data-driven procedure to credibly identify the number and timing of breaks and applies it on the benchmark stock-market indices of 27 OECD countries. The findings suggest that a substantial element of the observed deviations from normality might indeed be due to the co-existence of breaks and GARCH effects. However, the presence of structural changes is found to be the primary reason for the non-normality and not the GARCH effects. Also, there is still some remaining excess kurtosis that is unlikely to be linked to the specification of the conditional volatility or the presence of breaks. Finally, an interesting sideline result implies that GARCH models have limited capacity in forecasting stock-market volatility. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Breaks; GARCH; Non-normality; OECD countries; Stock returns",""

As the association between the underlying assets may vary over time, the dynamic copula approach is considered. Therefore, the proposed method proves to play an important role in pricing bivariate option. The approach is illustrated for Chinese market with one type of better-of-two markets claims: call option on the better performer of Shanghai Stock Composite Index and Shenzhen Stock Composite Index.

By aggregating heterogeneous beliefs into a market consensus belief, we obtain capital asset pricing model-like equilibrium price and return relationships under heterogeneous beliefs.We show that the market aggregate behaviour is in principle a weighted average of heterogeneous individual behaviours. The impact of heterogeneity on the market equilibrium price and risk premium is examined in general.

The cash-flow (C/F) stream to be discounted is projected as the product of the sales and the free C/F to the enterprise (FCFE)-to-sales ratio and their respective rates of change. The C/F timespan is divided into three intervals. In the first, sales and ratio change according to the company's track record. On the assumption that both industry and firm abnormal earnings disappear at a certain point, marking the beginning of the third interval, the ratio evolves over the second interval to reach the Industry's average and thereafter remains constant. On the same basis, sales grow in the third interval in accordance with the economy's long-term trend, i.e. at the long-term nominal GDP growth rate, and within the second at an average of the latter and the track-record year-on-year growth rate. The proposed variant is tested for the four largest telecommunications companies in continental Europe over a 2.5-year period. The results, together with those of the standard model, are then compared with enterprise market values to test relative performance. Examination of their respective bias (signed valuation errors) and inaccuracy (ditto unsigned) seems to indicate that the proposed variant outperforms the standard model from which it is derived, even for different assumptions about the valuation horizon and for alternative ways to estimate the values of the variables. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cash-flow forecasting; Company valuation; Discounted cash flow; Ratios; Relative valuation",""

This separation can explain differences in the lending behavior and performance of public and private banks as observed in the market.

The NAC is much more restrictive than the PCC in two respects. There are strong limitations on the degree of dependence in each level of the NAC, and all the bivariate copulas in this construction has to be Archimedean. Based on an empirical study with two different four-dimensional data sets; precipitation values and equity returns, we show that the PCC provides a better fit than the NAC and that it is computationally more efficient.

Surprisingly, we show that the diffusion-based stochastic volatility models are not consistent with this stylized fact. Finally, we argue that adding jumps to a diffusion-based volatility model help recovering this volatility pattern.

Furthermore, impact response coefficients and the contribution of news announcement effects on daily price variation are found to vary across the sample and to depend on three factors: the magnitude of news surprises; the underlying economic conditions conveyed by news announcements; business cycle turning points as represented by switches from bad news to good news (and vice versa). © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Asymmetry; Exchange rates; High frequency data; Macroeconomic news announcements; Realised volatility",""

Our intent is to study settings in which retail investors are most likely to have influence on market prices. Previous research suggests that retail investors have more influence in small capitalization stocks, and argues that retail investors are most likely to be irrational. Most theories of stock price anomalies hypothesize the presence of irrational traders. Consequently, we focus on stock price anomalies in primarily small capitalization stocks. Our data are from the Australian Stock Exchange Clearinghouse. The Australian stock market is characterized by a high level of direct stock holdings by individual investors, further enhancing the likelihood of retail investors' influence. We investigate the Granger causality between investor category trading and stock prices, and display the relative trading volume of the investor categories. We conclude that retail investors are not responsible for stock mispricing. Since retail investors do not affect prices in this carefully selected environment, we infer that their trading is unlikely to influence stock market prices.

The first is the elliptical methodology, where the leap from univariate to multivariate has taken place by constructing density functions that are functions of quadratic forms of the marginals. The second is the copula philosophy, where the dependency structure is treated entirely separately from marginals. In financial applications one often needs to work with combinations of marginals of various distributional types, and the copula philosophy is very attractive as it copes well with heterogeneous marginals. However, with some notable exceptions, the copula approach does not normally correspond to any natural or canonical multivariate structure arising from some underlying dynamic. This paper presents an approach to multivariate distribution theory that allows for heterogeneous marginals but without the limitations of the elliptical ansatz or the arbitrariness of the copula approach. The approach is to consider multivariate distributions as arising naturally from coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and in this paper we consider a first step based on the equilibrium situation. The scope of this paper is where the marginals are one of the classic Pearson family of distributions, allowing for great diversity among the marginals. For simplicity we present details for the bivariate case. Using a recently developed quantile form of the Fokker-Planck equation it is first shown how the members of the Pearson family are associated with various types of one-dimensional SDE in a transparent manner. Then appropriate two-dimensional SDEs and the associated Fokker-Planck equations are considered. In the equilibrium limit these give solutions that are natural bivariate structures. Some examples with marginals drawn from Gaussian, Student and one-sided exponential are explored. Some possible generalizations are outlined. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Bivariate; Copula; Dependency; Elliptic; Exponential; Exponential-normal; Fokker-planck equation; Gaussian; Multivariate; Normal; Pearson distribution; Quantile mechanics; Stochastic differential equation; Student; Student-normal",""

However, the homogeneity of market operations is not statistically significant. In our second-stage Cragg regression, market liquidity becomes insignificant while firms' growth opportunities are now inversely related to the amount of insurance purchased. Additionally, the homogeneity of market operations becomes significantly related to the corporate purchase of property insurance. Therefore, different factors (e.g. cost considerations) may influence the decisions to purchase property insurance and subsequently, the level of coverage provided. We argue that our results are relevant for companies in other emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and companies operating in more developedWestern economies such as the European Union (EU). © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Agency theory; China; Emerging markets; Insurance; Strategy",""

[1969. The adjustment of stock prices to new information. International Economic Review 10, no. 1: 1-21] to segregate a stock's return into expected and unexpected components. Moreover, conventional practice assumes that abnormal returns evolve in terms of a normal distribution. There is, however, an increasing tendency for event studies to employ non-parametric testing procedures due to the mounting empirical evidence which shows that stock returns are incompatible with the normal distribution. This paper focuses on the widely used nonparametric ranking procedure developed by Corrado [1989. A nonparametric test for abnormal security price performance in event studies. Journal of Financial Economics 23, no. 2: 385-95] for assessing the significance of abnormal security returns. In particular, we develop a consistent estimator for the variance of the sum of ranks of the abnormal returns, and show how this leads to a more efficient test statistic (as well as to less cumbersome computational procedures) than the test originally proposed by Corrado (1989).We also use the theorem of Berry [1941. The accuracy of the Gaussian approximation to the sum of independent variates. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 49, no. 1: 122-36] and Esseen [1945. Fourier analysis of distribution functions:A mathematical study of the Laplace-Gaussian law. Acta Mathematica 77, no. 1: 1-125] to demonstrate how the distribution of the modified Corrado test statistic developed here asymptotically converges towards the normal distribution. This shows that describing the distributional properties of the sum of the ranks in terms of the normal distribution is highly problematic for small sample sizes and small event windows. In these circumstances, we show that a second-order Edgeworth expansion provides a good approximation to the actual probability distribution of the modified Corrado test statistic. The application of the modified Corrado test developed here is illustrated using data for the purchase and sale by UK directors of shares in their own companies. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Abnormal return; Corrado test; Edgeworth expansion; Normal distribution; Rank",""

This paper provides a general explanation for this dividend puzzle by developing a class of signaling models where the most efficient signal for a firm of sufficiently high quality always involves payout of taxable cash dividends. If the high type is not of much higher quality than the low type, the cheapest way to deter imitation from the low type is to increase share repurchases financed by a cut in investments. However, when the high type is of much higher quality than the lowtype, the cut in investments on the margin becomes more costly to the high type than to the lowtype. Hence, the most efficient signal becomes a money-burning signal, which is equally costly for both types of firms. The crucial assumption leading to this result is that a marginal cut in investments eventually becomes more costly to the high-quality firm than to the low-quality imitator. Taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new shares/reduced share repurchases, which only gives rise to increased taxes, is the money-burning signal. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Dividends; Money burning; Share repurchases; Signaling; Single-crossing property",""

Results indicate that home bias induces a worse risk-adjusted performance. Home-biased individuals' relatively bad performance originates in insufficient risk-reduction, due to a lack of international diversification. A higher degree of portfolio churning also deteriorates performance, despite the fact that churning is not associated with any direct transaction costs. However, home-biased individuals do not churn portfolios as often as individuals with a larger share of international asset holdings, which diminishes the negative effects of home bias on performance. Overconfidence is driven by a return-chasing behavior, where overconfident individuals favor international assets with high historical returns.

Estimating and interpreting forward interest rates: Sweden 1992-1994, IMF Working Paper, International Monetary Fund, report significant pricing errors in their sample.

Tax and liquidity effects in pricing government bonds. Journal of Finance 53: 1533-62, cannot fully explain the observed pricing errors.

We provide empirical evidence for the German government bond market that risk-adjusted trading strategies based on bond pricing errors can yield about 15 basis points p.a. abnormal return compared to benchmark portfolios. Furthermore, the abnormal returns are continuously achieved over the whole time period and not randomly on a few days and show a relation to changes in the level and the curvature of the term structure of interest rates.

It is also found that: (i) the fundamental component of the E/P has superior explanatory power than simpler measures of expected earnings growth; (ii) 'non-fundamental' components, interpreted as signals reducing asymmetric information (such as firm size, the number of forecasts and the chartist momentum), mitigate the role of the fundamentals; (iii) current deviations from the fundamentals are affected by ex post adjustment of publicly available information in the EU sample. It is argued that differences in regulatory environments and in the composition of investors between the US and EU financial systems may help to explain these comparative findings. Results appear consistent with the 'market integrity hypothesis' postulating that reliance on publicly observable fundamentals is higher when insider trading is lower.","Asymmetric information; DCF fundamental value; Insider trading; Non-fundamental components; Price earning ratio",""

And yet, the basis for their use is generally weak: popular indicators of changes in risk appetite typically have scant foundation in theory and give contradictory signals in practice. This has led to the views that it is a convenient ex post rationalization rather than a well-founded explanation of asset price movements. This paper starts from the premise that changing risk appetite might be a legitimate explanation, but that there is an identification problem, both theoretically and empirically. The solution offered here is based on the approach introduced by Kumar and Persaud (Kumar, M., and A. Persaud. 2002. Pure contagion and investors' shifting risk appetite: analytical issues and empirical evidence. International Finance 5: 401-36.), and on the work of Misina (Misina, M. 2003. What Does the Risk-Appetite Index Measure? Bank of Canada, Working Paper 2003-23.) who established the theoretical conditions under which that approach will correctly identify changes in risk appetite. We propose a method to implement these conditions and thus ensure that the resulting index is empirically sound. This index is then used to examine the presence of changes in risk appetite in the data, and, more generally, whether this explanation is appropriate in particular circumstances. The empirical illustration is based on a portfolio of foreign currencies, but the techniques are general and can be applied to any portfolio.","Asset prices; Risk appetite; Risk-appetite indexes",""

A new family of conditionally heteroscedastic models with a trend-dependent conditional variance equation: The Trend-GARCH model is described. Modern microeconomic theory often suggests the connection between the past behaviour of time series, the subsequent reaction of market individuals, and thereon changes in the future characteristics of the time series. Results reveal important properties of these models, which are consistent with stylized facts found in financial data sets. They can also be employed for model identification, estimation, and testing. The empirical analysis supports the existence of trend effects. The Trend-GARCH model proves to be superior to alternative models such as EGARCH, AGARCH, TGARCH OR GARCH-in-Mean in replicating the leverage effect in the conditional variance, in fitting the news impact curve and in fitting the volatility estimates from high frequency data. In addition, we show that the leverage effect is dependent on the current trend, i.e. it differentiates between bullish and bearish markets. Furthermore, trend effects can account for a significant part of the long memory property of asset price volatilities.","GARCH; Leverage effect; News impact curve; Persistence; Trend; Volatility",""

The need to allow for skewness can also be readily tested. The model is consistent with the volatility feedback effect in that conditional skewness is dependent on conditional variance. Compared to previously presented GARCH models allowing for conditional skewness, the model is analytically tractable, parsimonious and facilitates straightforward interpretation.Our empirical results indicate the presence of conditional skewness in the monthly postwar US stock returns. Small positive news is also found to have a smaller impact on conditional variance than no news at all.

Two indicators have come to the fore in recent years that provide useful insights: sentiment/momentum and accounting fundamentals/financial health. We examine their single and combined impact on value and growth stocks and find that (i) they are effective in introducing a timing element into the selection of both value and growth stocks, (ii) the sentiment indicator completely dominates the financial health indicator and, (iii) both indictors contribute to the performance of the good and bad growth stocks. The size and significance of the investment profits that potentially can be generated using the two indicators in combination questions of the efficiency of the European equity markets.

This approach is particularly suited for prices with multiple attraction regions, such as crude oil and other energy and agricultural commodities. The price is modelled as a diffusion process governed by a potential function with minima at the attraction points. When applied to crude oil prices, the method captures characteristic behaviour of the prices remarkably well. Pricing of European options on spot and futures commodity contracts is developed within the potential model, and compared to the Black-Scholes framework. The approach provides a new way of estimating the volatility, which is particularly useful when option prices (and hence implied volatilities) are not readily available; this is often the case for commodity markets. European options on physical commodities and commodity futures are priced using the volatility forecasts obtained from the model. The performance of the model is evaluated on the basis of the hedging costs of an option. For options on crude oil, the method outperforms - in terms of hedging costs - the Black-Scholes approach with historical volatility.","Commodity prices; Hedging costs; Multiple attraction regions; Option pricing; Potential function; Volatility esimation",""

It is found that profit x-inefficiency is slightly higher than cost x-inefficiency, which suggests that revenue x-inefficiency is rather small. The evidence also shows that the degree of cost x-inefficiency is exacerbated by bad loans, high capital ratios and financial liberalisation. In contrast, it is shown that larger banks are more efficient and the level of foreign bank penetration reduces x-inefficiency.

Second, the residual value risk is approached through a resampling technique to provide one of the first empirical analysis on residual value losses in the automotive lease sector. Probability density function of losses and Value-at-risk measures are estimated on the basis of a private database comprising a unique set of 4828 individual automotive lease contracts issued between 1990 and 2001 by a major European financial institution. Then, a discussion is led in relation to the capital requirements related to residual value risk stemming from the Basel II Accord. As the greatest part of recovery risk is diversifiable, our conclusion is that a wider recognition of physical collateral in capital adequacy regulations should allow us to better reflect the relatively low-risk profile of automotive lease exposures.","Basel II Accord; Leasing; Loss given default (LGD); Residual value risk",""

However, a few examples of betting markets with zero or negative bias have been found, for example in certain American sports. The understanding of longshot bias is likely to be informed by comparing and contrasting conditions in markets displaying positive, zero, and negative bias but, to date, relatively few markets have been examined. This paper employs a large data set on professional men's tennis matches and a new econometric approach to the estimation of the relationship between returns and odds.

Besides, linear causality increases after 1987, a finding consistent with the expected effects of financial liberalization of the 1980s and the 1990s. Above all, we document the presence of bidirectional nonlinear causality between daily returns. To check for spurious nonlinear causality, we filter out heteroskedasticity using a FIGARCH model. The dramatic decrease in the number of significant nonlinear causality lags confirms that heteroskedasticity played a major part in the previous findings.

Using dynamic multivariate regression analysis coupled with a qualitative understanding of hedge fund return drivers, one is able to perform a robust factor decomposition to attribute risk within any hedge fund portfolio with an identifiable strategy. Furthermore, through use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques, these factors can be employed to generate implied risk profiles at either the constituent fund or aggregate fund-of-funds level.

It is concluded that for the time series studied and for the period under investigation, the performance of the advanced models is mixed. While the NNR models have the ability to forecast the 10-year Government bond yield and add economic value as a trading decision tool, the Kalman filter models' performance is not as conclusive. The Kalman filter models outperformed the traditional techniques using forecasting accuracy measures, however they did not perform as well in the simulated trading strategy.","ARMA models; Forecasting accuracy; Kalman filter; Logistic regression; MACD technical models; Neural network regression; Technical trading models; Trading efficiency",""

This paper examines the Fisherian hypothesis of asset returns using alternative techniques of linear regression, and vector error correction models to examine the nature of the relationship between stock returns and inflation in the UK. Consistent with the Fisherian hypothesis, empirical evidence in the linear regression model suggests a positive and statistically significant relationship between stock returns and inflation, which regards common stock as a good hedge against inflation. The results based on the unit root and cointegration tests indicate a long-run reliable relationship between price levels, share prices, and interest rates which could be interpreted as the long-run determinants of stock returns. The findings also suggest a bidirectional relationship between stock returns and inflation. The evidence of a significant Fisher effect is robust across model specifications.","Cointegration; Fisher effect; Inflation; Stock returns",""

This violation of no-arbitrage makes it impossible to illustrate the Black-Scholes delta hedging of an endowment of one call by an example containing only legally realizable transactions, and this causes confusion as to what delta hedging really does. Like Cox and Ross (1976), we model the short sale as having cash proceeds, and after including these, its instantaneous net value is zero. From this fact, delta hedging yields the risk-free rate of return on the option's opening value, for as long as required, in both discrete and continuous time. The terms of the Black-Scholes equation can be interpreted as inflows or outflows of cash, whose values are fixed at the time of hedging, and which risk-averse investors correctly price as risk-free even under the objective probability measure. The Cox and Ross model of no-arbitrage can be re-interpreted as a model of delta hedging, giving the same result, and we also use it to directly derive the Black-Scholes equation for risk neutral investors.","Black-Scholes equation; CAPM; Delta hedging; Risk neutral world",""

Using stock index and stock index futures from four European countries, we compare the hedging effectiveness of the GARCH error correction model with alternative hedging models that hold the OHR constant. Overall, in three out of four cases, the GARCH error correction model is shown to offer superior risk reduction compared with the competing models. Finally, we also estimate the OHRs using the GARCH-X model, which allows the error correction term to be a determinant of the time-varying volatility. The GARCH-X model performs similar to the GARCH error correction model.

The methods for computing EPS identified by the FASB (1996) are critically evaluated and an alternative measure, the holding period approach,is developed within the framework of contingent claims analysis. Two types of errors are shown to characterize the accounting measures of EPS. One arises from failure of accounting measures to fully recognize the contingent nature of the warrant. The other arises from the practice of not recognizing instances of anti-dilution. A further factor is the treatment of any difference between the proceeds from the issue of the warrants and their fair value at that time. This is ignored in existing measures and yet may have a significant effect on the value of the claims of ordinary shareholders on the company's earnings. Using a simulation method it is shown that the imputed earnings method of computing EPS is a very close approximation to the holding period method and is considerably more accurate than treasury stock measures favoured by accounting standards bodies.","Accounting standards; Contingent claims; Dilution; Earnings per share; Warrants",""

Third, one should not expect to consistently detect abnormal performance of less than about 1% (or perhaps even 2%), unless the sample contains primarily thickly traded stocks. Fourth, nonparametric tests are generally preferable to parametric tests of abnormal performance. Fifth, researchers should present separate results for thickly and thinly traded stock groups.

Specifically, interest rates exhibit non-stationary behavior following rate increases, but they are strongly mean reverting following rate decreases. The mean reverting component is statistically and economically stronger thus offsetting non-stationarity. Volatility depends on past innovations past volatility and the level of interest rates. With respect to past innovations volatility is asymmetric rising more in response to positive innovations.

We find that variance swap returns exhibit an option-like profile compared to returns of the underlying index. Given this pattern, it is crucial to account for the non-normality of returns in measuring the performance of variance swap investments. As in the US, the average returns of selling variance swaps are found to be strongly positive and too large to be compatible with standard equilibrium models. The magnitude of the estimated risk premium is related to variance uncertainty and past index returns. This indicates that the variance swap rate does not seem to incorporate all past information relevant for forecasting future realized variance.","Implied volatility; Smile; Variance swap; Volatility risk premium",""

First, we estimate traditional efficiency scores with stochastic cost and alternative profit frontier analysis. Then, we explicitly allow for different risk preferences and measure efficiency with a structural model based on utility maximization. Using the almost ideal demand system, we estimate input- and profit-demand functions to obtain proxies for expected return and risk. Efficiency is then measured in this risk-return space. Mean risk-return efficiency is somewhat higher than cost and considerably higher than profit efficiency (PE). More importantly, rank-order correlation between these measures are low or even negative. This suggests that best-practice institutes should not be identified on the basis of traditional efficiency measures alone. Apparently, low cost and/or PE may merely result from alternative yet efficiently chosen risk-return trade-offs.","Banks; Efficiency; Germany; Risk",""

While target liquidity improves as spread costs fall and quoted depths increase, acquirer liquidity falls continuously to successful offer completion. Due to increased trading differences, temporary trade costs fall more for targets than for acquirers. Permanent trade costs decline over the tender offer cycle for both parties, and especially for targets for cash tender offers and for acquirers for shares tender offers. The probability of informed trading declines (remains constant) for targets (acquirers) because increased trading intensity is greater (the same) for uninformed versus informed traders.

The method may be useful for other cases of singular points. The birth and death model gives lower option values than the geometric Brownian motion model, except at very low volatilities, so that if a firm incorrectly assumes a geometric Brownian motion process in place of a birth and death process, it will invest too seldom and too late.","Birth and death processes and Frobenius method; Real options",""

This paper develops a Monte Carlo method by exploiting the Markovian nature of the underlying value process. As a result, the Parisian option value can be written as an expression that can be solved by Monte Carlo integration, where the Parisian times are the random variables that need to be simulated. The Parisian times cannot be simulated directly as there exists no explicit distribution function. Therefore, these times are approximated by the simulation of hitting times in a special way. The quality of this approximation can be controlled and is a trade-off between accuracy and computation time.","Barrier option; Excursion; Hitting time; Monte Carlo; Parisian option",""

While previous research considered an external reference point of view analysing industry-wide aggregated data, little research, if any, has been directed at revealing the inside story of what influences the subjective perception of the risk framework the managers at a financial institution have to work under or whether managers consider incentives they receive to be satisfactory. This survey-based study analyses the answers of 120 fund managers from one of the world's largest banks to a set of questions designed to unveil the links between the objective and more subjective factors that contribute to the investment activity in the banking industry. This context is different from previous studies because information has been collected not only on objective characteristics such as age, size of portfolio, and size of incentives but also on whether investment decisions are based on subjective judgment or analytic tools and on the level of satisfaction with incentives and the bank's risk management system. This paper provides a methodology capable of exploring the links among the variables obtained from the interviews, graphical chain modelling, which offers an elegant solution to the problem caused by the sparsity of the data, testing with categorical ordinal variables, and model selection.

The alternative profit efficiency levels are found to be significantly lower relative to cost efficiency. According to the SFA, approximately one-third of banks' profits are lost to inefficiency, and almost one-half according to the DFA. The results of the second-stage regression analyses suggest that higher efficiency levels are associated with large and well-capitalized banks. The degree of competition has a positive influence on cost efficiency and a negative one on profit efficiency, while market concentration is negatively linked to efficiency.

We argue that the second effect is explained by the first. The extension at the end of the day allows some investors to postpone their trades, which results in occasional information cancellation or discovery; this mutes the effect of the extension on volume. In contrast, the extension at the start of the day allows some investors to accelerate trades, which precludes information cancellation or discovery and its negative effect on volume.

This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model.

However, accurately estimating beta-coefficients is not as straightforward as implicitly suggested by Sharpe's standard market model, i.e. simply using the ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. This is primarily because beta-coefficients cannot generally be assumed to be stable over time. In order to overcome this deficiency, we present and apply a non-parametric estimation technique that allows capturing this time effect and promises both more reliable estimates than obtained with an OLS regression as well as better manageability compared with the existing time-series approaches dealing with time-varying beta-coefficients.

Quadrature methods are expensive since the integrals must be evaluated at every point of the mesh. Though less so, Fourier methods are also computationally intensive since in order to avoid wrap around effects they require enlargement of the computational domain. They are also slow to converge when the parameters of the jump process are not smooth, and for efficiency require uniform meshes. We present a different and more efficient class of methods which are based on the fact that the integrals often satisfy differential equations.

Ex ante tests reveal significant arbitrage opportunities that could have been exploited up to 30min after they had been identified. All different tests employed indicate that the derivatives market was inefficient during its early trading history because arbitrage opportunities persisted even after other market impact costs were taken into consideration.","Cost of carry model; Market efficiency; Market frictions",""

Cross-market differences persist when they are regressed, in a panel GMM estimate, on various controls such as the number of individual forecasts and their standard deviation for any considered stock, with the latter being significantly lower in the US market.

In addition, the general level of competition is positively related with stock market development. Competition causes a decrease in the transaction costs and the cost of capital, driving more firms to list and more traders to trade.

This is an important contribution, since traditional panel data analysis adopted in previous studies suffers from serious heterogeneity bias problems. The empirical results obtained vary considerably among countries in the panel, thus highlighting the importance of using different measures of FSD rather than a single indicator. The evidence is rather inconclusive, although in most of the countries in the sample, a positive relationship between FSD and private savings seems to hold. The empirical analysis also suggests that a change in government savings is offset by an opposite change in private savings in most of the countries in the panel, thus confirming the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis.

We report that asset sales follow a period of declining operating returns and tend to occur in diversified companies with high levels of financial leverage. Stock prices respond positively to asset sale announcements. This arises due to improvements in operating returns and a decline in financial leverage and corporate diversification subsequent to the disposal. Our findings suggest that asset sales represent an effective operational response to a firm's poor financial condition. However, we also find that a manager's decision to sell assets is strongly influenced by the explicit threats to their control from lenders and competition from product, labour and takeover markets.","Asset sales; Corporate restructuring; Firm strategy; Managerial discipline; Operating performance",""

In line with earlier studies, we find evidence that corporate bond funds, on average, under-perform the benchmark portfolios. Moreover, there is not a single fund exhibiting a significantly positive performance. These results are robust to the different models. Finally, we examine the driving factors behind fund performance. As well as examining the influence of several fund characteristics, particularly fund age, asset value under management and management fee, we investigate the impact of investment style on the funds' risk-adjusted performance.

Monte Carlo investigation of the tick/volatility ratio provides convincing evidence that the pattern appears only if the tick/volatility ratio is above some threshold level. Since intraday returns have a ratio above the threshold value, they exhibit the pattern. On the other hand, the absence of the pattern in daily returns is due to the fact that the spot and futures currency returns examined have a ratio much smaller than the threshold value.

Including a memory effect eliminates the empirical shortcoming of discrete state models, namely that they produce a standard and an extreme state in stock returns. So far, this has prevented the regimes from being used as a valuable conditioning variable.

The market reaction also varies with firm size, with large companies tending to experience smaller responses to announcements than do smaller firms. Chung et al (1998) reported that the quality of a company's investment opportunities is the primary determinant of market reactions to capital expenditure decisions.

For seasonal commodities-such as electricity and natural gas-it is shown how to extract the seasonal component from the forward curve. The principal component indicator can then be applied to the de-seasoned forward curve to detect significant price deviations that may support profitable trading strategies.

Agents use these bonds to finance their consumption plans. The long-term bond is bought by agents with a long habitat.

Results suggest that the imposition of a limit on the volume of common stock favours the use of open market repurchases (OMRs) compared to other methods of repurchase such as tender offer repurchases (TORs) and Dutch auctions (DAs). The positive share abnormal returns around both announcements of open market buybacks and sellbacks in the full sample suggest that they are basically used to change the ownership structure of the firm in a consistent way with the convergence of interest hypothesis. The positive abnormal stock returns around open market repurchases, which are significantly different to the negative ones around sellbacks, when there are no changes in ownership structure also indicates the existence of a signalling and free cash flow effects.","Buybacks; Corporate control; Event study; Free cash flow; Sellbacks; Signalling",""

First, a classification of bonds into four different categories based on their degree of liquidity is proposed. Second, liquidity premia are estimated introducing liquidity parameters in the estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve. Results suggest the existence of a liquidity premium for post-benchmark bonds (both strippable and non-strippable). The size of this premium is relatively small. In the case of pre-benchmark bonds, the lack of liquidity does not seem to be priced. It is also shown that these pricing discrepancies are robust to the impact of taxes on bonds.","Benchmark; Bid-ask spread; Liquidity premium; Yield curve",""

The sample comprises data from 873 firms in France, Germany, Italy and the UK over the period from 1982 to 2002. The results support the hypotheses that more developed financial markets, greater efficiency of the legal system and better protection of shareholders all have a positive effect on the speed at which firms adjust their capital structure towards the target.

An original ten-factor composite performance model is applied that achieves very high significance levels. The analysis of performance indicates that most hedge funds significantly outperformed the market during the whole test period, mostly thanks to the bullish subperiod. In contrast, no significant underperformance of individual hedge funds strategies is observed when markets headed south. The analysis of persistence yields very similar results, with most of the predictability being found among middle performers during the bullish period. However, the 'Market Neutral' strategy represents a remarkable exception, as abnormal performance is sustained throughout and significant persistence can be found between the 20% and 69% best performers in this category, probably thanks to an extreme adaptability and a very active investment behaviour. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.","Abnormal returns; Bearish market; Bullish market; Funds of funds; Hedge funds; Persistence; Selection bias",""

The focus is on the empirical estimation of the factors underlying the volatility of the overnight interest rate and its transmission along the money market yield curve. Two sources of volatility are separated out, one related to the institutional features of the operational framework and payments system, and the other, related to the impact of policy decisions. A novel data set is used composed of hourly observations and covering several short-term interest rates. The sample runs from 4/12/2000 to 31/05/2002. Two common long-memory factors are found to drive the volatility processes. The first explains the long-memory dynamics of the shortest maturity. The other explains the transmission of volatility to other maturities. It is shown that announcements of interest rate changes exercise the strongest impact on the volatility of the shortest maturities. Persistent effects of liquidity shortages that are transmitted along the money market yield curve are documented.

Although there is a growing theoretical and empirical literature on liquidity effects in fixed income markets there is no clear answer to the questions how to measure liquidity and whether liquidity is priced in the market at all. The empirical analysis here is based on a unique data set containing individual bond data from six major EMU government bond markets, allowing one to compare yield curves estimated for subportfolios formed with respect to different potential liquidity measures. In a second procedure, liquidity measures are collected on the individual bond level and estimated pricing errors, given some reference yield curve, are regressed against these liquidity variables. This enables the conduction of formal tests on the pricing impact of liquidity measures. Results indicate that the benchmark property and the number of contributors are the most promising liquidity proxies having significant results in most countries. The results do not support the hypothesis that other liquidity measures under consideration, such as the on-the-run property, the issue size, and bid-ask spread related measures have a persistent price impact. A cross-country analysis of the subportfolio level indicates that liquidity effects cannot explain the size of the yield spreads between different issuers. This implies that effects other than liquidity, such as credit risk, are important driving factors of cross-country yield spreads.","Cross-country analysis; EMU; Government bonds; Liquidity; Price impact",""

The method overcomes the standard difficulty encountered in developing high-order accurate finite difference schemes for valuing American options; that is, the lack of smoothness in the option price at the critical boundary. This is done by making special corrections to the right-hand side of the differnce equations near the boundary, so they retain their level of accuracy. These corrections are easily evaluated using estimates of the boundary location and jump in the gamma that occurs there, such as those developed by Carr and Eaguet. Results of numerical experiments are presented comparing the method with more standard finite difference methods.","American options; Finite difference method",""

With a utility function that displays risk-aversion as well as risk-loving behaviour over its domain, it is demonstrated that the expected return-win probability frontier is not monotonic as has been hitherto tacitly assumed. This provides a consistent explanation for both the usual favourite-longshot bias and also for the few examples where a reverse bias has been observed. Pooled data supports the thesis that the frontier is not completely monotonic but does indeed have a turning point.","Betting markets; Reverse bias; Risk-return frontier",""

The positive aspects of the announcement only appear for a company with a low likelihood of being taken over, and with a low risk of minority shareholder expropriation. Specifically, stock repurchase programmes are good news when the firm is supported by foreign institutional investors, and in the case of controlled firms, when the firm has a second large shareholder, which guarantees an effective balance of power for the controlling shareholders.","Open market share repurchases; Ownership structure; Undervaluation",""

It shows that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, it is possible for the yield spread (callable minus non-callable) to be negative. It also identifies the key determinants of the yield spread. Next, it shows that the optimal default trigger for non-callable debt is higher than the trigger for callable debt, resulting in additional default-related costs. Thus, the use of non-callable debt gives rise to an indirect agency cost of early default, which is the difference in total firm value with callable and non-callable debt. This agency cost provides a rationale for the existence of callable debt. By examining the determinants of the magnitude of this agency cost, the conditions that make callable debt more attractive (to the issuing firm) relative to non-callable debt are identified. This allows certain predictions to be made regarding the likelihood of a call feature in a corporate bond. The model's implications are supported by existing empirical studies.","Agency cost; Callable debt yield spread; Default policy",""

Volatility is defined as within-month standard deviation of continuously compounded daily returns on the stock market index of each country for the ten-year period 1988 to 1997. The first half of the sample is retained for the estimation of parameters while the second half is for the forecast period. The following models are employed: a random walk model, a historical mean model, moving average models, weighted moving average models, exponentially weighted moving average models, an exponential smoothing model, a regression model, an ARCH model, a GARCH model, a GJR-GARCH model, and an EGARCH model. First, standard (symmetric) loss functions are used to evaluate the performance of the competing models: mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. According to all of these standard loss functions, the exponential smoothing model provides superior forecasts of volatility. On the other hand, ARCH-based models generally prove to be the worst forecasting models. Asymmetric loss functions are employed to penalize under-/over-prediction. When under-predictions are penalized more heavily, ARCH-type models provide the best forecasts while the random walk is worst. However, when over-predictions of volatility are penalized more heavily, the exponential smoothing model performs best while the ARCH-type models are now universally found to be inferior forecasters.","Forecast evaluation; Forecasting; Stock market volatility",""

The approach offers two major innovations. First, it frees the researcher from the necessity of having to make an ad hoc judgment call regarding which firms feature entrenched owners and which dont. Under this approach, the main shareholder becomes entrenched when the Shapley Value (SV) of his voting rights crosses an unknown threshold that is estimated jointly with the other model parameters. This approach allows one to perform a test on the joint hypotheses that the incentive to expropriate held by the dominant shareholder impacts negatively the market performance of the firm if the main shareholder is entrenched but produces no impact otherwise. Secondly, it generates a market-based estimate of the critical level of power at which the main shareholder becomes entrenched. The method is applied to a sample of European firms and a threshold equal to 0.34 is estimated. Most firms from the UK have a main shareholder with a SV below the estimated threshold; in contrast, about half of the continental firms in the sample feature main shareholders whose power index is above the estimated threshold. A negative relationship is found between the incentive to expropriate and corporate valuation above the threshold, that is both statistically and economically significant; below the threshold, we find no evidence of a relationship.","Control; Dominant shareholder; Market performance; Ownership; Shapley Value",""

There is an inverse relationship between volatility and autocorrelation consistent with the findings from several other stock markets, including the US. This pattern could be the manifestation of a certain form of noise trading namely positive feedback trading or, momentum trading strategies. There is little evidence that market declines are followed with higher volatility than market advances, the so-called 'leverage effect', that has been observed in almost all developed stock markets. In out of sample forecasts, the nonlinear specifications provide better results in terms of forecasting both first and second moments of the distribution of returns.","Cyprus Stock Exchange; EGARCH; Exponential autoregression; Forecasting; GED; Positive feedback trading; Stock return dynamics",""

However, although information asymmetries are more severe in emerging than in developed countries, corporate ratings bestow lower information content in the former. This is a problem since deserving corporations that are based in emerging countries require that the suitable rating they receive by a major RA - indispensable for them to issue debt in developed capital markets - be a credible signal to investors. Among the possible explanations, it is conjectured that this unsatisfactory situation might result from RAs not investing enough in collecting information on emerging countries' corporations. Here, an indicator is used of RAs' effort to gather information and test econometrically whether - controlling for both sovereign ratings and the corporate performance indicators used by RAs - higher effort affects corporate ratings. A negative relationship between RAs' effort and corporate ratings is found in developed countries whereas the relationship is positive in emerging countries. While the result for developed countries is coherent with the hypothesis that RAs raise their effort vis-à-vis problematic corporations, the result for emerging countries is inconsistent with such hypothesis. This evidence suggests that inducing RAs to raise their effort is desirable for corporations in emerging countries. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","Corporate credit ratings; Credit risk; Sovereign risk",""

Often the investment style is assumed to be constant through time. Alternatively, time variation is sometimes implicitly accounted for by using rolling regressions when estimating the style exposures. The former assumption is often contradicted empirically, and the latter is inefficient due to its ad hoc chosen window size. Here, the Kalman filter is used to model time-varying exposures of mutual funds explicitly. This leads to a testable model and more efficient use of the data, which reduces the influence of spurious correlation between mutual fund returns and style indices. Several stylized examples indicate that more reliable style estimates can be obtained by modelling the style exposure as a random walk, and estimating the coefficients with the Kalman filter. The differences with traditional techniques are substantial in these stylized examples. The results from the empirical analyses indicate that the structural model estimated by the Kalman filter improves style predictions and influences results on performance measurement. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Dynamic models; Kalman filter; Mutual funds; Style analysis",""

This paper therefore attempts to test the rent extraction hypothesis by relating the firm's dividend payout ratio to various ownership variables, which measure the degree of concentration in terms of the voting rights of large shareholders. The hypothesis that other non-controlling large shareholders may have incentives to monitor the largest shareholder is also tested. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that firms make lower dividend payouts as the voting rights of the largest shareholder increase.

This paper examines whether alternative models better explaining the empirical dynamics of the foreign exchange futures markets can yield implied volatility surfaces similar to those observed for options on Foreign Exchange futures. The most suitable alternative models include jumps and stochastic volatility. The inclusion of both these factors introduces unspanned sources of risk and therefore, the martingale measure will not necessarily be unique. However, it is not the objective of this research to propose which martingale measure is optimal; the aim, instead, is to gain a deeper understanding of the properties (and particularly the order of magnitude) of the risk premium. This is done by choosing a feasible martingale measure (based upon the no arbitrage condition), assuming no market price of jump or stochastic volatility risks, and price options under this measure. The implied volatility biases from model-based option prices are then compared to the actual implied volatility surfaces for options on these markets. The systematic and substantive differences that are found suggest a negative risk premium, which is a relatively more important (and universal) component in FX option pricing than previously reported. Furthermore, it appears that the relative risk premium across strike price and time is similar across four foreign exchange options markets. This may imply that some systematic mechanism causes the risk premium in these markets. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Implied volatility smiles; Methods of moments estimation; Normal inverse Gaussian distributions; Stochastic volatility",""

Standard tests of non-linear dependence give strong evidence for the presence of non-linearity in raw returns. Modelling non-linear dependence must distinguish between models that are non-linear in mean and hence depart from the Martingale hypothesis, and models that are non-linear in variance and hence depart from independence but not from the Martingale hypothesis. Therefore, three non-linear models of asset returns are formulated applying ARMA-GARCH specifications for the conditional mean and variance equations. The paper goes on to answer which model has the necessary characteristics that are sufficient to account for most of the non-linear dependence. In the Norwegian equity market most of the non-linear dependence seems to be conditional heteroscedasticity. However, the most thinly traded assets still report significant non-linear dependence for all non-linear specifications. These results imply that the independence hypothesis can be rejected for all assets, portfolios and indices. Moreover, for thinly traded assets the Martingale hypothesis can also be rejected. The economic implications from the unconditional distributions of thinly traded assets are therefore very difficult to interpret and are unfamiliar territory for those who are accustomed to thinking analytically, intuitively and linearly. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","ARMA-ARCH/GARCH; Conditional heteroscedasticity; Non-linear test statistic; Non-linearity; Trading/non-trading",""

The paper contributes to prior studies by, first, focusing on exporters to ensure that the companies in the sample have FX exposure, thereby allowing a more rigorous test of the theoretical determinants of hedging, and, secondly, in contrast to most previous studies that have focused on FX external hedging instruments, the use of both internal and external instruments is examined. Univariate, multivariate and multinominal analyses all provide evidence consistent with the firm value maximization hypotheses of underinvestment and risk aversion. Also, the following characteristics of firms - size, extent of internationalization and liquidity - are found to be related to the decision to hedge FX risk. However, the evidence on the links between the firm characteristics and the decision to hedge is not consistent across internal and external FX hedgers, and also varies for individual hedging instruments. Therefore it is argued that the empirical evidence on the theoretical determinants cannot be generalized to cover the full range of FX hedging strategies (which includes internal hedging instruments). Unlike empirical studies for other countries the evidence for Norwegian firms does not support the hypothesis that the avoidance of financial distress and the need to resort to external capital markets is a significant determinant of the hedging decision. Whilst the evidence suggests that country-specific factors may play a role in determining the use of FX hedging, it does not imply that the different policies adopted are necessarily-inconsistent with the firm value maximization hypothesis.","Exporters; Firm value; Hedging; Internal and external; Theoretical determinants",""

As well as using traditional mean variance, the paper constructs the hedge funds using portfolio selection methods that incorporate skewness in the optimisation process.

Efforts in modelling the former have resulted in development of the ARCH-family models. There is, however, less evidence on nonlinearity in the mean of financial time series. One family of models that is applied in finance is the STAR. In this paper some nonlinear modelling techniques are applied to a Finnish financial time series, the daily Banking and Finance branch index on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The techniques include a variance-nonlinear model from the ARCH family, a mean-nonlinear model, namely Smooth Transition Autoregression (STAR)-model and a neural network.

The subjects performed better than a random walk forecaster, but worse than the random walk with constant drift and first-order autoregressive models. Composite human judgement, however, not only improved on individual judgement but, also, surpassed the simple statistical models in many instances. Possible explanations are offered for these results, suggestions are made for future research, and practical implications are emphasized.","Exchange rate movements; Forecasting; Judgement; Probability",""

Evidence is found of a leverage effect and of higher variance during weekends. In both in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons SV models outperform GARCH models.

This research offers one answer to two of the questions raised by the anomalous behaviour of the residuals. The first is the failure of cumulative abnormal residuals (CARs) to be centred at zero and normally or t distributed. The second is the failure of CARs to be homoscedastic. The authors argue that, in some cases, a bimodal distribution fits the data better. During the period 1985-1993 there were 47 Helsinki Exchanges listed firms having at least one bimodal return distribution after the publication of an interim report. This frequency represents 76% of the total number of firms observed. Bimodality occurs most prominently during the first few days after the event. Internal factors, contained in the interim reports, and external factors, available exogenously, help explain the uncertainty that gives rise to expost bimodality. Sometimes bimodality disappears during the investigation period, while at other times bimodality remains. These findings should promote the use of more sophisticated methods for non-normal return distributions and longer examination periods after the event. On the practical side, these results should help managers refine their communication practices.","Bimodal distribution; Interim reports; Voluntary disclosure",""

While these models work well for non-financial firms they are usually not very successful in capturing the financial strength of banks. As an answer to this, Hall and Miles suggest a simple approach of estimating bank failure probabilities based solely on their stock prices. This paper suggests an extension to the Hall and Miles model using extreme value theory and applies the extended model to the Swedish banking sector around the banking crisis of the early 1990s. The extended model captures very well the increased likelihood of a systemic banking sector failure around the peak of the crisis and it produces default probabilities that are more stable, more realistic and more consistent with Moody's and Fitch rating implied default rates than probabilities from the original Hall and Miles model.","Banking sector failure; Default risk; Extreme value theory",""

The negative reaction to announcements is well documented and the evidence suggests it is more due to an issue being a signal of overvaluation than to inelastic demand. Other findings are less well understood. The shares of issuers underperform appreciably in the long term, and there is evidence that market receptiveness to new issues varies. Companies tend to choose the most expensive method of issue both in terms of direct costs and negative market reaction.

The results suggest that the cost of capital calculation is subject to wide variation across firms, both with regard to the overall figure and the precise computation of its components. The intuitive appeal of the WACC and CAPM approaches appears to ensure their continued popularity in the real world. However, firms tend not to make all of the adjustments to the overall figure which academics might expect, only making simple adjustments for risk and the tax advantage to debt. The after-tax money cost of capital which is approximately 10%, is Influenced by the choice of method, and firms do not appear to revise their overall cost figure rapidly in response to the environment.

We demonstrate how the efficiency of lattice techniques such as the binomial model can be analysed in terms of their computational cost.

For the multivariate case, the most efficient method depends on the computational cost of the early exercise test. However, for typical problems, the most efficient method is the standard step-back method: that is, performing the early exercise test at each time step. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The analysis concentrates on the so-called long-memory property which is examined using, various alternative test procedures. This analysis makes use of relatively long monthly Finnish time series which cover the period 1922–1996. The results give some evidence on long memory but one cannot say that the results would overwhelmingly support the existence of long memory in Finnish time series. There are, however, considerable differences between variables and the results are quite sensitive in terms of the treatment of short memory which also applies to different ways of prefiltering the data. Clearly more work is required to obtain more affirmative results in this respect. One way, of doing that is to apply asymmetric time models to find the source of nonlinearity. When that is done with the Finnish data some weak evidence on asymmetry is obtained. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Long Memory Forecasting Nonlinear Models",""

The underlying sales upon which VAT is based is modelled by a geometric Brownian motion. By contrast the timing of a VAT rate change, consitent with a negative exponential distribution, implies a Poisson jump if and when the VAT rate changes. By combining the geometric Brownian motion with a Poisson jump, a model is developed which requires the solution to a second-order ordinary differential equation. This provides a frmework to quantify the effects of VAT risk upon firm values.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate on the necessity for formal legal status to be sustained in the market for bond credit ratings. In this context, the criteria for a credible rating agency are examined and evidence is provided on one element of the criteria which is under-researched: namely, the impact of the ratings in the market place. The influence of rating agencies in international capital markets is assessed through an analysis of the impact of ratings on the yields of bonds, represented by a comprehensive sample of actively traded debt. The sample contains analysis of ratings introductions on both new and seasoned debt and also examines the impact of ratings revisions. It is concluded that official recognition has no market-based role and it is argued that ratings are used by regulators because of the success of the major agencies in performing their market function. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Credit Ratings Credit Agencies Formal Legal Status Impact On Yields Of Bonds",""

The debate as to whether beta is a valid measure of risk was reanimated by Fama and French and subsequent studies. Rather than focusing on exogenous variables that have a larger explanatory power than an asset's beta in cross-sectional tests, the matrix of variances-covariances is assumed to follow a time varying ARCH process. Using monthly data from the UK market from February 1975 to December 1996, the cross-sectional return-risk relations obtained with an unconditional specification for assets' betas are compared to those obtained when the estimated betas are based on an ARCH model. The approach taken by Pettengill, Sundaram and Mathur, which allows a negative cross sectional return-risk relation in periods in which the market portfolio yields a negative return relative to the risk free rate, was also investigated. These tests are also carried out on samples pertaining to a specific month and on samples from which a particular month is removed. Results suggest that the CAPM holds better in down-ward moving markets than in upward moving markets hence beta is a more appropriate measure of risk in bear markets.","CAPM; QTARCH; Return-risk relation; UK market",""

The model features transition probabilities that are functions of the basis.

Conditional on regimes, GARCH persistence is significantly reduced. Out-of-sample tests show that incorporating regime shifts improves the accuracy of short-term volatility forecasts.","Conditional volatility; Crude oil futures; Forecasting; GARCH persistence; Regime switching",""

The study demonstrates first that no systematic relationships exist between the market response to NFAs and pre-announcement insider trading. Second, contrary to the predictions of John and Mishra (1990), the values of growth indicators do not differ significantly between firms that are subject to insider buying and selling prior to NFAs. Third, while there is some evidence to suggest that insider trading and growth prospects influence the market reaction to debt issue announcements, the evidence is not pervasive across growth measures and does not extend to equity issues. This final result helps to resolve an apparent contradiction between the signalling models of John and Mishra (1990), and John and Lang (1991), and suggests that prior studies of the market reaction to NFAs are not significantly flawed by their failure to consider the signalling role of pre-announcement insider trading. The findings are also shown to be relevant to the current debate about whether, and how, insider trading regulations should be tightened.","",""

Since competition among banks will increase, it is important to identify the most efficient banking system able to play a role in that market. A parametric approach is adopted, based on the estimation of a stochastic cost frontier. This methodology enables one to measure X-inefficiency and to model it as a function of environmental variables which may influence firms' efficiency. By means of this analysis it is possible to identify the most efficient banking systems and to focus on the determinants of deviations from cost minimizing. The analysis highlights significant efficiency gaps among the performances of banks in different countries and of different institutional types. In particular, it is found that the Mittel-European model is the one that operates closest to the efficient frontier. This may indicate that, compared with separated banks, the universal banking system allows for production plans which come closer to the optimal frontier. The analysis suggests that, at the beginning of European Monetary Union, national barriers and regulatory frameworks are still responsible for deviation from the efficient frontiers. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Banking Systems; Cost Efficiency; Productivity; Stochastic Cost Frontier; Technical Efficiency",""

The decomposition improves the interpretation of security performance. The methodology is demonstrated on the security performance of bidding firms listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The most surprising finding is that the long-run abnormal return after three years is not significantly different from zero. This implies that the bidding firms do not under-perform relative to the market. This result stands in contrast to findings in other studies and it may reflect that earlier studies do not adjust correctly for the volatility component. These current findings indicate that the market efficiency hypothesis is intact in the long run.

Differences in price reactions and the accompanying trading volumes are tested as the investor mix changes and small investors enter ISE due to the cultivating of awareness about the stock market. Other possible causes of excess returns such as prior knowledge about the stocks being traded or a preferred trading range are also tested. Considering the characteristics of thinly traded emerging markets, non-parametric tests are employed besides traditional event study methodology and results are immune to the choice of relevant test statistics. The results indicate that the changing mix of investors shift the timing of market reaction from announcement to implementation of stock dividends and rights offerings. Since individual investors, who are attracted by lower relative prices, are not expected to be prompt in timing, excess returns persist over longer event windows and are accompanied by increasing trading volumes.","Event study; Rank test; Rights offerings; Sign test; Stock dividends",""

This paper provides a descriptive analysis of the derivative practices of UK non-financial institutions, and attempts to evaluate whether these practices are consistent with value maximizing behaviour. Starting from the basic Modigliani and Miller Capital Structure proposition, more recent academic works on the subject are reviewed and analysed in the light of market imperfections. Unlike previously published UK based research, this study encompasses a broad spectrum of both derivative instruments and companies surveyed, and offers a wider picture of derivative activity. The paper starts with an analysis of potential benefits and pitfalls of derivative instruments in risk management. The results of a survey, sent to 629 of the 637 corporates listed in the FTSE actuaries as of 1 April 1998 are discussed and compared to existing surveys which report mainly from North American markets. As a whole, the derivatives activity of UK corporates appears to be fairly similar to that of Canadian and US firms, but is still limited in view of the potential benefits that can be derived from their use in risk management. Small firms in particular do not seem to take advantage of the products available to manage their exposure to financial price risks, and initial findings suggest that this is because of a lack of knowledge in derivatives. The results support a positive relationship between derivative usage and firm size and a strong positive correlation between interest rate derivatives usage and firm size. Results also confirm that a significant proportion of firms appear to take unnecessary chances on financial markets using derivatives, although as expected, UK corporates do not use equity derivatives. Finally, although large firms seem to have adopted fairly consistent practices towards derivatives' risk management; smaller firms have a far less consistent approach. Indeed, a significant number of them also do not appear to report their activity to the board of directors, and/or do not have a policy covering the use of these instruments.","Derivatives; Hedging; Risk management",""

To investigate the evidence for such models in the Portuguese stock market ten stock indexes were created. This is a pioneer study of the Portuguese stock market, and uses nominal, real and excess returns, computed for longer horizons. Three methodologies were used: variance ratios, ordinary least squares regressions and weighted least squares regressions.

The evidence is mixed, as the presence of tendencies towards mean aversion and mean reversion were detected. Results also show that the evidence is very sensitive to the methodology used and the signifcance tests performed.

In the same way they have attempted to reduce costs associated with the monitoring and collection of bad debts. Failure to monitor debt recoveries adequately, however, can lead to further pressure on profits. This paper uses a case study approach to outline key strategies adopted by two major banks in respect of formal insolvency, the ‘tip’ of a considerable debt recovery ‘iceberg’. The paper illustrates the reactions and changing administrative practices of banks, as unsecured creditors, and draws on empirical research that has charted the effect of the Insolvency Act 1986 as regards individual debtors. The collection of bad debts presents banks with risks, heightened by adverse selection and moral hazard problems greater than those applicable to credit risk assessment.

However, the reason for this remains unclear. Before the development of theory to explain this phenomenon, it may be helpful to better understand the empirical record of implied volatility surfaces. If regularities are discovered which are stable over time, this may aid the development of theories to explain implied volatility surfaces and provide a means to test alternative models. This paper identifies these regularities and subsequent research will examine the implications of these results. While a number of papers have examined individual option markets and identified smile patterns, it is not clear whether the conclusions found are based upon idiosyncrasies of a particular market or more generally apply to options in other markets. This research fills this gap in the literature by examining sixteen options markets on financial futures (comprising four asset classes) and compares the smile patterns across markets. Furthermore, this analysis considers a longer period of analysis than previously examined in the literature. This allows assessment of the stability of the implied volatility patterns for a variety of subperiods and testing of models outside of sample. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Implied Volatility Surfaces Volatility Smiles Shocks Risk Neutral Processes Skewness Kurtosis Heterokurtosis",""

Empirical evidence is presented that in the Spanish Stock Market the main motive for acquiring a holding is similar to synergy, especially in partial acquisitions with positive total gains. However, in the samples with negative total gains a main motive similar to hubris always appears. The analysis takes into account the size of the investment and distinguishes between the first report and subsequent ones.

The paper reports investigations into the use of alternative means of financing. More specifically, the use of trade credit and factoring are examined. Indeed, following the trade credit management literature both institutional and macro economic restrictions on small business finance can be overcome by ‘larger suppliers’ extending trade credit to their smaller customers. However, the DSO-rate cannot be used to measure the supplier's willingness to invest in trade credit as it depends on both suppliers' and customers' characteristics. The decision to extend trade credit is therefore approximated by the will to control its management and operationalized by the decision to factor or not to factor. The results of our study are twofold. First, factoring is mainly used by small and medium-sized companies. Moreover, when looking at the characteristics of the factor's customers, new companies facing huge capital expenditure programmes and seasonal sales decide to factor. The prejudice about factoring being a last resort means of finance is, however, not supported: companies that decide to use factoring are indeed less profitable, but this is simply due to their high growth and/or capital intensive investment programmes. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Belgium; Factoring; New Business Finance; Small Business Finance; Trade Credit",""

This research extends an earlier study by Gazely and Binner by examining the theory that rapid financial innovation, particularly during the financial liberalization of the 1980s, has been responsible for the poor performance of conventional simple sum monetary aggregates. The Divisia index is adjusted in two ways to allow for the major financial innovations that Taiwan has experienced since the 1970s. The technique of neural networks is used to allow a completely flexible mapping of the variables and a greater variety of functional form than is currently achievable using conventional econometric techniques. Results suggest that superior tracking of inflation is possible for networks that employ a Divisia M2 measure of money that has been adjusted to incorporate a learning mechanism to allow individuals to gradually alter their perceptions of the increased productivity of money.

Since volume is affected also by within-the-day price movements and hence is not weakly exogenous relative to returns, alternative proxies for trading activities are suggested.

The EMM construction shows that a classical discrete time stochastic volatility model is rejected. An extended model incorporating an asymmetric volatility specification validates all the moment scores.

In particular, investigations were made of the consistency in the sign and direction of discretionary accounting techniques and qualitative earnings forecasts. Long-run forecasts are defined, for the purposes of this paper, as forecasts made at least seven months before the year-end. Although not mandatory, qualitative forecasts are released by well over 60% of the listed companies in the Netherlands. Empirical results indicate that there is consistency in the sign and direction of qualitative earnings forecasts and discretionary accounting. After adopting discretionary accounting, the forecast errors are reduced if the company can reach the management earnings forecast (target). In the event that reserves are insufficient to accomplish this goal, managers choose their next best option and take an earnings bath in order to maximize reserves available for future use. By partitioning the sample in various sub-sets it is shown that earnings management and forecast errors occur most in the extreme ranges of financial performance. Overall, the study shows that management engages in discretionary accounting to present results in line with the disclosed qualitative earnings forecasts in their directors' reports. Whilst discretionary accounting may clearly improve the consistency of companies' earnings forecasts released via the directors' reports and the actual earnings, managers' earnings forecasts are sometimes disclosed in anticipation of planned discretionary accounting actions.","Discretionary accounting and qualitative management earnings forecasts; Forecasting earnings",""

On the other side, it must be stressed that previous benefits can be achieved at the risk of introducing parameter heterogeneity into the area-wide relationship.

The comparison shows that the area-wide money demand is more smooth and less subject to shocks than the single-country ones.

Unlike previous studies, this one concentrates on long maturities, investigating three to ten-year assets, and employing swap rates as a means of covering foreign exchange risk. Although CIP has not been previously assessed for EU long-term interest rates, such evaluation has practical interest. In fact, given EU member states' scarcity of mechanisms to react to asymmetric shocks, financial markets may become one major source of adjustment and stabilization. To this end, it is the mobility of long-term capital that is of critical importance. The analysis in this paper suggests that long-term financial flows appear to be completely unrestrained only between domestic Dutch and German markets.","Capital mobility; Covered interest parity; Financial integration",""

Findings indicate that banks can create an asset securitization pipeline structure that enables them to increase their return on capital. In other words, through securitization banks can expand their loan provision business without increasing their liabilities or their capital levels. Using a contingent claims model, four factors that impact on the bank's decision to securitize are highlighted and analysed: (i) the level of deposit insurance; (ii) capital adequacy requirements; (iii) insolvency risk; and, (iv) the risk of credit enhancements. Furthermore, we identify key accounting and regulatory challenges that emerge for banks from the process of asset backed securitization. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Asset-BACKED Securitization Return On Capital Deposit Insurance Capital Adequacy",""

Price discovery was inefficient when the presence of insiders was disguised, compared to a homogeneous expectations baseline. When the presence of insiders was revealed observed prices became efficient with respect to bad news but not with respect to good news, possibly suggesting loss-averse behaviour. With free communication there was a decrease in both efficiency and price volatility - insider information was masked by noise. Price formation under these conditions was similar to baseline, but with weak evidence of speculative pricing. It is conjectured that other factors than informational noise may be necessary determinants of herd behaviour, but further work is indicated.","Asymmetric information; Experimental markets; Limitation; Rumour",""

The hypothesis under examination is whether there is any value-added in estimating minimum spread ratios based on intraday data. Three spread ratios are defined: two ratios calculated from daily data and a third one based on intraday data. Evidence tends to indicate that spread ratios calculated from intraday data exhibit a substantially lower variance than the other two spread ratio speciications. Thus, it is shown that intraday data, in comparison with daily data, allow for lower hedging costs.

In a partial equilibrium setting, the objective of the institutional investor is modelled as the maximization of expected utility (an increasing and concave function, in order to accommodate risk aversion) of final wealth minus a benchmark. In equilibrium this optimal strategy gives rise to the two-beta CAPM: together with the market beta a new risk-factor (termed active management risk) is brought into the analysis. This new beta is defined as the normalized (to the benchmark's variance) covariance between the asset excess return and the excess return of the market over the benchmark index. The empirical test supports the model's predictions. The cross-section return on the active management risk is positive and significant, especially after 1990, when institutional investors became the representative agent of the market.","Asset pricing; Benchmark portfolio; Relative performance",""

For the bond market too, it is future return news - not inflation news - that moves bond returns most. For finite investment horizons, however, asset market movements give a differential importance to the various news components. Results are comparable for the US and the Euro area, but differ in terms of magnitudes. In addition, sensitivities ('betas') to a set of state variables are estimated, yielding high interest rate betas and low money growth betas.

The combinations of model and estimation method are first evaluated in terms of their forecasting performance for the components mentioned for the individual assets.

Finally, an algebraic transformation converts these multilateral equilibrium real rates into bilateral equilibrium nominal rates.

In order to achieve this aim, an area-wide model is analysed. The aggregation is motivated by the fact that the Euro-zone is under a single monetary policy. Furthermore, a more parsimonious parametric model enables one to consider an important source of non-stationarity given by the presence of structural breaks using the multivariate cointegration analysis. Against the Meese-Rogoff critique, the out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts using actual values of the exogenous produced by the estimated VECM are reasonably satisfactory. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Area-WIDE Model; Cointegration; Forecasting; Real Exchange Rates; Structural Breaks",""

Basic performance is measured by the average cross-sectional correlation over time between the 55 forecasted returns and the realized returns across industries. Since investors and asset managers typically want a steady performance over time, the volatility of this cross-sectional correlation is further taken into account in an adaptation of the Sharpe Ratio. Strong evidence is found in favour of certain macroeconomic factors as dominant industry return predictors, and some two-stage models based either purely on OLS or a mix between OLS and the non-linear model can lift both cross-sectional forecasting correlation and Sharpe Ratio. However, viewed overall in relation to the benchmark OLS model, performance is not consistently improved by any particular model.","Forecasting; Nearest neighbour algorithm; OLS Industry returns",""

The German term structure appears to forecast future short-term interest rates surprisingly well, compared with previous studies with US data, while it has lower predictive power for long-term interest rates. However, the direction suggested by the coefficient estimates is consistent with that implied by the EH, that is when the term spread widens, long rates increase. The use of instrumental variables to deal with possible measurement errors in the data significantly improves regressions for the long rates. Moreover, re-estimation with proxy variables to account for the possibility of time-varying term premia confirms that the evolution of both short and long rates corresponds to the predictions of the EH and that most of the information is in the term spread. These results are important as they suggest that monetary policy in Germany could be guided by the slope of the term structure. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Expectations Hypothesis; Forward Rates; Interest Rate; Measurement Errors; Term Premia; Term Structure; Volatility",""

Various authors have argued that security returns are not homoskedastic but exhibit variation over time. They have observed that large changes tend be followed by more large changes in either direction, and so volatility must be predictably high after large changes. This phenomenon of securities' volatility, referred to as clustering, has important implications for security pricing and risk management. Among the most popular techniques currently used to capture the clustering effect and to forecast future volatilityare those belonging to the family of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) models. The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether such volatility modelling can be used to capture the time variation not only in the total risk of a security return but also its systematic and unsystematic components. Using weekly local stock market data, the time varying beta with the World Index has been estimated via a bivariate GARCH-M model. The GARCH-M parameterization used here is a dynamic specification of the SIM. The hypothesis that this dynamic specification holds cannot be rejected for 11 out of 13 local portfolios. The results provide evidence that both the systematic and the non-systematic counterparts are also changing over time. However, in some markets those risk changes may take place with some delay. This suggests that some of the low correlation coefficients computed for certain stock market returns may not be due to differences in business cycles among those countries, but may be caused by the non-synchronous response to world market developments. This finding should have important implications in many investment decisions such as portfolio selection, market timing and risk hedging. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Whether these external capital market pressures actually exist or not, short-term pressures on firms are influenced by managers' own perceptions of these external pressures. If managers perceive the existence of these external pressures it is likely that this will lead to shortterm behaviour on their part. The purpose of this paper is therefore to examine (a) research and development (R&D) managers' perceptions of short-term behaviour in capital markets in the UK, and (b) patterns of behaviour relating to R&D which may be influenced by these perceptions. The findings of this study indicate that approximately half of the UK research and development managers perceive capital markets as responsible for putting inappropriate short-term pressures on their companies' manage ment. However, an even larger proportion report short-termist behaviour relating to R&D and its evaluation, suggesting that some at least of the problem of ‘short-termism’ is internally generated. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

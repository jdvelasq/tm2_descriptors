"Systematic investigation of the logistics service quality of cross-border e-commerce: a mixed-methods perspective","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169681102&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2023-0203&partnerID=40&md5=02483ae373f1cbe4485cd9724edb297b","Purpose: This study explores the factors that characterize the logistics service quality (LSQ) of cross-border e-commerce and identifies the different relationships between these factors with respect to customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: The study applied a two-stage mixed-methods design. The first stage (Stage 1) was a qualitative study of 3,000 reviews from the Amazon China e-commerce platform. The second stage (Stage 2) included a quantitative study that analyzed survey data from 590 Chinese cross-border e-commerce customers using the Kano model. Findings: Stage 1 involved developing a conceptual framework for the LSQ of cross-border e-commerce, including six dimensions: timeliness, safety, reliability, economy, personnel contact quality and information quality. In Stage 2, the study found that only reliability and personnel contact quality indicators are linearly related to customer satisfaction. Timeliness and the safety of packaging greatly contribute to customer satisfaction, but do not cause dissatisfaction when unfulfilled. Economics and information quality indicators, and the safety of goods, are basic requirements that tend to provoke customer dissatisfaction when unmet, but do not increase customer satisfaction when they are met. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to construct a conceptual model of LSQ that applies to cross-border e-commerce and to identify the instrumental nature of various LSQ attributes and their impact on improved customer satisfaction. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cross-border logistics; Customer satisfaction; Kano model; Logistics service quality of cross-border e-commerce",""
"Impacts of information asymmetry on users' payment rates: evidence from trading data of Chinese knowledge payment platform","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179959439&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2023-0766&partnerID=40&md5=4c2d00e5d5c22ed9812837afa6953052","Purpose: This paper aims to clarify the impact of information asymmetry on users' payment rates and examine the role of perceived uncertainty (PU) and acceptable price (AP) in the relationship between information asymmetry and users' payment rates. Design/methodology/approach: To test the influences of information asymmetry on users' payment rates, this paper collects 18,489 transaction data from the Chinese knowledge payment platform Zhihu with a Python crawler. This paper constructs a mediation model to define the relationship between information asymmetry and users' payment rates by introducing PU and AP as the mediators. Findings: Information asymmetry negatively affects users' payment rates. In addition, PU and AP mediate the information asymmetry in users' payment rates bond. Research limitations/implications: This study only explores the mediators of the information asymmetry users’ payment rates bond, ignoring the effect of potential moderators, which would be an important direction for future research. Practical implications: The findings of this paper suggest that information communication is essential in knowledge market transactions. Knowledge providers, as well as knowledge platforms, should enhance information exchange with consumers in order to increase product sales. Social implications: This paper provides a new perspective for understanding how information asymmetry affects users' payment rates and helps to guide suppliers to improve product quality. The research framework of this paper is universal to a certain extent. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to propose using PU and AP to construct a mediation model to study the information asymmetry between users' payment rates relationship. It provides a new perspective for understanding the channel of information asymmetry in customer behavior. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acceptable price; Information asymmetry; Perceived uncertainty; Users' payment rates",""
"The effect of self-construal on solo dining intentions: an empirical study of Chinese consumers","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171795222&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2023-0356&partnerID=40&md5=17a880bea327f76630642df4d476776e","Purpose: This study aims to examine the effect of self-construal on solo dining intentions and its underlying mechanism through consumer emotions. Furthermore, the study also investigates the moderating effect of the composition of other diners on the relationship between self-construal and solo dining intentions. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (self-construal: independent vs interdependent) × 2 (other diners: solo diners vs social diners) between-subjects experimental design was adopted to test the hypotheses. The data were collected from 317 Chinese consumers, followed by an analysis using IBM SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0. Findings: The findings indicate that consumers with an independent self-construal are more likely to have the intention to dine alone at a restaurant. Nevertheless, this effect is contingent upon the composition of other diners. The effect is significant only when nearby diners are social diners, and perceived enjoyment partly mediates the relationship. Conversely, when nearby diners are also solo diners, consumers' self-construals do not significantly affect their solo dining intentions. Moreover, the results indicate that consumers generally experience low levels of perceived stress when dining alone. Originality/value: This study incorporates individual personality traits into research on solo diners and highlights the crucial role of positive emotions in solo dining, which provides insights for relevant enterprises to develop effective marketing strategies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral intention; Consumer emotions; Self-construal; Social identity theory; Solo dining",""
"How broadcasters' characteristics affect viewers' loyalty: the role of parasocial relationships","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165192518&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2022-0856&partnerID=40&md5=ad0786d0842c2aebed77e1ee68cfa41d","Purpose: This study applies parasocial relationship theory to identify the role of broadcaster characteristics in the highly interactive business setting of live streaming commerce. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 401 online questionnaires were distributed to individuals with live streaming showroom shopping experience, and SmartPLS software was used to analyse the data and test the hypotheses. Findings: Broadcasters' characteristics are positively associated with viewers' parasocial relationships, thus further enhancing viewers' attitudinal and behavioural loyalty towards that broadcaster's streams. Parasocial relationships mediate the effects of most broadcaster characteristics (except for expertise) on attitudinal and behavioural loyalty. In addition, parasocial relationships have a stronger positive effect on viewer behaviours for hedonic products and under high match-up. Originality/value: The broadcaster is a key indicator of the success of live streaming commerce. This study establishes a well-organized framework to understand how broadcaster characteristics influence viewer loyalty towards that broadcasters' streams based on parasocial relationship theory. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Broadcaster characteristics; Live streaming commerce; Parasocial relationships; Product characteristics; Product match-up; Viewer loyalty",""
"How does frugality influence customer complaints through the mediation of the zone of tolerance? Empirical evidence from Chinese consumers purchasing Shanzhai products","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176966651&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2023-0202&partnerID=40&md5=b50ef3361ee337380f030a94bf89884e","Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether frugality increases customer complaints via the mediating role of the zone of tolerance (ZOT) of quality for Shanzhai products. Additionally, the study seeks to explore how customer empathy as a boundary condition affects the relationship between the ZOT of quality and customer complaints. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the purchasing data of 241 low-income customers from business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce and social platforms in China, hierarchical analysis was conducted in the study. Moreover, “PROCESS SPSS Macro” was used to test the mediation effect of the ZOT of quality and the moderated mediation effect with customer empathy as a moderator. Findings: The results indicate a positive impact of frugality on customer complaints, which is mediated by the ZOT of quality. Moreover, with an increase in customer empathy, the negative effect of the ZOT of quality on customer complaints increases, and the positive influence of frugality on customer complaints, through the mediation of the ZOT of quality, also becomes stronger. Originality/value: Drawing upon the principle of cognitive consistency, this study not only extends the stream of research on frugality by exploring how frugality influences customer complaints via the mediation of the ZOT of quality but also sheds new light on the research on customer empathy by exploring its moderating role in the relationship between the ZOT of quality and customer complaints. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer complaints; Customer empathy; Frugality; Quality perception; Zone of tolerance of quality",""
"Eating halal: a serial mediation model for the effect of religiosity on the intention to purchase halal-certified food","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165215284&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2022-0868&partnerID=40&md5=13759efeb3854bd357930de4e11d2eee","Purpose: This research discloses the effect of religiosity on purchasing intention through serial-mediation paths in a halal-certified food context. Borrowing from the identity theory while supplemented by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the knowledge–attitude–practice (KAP) theory, a 4-layered framework is developed to investigate such an issue. Design/methodology/approach: 264 questionnaires are collected in the field study conducted in Tunis, Tunisia. Quota sampling method is applied. Testing of the hypotheses is performed using partial least square analysis. Findings: The findings reveal that religiosity affects the four mediators—awareness, trust, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control—which in turn affect attitude, and purchase intention towards halal-certified food is eventually aroused. These four serial-mediation paths are further proved to form the mechanisms. Research limitations/implications: The field study participants are limited to consumers in Tunis. Besides, a mechanism to collect the data from general public including lower educated consumers should be necessary. Originality/value: This research is a pioneering work investigating the sequential intervening effect in the religiosity-intention relationship in halal-certified food. The authors provide unique and fruitful insights into this relatively untapped field for academia and firms. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Halal certification; Halal food; Purchase intention; Religiosity",""

Design/methodology/approach: Three studies (n = 539) were conducted using data collected from an online consumer panel and tested via structural equation modelling and PROCESS macro in SPSS. Findings: The findings suggest that subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitudes positively influence consumers' e-deal purchase intention. Additionally, price consciousness amplifies the relationship between consumers' e-deal proneness and purchase intention, and price-conscious respondents are more likely to have the intention to buy e-deals when faced with some form of anticipatory regret. Practical implications: Based on the research findings, practitioners are advised to prioritise social norms and entertainment value when promoting the attractiveness of e-deals, using strategies such as social media and influencer marketing. Brands should also emphasise the value of e-deals by showcasing comparative price savings and discounts to motivate consumers to buy. Originality/value: This paper addresses an interesting and practical issue related to the effects of group buying websites, focussing on e-deal proneness, price consciousness and anticipatory regret. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anticipatory regret; Attitude; e-deals; Price consciousness; Purchase intention; Theory of planned behaviour",""

However, few studies have examined corporate philanthropy from the perspective of community evolution. To address this gap, this study aims to provide a more in-depth and holistic investigation of corporate philanthropy by examining the evolution of social media brand communities caused by corporate philanthropy and the characteristics of consumer interactive behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawlers developed by Python were employed to collect data of ERKE from Sina Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter). A total of 2,736 posts and 7,774 comments were collected and investigated using social network and sentiment tendency analyses. Findings: The results showed that the evolution of the social media brand community presented a prominent three-stage characteristic influenced by corporate philanthropy. The findings not only support the benefits of corporate philanthropy but also show the possible disadvantages. Besides, this study further concluded the characteristics of consumer interactive behavior in the social media brand community. Originality/value: This paper addresses an attractive and practical issue related to the impact of corporate philanthropy. Moreover, this study is one of the first studies to examine the impact of corporate philanthropy in the context of the social media brand community.

"Downward social comparison in explaining pro-environmental attitude-sustainable consumption behavior gap","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198829496&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2024-0665&partnerID=40&md5=1e76e1528467a16355cca93d4c2d6406","Purpose: While consumers are increasingly concerned about the environment and commit themselves to environmental protection, they are still reluctant to act. This phenomenon, to date, has remained a puzzle and gained much attention from practitioners and researchers. As a contribution to the understanding of the phenomenon, this study aims to examine the role of downward social comparison as an explanation for the inconsistency of the relationships between two types of pro-environmental attitudes, namely attitudes toward the environment and attitudes toward sustainable consumption, and two sustainable consumption behaviors including electricity-saving behavior and unneeded consumption reduction. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to test the hypotheses with survey data from 381 consumers in a large city in a Southeast Asian country. Findings: The regression results support our expectation that downward social comparison negatively moderates the relationships between the two attitude variables and the two sustainable consumption behaviors. Originality/value: Our findings provide some insights into the complexity of the attitude-behavior relationship and offer some practical recommendations for governments and policymakers in designing more effective behavioral interventions for the sustainability of human society. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Downward social comparison; Environmental attitude-behavior gap; Environmental attitudes; Green gap; Sustainable consumption",""
"Perceived risk-based sport spectator segmentation during the pandemic situation","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181698333&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2023-0801&partnerID=40&md5=50217f3fd03b244d0dd5a9c0e6a08b9e","Purpose: Although many attempts to discover key segments of sport spectators have been extant, little segmentation effort has been made to reflect pandemic situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to classify sport spectators into key segments based on perceived risks associated with a mass-gathered sporting event during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to identify each segment’s profiles. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire surveys of spectators attending a Japanese rugby game during the COVID-19 pandemic (January–June 2021) were conducted (n = 1,410). A combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods was executed. Findings: The results revealed the five-cluster solution as the optimal number of clusters representing the samples (i.e. spectators with extremely low-risk perception, those with low-risk perception, those with moderate-risk perception, those with high-risk perception and those with higher social risk perception). This five-cluster solution showed sufficient stability and validity. Moreover, each segment had different profiles regarding three background aspects – demographics, psychographics and behavioral variables. Originality/value: This study is the first effort to segment sport spectators based on perceived risks associated with a mass-gathered sporting event in the pandemic situation. Despite extensive segmentation studies to explore sport fans, contribution reflecting the post-crisis situations is scant. Therefore, the findings provide insight into this realm by providing a new viewpoint for understanding sport spectators during a possible future pandemic era. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cluster analysis; Mass gatherings; Pandemic situations; Perceived risks; Sport spectators",""
"Does diversity facilitate consumer decisions: a comparative perspective based on single-category versus multi-category products","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176121767&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2023-0395&partnerID=40&md5=abcd51d71ec11d05a2386362574e2180","Purpose: This study aims to explore the opposite effects of single-category versus multi-category products information diversity on consumer decision making. Further, the authors investigate the moderating role of three categories of visitors – direct, hesitant and hedonic – in the relationship between product information diversity and consumer decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilizes a sample of 1,101,062 product click streams from 4,200 consumers. Visitors are clustered using the k-means algorithm. The diversity of information recommendations for single and multi-category products is characterized using granularity and dispersion, respectively. Empirical analysis is conducted to examine their influence on the two-stage decision-making process of heterogeneous online visitors. Findings: The study reveals that the impact of recommended information diversity on consumer decision making differs significantly between single-category and multiple-category products. Specifically, information diversity in single-category products enhances consumers' click and purchase intention, while information diversity in multiple-category products reduces consumers' click and purchase intention. Moreover, based on the analysis of online visiting heterogeneity, hesitant, direct and hedonic features enhance the positive impact of granularity on consumer decision making; while direct features exacerbate the negative impact of dispersion on consumer decision making. Originality/value: First, the article provides support for studies related to information cocoon. Second, the research contributes evidence to support the information overload theory. Third, the research enriches the field of precision marketing theory. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer decision making; Information diversity; Online marketing; Online visitor heterogeneity; Recommender systems",""
"Exploring new dimensions in OTT consumption: an empirical study on perceived risks, descriptive norms and goal-directed behaviour","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183000305&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2023-0690&partnerID=40&md5=326b7e610a6280904f383b08e8e8371a","Purpose: With over-the-top (OTT) streaming services rapidly transforming the media industry and saturating the market, the authors' study seeks to enrich the goal-directed behaviour model by exploring how perceived risks and descriptive norms influence OTT consumption. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from OTT subscribers were collected online to assess their risk behaviours. The 353 responses obtained were analysed with SmartPLS, validating the structural equation modelling (SEM) through structural and measurement model verification. Findings: The authors' findings illustrate that descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, as well as positive and negative anticipated emotion (NEM) and attitude, contribute positively to the desire to engage with OTT streaming services. Interestingly, the authors' study contradicts common assumptions, revealing that subjective norms do not significantly impact the propensity to utilise OTT services. This counterintuitive finding necessitates a reconsideration of prevalent theories and contributes to a nuanced understanding of OTT adoption determinants. Research limitations/implications: The data gathering for this study were conducted from the perspective of a single nation. Therefore, caution must be exercised when generalising this study's results. Practical implications: The practical ramifications of this research are vast, providing OTT service providers and marketers with actionable insights to maximise user engagement and navigate perceived risks related to OTT service adoption and consumption. Originality/value: This study's exploration of perceived risks and descriptive norms enhances the goal-directed behaviour model's breadth, facilitating a holistic comprehension of the constructs shaping OTT consumption behaviours. It would be the first attempt to combine perceptual, affective and behavioural factors and perceived risks to understand the user's predisposition to engage in OTT streaming services. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Descriptive norms; Goal-directed behaviour model; Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services; Perceived risks; User engagement",""

In addition to facing a demand for new CSR strategies (consumer-centric CSR), changes in CSR discourse among luxury brands are observed. This study examines how CSR-related and luxury-related agendas relate in the news media, especially concerning the difference between traditional and new luxury brands. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 117,171 fashion-related news articles were collected from January 2016 to December 2020. The word2vec method was used to determine the relationship between CSR and luxury agendas. Findings: The results indicate that company-centric CSR is more prominent with traditional luxury brands, while consumer-centric CSR is more relevant for new luxury brands. In addition, specific CSR attributes and luxury-related attributes are associated with media discourse, which means that CSR and luxury are compatible. Originality/value: Studies on CSR in the luxury industry are not extensive in the literature. This study addresses this gap through a unique framework that combines agenda-setting theory and existing CSR literature and applies them to the luxury industry. Specifically, this study captures the development of each construct (company-centric CSR to consumer-centric CSR and traditional luxury to new luxury) and identifies the specific relationships between them. This result provides a novel view of the luxury industry indicating that it has evolved to encompass CSR-related values.

The second purpose is to not only observe specified connectivity in a comprehensive and complex structural model but also reveal key mediators for better linkages. The third purpose is to detect any moderating effects of the knowledge-learning experience between ADEPT constructs and satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: The causal relationships, mediating effects and moderating effects were analyzed using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Based on the ADEPT value-added framework, the higher the ADEPT service quality constructs, the more satisfied the general attendees are through the distinct mediating role of perceived value. Moreover, the influence of service delivery on satisfaction is strengthened with high-level knowledge-learning experiences. Originality/value: The optimized fit of the ADEPT service quality constructs that are significantly linked to distinct perceived value was theoretically conceptualized and empirically identified in this work. The complex connections and degrees of significant influence throughout the entire process of the ADEPT constructs, distinct perceived value and satisfaction serve here as the basis (i.e. framework) for establishing strategic marketing management in exhibitions.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of language intensity of brand fan WOM on customers' willingness to adopt WOM based on psychological resistance theory and to reveal the underlying mechanism of this process. Design/methodology/approach: A research model was developed to test the proposed hypotheses. Two experiments were conducted on an online platform using data from 708 participants. The independent samples t-test and analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. Findings: The results show that, in the context of WOM among brand fans, high-intensity language leads to a lower willingness to adopt than low-intensity language and threats to freedom mediate this effect. Moreover, the restoration postscript moderates the effect of language intensity on threats to freedom and customers' willingness to adopt WOM.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 624 participants, the results support that social media engagement has indirect effects on culinary brand equity development through travel attitudes and information sharing. Findings: The study finds that values are expressed as foundational attributes that have indirect effects on brand equity through hedonic function, perceived quality, brand awareness and brand image. In contrast, the social interaction mechanism strengthens subdimensional relationships. These findings extend the customer brand equity literature and the nature of tourists' perspectives in the context of Taiwan's culinary destination brand equity. Practical implications: It is a suggestion for tourism and hospitality managers to identify the different characteristics of attitudes towards visits and the customers' desert of participation in food-related activities when it derives to the classifications of food and culinary tourism. Originality/value: The current study extended the findings and asserted that social interaction leads to and strengthens the relationships between memorable culinary hedonic experiences and perceived quality and improves tourists' positive awareness and image compared to other tourism experiences. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Culinary; Information sharing; Social interaction; Travel attitude",""
"Extension of heritage brands and consumer purchase intention with the moderating role of pop culture involvement: an empirical analysis of time-honoured brands in China","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176916943&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2023-0442&partnerID=40&md5=ed20af0ff2ebdbabde8546d822b60a28","Purpose: This study explores the influence of heritage brand extension on consumer purchase intention and analyses the effects of pop culture involvement. The extension of heritage brands is becoming increasingly difficult because such an extension needs to be consistent with the unique characteristics of brands and resonate with consumers. However, few scholars discuss the influence of consumers' level of pop culture involvement on brand extension and purchasing behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Taking time-honoured brands as an example, this study established a conceptual model based on a comprehensive review of the literature, and then tested the model using a sample of 255 respondents who were familiar with one of the selected Chinese time-honoured brands. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the relationships amongst brand extension fit, pop culture involvement, perceived value and purchase intention. Findings: Time-honoured brand extension fit has a positive impact on consumer purchase intention, and this path is significantly influenced by the mediation mechanisms of perceived value.

"Exploring the effects of virtual annotation background display mode and transparency through a 360-degree panorama approach to online shopping","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176412275&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2023-0346&partnerID=40&md5=3a75df43e0db15e68e5e1520716d186f","Purpose: With the rapid development of technology, 360° panorama on mobile as a very convenient way to present virtual reality has brought a new shopping experience to consumers. Usually, consumers get product information through virtual annotations in 360° panorama and then make a series of shopping behaviors. The visual design of virtual annotation significantly influences users' online visual search for product information. This study aims to investigate the influence of the visual design of virtual annotation on consumers' shopping experience in the online shopping interface of 360° panorama. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 × 3 between-subject design was planned to help explore whether different display model of annotation (i.e. negative polarity and positive polarity) and different background transparency of annotation (i.e. 0% transparency, 25% transparency and 50% transparency) may affect users' task performance and their subjective evaluations. Findings: (1) Virtual annotations with different background transparency affect user performance, and transparency has better visual search performance. (2) Virtual annotation background display mode may affect the user operation performance; the positive polarity of the virtual annotation is more convenient for the users' visual searching for product information. (3) When the annotation background transparency is opaque or semi-transparent, the negative polarity display is more favorable to the users' visual search. However, this situation is reversed when the annotation background transparency is 25%. (4) Participants preferred the presentation of positive polarity virtual annotations. (5) Regarding the degree of willingness to use and ease of understanding, participants preferred the negative polarity display for 0% background transparency or 50% background transparency. However, the opposite result was obtained for 25% background transparency. Originality/value: The findings generated from the research can be a good reference for the development of virtual annotation visual design for mobile shopping applications. Highlights: Virtual annotation background transparency and background display mode are two essential attributes of 360° panoramas. This study examined how virtual annotation background transparency and background display mode influence user performance and experience. It is recommended to use a translucent or opaque annotation background with a negative polarity display. Virtual annotation presentation with 25% background transparency facilitates consumer searching and comparison of product information. Users prefer a positive polarity annotation display. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","360° panoramas; Background transparency; Display mode; Product information; User experience; Virtual annotation",""

Design/methodology/approach: Four between-subject experiments were conducted to verify the hypotheses presented in this research. Study 1a had a sample size of 60 respondents and examined the effect of goal type of UGC on compensatory consumption. Study1b replicated the effect by using a sample size of 60 respondents. Study 2 had a sample size of 70 respondents and verified the mediating role of self-threat, self-enhancement motivation and self-protection motivation. Study 3 examined self-efficacy as a critical moderator by using a sample of 255 participants. Findings: Study 1a and Study 1b demonstrate that UGC with an attainment goal (vs maintenance goal) is more easily produced within-domain and across-domain compensatory consumption. Study 2 verifies that the effect of goal type of UGC on within-domain compensatory consumption is serially mediated by self-threat and self-enhancement motivation, and the effect of goal type of UGC on across-domain compensatory consumption is serially mediated by self-threat and self-protection motivation. Study 3 demonstrates that self-efficacy not only moderates the effects of self-threat on within-domain or across-domain compensatory consumption respectively, but also moderates the whole mediating path structure. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of UGC and addresses the inconclusive evidence of the impact of goal type of UGC on consumer compensatory behavior in the context of closed social media platforms. The authors identify the moderating role of self-efficacy, which explains why consumers adopt different compensatory strategies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Closed social media platform; Compensatory consumption; Goal type; Self-efficacy; Social comparison; User-generated content",""

Design/methodology/approach: With the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, more and more customers purchase products in through online channels and choose products by comparing different prices and services, and the reference price effect has an impact on pricing decisions. To investigate the impact of consumers' reference price effect on the dual-channel supply chain, the authors establish a basic model consisting of a single dominant manufacturer and a single downstream retailer, and analyze the optional decisions under different situations and discuss the influence of reference price effect. Finally, a number case verifies the validity and rationality of the proposed model. Findings: The results show that (1) the reference price effect has varying effects on the price, channel demand and income of manufacturers and retailers in the channel depending on the role of customers' channel preferences. (2) The manufacturer's online channel demand and profits always increase with the reference pricing effect, whereas the retailer's offline demand and profits always decline. (3) When the proportion of consumers preferring offline is higher, the manufacturer's network price and wholesale price increase with the reference price effect, while the retailer's retail price decreases with the reference price effect; when the proportion of consumers preferring offline is lower, the opposite is true, and the centralized decision results are consistent with the decentralized decision results. Practical implications: This paper can clarify the impact of consumer reference price effects on the operation of dual-channel supply chains, and help inform pricing decisions of manufacturers and retailers in dual-channel supply chains.

Originality/value: The study's findings show a moderating effect of green clothing type (green home-in wear vs green home-out wear). That is, compared to green home-out wear, the relationship between expected moral benefit and perceived greenwashing for green home-in wear had a weaker negative effect on purchase intentions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Empirical research; Environmental knowledge level; Expected moral benefit; Green fashion; Greenwashing; Perceived value",""
"Individual characteristics linking cognitive, affective and conative mechanisms among vegetarian restaurant customers","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167339596&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2023-0208&partnerID=40&md5=6582e6a2b9163dec861d46109dbbe714","Purpose: Despite the recent increase in vegetarian food consumption, studies on this topic have focused on the product category. Based on the functional theory of attitude and the cognitive–affective–conative framework, this study investigates the impact of customer individuality (i.e. uniqueness and level of self-monitoring) on cognitive attitude (i.e. social-function attitudes), which leads to conative attitude (i.e. behavioral intentions) via affective attitudes toward vegetarian restaurants. Design/methodology/approach: The sample (n = 176) comprises experienced vegetarian restaurant customers in the USA. Multi-group analysis is used to examine differences between vegetarian and non-vegetarian customers, as well as customers' low and high frequency in visiting vegetarian restaurants. Findings: Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, this study finds the relative impact of customers' personal traits on self-expressive and social-adjustive functions. Results highlight the role of the social-adjustive function as an antecedent of affective attitudes leading to positive behavioral intentions. Last, the findings from a multi-group analysis show that customer self-monitoring is the only significant antecedent of a cognitive attitude among vegetarian customers. Originality/value: The present study adds to the literature regarding trait attributes and corresponding cognitive, affective and conative attitudes in the context of the vegetarian food service industry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Need for uniqueness; Self-expressive function; Self-monitoring; Social-adjustive function; Vegetarian restaurant",""
"What makes a self-deprecating advertisement more persuasive? The role of self-uncertainty","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164136376&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2022-0514&partnerID=40&md5=ae5af81943ad294dba4c4132a9be1962","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the interesting but largely unexamined impact of self-uncertainty on the persuasiveness of self-deprecating advertisement. Design/methodology/approach: In the present research, the experimental design and survey methods are used to collect data. Furthermore, the ANOVA and bootstrap analysis methods are adopted to verify whether a self-deprecating advertisement is more persuasive for consumers experiencing self-uncertainty and explore the mediating role of self-verification. Findings: Study 1 indicates that people experiencing self-uncertainty are more likely to engage in actual self-verification. Study 2 demonstrates that consumers experiencing self-uncertainty are more likely to purchase products in a self-deprecating advertisement (vs. self-enhancing advertisement), and actual self-verification motive underlies this effect. In Study 3, a novel boundary condition for the main effect–product type (hedonic vs. utilitarian) is found, and it further reveals that the impact of self-uncertainty on the persuasiveness of self-deprecating advertisement will attenuate when the advertised product is utilitarian. Practical implications: This research reveals that self-deprecating advertising is more desirable for consumers who experience self-uncertainty. Based on the conclusions in this paper, the self-deprecating advertising is more attractive and desirable for consumers who are reminded about their personal uncertainties. Thus, marketers could employ self-deprecating (vs. self-enhancing) advertisement to promote products. For example, in order to promote the waterproof function of iPhone 12, Apple China released a self-deprecating advertisement of “Splash proof and water resistant. Don't worry, iPhone.” Originality/value: First, this research not only sheds new light on the relationship between self-uncertainty and the persuasiveness of self-deprecating advertisement but also verifies the mediating role of self-verification motive in this relationship. Moreover, this research reveals that self-uncertainty is a significant factor in how people react to the self-deprecating advertisement. It is noteworthy that the self-uncertainty effect is more likely to be found when the advertised product is related to hedonic or experiential consumption as opposed to utilitarian consumption. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Self-deprecating; Self-uncertainty; Self-verification",""
"Self-regulation and panic buying: examining the brake mechanism effect on fear of missing out","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198972072&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2023-1254&partnerID=40&md5=4af6ab785581b755bb2dc8d61a71fe82","Purpose: Extant research indicates that fear of missing out (FoMO) caused by the negative influence of media and word-of-mouth (WOM) leads to panic buying and generates a negative impact on consumer well-being. However, the mechanism that can minimise or abort this impact remains understudied. Therefore, in this study, we examine how consumer self-regulation functions as a brake mechanism to intervene with the negative influences of media and WOM on FoMO. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a representative sample in Australia. Hypotheses were tested by applying generalised structural equation modelling (GSEM), and analysis was conducted using the statistical software Stata 17. Findings: Self-regulation is negatively influenced by media channels and WOM but is positively influenced by media content. Consumer self-regulation acts as a brake mechanism for FoMO. Panic buying, which is triggered by FoMO, has a significant impact on negative emotional well-being. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the study are associated with the survey data collection. Practical implications: We extend the knowledge of how self-regulation works as a brake mechanism for the complex FoMO construct consisting of a perception of missing out accompanied by irrational behaviours. Self-regulation emerges as a brake mechanism for FoMO. Hence, if self-regulation is practiced at the inception of the media and WOM exposure, it can counteract FoMO and potentially abort its’ impact on panic buying. Social implications: From a practical perspective, policymakers could help emotionally vulnerable individuals better engage in self-control practices through support programmes and workshops aimed at assisting the public in coping with overwhelming and intense adverse emotions experienced during and following various crises. Vulnerable cohorts, particularly the younger generation who are arguably more susceptible to FoMO, need to be studied more thoroughly in the marketing domain. Originality/value: The role of self-regulation has been studied thinly in marketing literature, particularly in relation to offsetting irrational consumer behaviours. The originality of our study is that it extends and broadens the understanding of the role of self-regulation in the context of pandemics and addresses the inconclusive evidence of the impact of self-regulation on FoMO. © 2024, Tatiana Anisimova, Soniya Billore and Philip Kitchen.","FoMO; Negative consumer well-being; Panic buying; Self-regulation",""

Moreover, moderating effects of place attachment on the relation between the aforementioned variables were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The validities and reliabilities of the measures were investigated through confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha and correlation analysis. A structural equation modelling with maximum likelihood estimation was tested to analyze the relationships among the research variables using 383 participants. Findings: The results revealed positive associations among stimulus (personal involvement), organism (positive emotions) and response (tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty). Moreover, the authors found moderating effect of place attachment on the relationships between personal involvement and positive emotions, personal involvement and tourist satisfaction and tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty. Research limitations/implications: This study holds the potential to aid destination managers in acquiring a more profound comprehension of how personal involvement contributes to elicit positive emotions, keep tourists satisfied and build destination loyalty as well as demonstrating the moderating roles of place attachment. However, generalizing the findings to alternative contexts presents a formidable challenge. Enhancing the applicability of these findings could be achieved through prospective research endeavors that explore visitors in diverse cities spanning various continents. Originality/value: The study contributed to the literature by providing empirical evidence that personal involvement evokes positive emotions while also plays significant role in improving satisfaction and loyalty. Given the importance of experiences in sport tourism, this study also confirmed the role of positive emotions on tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty.

However, limited scholarly attention has focused on the perception of stadium toponyms. This research initiative aims to gauge attention garnered by football stadiums in Europe and China based on various naming rights options. Design/methodology/approach: Commencing with a well-known European stadium: Allianz Arena (Munich) and new constructed stadium in China, the original naming rights have been proffered as stimuli, in comparison with two major technology brands as well as Coca-Cola, the historical sponsor of sport mega-events. A sample of 100 participants was analyzed using the eye-tracking technique to compare the perceptions of European and Chinese youth. Findings: The conclusion drawn from the study is that for stadiums with a history of sponsorship, unedited versions of the pictures attract the most attention. Compared with technology brand, Coca-cola is the brand with the greatest ability to attract the attention of young people in both historical stadiums or new constructed stadium, acting as an impulse to the activation of the naming rights strategy due to its historical character as a sponsor of mega sporting events. Originality/value: The research makes dual contributions, both theoretically and practically. It enhances comprehension of audience visual attention patterns in the context of football stadium naming rights sponsorship, employing cognitive attention theory to substantiate empirical evidence. Furthermore, it advances the existing literature on football stadium naming rights research. Additionally, it proposes an optimization tool to assess the effectiveness of naming rights sponsorships, offering valuable insights for companies and brands seeking to enhance their marketing strategies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behavior; Eye-tracking; Naming rights; Neuromarketing; Stadium sponsorship",""
"A streamlined survey instrument to moderate university students' grades for group projects","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183716995&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2023-0858&partnerID=40&md5=64d2a3e7a6d43767d8d986adb27c3ebb","Purpose: The aim of this paper is to generate a streamlined, transparent and effective instrument to fairly measure the contribution made by each student to a group project within a higher education context. The primary aim is to moderate the grades of underperforming students at the end of the project. There is a secondary benefit in alerting underperforming students to raise their contribution mid-task or face a potentially reduced grade at the final stage. Design/methodology/approach: The development of this multi-dimensional instrument is guided by findings from previous research. The quest is to minimise the instructor's administrative work load in applying a moderation-only instrument that is open-source and available at no cost. Based on the literature, the survey instrument seeks to apply a peer-based, equitable and transparent evaluation of each member's contribution to a group task. The survey is applied at mid-task and again at end-task in order to afford underperformers the opportunity to address contribution deficits during the final phase of the project. Findings: The instrument, called TANDEM©, offers a transparent, streamlined, equitable, confidential and practical measure of each student's contribution to a graded group task. Students whose end-task contribution falls below the group average rating receive a proportional reduction in their personal grade. Additionally, the end-task moderation instrument captures a single-item holistic measure of relative contribution that may, in the future, serve as a surrogate for the multi-dimensional measures currently in place. Research limitations/implications: TANDEM© was developed with group sizes of four or five members in mind. There is no evidence to support its application to three-person groups. Moreover, the application was applied only amongst under-graduate students. It is yet to be applied across post-graduate groups and within online learning environments. Future research into diverse cultural settings would serve to advance understanding of how moderation is perceived across borders. Practical implications: Several existing group grade moderation methods propose complex algorithms that are “black box” solutions from a student's perspective. In establishing a fair, streamlined, confidential and transparent process for peer-rated moderation, TANDEM© deploys a concise instrument with a relatively small administrative load. TANDEM © may be applied to all groups or can selectively be applied to groups that report moderate, strong or extreme levels of conflict. Social implications: Students will appreciate the opportunity to rate peer contributions to group projects. This will dissipate the negative social sentiment that may arise when fellow students benefit from the work of others. Those students seeking conflict resolution within the group will value the transparent and equitable moderation of grades as well as the positive social implications that follow. Originality/value: This research forms part of an ongoing quest to present a moderation instrument that fairly identifies student contribution to a group project. Whilst the solution proposed is one of many existing alternatives, its focus is on a practical moderation-only instrument that can immediately be applied to a course or major. The benefits lie in the ease of application and minimal administrative workload. This constitutes an original contribution to the individual (course or major) coordinator who seeks to apply a moderation-only instrument without having to commit to an extensive, broad-based group optimisation programme. © 2024, Stephen Dix.","Free rider; Grades; Group assessments; Moderation; Peer review; Tertiary education",""

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework, this research examines the effects of OCRs, countdowns and self-control on users' impulse purchases. First, the influence of emotions on impulse purchases in group purchasing is investigated. In addition, this study innovatively applies stress-coping theory to group buying research, with countdowns exerting temporal pressure on consumers and OCRs viewed as social pressure, to investigate in depth how countdowns and OCRs affect users' impulse purchase behavior. Finally, this study also surveys the moderating role of users' self-control in the impulse purchase process. Findings: The results show that the perceived value of OCRs and positive emotions (PE) were positively correlated with impulsiveness (IMP) and the urge to buy impulsively (UBI), while negative emotions (NE) were negatively correlated with IMP. Countdowns (CD) had a positive effect on UBI. Self-control can indirectly affect users' impulse buying by negatively moderating the relationship between PE and UBI, PE and IMP and CD and UBI.

The multigroup analysis is applied to understand the similarities and differences of factors that trigger purchase intentions among buyers and non-buyers in live-streaming shopping. Design/methodology/approach: A snowball sampling was used to collect data from 507 Chinese consumers between June and September 2022 using Wenjuanxing, i.e., an online survey platform in China. The data was analyzed using the partial least squares method of structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings revealed that amongst the three relational bonds, social and structural bonds were positively associated with trust, whereas financial bonds had no significant relationship with trust. This implies that while price discount might not have any significant relationship with trust, the social interactions that college students have with the live-streamers and their products build trust, which in turn translates to purchasing decisions. Comparing buyers and non-buyers, the results support that buyers have a higher level of trust in live-streaming shopping than non-buyers. This is indicative of the authentic and immersive experiences enjoyed by consumers in live streaming that generate structural bonds and foster stronger connections (relational bonds), thereby establishing trust. Originality/value: This study is one of the first empirical studies targeting college students as participants in live streaming. These findings are expected to provide actionable insights to streamers especially in converting non-buyers to buyers in live-streaming broadcast. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumers' engagement; Live-streaming shopping; Multigroup analysis; Purchase intention; Relational bonds; Trust",""

Moreover, it explores how perceived risk moderates the association between the attitude to adopt BNPL and its adoption intention. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the existing theoretical and empirical evidence to propose a model and validated it using the data collected from 339 young shoppers in India. Analysis of data is conducted using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The study results show that consumers’ RIB is not directly related to their attitude toward BNPL. However, impulse buying fully mediates this relationship, influencing the attitude toward BNPL. Impulse buying and attitude serially mediate the relationship between RIB and BNPL adoption intention. Further, in the context of BNPL, perceived risk strengthens the attitude-intention gap. Practical implications: This study advises policymakers and BNPL providers to carefully assess users’ creditworthiness to prevent those already in debt from entering into a detrimental loop.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted on a sample of 409 consumers to collect data on their health consciousness, sugar-induced anxiety, self-congruity, fresh start mindset and MPE of reduced front-of-pack sugar labeling in food products. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Findings: The results highlight the sugar-induced anxiety as the most pronounced determinant for the proposed placebo effect. Health consciousness was observed to indirectly influence the MPE via mediators (sugar-induced anxiety and self-congruity). Furthermore, the supporting role of the fresh start mindset moderates the relationships between health consciousness, sugar-induced anxiety, self-congruity and the MPE.

Design/methodology/approach: Around 902 valid questionnaires were collected using the questionnaire to analyze the different effects of three types of IS (official, interpersonal and commercial) on mass consumers' PIs. Besides, this study investigates the mechanisms by examining the mediating effect of perceived risk (PR) and the moderating effect of individual differences like age and education level. Findings: The three types of NEV IS stimulate the PI of mass consumers, but there are some differences, with interpersonal information sources (IISs) having the strongest contribution, followed by official information sources (OISs) and commercial information sources (CISs) the least. Meanwhile, PR plays a mediating role in the effect of NEV IS on mass consumers' PIs, and age and education level moderate the influence paths. Specifically, the moderating effect of age mainly works on the negative impact of PR on PI, while education level moderates the influence of IS on PR.

Moreover, the authors found that the time discount is a critical factor in determining pricing strategies under various payment schemes offered by the platform. Research limitations/implications: This work adopts a uniform pricing strategy for users who opt for either immediate or post-payment schemes. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this approach has limitations in terms of offering discriminatory pricing for those who choose both payment schemes. Practical implications: This analytical work provides valuable insights for two-sided media platforms to optimize their payment scheme strategies and pricing considering the influence of a user's mental account. Originality/value: In a two-sided media platform, the authors provide applicable conditions for the platform to offer first-enjoy-after-pay service considering the effect of mental accounts. Further, the authors show the optimal pricing strategy under different payment schemes provided by the platform. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","First-enjoy-after-pay; Mental account; Payment scheme; Pricing",""
"The influence of manufacturer encroachment on the supply chain: the conditional role of traditional retailer retail service investment","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198641317&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2024-0109&partnerID=40&md5=972a3c3b32d1296f9b1b5dc97609351a","Purpose: This paper investigates the dual interactive effects of manufacturer encroachment on the supply chain and retailer provision of retail services. Design/methodology/approach: Consider a supply chain dominated by manufacturers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms, with the manufacturers selling the same product online and offline. Utilizing Stackelberg’s game theory, examples of wholesale and retail prices and profits of participants in the supply chain under different channels are analyzed. An effective encroachment strategy for manufacturers facing different retail service investment strategies of traditional retailers is given. Findings: When traditional retailers do not invest in retail services, they will lose more profit due to competition with the manufacturer. At this time, the retailer does not want the manufacturer to encroach. The traditional retailer’s investment in retail services will enhance its and the manufacturer’s profits, incentivizing the manufacturer to pursue an aggressive expansion strategy. Originality/value: (1) Considers a situation where the selling efficiency of the manufacturer is lower than that of the traditional retailer. (2) The interaction between traditional retailers’ retail service investment strategies and manufacturers’ encroachment strategies is investigated where the manufacturer is the dominant player. The three modes of online direct sales, resale, and third-party platform agency are compared to provide a basis for decision-making on different types of manufacturers’ encroachment. (3) Offline retail services not only directly increase sales in the offline market but also indirectly have a negative effect on the online market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Channel model; Manufacturer encroachment; Retail service investment; Stackelberg game",""

Food labels have long been recognized as an important marketing tool, but there is a lack of research on label-free products. To address this gap, this study examined the influence of label-free design on product attractiveness in the Japanese green tea market. Design/methodology/approach: If existing products are used in an experiment, respondents would be subject to brand image bias. Hence, by mechanically combining the main design elements (cap shape, bottle style, decoration line, logo and label) with an orthogonal array, the conditions for bottles with and without labels are completely aligned. The authors conducted an online survey and applied the chi-square test to the attractiveness of 18 designs presented in random order. Findings: Label-free designs were more attractive to consumers than labeled designs. The effect was higher among female, middle-aged and older adults; those with higher annual income and low-frequency purchasers. Practical implications: Practitioners should adopt a label-free design that can satisfy both environmental considerations and customer value. It would be a formidable challenge to change the longstanding emphasis placed on label design, but this study demonstrates the value of doing so. Originality/value: This is the first study in the package design literature on the advantages of label-free plastic bottles.

Drawing upon dual factor perspective, this study examines how two types of quality and perceived usefulness impact user resistance as enabling factors and how switching cost, skepticism, habit and inertia contribute to user resistance as inhibiting factors. Additionally, multi-group analysis is employed to compare small and medium enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: Purposive sampling technique was employed to collect 460 Korean SMEs employees, consisting of 235 small enterprises and 225 medium enterprises. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Findings: The results reveal that all three inhibiting factors, switching cost, skepticism and habit, are key antecedents of inertia. In small enterprises, skepticism has a greater impact on inertia, which in turn strongly affects resistance. Additionally, system quality is more crucial for small enterprises, whereas information quality holds more importance for medium enterprises in mitigating resistance. Moreover, when the implementation level of a smart factory is high, the effect of perceived usefulness on user resistance diminishes. Originality/value: This study has revealed the importance of considering both enabling and inhibiting factors for the adoption of smart factory systems in the context of SMEs. Additionally, it has provided evidence that as the level of the smart factory system increases, the effect of perceived usefulness on user resistance decreases, thus making the transition to smart factory systems more challenging. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Inertia; Information quality; Perceived usefulness; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); Smart factory; System quality; User resistance",""
"The impact of normative appeals and affective priming on public service announcements (PSAs) – a moderating role of self-construals","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169925110&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2023-0320&partnerID=40&md5=7853ef6f25f1844954f41c0d2d0ffa7d","Purpose: It is believed that the effectiveness of public service announcements (PSAs) in persuading recipients to engage in the advocated behavior may be influenced by the content of PSAs, the recipient and the context in which the recipient is exposed to the PSA. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the persuasive process of PSAs with respect to these three aspects. Specifically, how the normative appeals used in PSA, affective priming and self-construals of recipients influence the recipients' behavioral intention is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Between-subject experiments were conducted to collect data. The proposed hypotheses were verified by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro. Findings: Results show that participants with sad emotional experiences exhibit significantly higher behavioral intention after exposure to PSA compared to those with joy primed. However, the difference in behavioral intention between participants with guilt and neutral emotional experiences was insignificant. Concerning normative appeals, descriptive norms are more persuasive than injunctive norms. In addition, participants' self-construals moderate the relationship between normative appeals and behavioral intention. Research limitations/implications: First, this study selected a group of college students as participants and used “Empty Your Plate” campaign as stimulus. Future research should test this mechanism with different samples. Second, this study only tested the effect of print advertising. Future research may examine whether these findings still work with advertisement in different formats. Moreover, future research should investigate the impact of priming guilt that is related to the PSA themes on PSAs' persuasive outcomes. Finally, this study only explored the moderating role of self-construals. Other personal traits were not investigated in current study need to be further explored. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the effectiveness of PSA and have practical implications for PSA practitioners. Firstly, descriptive norms can be used more frequently to improve the effectiveness of PSAs. Secondly, negative emotion exerts a positive influence on persuasive outcomes, so PSA practitioners can arrange media planning more rationally. Furthermore, they can adapt their normative appeals to the self-construal characteristics of their primary audiences to achieve their communication goals more effectively. This study reveals the effectiveness mechanism of PSA in the Chinese context, and thus meets practical needs. Social implications: This research will help improve the effectiveness of PSAs to protect the public interest and alleviate social problems by optimizing media planning strategies and increasing the willingness of viewers to change their behavior.

"Brand engagement and community user behaviors in online interest communities: exploring a moderated mediation model","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169165412&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2023-0503&partnerID=40&md5=5b9172bc9aeee9039ba32e81786bf9c6","Purpose: As fertile soil for product promotion, online interest communities have gradually come into brands' view. However, existing research does not clarify whether brand engagement in consumer interaction is beneficial to the development of online interest communities. This study attempts to investigate the effects of brand engagement on the online interest community operation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a model that delineated the influence of brand engagement on consumers' citizenship behavior in the online interest community from the commitment-trust perspective. Scenario-based experiments were conducted and 536 data were collected by simple random sampling. Findings: Results shows that a stronger perception of brand engagement has a positive influence on the relationship (trust and commitment) between the community and its users, which further influences online community citizenship behavior (feedback, advocacy and tolerance) of both posters and lurkers, especially for the posters. Although relationships are more complex, brand engagement activates the development of online interest communities to some extent. Originality/value: This original study contributes to the commitment-trust theory by examining the impact of brand engagement on citizenship behavior via community commitment and trust in the online interest community context. In addition, this study compares the moderating effect of posters vs lurkers on the relationship between brand engagement and citizenship behavior in the online interest community. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand engagement; Citizenship behaviour; Empirical research; Lurker; Online community; Poster",""

However, the evidence on how these good practices would ultimately benefit brands economically remains insufficient. This study tests the causal effect between corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, media coverage, and brand value to reveal the underlying mechanisms of how consumers would react to high ESG performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data regression analysis with a sample of Chinese A-share non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2021. ESG performance, brand value, and media coverage are assessed with Huazheng ESG Rating, the rankings from the China’s 500 Most Valuable Brands' list published by the World Brand Lab, and media index compiled by the Chinese Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS) respectively. Findings: This research confirmed that ESG performance positively impacted brand value in terms of profitability, and that media coverage played a role as a megaphone in this relationship. Large-scale corporates, compared to small ones, benefited more from good ESG ratings due to increased media coverage. Originality/value: The findings provide evidence of the megaphone effect of media coverage on the relationship between firms’ ESG engagements and brand value in the product market, which has extended the knowledge of media’s monitoring role in the financial market. And this megaphone effect is strengthened by firm size in which larger firms have spotlight effect in draw public attention due to higher expectations in terms of social responsibility. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand value; ESG performance; Firm size; Media coverage",""

Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from a sample of 127 exporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in New Zealand. The authors employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for analyzing the measurement and structural models. Findings: Psychological contract fulfillment (PCF) enhances affective commitment and calculative commitment. Moreover, affective and calculative commitments mediate the relationship between PCF and export venture performance (EVP). The authors also find that institutional distance (ID) weakens the relationship between PCF and both affective and calculative commitment. Additionally, ID moderates the strength of the mediating mechanism for affective commitment; thus, the authors present a moderated-mediation model. Originality/value: To date, international relationship marketing (IRM) literature has focused on PC breach, and business-to-business (B2B) marketing literature has focused on the effects of PCs on affective/relational commitment. This study offers novel insights by demonstrating the positive indirect effect of PCF on EVP via the mediating variables – affective and calculative commitment.

This paper examines how SMBE mediates the effects of firm-generated content (FGC) and user-generated content (UGC) on brand trust, considering the moderating effects of social media influencer endorsement (SMIE) and self-image congruence (SIC) for luxury residential properties (LRPs). Design/methodology/approach: Around 516 high-income homebuyers in Vietnam who shared information about LRP on social media were targeted to test the research model empirically. The primary data collected from paper-based surveys were analysed using SPSS 26 and AMOS 24. Findings: Results indicate that FGC and UGC positively impact SMBE and consequently significantly affect brand trust. Further, results confirm the moderating roles of SMIE and SIC in the effects of FGC and UGC on SMBE. Research limitations/implications: Data and sample size were limited to meet the generalisation from different nations and cross cultures. Practical implications: The authors' findings suggest that marketers should apply the authors' integrated SMBE model to strengthen brand–consumer interactions and increase their sales revenue. Originality/value: This study is the first in its application of the uses and gratifications theory and self-congruence theory to investigate how SMBE mediates the relationship between FGC and brand trust as well as between UGC and brand trust.

Design/methodology/approach: Using data from three consumer surveys in Vietnam, South Korea and Poland, this study employs polynomial regression with response surface analysis as a methodological approach to assess the complementary, balanced and imbalanced effects of cultural dimensions (COL and LTO) on consumers' green purchase intention (GPI) and behaviors. Findings: First, this study found that, in Vietnam, both COL and LTO had a significant positive effect on GPI. However, only COL demonstrated a significant effect on GPI in South Korea and Poland. Second, this study also revealed that, in all three countries, when COL and LTO were in agreement, the degree of GPI was higher when COL and LTO were higher. The findings also showed that an increase in the imbalance between COL and LTO integration in the Vietnam sample led to a decrease in consumers' GPI. However, this relationship was insignificant in the South Korea and Poland samples.

To address these gaps, this study developed a theoretical framework including MTEs, cognitive response, affective response, tourism motivation and tourist satisfaction with golf tourism using a stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory. Design/methodology/approach: The author collected data from domestic and international tourists that attended amateur golf tournaments for non-commercial purposes as amateur athletes in Jeju and Gunsan, South Korea, in 2022. Construct validity of the measurement scale was verified by confirmatory factor analysis, factor loadings, average variance extracted and construct reliability. The reliability of the measurement scale was verified by Cronbach's analysis. The current study utilizes structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimation to analyze the positive relationships and double mediating effects. Jamovi statistical software was also used to conduct a moderation analysis. Findings: The findings displayed the significant impacts of MTEs on cognitive response, affective response, and tourist satisfaction, and the positive impacts of cognitive response and affective response on tourist satisfaction. Moreover, cognitive and affective responses were found to partially mediate the aforementioned relationships and golf tourism motivation moderated the aforementioned paths. Originality/value: The current study shows that there is a double mediating role of the cognitive and affective responses and moderating role of tourism motivation on the relationship between MTEs and tourist satisfaction and explores golf tourists who participate in an amateur golf tournament for non-commercial purposes as amateur athletes, which has largely been ignored in golf tourism research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cognitive and affective responses; Golf tourism; Memorable tourism experiences; Stimulus-organism-response theory; Tourism motivation; Tourist satisfaction",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a research model that integrates attributes from the technology acceptance model, perceived product quality, logistics service quality, risk, and food safety trust. Structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the causal relationships using data from 851 Chinese customers. Findings: The results indicated that perceived usefulness, product quality, and logistics service quality significantly enhance Chinese customers' intention to shop online for fresh agricultural products. Further, the positive effects increase when customer trust in food safety changes from low to high. In contrast, perceived risk reduces Chinese customers' willingness to engage in online shopping, but the negative influence is weaker for customers with high trust in food safety than for those with low trust. However, perceived ease of use plays an insignificant role in predicting online purchase intention and the impact does not vary depending on food safety trust.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a structured questionnaire to measure the variables of the research. The study successfully obtained useable data from a sample of 491 consumers residing in India. The analysis of the variables and their relationships was done using structural equation modelling using SMARTPLS4 software. Findings: The relationship between the values of NEP and CFC was observed in the context of electric cars that has a significant impact on the intention to buy and pay a premium. It also highlights the role of CFC future and CFC immediate on the intention to buy and between NEP and the intention to pay a premium. Research limitations/implications: The study only covers electric cars, and therefore further testing of these relationships is required in the context of other forms of environmentally friendly transportation. The results are generalizable across the potential consumers of EC but are even more pertinent to higher-income millennial consumers. Practical implications: Potential buyers of electric cars, having a positive orientation towards the environment and also consideration for future consequence, were observed to have a stronger intention to buy EC. The study finds a way in increasing the intention to buy an EC by catalyzing environmental concern of consumers through CFC future. Originality/value: This is the first study that has examined the NEP-CFC relationship, and provides evidence that the intention to buy an electric car is not only NEP (environmental concern)-dependent but also considers CFC's future orientation. This study adds the CFC aspect as another important variable regarding the purchase of EC, and proves that environmental concern is not the only moderating factor to buy an EC. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consideration of future consequences (CFC); Electric cars (EC); Intention to buy; Intention to pay a premium; New ecological paradigm (NEP)",""

Two types of nostalgic brand spokes-characters (i.e., eliciting personal nostalgia and historical nostalgia) were examined separately and compared to verify their contributions to more positive brand attitude, as well as related mechanisms, that is, whether consumer trust in the spokes-character mediated the relationship between nostalgic spokes-characters and brand attitude. Design/methodology/approach: An experiment was first conducted to test the causal effects of brand spokes-characters designed to elicit two types of nostalgic feelings (i.e., personal nostalgia and historical nostalgia). Then, the authors investigated the influencing mechanism of nostalgic brand spokes-characters based on bootstrap mediation models. Findings: The results revealed that for less familiar brand spokes-characters, either type of nostalgia-driven design would enhance consumers' brand attitude.

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is tested using a sample of 822 participants by employing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Hypothetical relationships among MPE, PH, PT, purchase intention (PI) and social class are examined for both hedonic and utilitarian products. Findings: The results highlight the positive role of MPE in leveraging consumer PI through the parallel mediation of PH and PT. The positive effect of MPE on PH and PT was more pronounced for the utilitarian product. In addition, social class negatively moderated the relationship between PH and PI only in the case of the utilitarian product. Originality/value: This paper contributed to the MPE literature in the food industry by challenging the conventional intuition of “Unhealthy = Tasty” and highlighting the potential of perceived food healthiness to positively influence perceived food tastiness under the effect of MPE. An upper social class would attenuate the positive effect of perceived food healthiness on PI. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health communication; Marketing placebo effect; Perceived healthiness; Perceived tastiness; Promotions management; Reduced-sugar labeling",""

The study aims to expand upon the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) framework to accomplish this objective by integrating the critical dimension of technology readiness (TR). Design/methodology/approach: Four hundred and fifty-three (453) inbound tourists were asked to share their feedbacks on their recent OTA booking experience. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to confirm the study model and test the study hypotheses. Findings: This study found that the motivating TR attributes favourably affect the acceptance and actual use of OTAs, while the inhibitors TR reflects adverse effects on OTA’s usage. On the other hand, the OTAs usage attributes: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, price value and habit are all significant determinants of consumers' behavioural intention. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in providing a more comprehensive explanation and prediction of consumer behaviour in relation to OTAs. Specifically, it recognises the importance of TR as a significant determinant of technology adoption and usage within the service industry realm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hotel booking; Online travel agents (OTAs); Technology readiness; UTAUT2",""
"The interplay among trust, reciprocity and commitment factors in facilitating supply chain collaboration: the case of Vietnamese fishery industry","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199355520&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2024-0445&partnerID=40&md5=5e6cf7e22a1f44cfa55911dc5f453393","Purpose: Supply chain collaboration is increasingly important in today’s competitive business environment. While prior research has acknowledged the role of relationships in facilitating collaboration, few studies have considered inter-personal and inter-organisational attributes simultaneously. This study addresses this gap by investigating these two levels of the manufacturer-supplier relationship in Vietnam’s fishery industry and their impacts on supply chain collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was distributed to 635 fishery manufacturers in Vietnam by the drop-and-collect method. EFA and CFA were used to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model, while CB-SEM was employed for structural model assessment and hypothesis testing. Findings: Supply chain collaboration encompasses incentive alignment, collaborative communication, decision synchronisation, and information sharing. All antecedents, including commitment, inter-organisational trust, reciprocity, and inter-personal trust, positively affect collaboration. Inter-personal trust positively influences the other antecedents, and inter-organisational trust enhances commitment. Furthermore, there are partial mediating effects among these relationship attributes. However, no significant moderating effect regarding firm size is observed. Originality/value: The study extends the social exchange theory to encompass both inter-personal and inter-organisational relationship attributes. Additionally, it pioneers in investigating the interrelatedness of these antecedents. By addressing the research gap in the Vietnamese fishery supply chain, it offers valuable insights for both academics and practitioners, contributing to theoretical understanding and practical implications in supply chain collaboration. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fishery supply chain; Inter-organisational relationship; Inter-personal relationship; Supply chain collaboration",""

Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, data was collected from 313 tourism and hospitality firms. To test the model, this study applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the relationships among environmental strategy, SMC, supplier trust and service attractiveness in a mediation-moderation setting. Findings: The results indicate that the multiple mediation effects of environmental strategy may indirectly influence tourist attractiveness through SMC and tourism services. The two-way moderating effects reveal that supplier trust and socialization strengthen the service attractiveness development process, while three-way interaction discovered that socialization and supplier trust positively moderate the relationships between tourism services and service attractiveness. Originality/value: Sustainable strategy is a future trend for tourism business management; however, unknown to most is the role of marketing and environmental strategy in tourism business due to lack of integration with concepts in marketing strategy, with the multidimensionality of tourism services, and with the function of trust and socialization, critically undermining analyses of service attractiveness.

However, chaotic sources and homogenized content have led to poor user experiences. Taking Kulangsu and Xi'an City Wall in China as examples, this study explored the influence of matching short-form video sources with destination types on user engagement and visit intention. Design/methodology/approach: This study selected three short-form videos from different sources for each destination on TikTok and conducted an empirical research using a 3 × 2 experimental design to examine the proposed research model. Findings: The results showed that the matching effect between short-form video sources and destination types will positively affect user engagement and visit intention. (1) the short-form videos with user-generated content (UGC) or professional user-generated content (PUGC) in hedonic destinations can obtain higher user engagement and visit intention; (2) the short-form videos with professionally generated content (PGC) or PUGC in utilitarian destinations can obtain higher user engagement and visit intention and (3) perceived credibility and perceived usefulness played mediating roles in these interactions. Originality/value: This study considers short-form video sources as antecedent variables influencing user engagement and visit intention and confirms the matching effect between short-form video sources and tourism destination types.

The authors propose an analytical model to investigate the impact of PWYW delivery pricing on the online food delivery (OFD) platforms. Design/methodology/approach: Using a game-theoretic model, the authors characterize the equilibrium as a function of the platform's average delivery cost and the consumer's social preferences parameters like fairness and reciprocity. The authors derive the parametric conditions under which PWYW generates higher profits for the platform compared to the traditional pay-as-asked delivery pricing. Findings: For the PWYW strategy to be profitable, the average delivery cost to the platform should be low. Therefore, OFD platform managers should focus on reducing delivery costs. The authors also identify the feasible region in which the platform managers need to maintain the consumer's social preferences. Practical implications: Under PWYW, the authors recommend that the platform managers impose a minimum delivery fee which consumers can use as a benchmark to minimize zero delivery fee payments and consumers' free-riding tendencies simultaneously. This allows OFD platforms to extract online orders from highly price-conscious consumers. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to explore the innovative application of PWYW to a particular segment of delivery pricing in OFD platforms. The authors establish that the overall consumer surplus and social welfare are higher under the PWYW strategy, forming a solid ground for its implementation in OFD platforms. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Online food delivery; Pay-as-asked; Pay-what-you-want; Pricing; Sharing economy; Social preferences",""

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from customers who had experience with omni-channel shopping in South Korea through a questionnaire made with Naver Forms, both online and offline from 15 June to 15 July 2022. Out of the received responses, only valid and consistent questionnaires were considered for statistical analysis. In total, 272 valid samples were utilised for the final analysis. Analyses included reliability, validity, path, structural equation modelling and mediation effects, using SPSS and AMOS software. Findings: The results revealed a significant influence of personal innovativeness on the omni-channel customer experience across all purchase stages. Personal innovativeness was found to influence the customer experience in the pre- and post–purchase stages, thus affecting reuse intention. However, it did not have the same effect in the purchase stage. The omni-channel experience customer experience also played an indirect mediating role in the relationship between personal innovativeness and reuse intention. Research limitations/implications: First, personal innovativeness in the IT domain may be very prominent in studies examining innovative behaviours related to computing technology. Second, this study provides further understanding of customers' intentions to reuse omni-channel shopping. Third, the path analysis showed that personal innovativeness significantly affects customer experience at all pre-purchase, purchase and post–purchase stages of the customer journey. However, except for the purchase experience, both pre- and post–purchase experiences significantly impact customers' intention to reuse omni-channels and play a mediating role. Practical implications: First, omni-channel retailers should launch new products, innovative promotional activities and explore new channels or new service modes to stimulate the need recognition of customers with high personal innovativeness. Second, omni-channel retailers should pay attention to the users' reviews of each channel because they play a key role in potential customers' purchase decisions. Third, offering customers a seamless shopping experience is essential as a marketing strategy for omni-channel retailing. Originality/value: This study elucidates the causal relationship between personal characteristics and behaviour by dividing the omni-channel customer journey. In particular, personal innovativeness is identified as an important predictor of the intention to reuse omni-channels during the pre- and post–purchase stages. This suggests that omni-channel retailers need to strategically manage these stages to boost customers' reuse intention. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer experience; Customer journey; Personal innovativeness; Reuse intention",""

Findings: By testing competing CBBE models, the main research model was found to have the greatest predictive ability, due to its inclusion of both the rational and emotional paths and the cross-over effect between consumer brand judgment and brand feeling. This paper indicates that consumers enhance brand equity and develop a strong ongoing relationship with regional wine brands by simultaneously engaging in both mental behavior paths, where, in the meantime, rational processing has a cross-over effect on emotional processing. Originality/value: This study expands the brand management literature by answering the future research on the CBBE model identified by Hall et al. (2021). Moreover, it establishes the underexplored cross-over effect within the CBBE literature. Furthermore, it adds to the marketing and wine-marketing literature by extending the concept of the brand to other attributes in consumer choice, such as a wine region as outlined by Giacomarra et al. (2020). Thus, this study advances the existing branding knowledge in a practical sense, which enables regional wine marketers and wine retailers to undertake promotional and product development strategies accordingly. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Complex product category; Consumer-based brand equity; Consumer-brand relationship; Cross-over effect",""

However, most of the existing research focuses on investigating the application of theories to explain consumer behavior related to intention to use and adopt IVAs, while ignoring the impact of its privacy issues on consumer resistance. This article especially examines the negative impact of artificial intelligence-based IVAs’ privacy concerns on consumer resistance, and studies the mediating effect of perceived creepiness in the context of privacy cynicism and privacy paradox and the moderating effect of anthropomorphized roles of IVAs and perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) of IVAs’ companies. The demographic variables are also included. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the theory of human–computer interaction (HCI), this study addresses the consumer privacy concerns of IVAs, builds a model of the influence mechanism on consumer resistance, and then verifies the mediating effect of perceived creepiness and the moderating effect of anthropomorphized roles of IVAs and perceived CSR of IVAs companies. This research explores underlying mechanism with three experiments. Findings: It turns out that consumers’ privacy concerns are related to their resistance to IVAs through perceived creepiness. The servant (vs. partner) anthropomorphized role of IVAs is likely to induce more privacy concerns and in turn higher resistance. At the same time, when the company’s CSR is perceived high, the impact of the concerns of IVAs’ privacy issues on consumer resistance will be weakened, and the intermediary mechanism of perceiving creepiness in HCI and anthropomorphism of new technology are further explained and verified. The differences between different age and gender are also revealed in the study. Originality/value: The research conclusions have strategic reference significance for enterprises to build the design framework of IVAs and formulate the response strategy of IVAs’ privacy concerns. And it offers implications for researchers and closes the research gap of IVAs from the perspective of innovation resistance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphized roles; Appraisal-tendency framework; Consumer resistance; Creepiness; Intelligent voice assistants; Perceived corporate social responsibility; Privacy concerns",""

However, research on the relative effects of COO compared to other geographical indicators, such as region-of-origin (ROO), on food purchases is still limited. This study investigates how geographical origin labels influence consumers' perceptions of product value and authenticity of foreign food, as well as subsequent purchase intention (PI) and willingness to pay premium prices (WTPPP). The moderating role of health consciousness on these relationships is also examined due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a between-subjects experimental design conducted with 300 middle- and high-income Chinese consumers aged between 25 and 50 years. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Findings: Whilst under both COO and ROO cues, all five product values positively influenced consumers' WTPPP, only functional, economic and novelty values influenced PI. The ROO cue performed significantly better than the COO cue in eliciting functional, economic and novelty value perceptions, which triggered stronger PI and willingness to pay a premium price. These relationships were mediated by product authenticity (PA) and moderated by consumers' health consciousness (HC). Practical implications: Because food labels provide salient product information that facilitates consumers' evaluation of products, marketers should assess which product value perceptions they wish to enhance and then choose the appropriate geographical indicators for their labelling strategies. Originality/value: This study identifies the effects of COO and ROO cues on product values, authenticity, PI and WTPPP. It also provides valuable insights into the role of HC on consumers' purchase decisions, which also aids in understanding the impact of global crises on food purchases. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food labelling; Health consciousness; Premium price; Product authenticity; Product labels; Product values; Willingness to pay",""

Studies have reported that authenticity and credibility increase followers' PWOM and have identified the dimensions of authenticity (i.e. originality, naturalness and continuity) and credibility (i.e. attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise). However, the mechanisms underlying the associations among these dimensions are unclear. Drawing from social exchange theory, the authors developed an integrated conceptual model and explored how the dimensions of SMI authenticity affect those of followers' perception of credibility. Moreover, the authors analyzed how followers' perception of credibility affects the followers' PWOM behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected 463 valid questionnaires from respondents that followed at least one SMI. Additionally, the authors developed a structural equation model for data analysis. Findings: The results revealed that the subdimensions of SMI authenticity have different effects on followers' perception of credibility. An SMI's continuity positively affects followers' perceptions of the SMI's trustworthiness and expertise. The naturalness of an SMI positively affects followers' perception of the SMI's attractiveness but nonsignificantly affects followers' perception of the SMI's trustworthiness. Additionally, an SMI's originality positively affects followers' perception of the SMI's attractiveness but negatively affects followers' perception of the SMI's trustworthiness. Finally, followers' perceptions of an SMI's attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise all positively affect followers' PWOM behavior. Originality/value: By employing multidimensional constructs, the authors obtained results that provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of SMI authenticity on the SMI's followers' perception of followers' credibility. These results can be used by SMIs to increase SMIs followers' PWOM by determining which aspects of authenticity and credibility SMIs should develop. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Authenticity; Credibility; Positive word-of-mouth; Social media influencers",""

Based on the stimulus–organism–response (S-O-R) paradigm, this study develops and tests a theoretical model investigating the effects of football-game socialisation, team interest, football interest and transaction satisfaction (stimuli) on fanship and cumulative satisfaction (organism), and subsequently, attitudinal loyalty and behavioural loyalty (response). National culture was a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered online survey collected data from a convenience sample of 762 football fans from Brazil, China and Germany. Findings: The PLS-SEM results support the S-O-R based model, indicating that football fan-loyalty behaviours are determined by fanship and cumulative satisfaction with the team. Fan experiences, in turn, are also found to be influenced by fan perceptions relating to socialisation, team interest, football interest and transaction satisfaction—elements over which the football team's management may exert some degree of control. Some national cultural differences were found, with three of the model's 12 structural paths significantly different for Germany vis-à-vis Brazil. Originality/value: This study advances the authors’ understanding of the significance of socialisation and fan-interest factors for football, providing evidence supporting the role of the fan experience and service-consumption stimuli related to those game experiences as significant drivers (stimuli) of the fan's affective (fanship) and cognitive states (cumulative satisfaction). This study enriches the limited body of evidence on fanship's role as a driver of attitudinal and behavioural loyalty.

This article aims to present and empirically test a causal model to account for the pattern of discontinuous intention of attention to YouTuber channels. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the expectation–disconfirmation theory, the study proposes and examines a research model by using an empirical quantitative approach. The proposed model considers channel and YouTuber facets, as well as potential moderation effects of viewing seniority. Findings: Analysis of a sample of 406 questionnaires revealed that ads interference is not a significant reason for discontinuation of viewing a channel, in contrast to insufficient playfulness and inconsistency. Regarding YouTubers’ features, both interaction inadequacy and negative self-disclosure are significant determinants of perceived dissatisfaction and discontinuation of viewing. The effects of determinants of discontinuity depend on viewers' seniorities, except for negative self-disclosure. Originality/value: While existing studies have focused mainly on revealing the determinants associated with the behavioral intention of viewing YouTuber channels to increase self-media performance, this research contributes insights into the literature investigating why existing viewers stop following a certain YouTuber channel. From a psychological perspective, this study demonstrates the value of modeling discontinuous behaviors toward YouTuber channels in the domain of social marketing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Channel features; Expectation-disconfirmation theory; YouTuber channel; YouTuber features",""

Design/methodology/approach: We construct a supply chain model with a retail platform as the leader and manufacturers as the followers. Manufacturers face differential consumer preferences on the same agency retail platform, and they can sell a bundled extended service product and sell a separate product without any extended service. Findings: The sale of extended warranty services on the retail platform leads to lower pricing of the manufacturers' products and changes in the product market structure in response to differences in consumer preferences. The retailing platform tends to provide an extended warranty conditionally. The sale of extended warranty services on a retail platform would be detrimental to the interests of the manufacturer who sells products with extended warranty services and in favor of the manufacturer who sells products without them.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey-based empirical study was conducted with 395 respondents. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling and Hayes process Macro in SPSS. Findings: SFC was found to be positively influenced by personal FOMO. Contrary to expectations, social FOMO had a negative correlation with SFC. Social influence and social identity were shown to be positively correlated, whilst the social influence-SFC relationship was favourable. This approach was aided by social identity. Research limitations/implications: The study supports personal FOMO as an SFC-influencing factor. It evaluates the differential effects of FOMO’s personal and social dimensions on SFC. It also demonstrates that social FOMO negatively affects SFC, contrary to expectations.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected using online surveys from 224 Gen Y and 238 Gen Z mobile banking users. The study uses the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique and an asymmetrical analytical approach through fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the effects of five experience dimensions (pragmatic, usability, affective, sensory and social) and satisfaction on continuance intention. Findings: Whilst Gen Z values pragmatic and affective experiences more than Gen Y and assigns less importance to usability experience (Uxp), both PLS-SEM and fsQCA did not find any significant impact of sensory experience (Sxp) in any cohort. In contrast, fsQCA suggests that social experience could play a significant role for specific segments within both generations. Furthermore, PLS-SEM demonstrates a greater impact of satisfaction on continuance intention for Gen Y than for Gen Z. Research limitations/implications: The sample consists of high/middle-income urban consumers in one country. Future research could investigate low-income and semi-urban/rural consumers and consumers living in other countries. Practical implications: Banks must recognise the diversity within and between Gen Y and Gen Z, adopting a segmented user experience approach. Users within each generation may prioritise distinct aspects of the mobile banking app and understanding the specific differences between Gen Y and Gen Z preferences is crucial. Social implications: Encouraging mobile banking users to engage in community-driven financial initiatives can inspire non-users, promoting digital financial inclusion. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to compare the customer experience-based psychological patterns of continued mobile banking use in Gen Y and Gen Z. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; Customer experience; Generation Y; Generation Z; Mobile banking",""

This study uses the diffusion of innovation (DOI) literature to assess an integrated model including smartphone addiction, technology-related and consumer-related factors that influence consumers' intention to use MPS. It also explores the interplay of situational variables and smartphone addiction in shaping this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors base the conceptual model on the theory of rational addiction and the theory of optimal flow. This model is then empirically validated through data collected from seven hundred users of MPS in India. Research hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. Findings: The study finds that smartphone addiction has a positive impact on millennials' perceived advantages, compatibility, trialability and observability of MPS but does not significantly affect their perceived complexity or risk. The results also suggest that the relationship between smartphone addiction and MPS is moderated by situational factors. In low-priority situations, smartphone addiction strengthens millennials' perceptions and intentions to use MPS, while in high-priority situations, situational factors overshadow the impact of smartphone addiction. Originality/value: The findings of the study enable organizations to capitalize on smartphone addiction-driven MPS adoption behavior to sustain long-term usage behavior by appropriately understanding the context/situation which drives MPS adoption. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Millennials; Mobile payment; Situational variable; Smartphone addiction; Technology addiction",""

One of the most exciting of these is urban air mobility (UAM), and one of its challenges is constructing effective and efficient UAM service network. This study took a quantitative approach to the problem in an effort to support and facilitate the UAM service industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study derived a multi-objective and multi-period (MOMP) location optimization model to support strategic UAM service network design. The model, based on its long-term service plan, determines where and when to open UAM airports. In addition, this study applied a modified e-constraint algorithm to derive managerial decisions on the Pareto relationship in consideration of multiple objectives and multiple periods. Findings: Each Pareto solution represents a different UAM service network configuration. Thus, the model can analyze the trade-offs between Pareto decisions for the UAM service network. A case study of UAM service network design in South Korea demonstrates the validity of the proposed mathematical model and algorithm. Practical implications: The design of a UAM service network should consider various aspects. Its construction and operation would require significant investments of time, capital and people, which would redound to society over a significant span of time. The results of this study provide quantitative guidelines for derivation and analysis of various UAM service network configurations in consideration of multiple objectives and multiple periods.

Special agricultural products have symbolic and social functions that effectively meet psychological needs and stimulate compensatory consumption behavior. The social commerce context not only enriches consumer experience but also influences consumer purchase decisions. This study constructs a model based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory to explore the mechanism of compensatory consumption behavior of special agricultural products in a social commerce context. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a two-stage method of partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze 523 valid samples collected through random sampling. PLS-SEM was used to examine the relationships and effects between the variables; fsQCA was used to conduct a cohort analysis between the variables to further reveal the complexity and diversity of compensatory consumption behaviors. Findings: PLS-SEM indicates that product attributes and social affordances influence consumers’ triggering of compensatory consumption behavior for control and belongingness needs. fsQCA shows that there are three different modes, and the satisfaction of belongingness or control needs is a necessary condition for triggering compensatory consumption behavior. Originality/value: There is limited research on compensatory consumption behavior specifically focused on special agricultural products. This study explores the influencing factors and mechanisms of compensatory consumption behavior related to special agricultural products. The occurrence of compensatory consumption behavior is not only influenced by product attributes but also by the social commerce environment.

Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments were conducted. The first was a two-part (virus: anthropomorphic vs non-anthropomorphic) between-subject design that measured the participants' risk perception and compliance intention. The second experiment used a three-part (cuteness: cute vs non-cute vs control) between-subjects design. The third experiment used a three-part (cuteness: cute vs non-cute vs control) by two-part (aggressive guidance: present vs absent) between-subject design. Findings: Anthropomorphism of the virus increased risk perception, thus influencing protective behavior and the effectiveness of warning signs, but only when the message was not perceived as cute. Aggressive messages and cute images of baby schemata enhanced compliance intention to warning guidelines. Practical implications: The results provide a theoretical basis for studying the effectiveness of anthropomorphized warning signs and suggest implications for the impact of anthropomorphism on risk communication and compliance. Originality/value: This study highlights that cuteness, often accompanied by anthropomorphism, may evoke inferences that reduce the effect of risk communication to induce compliance intention.

Design/methodology/approach: The experiment was conducted with 180 college students, using eye-tracking technology to explore the impact mechanism of live background visual complexity on consumers' purchase intention, considering three types of background visual complexity (high vs medium vs low) and two levels of need for cognitive closure (high vs low). Findings: Firstly, the background visual complexity of live-streaming positively influences consumers' purchase intention by eliciting positive emotions (pleasure and arousal), and the relationship between consumer emotions and purchase intention is nonlinear. Secondly, need for cognitive closure to significantly moderate the influence of background visual complexity on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The limited sample size makes it difficult to generalize to other consumer groups. Also, the study only focuses on one visual factor, lacking comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives. Practical implications: It is recommended that live e-commerce companies optimize the visual design of live-streaming backgrounds and identify consumer traits to match the visual complexity with consumers' level of need for cognitive closure, thereby stimulating positive emotions and facilitating more satisfactory shopping decisions. Originality/value: This paper addresses an interesting and practical issue related to the effects of live background visual complexity on consumers' purchase intention. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Background visual complexity; Eye-tracking experiments; Live marketing; Need for cognitive closure; Purchase intention",""

Design/methodology/approach: We collected questionnaire data from 1,399 respondents engaged in online shopping, including 65% females with an average age of 29.9. Latent profile analysis tested the hypotheses, using Mplus 8.3. Findings: The online shopping experience sometimes satisfies and sometimes frustrates consumers’ basic psychological needs for autonomy and competence. This research used latent profile analysis to identify two profiles of the online shopping experience: “satisfied-dominant” and “moderately satisfied/frustrated.” Online shoppers who experienced only need satisfaction showed adaptive consumer behavior in terms of positive word-of-mouth and high loyalty, while online shoppers who experienced both moderate need satisfaction and frustration showed maladaptive consumer behavior. Originality/value: An online shopping experience of need satisfaction vs frustration explains consumers’ adaptive vs maladaptive behavior. Specifically, when online shoppers experience only autonomy and competence need satisfaction, they engage in positive word-of-mouth and show high loyalty. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Basic psychological needs; Latent profile analysis; Loyalty; Online shopping; Word-of-mouth",""

It specifically examines how perceived value and perceived risk interact with the moderating effects of environmental, policy, and social factors to shape consumer behaviors towards EV adoption. The purpose is to delineate the intricate mechanisms driving consumer intentions in the context of sustainable mobility solutions. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a quantitative research design, this investigation collected data via a survey targeting consumers across various Asian countries. The study utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the responses, enabling a robust examination of the relationships between perceived value, perceived risk, and the potential moderating roles of external factors on consumer purchase intentions towards EVs. Findings: The analysis revealed that both perceived value and perceived risk significantly influence consumers' intentions to purchase EVs. It was also found that environmental factors effectively moderate the relationship between perceived risk and purchase intentions, while social factors moderate the relationship between perceived risk and purchase intentions, highlighting the complex influence of external elements on consumer decisions. Contrarily, policy factors did not exhibit a significant moderating impact on the relationships examined. Originality/value: This research enriches the domain of sustainable technology adoption by providing nuanced insights into the factors driving consumer intentions towards EVs in the Asian context. It underscores the critical roles of perceived value and risk, along with the distinct moderating effects of environmental and social factors, offering strategic implications for stakeholders within the EV ecosystem.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a model and examine the influence of small restaurant attributes (i.e. authenticity) on customers’ positive attitudes and behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Using 181 responses from customers of small restaurants, this study examines how the dimensions of authenticity (i.e. continuity, credibility, integrity, and symbolism) affect customers’ positive behavioral intentions through emotional attachment. Findings: The results of partial least squared–structural equation modeling demonstrate that customer perceptions of symbolism, credibility, and integrity in their experience at a small restaurant influence their attachment, which in turn influences both their word of mouth and revisit intentions. However, continuity has no significant effect on customers’ emotional attachment to service providers. Also, the effects of authenticity on customer behavior vary across demographic categories. Originality/value: With increasing competition in the small business context, service providers seek to understand how to create positive customer patronization behavior.

It also investigates the impact of balanced skills on leadership success in collectivist and assertive cultures. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods approach is employed using survey data from 766 American and Japanese managers and eight interviews across four diverse cultures. It uncovers the intricate relationship between leadership derailment risk and competency ambidexterity. Findings: Optimal competency ambidexterity lowers the risks of leadership incompetence (operationalized as derailment) but through distinct configurations of current and needed competencies, which both competencies should be congruent at high levels in uncertain environments. Furthermore, moderately high competency levels mitigate derailment risk in collaborative cultures (Japan and China), while very assertive cultures (USA and Netherlands) require high competencies to lower derailment danger and sustain leadership effectiveness. Practical implications: Leaders must maintain competency ambidexterity, adapting to diverse contexts in our dynamic world. Recognizing cultural nuances is essential for enhancing managers’ skills in global talent management. Originality/value: Cultural values shape competency configurations and managers should balance organizational and personal competencies for effective leadership.

Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was disseminated to participants residing in the Lucknow region of India. We conducted an experiment in which 374 participants evaluated the factors on a stimulus (chips packaging) using an online survey. Collected data were analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The result suggests that packaging semiotics exhibits a positive influence on brand image and perceived brand quality of consumers. The brand image significantly impacts brand loyalty and consumers’ purchase intention. In addition, the perceived brand quality has a positive significant impact on brand loyalty, but a negative and insignificant influence on purchase intention. The results show that both brand image and perceived brand quality significantly mediate the relation between packaging semiotics and brand loyalty. Brand image significantly mediates but perceived brand quality does not mediate the relation between packaging semiotics and purchase intention. Practical implications: The results of the study will assist food brands in determining how to utilise semiotics in packaging to positively influence brand image, perceived brand quality, brand loyalty and consumers’ intent to purchase. Originality/value: The study is unique in the sense that it assesses the role of packaging semiotics as antecedent in mapping of brand loyalty and purchase intention through brand image and perceived product quality.

This study attempts to examine responses toward culture mixing based on spatial metaphor theory. Specifically, it focuses on power relationships to explore the impact of space image schemas on consumer attitudes. The boundary conditions of this effect, the significance of cultural symbols and the dominance trait are also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments are conducted, and 567 participants are involved in this research. The data are analyzed using ANOVA and Process 213. Findings: The results show that the relative vertical positions of cultural symbols significantly impact consumer attitudes toward culture mixing, and demonstrate that perceived cultural threat enhances ethnocentric tendencies. The data also indicate that individuals only express their distinct attitudes toward culture mixing when significant cultural symbols are presented, and only high-dominance individuals, who prefer to link vertical spatial metaphor with power relationships, are sensitive to vertical spatial metaphor. Originality/value: This research highlights the underlying mechanism, encouraging ethnocentric tendencies among the young population in China. It extends work on the use of metaphorical concepts and contributes to the increasing literature on power in consumer behavior.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper focuses on a GSC consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer is risk-averse (R-A). This paper employs Stackelberg game theory and mean variance analysis to assess the pricing decision-making process under various scenarios. Furthermore, cost-sharing contracts are introduced to coordinate the GSC. Findings: The research results suggest that the green level of the product and the profit of the GSC under a centralized scenario are higher than those under a decentralized scenario, while the retail price is lower. Under the decentralized scenario, the green level of product, wholesale price and manufacturer’s profit in the R-A scenario are lower than the values in the risk-neutrality scenario, while retailer's profit is higher. In addition, when a cost-sharing contract is utilized for coordination in the GSC, it can lead to Pareto improvement, regardless of whether the manufacturer makes risk-neutrality or R-A decisions. Originality/value: This research provides a deeper understanding of GSC decision-making and coordination strategy under mixed carbon policy with consideration of R-A from a theoretical perspective and provides decision support for enterprises to choose strategies in practice. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cost-sharing contract; Green supply chain; Mixed carbon policy; Risk-averse",""

The purpose of this research was to explore the mechanisms that prompt consumers to stay or leave after content anchors transfer to live e-commerce broadcasts. In addition, we explored the factors affecting consumption from the perspectives of anchors, consumers and the external environment. Design/methodology/approach: We distributed questionnaires to a group of fans who had experienced the transition of content anchors to live streaming and received back 375 valid questionnaires. Using psychological contract theory, we constructed a theoretical model for the scenario in which content anchors transition to live e-commerce broadcasting and analysed the data using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that circle culture, mainstream culture, initial trust and live streaming content all positively influenced consumers’ attitudes, whilst consumers’ past shopping experiences negatively influenced consumers’ attitudes. The personal charm of the content anchors did not have a significant effect on consumers’ attitudes. Additionally, we found that only anchors with a significant circle culture and good trust levels amongst fans were able to transition to live e-commerce streaming successfully. Originality/value: This study extends the application of psychological contract theory to the field of e-commerce and describes the transformation of different types of psychological contracts. The paper’s conclusions provide a reference for decision-making and the implementation of transformation by content-based anchors to live streaming, helping them to coordinate their relationships with fans more effectively. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Content anchor; E-commerce; Live streaming; Purchase intention; Transformation",""

The authors empirically examined how ethical messages influence advertisement persuasiveness through ethical consumer guilt and positively impact consumer evaluations of ethical luxury products. Furthermore, the authors explored the moderating role of consumers’ independent versus interdependent self-construals. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted four experimental studies on the interplay among ethicality, luxury brand positioning and self-construal. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that moral emotions were responsible for the effect of ethical luxury advertisements that address animal welfare on brand attitude. Findings: Advertisement messages signaling a luxury brand’s ethical efforts increase empathy through ethical consumer guilt, thereby generating favorable attitudes toward luxury products. However, this effect is limited to consumers with independent self-construal in South Korea and the United States of America.

Design/methodology/approach: Panel data were collected from 17 international luxury brands on the Douyin live streaming platform in an 18 week period from August to December 2020 and analyzed by using a two-way fixed effects model. Findings: The authors compared different mega-, macro- and micro-streamer channels within live streaming commerce and found that the densities of mega- and macro-streamer channels had significant positive impacts on luxury brand sales in live streaming commerce. Moreover, the effects of the density of streamer channel on luxury brand sales were moderated by such variables as product line breadth, product line depth, product type (star/non-star) and product price (high/low). The authors found that product line breadth and depth could reduce the positive impact of the densities of mega- and macro-streamer channels on luxury brand sales. For star products and high-priced products, the relationship between the density of mega-streamer channel and luxury brand sales was more likely to be observed than for non-star products and low-priced products. The relationship between the density of macro-streamer channel and luxury brand sales was more likely to be observed in low-priced products than in high-priced products. Originality/value: The findings make important contributions to the literature in that the authors expand the influencer-brand fit theory by proposing a new model of effects of the densities of mega-, macro- and micro-streamer channels on sales performance across different luxury products to improve our understanding of the fit among influencers, brands and products.

Korean participants are to be used for this study. The present research further investigated the impacts of categorization and averaging bias in relation to the health halo phenomenon, specifically focusing on traditional food and textured vegetable protein (soy meat) burgers. Thus, the present research investigated how consumers' intentions contrasted with their consumption goals in food choice circumstances. Design/methodology/approach: We partitioned the survey due to the COVID-19 epidemic. A single, well trained surveyor first surveyed customers at cafés in Seoul and six other Korean cities. We received 102 in-person survey replies. A total of 254 advanced degree or undergraduate students from two universities completed an online questionnaire. There are 356 responses. Two studies were conducted where participants were instructed to evaluate the perceived healthiness, calorie content, and sodium level of different food items. The specifics of each study are elucidated in the main body of the paper. Findings: This study shows that Koreans categorize meals as virtue or vice depending on their perceived healthiness, validating the categorization effect. Furthermore, this research demonstrated that consumers' perceptions of the health benefits of traditional meals and soy meat burgers impact their categorization. Koreans also assessed the average of the vice and virtue and found vice-virtue combination meals healthier than the vice alone. This affects how calories and sodium are perceived. This study also shown that high virtue affects averaging bias more than weak virtue in meals with vice and virtue combo. Originality/value: This study extended food categorization and averaging bias to non-US consumers and confirmed this contradictory meal choice is universal. Health halo also affects food health perception. The results of this study revealed that Koreans consider traditional food healthier than western junk food. Korean customers incorrectly assume soy meat burgers have fewer calories and sodium than regular burgers. Thus, this study explains Korean consumers' food health misconceptions related to paradoxical consumption. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Averaging bias; Calorie and sodium; Categorization effect; Health halo; Korean consumers; Virtue and vice",""

These factors have led to the rise of new luxury consumption, which is different from traditional luxury consumption. This study examines how consumers’ identities shape their intentions to consume traditional luxury and new luxury brands. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical underpinnings of the schema congruity theory and heuristic systematic framework were applied to understand the role of identities in determining consumers’ regulatory focus, price luxuriousness inference and preference for traditional and new luxury brands. Findings: Findings suggest that the global identity of consumers shapes their promotion focus and price luxuriousness inferences. However, their local identities induce a prevention goal. Consumers with such a goal are unlikely to make price luxuriousness inferences. Further, these inferences lead to the choice of traditional luxury over new luxury brands. The results also establish the moderating effects of consumer flexibility. Originality/value: The extant literature is inconclusive on the role of globalization in luxury consumption and ignores new luxury brands. The current study shows the impact of identities and regulatory focus on traditional and new luxury consumption. The findings also indicate consumers’ regulatory focus and price luxuriousness inference as the reasons behind the influence. The paper also implies that consumers open to renting, sharing or buying second-hand goods will prefer new luxury over traditional luxury brands. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Heuristic systematic framework; Identities; Luxury consumption; New luxury; Regulatory focus; Schema congruity theory",""

Of paramount importance is the novel dimension introduced by this study the integration of trust in e-commerce platforms, GSCM practices, and the multifarious dimensions of online shopping all within a unified conceptual framework. Trust on e-commerce platforms leads to GSCM. GSCM determines online shopping satisfaction, i.e. efficiency, fulfillment, convenience, and privacy. Finally, GSCM mediates between trust on e-commerce platforms and online shopping satisfaction. Practical implications: This holistic approach represents a ground-breaking contribution to the existing body of literature. It presents a fresh perspective on the intricate interactions that define the contemporary e-commerce landscape. Originality/value: This initial research integrates trust in e-commerce platforms, GSCM, and online shopping in a single framework through UTAUT2. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer trust; E-commerce; Green supply chain management; Online shopping; Structural equation modeling",""
"Do family factors affect the usage intention of smart homes? A PLS-SEM empirical study from China","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184192288&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2023-0922&partnerID=40&md5=020c125b6b28650ee110cc0e1258ca54","Purpose: Despite the enormous benefits, smart homes (SHs) are still not widely adopted by residents in China. Furthermore, research on the intention to use SHs has overlooked the role of family factors. Thus, this study aims to propose a new research model to examine the impact of family factors on the usage intention (UI) of SHs. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 265 valid data from potential users of SHs in China using a convenience sampling method. The PLS-SEM method was applied to test the research model and related hypotheses. Findings: The empirical results confirm the mediating role of optimism (OP) in perceived family support (PFS)/perceived family trust (PFT) and attitude (AT). Unsurprisingly, the results validated the relationship between perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (AT) and UI of SHs through TAM theory. Besides, this study also identified the moderating effect of perceived risk (PR) between AT and UI. Practical implications: To improve SH adoption, practitioners should focus on family factors and utilize family influence to promote the spread of smart home reputation. Besides, SH practitioners should enhance user trust and reduce perceived risks through technological upgrades and security measures. Originality/value: Based on the Social Impact Theory and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study is an empirical attempt to explore the impact of family factors on the intention to use SHs, expanding the research on smart home adoption. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Family factors; Intention to use; Internet of things; Smart homes; Social impact theory; Technology acceptance model",""

Independent and joint effects of market orientation (MO), innovation orientation (IO) and sales control systems (SCS) on firm performance were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research methodology is adopted to compile firm-level primary data from manufacturing companies located in an organized industrial zone. Research data were collected by face-to-face surveys from 302 sales professionals. The research model and hypotheses were tested by using partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) with Smart PLS 3.0. Findings: In addition to confirming the positive effects of MO and IO on performance, data analyses revealed that SCS exert an indirect effect on company performance which is fully mediated by MO. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to a developing country context and research data was collected from a convenient sample of B2B companies by a cross-sectional study. Cross-cultural and longitudinal studies may provide additional insights. Firm level strategic orientations and sales control systems must be examined together in an integrated way to explore their effects on company performance. The individual effects of these structures on business performance may manifest differently when they come together. Practical implications: Results indicate that the sales control system setup is critical for the implementation of a market-oriented strategy. This study highlights the importance of setting a compatible sales control system to achieve organizational goals in accordance with the strategic orientations which affect the success of particular organizational strategies. Originality/value: Although the current literature identifies the independent and joint effects of market orientation and innovation orientation on company performance, empirical studies probing the interaction of sales control systems with these constructs is very scarce. Understanding how sales control systems relate to strategic orientations will help design a more effective sales organization and improve company performance. This study contributes to the literature by promoting additional insights by linking sales control systems with market orientation, innovation orientation and company performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Company performance; Innovation orientation; Market orientation; Sales control systems",""

"Effect of green advertising attitude on collectivist consumer behavior: an integrative approach","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161718245&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2022-0437&partnerID=40&md5=769715d57908a5d87ea7d1a58ed7f699","Purpose: Unlike traditional products and services, customer motivation to purchase green products/services may be due to non-marketing factors, such as their personal values about health. In this study, the authors aim to propose and validate an integrative model using both advertising attitude factors and health beliefs to explain purchase intention and word of mouth in the context of green marketing. The authors focus specifically on collectivist consumers as values and social norms that tend to be more salient in driving their decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The model was tested empirically using a survey study with 308 Chinese consumers in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed using confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) and partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: All health beliefs were significant predictors of green advertising attitude. Green satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between green advertising attitude and positive word of mouth for products and services with green advertising for collectivist Chinese consumers. Meanwhile, green satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between green advertising attitude and purchase intention. In addition, green brand equity partially mediates the green advertising attitude–purchase intention/positive word of mouth link. Practical implications: The significant impacts of health belief factors on green advertising attitude present important implications to advertising managers in terms of the use of information appeal in promoting green products/services. Green brand equity should also be developed in order to optimize green advertising effectiveness, especially in the context of collectivist customers.

Existing literature has demonstrated that providing sensory cues is an effective way to promote imaginative use or experience. However, such an approach seems to have been proposed for product that requires the use of body-related information (e.g. sensory information) for evaluation (high body-involving product). There is less literature on how to facilitate consumers’ imaginative use of product that requires relatively less bodily information (low body-involving product). Considering this, this research proposes a factor that influences the imaginative use of both high and low body-involving products, the character cues in the product image. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, two studies are conducted to verify the matching effect about presence or absence of character cues with product type (high body-involving vs. low body-involving) in facilitating imaginative use and the downstream effect. Findings: The experimental results indicate that high (low) body-involving product display images are suitable for present (absent) character cues, which can promote the mental imagery of use the product, increase perceived image attractiveness and ultimately increase purchase intentions. The research also verified the influence of distance between the product and the character cues on the above effects.

Specifically, this study solves the following questions: (1) What is the impact of BOPSC on their optimal price and sales volume of products? (2) When should an online retailer and an offline retailer conduct the BOPSC strategy with each other? Design/methodology/approach: The paper first establishes two game models to explore the equilibriums of online and offline retailers in non-BOPSC and BOPSC. Then the condition for online and offline retailers to implement BOPSC strategy are determined. Furthermore, the applicability of the BOPSC strategy is enhanced by incorporating numerical analysis. Findings: The study’s findings reveal that BOPSC strategy will not always beneficial to online and offline retailers, which depends on the total cost of online shopping and the product valuation of consumers. BOPSC strategy leads to the increase of prices and online orders, and the demand of offline retailer is eroded. Moreover, BOPS cooperation between different retailers is easier to achieve than omni-channel integration strategy. When the convenience difference between offline shopping and BOPSC pick-up is moderate, the effectiveness of BOPSC strategy can be improved. Originality/value: This study has the following two main contributions: Firstly, the authors investigate the effects of BOPSC strategy on the prices of online and offline retailers. The study results show that the BOPSC strategy alleviates price competition and promotes a win–win situation between online retailers and offline retailers. Secondly, this paper mainly studies the cooperative behavior between online and offline retailers and reveals the optimal conditions for online and offline retailers to adopt BOPSC strategy.

It also explores the interaction between these two types of information disclosure and their impact on purchase intention in the live-streaming sales context. Design/methodology/approach: An e-questionnaire survey was conducted in China, followed by multiple regression and structural equation modeling analyses. Findings: The disclosure of both negative and positive product information is positively correlated with consumers’ trust in the seller or product but does not directly affect their purchase intention. Negative information disclosure neither enhances nor diminishes the positive impact of disclosing positive information on consumer trust. Practical implications: Live-streaming sellers (i.e. retailers or manufacturers) should disclose both positive and negative product information to form consumers’ trust toward them (or products) and enhance sales. Social implications: Live-streaming sellers often worry about the negative effects of excessive promotions or disclosure of positive or negative product information. However, these negative effects were not statistically significant.

Design/methodology/approach: This research involved the administration of two sets of questionnaires during distinct periods: December 15 to December 30, 2022 and August 26 to September 2, 2023. The participants were college students from three universities in China, and the data collection utilized the “Questionnaire Star” platform. Only responses deemed valid and consistent were included in the subsequent statistical analysis. A total of 1,108 valid samples were used for the final analysis. Analyses including reliability, validity, path analysis, structural equation modeling, mediation effects and moderation effects were conducted using SPSS and AMOS software. Findings: The study revealed that both FOMO and PE exerted positive influences on users' addiction to social media applications. Furthermore, this addiction was found to have a negative effect on users' life satisfaction while simultaneously contributing positively to their intention to continue using these platforms. The mediating effect of social media application addiction and the moderating impact of self-regulation were also substantiated through the analysis. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, it is important to note that the research population of this study is limited to college students, which may limit its generalizability and representativeness. Although college students are a group known for their familiarity with and frequent use of smartphones and social media apps, the findings may not fully capture the behaviors of social media app users in other age groups. To enhance the understanding of social media app addiction across different age groups, future studies should consider expanding the research population and conducting multi-group difference analyses. Secondly, while focusing on specific users within a particular region can minimize unexplained variance in model estimation, it may also restrict the broader applicability of the study results. Therefore, future studies should consider testing the research model with diverse groups from different regions and cultural backgrounds. This approach will provide valuable insights into how social media app addiction may vary across various contexts, thereby enriching our understanding of this phenomenon. Practical implications: Our findings reveal that in the “attention economy” environment shaped by addiction, social media app managers should leverage technology to swiftly and accurately target audiences, attract them to their platforms and cultivate long-term relationships. Encouraging users to develop new beneficial habits through app-specific functions and precise services will foster continuous usage and unlock revenue and marketing opportunities for app companies. Social implications: Despite the extensive scholarly discourse on social media application addiction, there is a lack of a well-defined framework delineating how addictive user behaviors can be leveraged in the marketing strategies of social media application platforms. The present study seeks to address these gaps, contributing to a better understanding of the formation mechanisms and knowledge systems related to social media application addiction. By investigating the causes and consequences of such addiction, this research offers valuable insights and recommendations for the innovative development of these apps, given their widespread popularity. Concurrently, the study establishes a theoretical basis for the concept that users can mitigate the negative effects of social media addiction by exercising their own self-regulation. Originality/value: As the functionalities and features of social media apps converge, their individual uniqueness starts to diminish, intensifying the competition among social media companies. This escalating rivalry places higher demands on these companies. This study aims to aid social media app companies in comprehending and analyzing the diverse psychological needs of users. By enriching their platform features and services, leading users towards addiction and gaining an edge in the “Attention Economy” competition. Understanding and catering to users' needs will be instrumental in thriving within this dynamic and evolving attention economy landscape. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuous usage intention; Fear of missing out; Life satisfaction; Psychological enhancement; Self-regulation; Social media app addiction",""

"How do temporal psychological distance and grandiose narcissism affect tourists’ travel motivation and attraction visit intention?","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198093919&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2024-0116&partnerID=40&md5=299368c8ec78693aff85e1e8c0731bcc","Purpose: Literature has paid limited attention to narcissism’s influence on tourism. The pre-trip planning stage involves temporal psychological distance, where decision-making regarding the trip stretches over a period of time and occurs anytime during that period. Using narcissism theory and with temporal distance (6 months and 1 week before the trip) as the moderator, this study examines how tourists’ self-sacrificing self-enhancement and grandiose fantasy – grandiose narcissism facets – and travel motivations affect attraction visit intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was applied on survey information obtained from 374 individuals (200 and 174 were six-months and one-week scenarios, respectively). Findings: Grandiose narcissism facets affect motivations and visit intentions to various attractions at different temporal distances. The consequences of grandiose fantasy and self-sacrificing self-enhancement on motivation become evident as temporal distance decreases. At large temporal distances, grandiose fantasy positively influences social recognition motivation. At short temporal distances, it positively influences social recognition and ego and negatively influences scenery and relaxation motivations. Self-sacrificing self-enhancement positively influences socialization, exploration, scenery, relaxation and escape motivations at large temporal distances. At short temporal distances, self-sacrificing self-enhancement positively influences historical attraction visit intentions. Originality/value: Grandiose narcissism facets’ influence on tourism is rarely examined. This study extends the temporal distance concept to the narcissism theory. It integrates the effects of grandiose narcissism and temporal distance on tourists’ motivations and different attraction type visit intentions and shows that motivation is temporally distance-specific. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attraction visit intention; Grandiose fantasy; Grandiose narcissism; Pre-trip planning; Self-sacrificing self-enhancement; Travel motivation",""

Recently, however, uncertainty has become an emerging marketing tool in the hedonic product industry. In the case of blind box consumption, for example, the consumers become addicted to the uncertainty created by businesses, leading to repeat purchases and even indulgences. Previous research has, yet, to focus on the impact of uncertainty on indulgence and the role of emotions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper constructs and validates a chain mediation model of uncertainty triggering indulgent consumption based on the information gap theory, positive emotion theory and uncertainty resolution theory and examines the difference between resolved and unresolved uncertainty. This study also explores differences in the impact of whether uncertainty is resolved on emotions. The uncertainty-resolved group elicited a more positive emotional response than the uncertainty-unresolved group, leading to a more indulgent consumption. Findings: The results of three studies show that uncertainty influences indulgent consumption through curiosity and positive emotion, and that curiosity and positive emotion play separate and chain mediating roles between uncertainty and indulgent consumption, respectively. We validate our central hypothesis with questionnaires among blind box consumer groups, examining the moderating role of perceived luck and risk preferences.

"Give me a human! How anthropomorphism and robot gender affect trust in financial robo-advisory services","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190366146&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2023-0939&partnerID=40&md5=6578595f1bc6230bb7b6f0df6c4fc517","Purpose: Financial services industry is increasingly showing interest in automated financial advisors, or robo-advisors, with the aim of democratizing access to financial advice and stimulating investment behavior among populations that were previously less active and less served. However, the extent to which consumers trust this technology influences the adoption of rob-advisors. The resemblance to a human, or anthropomorphism, can provide a sense of social presence and increase trust. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, we conduct an experiment (N = 223) to test the effect of anthropomorphism (low vs medium vs high) and gender (male vs female) of the robo-advisor on social presence. This perception, in turn, enables consumers to evaluate personality characteristics of the robo-advisor, such as competence, warmth, and persuasiveness, all of which are related to trust in the robo-advisor. We separately conduct an experimental study (N = 206) testing the effect of gender neutrality on consumer responses to robo-advisory anthropomorphism. Findings: Our results show that consumers prefer human-alike robo-advisors over machinelike or humanoid robo-advisors. This preference is only observed for male robo-advisors and is explained by perceived competence and perceived persuasiveness. Furthermore, highlighting gender neutrality undermines the positive effect of robo-advisor anthropomorphism on trust. Originality/value: We contribute to the body of knowledge on robo-advisor design by showing the effect of robot’s anthropomorphism and gender on consumer perceptions and trust. Consequently, we offer insightful recommendations to promote the adoption of robo-advisory services in the financial sector. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphism; Financial services marketing; Robo-advisor; Robot gender; Social presence; Trust",""

"Investigating consumers’ intention to use drone food delivery services: Do personality traits matter?","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193700453&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2024-0092&partnerID=40&md5=1fcb596caf15d82fc58185e60dc7b8c4","Purpose: The drone food delivery service (DFDS) is a revolutionary technology owing to its ability to reduce delivery costs, alleviate traffic congestion, and offer a more environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional delivery methods. While studies have been conducted to understand consumers’ intentions towards DFDS, very few of them considered internal factors such as personality traits. Considering the aforementioned factors, this research employs the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model and the big five personalities (BFP) traits to explore how personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness) moderate the associations between the desire for DFDS and consumers’ intention to use DFDS (ITU). Design/methodology/approach: Survey questionnaires were distributed online via Facebook and WhatsApp. A total of 359 responses were considered valid, and the study employed the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach to test the hypotheses. Findings: The study revealed a positive impact of the desire for DFDS on ITU. Additionally, extraversion and agreeableness were found to moderate the effect of the desire for DFDS on ITU. Originality/value: This study is the first in DFDS literature to employ the BDI model, showcasing its effective application in understanding the desire-to-intention relationship. Also, this is the first study that explores the moderating role of the BFP traits in the context of DFDS usage intention. The results provide insights for developing marketing strategies to encourage DFDS usage intention based on consumers' personality traits. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intention; Belief-desire-intention model; Big five personality traits; Desire; Drone food delivery services; Personality traits",""

However, research exploring the impacts of live-streamers’ characteristics on customer engagement in different types of live streaming rooms remains limited. This study aims to examine the impacts of live-streamers’ characteristics (i.e. expertise, moral reputation, popularity, responsiveness) on consumer engagement in e-commerce live streaming, and verify whether there are differences in the impact of live-streamers’ characteristics on consumer experience for different types of live-streamers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered from 266 Chinese adults who have experience watching e-commerce live streaming. Partial least squares techniques were used to verify the model. Findings: The results show that expertise, moral reputation, popularity, and responsiveness of live-streamers have positive impacts on consumer engagement through perceived trust and perceived pleasure. Moreover, through multi-group analysis, this study found that compared with enterprise live-streamers, the moral reputation of individual live-streamers exerts a stronger effect on consumers’ perceived trust, and the popularity of individual live-streamers exerts a stronger effect on consumers’ perceived pleasure. Compared with individual live-streamers, the responsiveness of enterprise live-streamers exerts a stronger effect on consumers’ perceived pleasure. Originality/value: This study contributes to e-commerce live streaming research by categorizing live-streamers into two types: individual live-streamers and enterprise live-streamers, and verifying the specific difference in the impacts of live-streamers’ characteristics on consumer experience for the two types of live-streamers. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer engagement; E-commerce live streaming; Live-streamer type; Live-streamers’ characteristics; Multi-group analysis",""
"The drivers of sharing willingness regarding sustainable fashion brand image based on commitment theory","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194943837&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2023-1035&partnerID=40&md5=44236f0a02c00c4afd7c47eb500357b1","Purpose: Sustainability is considered a core trend in the development of the fashion industry. Clarifying the driving factors of consumers’ sharing willingness regarding sustainable image from the perspective of psychology can help fashion brands implement sustainable management and deepen industrial sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Based on commitment theory, this paper proposes a conceptual model that includes three antecedents: perception of greenwashing, environmental, social and governance (ESG) and social media content quality. These affect consumers’ sharing willingness regarding sustainable image through affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. Furthermore, 310 participants reported their tendencies in a formal empirical study. Findings: The results show that unlike green perception, which has a significant negative effect, consumers have a significant positive commitment to high perceived levels of ESG and social media content quality. Besides, all three dimensions under the commitment theory play a partial mediating role between consumer perception and sharing willingness. Originality/value: This study not only extends the research on the commitment theory to the field of fashion marketing and management but also enriches the research context of brand image sharing willingness, which explains the differential effects of different consumer commitments on their information sharing willingness. Moreover, several management implications applicable to the fashion industry have also been proposed based on the conclusion. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Consumer behavior; Empirical research; Sharing willingness; Sustainable fashion",""

"Does consumer knowledge about sustainable-fashion impact intention-to-buy?","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194893088&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2023-0456&partnerID=40&md5=0ad94b16a494b73692d6668e14e504b0","Purpose: This study proposes and empirically tests the hypothesis that most consumers differ significantly in how accurately they express knowledge about what experts define as indicators of fashion sustainability behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Sustainability discipline scholars (i.e., experts) provide the following two examples of accurate sustainability knowledge: (1) Sustainable-fashion manufacturers ensure safe working conditions for their employees; (2) fibers such as wool can be commercially recycled. In the current study, 85% of participants in separate samples of Chinese (n = 244) and Korean (n = 214) adults provide incorrect answers to the two statements, contradicting experts' beliefs. The study here develops and tests a general, asymmetric predictive, case-based theory of simple and complex antecedent conditions and outcomes for consumers with correct or incorrect knowledge of fashion sustainability behavior for fashion products. Findings: According to the study consumers who have a high level of knowledge about sustainable fashion consistently have high purchase intentions for these products. On the contrary, consumers with insuffient knowledge of sustainable-fashion have low purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications: The analysis emphasizes the importance of government policy in encouraging important-term consumer behavior. Government policy has a direct and indirect impact on sustainable consumer behavior. Practical implications: This study's practical contribution is that it amphasizes the important role of government policy in encouraging sustainable consumer behavior (Perez-Castillo and Vera-Martinez, 2021). Government policy both directly and indirectly influences sustainable consumer behavior. Understanding consumers' consumption behavior as influenced by knowledge of sustainable development allows policymakers to develop more targeted policy measures, thereby promoting the achievement of sustainable development goals. For example, incorporating sustainable issues into the school curriculum can encourage students to practice sustainable behavior when purchasing, using, or disposing of products. People may require encouragement to understand why sustainable development is necessary, how to facilitate it, what the expected effects are and how it will affect their lives. Social implications: Knowledge of sustainable development, as well as consumer behavior research, can help improve consumer environmental awareness and understanding of sustainable development, guiding them towards greener and more environmentally friendly consumption habits. Understanding consumers' reactions to knowledge of sustainable development and subsequent changes in their consumption behavior guides businesses to engage in green product design, green production and green marketing, thus improving their competitiveness and market share (Rynarzewska et al., 2023). Some countries around the world are working hard to meet their sustainable development goals. By comparing consumer consumption behavior in different countries under the influence of knowledge on sustainable development consumer can share experiences and practices, strengthen international cooperation and communication and promote the global sustainable development process collaboratively. Originality/value: The current study contributes by looking into the validity of the claim that consumers who have accurate sustainable fashion knowledge are more likely to purchase brands with high sustainability characteristics. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Asymmetry; Consumers; Knowledgeable; Sustainability",""

An excellent way to motivate such foreign channel partners is to give them exclusive territories. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the determinants of territorial exclusivity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between organizational culture and territorial exclusivity and the moderating role of firm size in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Japan. To test the hypotheses, a regression analysis was conducted using the ordinary least squares technique. Findings: Empirical evidence shows that the cultural values of collectivism and uncertainty avoidance influence territorial exclusivity; collectivist exporters are likely to use territorial exclusivity, whereas exporters with high uncertainty avoidance are not likely to use it. Furthermore, the larger the firm size, the smaller the impact of cultural values on territorial exclusivity; this suggests that large SMEs do not rely on their organizational culture to make decisions about exclusive territories. Originality/value: The export marketing literature emphasizes the advantages of exclusive territories. By contrast, the channel management literature suggests that exclusive territories also have disadvantages. As exclusive territories have both advantages and disadvantages, it is crucial to answer the following question: What kinds of exporting manufacturers grant exclusive territories to their foreign channel partners? By addressing this question, this study contributes to a better understanding of export channel strategy. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cross-border business relationships; Cultural value; Export channels; Export marketing; International channel relationships; Manufacturing SMEs",""

Design/methodology/approach: This research conducted three studies. Study 1 explored the main effect of appearance aesthetics (appearance: plain vs classical vs expressive) on green products purchase intention through a one-factor between-subjects design. Study 2 verified the mediating role of perceived naturalness through two types of appearance aesthetics (appearance: classical vs expressive) between-subjects design. Study 3 verified the moderating role of product identity-symbolic attributes through a 2 (product identity-symbolic attributes: non-identity-symbolic vs identity-symbolic attributes) × 2 (appearance: classical aesthetics vs expressive aesthetics) between-subjects design. Findings: Consumers will be more likely to purchase a green product that has classical aesthetics appearance (vs expressive aesthetics). Perceived naturalness mediates the effect of aesthetic appearance on consumer green consumption. Product identity symbol attributes moderate this effect. Specifically, for non-identity-symbolic green products, classical aesthetics can effectively enhance consumer purchase intention. For identity-symbolic green products, expressive aesthetics can effectively enhance consumer purchase intention. Originality/value: Existing research suggests that aesthetic appearance can increase consumers’ evaluation of electronic products, beauty products and food, but the difference between aesthetics has not yet been explored. This research compares two aesthetics, contributing to the literature on aesthetic appearance in green products and offering valuable insights for managers’ green products marketing. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aesthetic appearance; Green products; Perceived naturalness; Product identity symbol attributes; Purchase intention",""

Whilst research on the adoption of these devices is rapidly expanding, few have explored post-adoption behaviour. To fill this gap, we investigate how functionality and human-like features shape customers’ emotions, engagement and loyalty towards DVAs. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through a self-administered online survey from 509 DVA users. Structural equation modelling was employed for data analysis. Findings: The results reveal that distinct human-like and functional factors of DVA independently explain customers’ positive emotions and engagement with DVAs. Positive emotions and engagement significantly impact customer loyalty to DVAs. The study shows that localisation of DVAs has a significant positive moderating influence on the service experience-customer engagement relationship but a negative moderating influence on the anthropomorphism-customer engagement relationship. Originality/value: Unlike previous research, this study contributes to the literature by delving into post-adoption phenomena. It explains how DVAs’ human-like and functional attributes drive customers’ positive emotional responses, engagement and loyalty towards DVAs. The findings not only unveil new insights into the moderating role of localisation but also provide a crucial understanding regarding the boundary conditions of the influence of anthropomorphism and service experience on customer engagement. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Customer emotions; Customer engagement; Customer loyalty; Digital assistants",""

Studies 1a and 1b tested the main hypothesis that being maliciously envied (vs benignly) can increase consumers' inconspicuous consumption of luxury products and luxury hotel experiences. Study 2 replicated this finding and examined the mediating role of social anxiety. Study 3 investigated the moderating effect of ideal self-congruity (low vs high). Findings: The findings reveal that being maliciously envied (vs benignly) is associated with higher levels of inconspicuous consumption and social anxiety acts as a mediating role. Moreover, when individuals have a strong sense of ideal self-congruity, the positive impact of being maliciously envied (vs benignly) on inconspicuous consumption is further amplified, confirming the moderating role of ideal self-congruity.

The aim is to include a range of drivers identified by different investigations into a single approach, to determine direct and indirect channels by which these drivers influence purchasing behaviour, and their relative importance in quantitative terms. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour that considers hypotheses based on a number of studies revised in the literature review. This theoretical framework was used as the basis for a questionnaire applied to a sample of 362 young Chinese consumers. A Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling approach was used to analyse the collected data. Findings: The results revealed three main channels influencing purchasing behaviour which were shown to share the same root, corresponding to the influences of the social network young consumers belong to. This result suggests that social norms have a key role in explaining young consumers' purchasing behaviour through its impact on their needs for status and social recognition, their attitudes towards foreign cultures and foreign brands, and their beliefs regarding the attributes of foreign clothing. Practical implications: The work therefore provides companies operating in the foreign clothing market the confidence to devise business strategies that focus on the channel demonstrating the highest influencing power. A strategy likely to have the highest influencing power is one that uses celebrities to promote the reputation of products and reinforce the messages associated with status and social recognition. Reinforcement of these strategies could include secondary strategies linked to the other channels such as the one related to the adoption of foreign cultural symbolism. Originality/value: In contrast to the majority of related studies, this investigation also explores indirect channels or paths by which a behavioural driver affects the behaviour of young Chinese consumers. In fact, this investigation not only simultaneously identified the different paths influencing young Chinese consumers purchasing behaviour but also quantitatively identified their relative importance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Foreign clothing brands; Purchasing behaviour; Structural equation modelling; Theory of planned behaviour; Young Chinese consumers",""

The present study investigates how to build interpersonal relationships with streamers and whether different interpersonal relationship factors lead to repurchase intention and WOM intention in live streaming commerce. The moderating effect of gender is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 429 live streaming commerce users in mainland China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that all four streamer attributes (expertise, authenticity, attractiveness, and homophily) have a positive influence on swift guanxi, and swift guanxi is effective in predicting both calculative commitment and affective commitment. In addition, all interpersonal relationship factors (swift guanxi, calculative commitment, and affective commitment) significantly affect repurchase intentions, with only affective commitment being linked to WOM intention. Also, the moderating role of gender was confirmed in expertise – swift guanxi, attractiveness – swift guanxi, cognitive commitment – repurchase intention and affective commitment – repurchase intention linkages. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the live streaming commerce literature by integrating swift guanxi, calculative commitment, and affective commitment to understand the repurchase intention and WOM intention from the relationship-building process perspective. In addition, this paper enriches the source credibility and source attractiveness models by identifying gender boundaries on the effectiveness of these models in predicting swift guanxi. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affective commitment; Calculative commitment; Gender; Live streaming commerce; Swift guanxi",""
"Supplier selection for carbon emission reduction collaboration in green supply chain using an improved multi-criteria decision-making method","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185688743&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2023-1084&partnerID=40&md5=12401ae37b192e1d72f62ac7fe20cbd6","Purpose: Platform-based enterprises, as micro-entities in the platform economy, have the potential to effectively promote the low-carbon development of both supply and demand sides in the supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a multi-criteria decision-making method in a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment to assist platform-type companies in selecting cooperative suppliers for carbon reduction in green supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines the advantages of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PHFS) to address uncertainty issues and proposes an improved multi-criteria decision-making method called PHFS-DNMEREC-MABAC for aiding platform-based enterprises in selecting carbon emission reduction collaboration suppliers in green supply chains. Within this decision-making method, we enhance the standardization process of both the DNMEREC and MABAC methods by directly standardizing probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements. Additionally, a probability splitting algorithm is introduced to handle probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements of varying lengths, mitigating information bias that traditional approaches tend to introduce when adding values based on risk preferences. Findings: In this paper, we apply the proposed method to a case study involving the selection of carbon emission reduction collaboration suppliers for Tmall Mart and compare it with the latest existing decision-making methods. The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and the effectiveness of the introduced probability splitting algorithm in avoiding information bias. Originality/value: Firstly, this paper proposes a new multi-criteria decision making method for aiding platform-based enterprises in selecting carbon emission reduction collaboration suppliers in green supply chains. Secondly, in this method, we provided a new standard method to process probability hesitant fuzzy decision making information. Finally, the probability splitting algorithm was introduced to avoid information bias in the process of dealing with inconsistent lengths of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon emission reduction; Multi-criteria decision making; Platform-based enterprises; Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets; Supplier selection",""
"Investigating of the influence process on consumer’s active engagement through emotional brand attachment and brand love","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195454330&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2023-1028&partnerID=40&md5=b8f3dbc17599928ea0816d418817a398","Purpose: This study aims to confirm the causal relationship between emotional brand attachment, brand love, and brand commitment, and then explain how these variables affect active engagement. In addition, it is to confirm the effect of brand prestige, brand consciousness, and brand trust on emotional brand attachment and to identify the moderating role of self-congruity in the causal relationship between these variables. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a survey was conducted targeting 320 consumers who have recently purchased luxury products or brands. In addition, structural equation model analysis (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses raised in this study. Findings: The results found that brand prestige and brand consciousness affect on emotional brand attachment. Emotional brand attachment had a significant effect on brand love and brand commitment. And brand love affect brand commitment and active engagement. Emotional brand attachment affects active engagement. Brand love was mediated in the relationship between emotional brand attachment and active engagement. Self-congruity was moderated in the relationship between brand prestige and emotional brand attachment. However, self-congruity was not moderated in the relation to brand consciousness, brand trust and emotional brand attachment. Research limitations/implications: This study has significance in that it identified the antecedent factors that cause consumers' emotional brand attachment and confirmed that they have differential effects depending on the degree of consumer self-congruity. In addition, this study is meaningful in that it confirmed the concept of the causal difference between attachment and brand love as consumers' emotional responses to luxury brands. However, the scope of this study was limited to offline stores excluding online purchases as a place of purchase for luxury brands. In a situation where the purchase of luxury brands is gradually increasing in various online environments, limiting the scope of the study to offline stores may have problems in generalizing the study. Therefore, in future research, we would like to propose a study on the relationship and influence between these variables by integrating all purchasing environments, such as offline and online. Practical implications: The management implications of the results of this study are as follows. First, brand marketers and managers must suggest strategies to increase emotional attachment to customers who are satisfied with the brand and have a favorable brand attitude. After segmenting target customers and identifying their tendencies, behavioral characteristics, and preferred brands, emotional attachment can be strengthened by providing information about the brand to each segment and strengthening the brand image. Strategies like these can help target customers strengthen their emotional connection to a luxury brand, build positive attitudes toward the brand, and prevent them from switching to competing brands. Second, a strategy is needed to ensure that target customers have a strong emotional response to the company's luxury brand and become immersed in the brand. Target customers who have an affinity for the brand can strengthen their level of brand attachment and become immersed in the brand by allowing them to directly participate in brand activities through various advertising campaigns, events, and content. Third, you can strengthen your brand by developing a brand that fits the self-concept of your target customers. Brand marketers or managers can strengthen brand attachment by presenting a brand that fits the characteristics of each target customer and recognizing that the brand's status is relatively high compared to competing brands. Social implications: This study identified how consumers' brand engagement in a luxury brand environment is influenced by its components. In other words, the preceding factors for consumers' brand emotion were identified, and the influence of emotional brand attachment and brand love, which represent the consumer's emotional state that affects consumers' brand engagement, was investigated. The theoretical implications of the results of this study are as follows. First, Shahid et al. (2022) found that emotional attachment was expressed more strongly when emotional bonds were formed through relationship formation. Hwang and Kandampully (2012) found that emotional attachment and brand love are conceptually similar but differ in intensity. And Gómez-Suárez (2019) said that brand attachment is a prerequisite for brand love. As mentioned earlier, previous research has shown that emotional attachment and brand love differ depending on the consumer's emotional state. The results of this study showed that emotional brand attachment did not affect active participation, while brand love did. This means that active engagement is directly influenced by brand love rather than emotional attachment. Through these research results, it can be confirmed that even if consumers have similar brand emotional states, the impact on consumer behavior is different depending on the intensity of the emotional state. Therefore, in the consumer-brand relationship, the intensity of emotions arising from the interaction between the consumer and the brand is different, and only when brand emotions are at a high level, consumers engage in behavioral participation toward the brand. Second, Morris and Keltner (2000) found that consumers activate the integration of emotions in the decision-making process. Hwang and Kandampully (2012) found that love induces consumers to maintain a relationship with a brand, and that brand commitment increases when consumers feel intimacy and a strong emotional bond between themselves and the brand. Through these prior studies, it was confirmed that emotions play an important role in the consumer's decision-making process, and in particular, it was confirmed that maintaining close relationships with others induces emotional commitment to the object. In this study, brand loyalty was also found to have a positive effect on brand immersion and active participation. Therefore, consumers need to foster strong bonds with luxury brands to create brand love and strengthen their relationship with the brand, leading to brand commitment and active participation. Third, Ji et al. (2018) found that brand reputation has a positive effect on consumer attitudes and behaviors, including brand attachment, purchase intention, and brand loyalty. Casidy et al. (2015) found that consumers with high brand awareness are likely to have high brand preference and have favorable and positive brand attitudes due to their high brand knowledge. Previous research has shown that consumers' brand reputation and brand consciousness influence brand attachment. Originality/value: This study dealt with a more comprehensive variable in the relationship between luxury brand factors as an antecedent variable of emotional brand attachment in luxury brand situations, and provided important evidence for the mediating effect of brand love, which was a limited emotional variable. In addition, additional implications for the moderating role of brand self-congruity on emotional brand attachment were suggested. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active engagement; Brand commitment; Brand love; Emotional brand attachment; Luxury brand; Self-congruity",""

Communication effects include ad attitudes and product attitudes in this study. Design/methodology/approach: One 2 (mental simulation: process-focused vs. outcome-focused) x 2 (attribute typicality: high vs. low) x 2 (attribute benefits: hedonic vs. utilitarian) between-subjects experiment design was conducted. SPSS was used to do data analysis. Findings: This article reveals that high (low) typicality of new attributes causes a process-focused (outcome-focused) simulation to lead to better consumer attitudes (i.e. ad attitude and product attitude). In addition, for a new hedonic attribute, a low typical attribute induces better consumer attitudes. Furthermore, there are interaction among mental simulation, product attribute typicality and benefits. These findings have important implications for academic developments and marketing management. Originality/value: Compared with previous studies, this study is unique in several ways. First, enterprises often develop new products by introducing new product attributes (i.e. new features). Product attribute typicality is an interesting issue for new product design and communication. This research illustrates that the marketing communication effects of attribute typicality depends on attribute benefits and mental simulation. Second, the current research finds the new product attribute benefit (i.e. hedonic/utilitarian) play an important role and moderates the effects of mental simulation on consumer attitudes. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer attitude; Mental simulation; Product attribute benefit; Product attribute typicality",""
"How social media marketing activities affect brand loyalty?

However, limited studies have attempted to understand as how activities on social media influence usage intentions and brand loyalty. Thus, this study aims to examine the influence of social media marketing activities (SMMA) on brand experience and its association with continued usage intentions (CUI) and brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: The study conceptualized a research model by using the theoretical premise of stimulus-organism-response theory. SMMA acts as stimulus, four (sensory, affective, behavioral and intellectual) elements of brand experience act as organism, and CUI and brand loyalty act as response. A survey-based questionnaire is used to collect data from 309 respondents. The hypothesized associations of research model were examined using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings: Results of the study are in line with hypothesized associations among constructs. Results suggest that SMMA is associated with all four elements of brand experience. Also, affective, behavioral and intellectual aspects of brand experience are associated with CUI which influence brand loyalty. The moderating role of education on hypothesized association and the mediating role of organism are also confirmed. Originality/value: Using stimulus-organism-response theory, this study confirms that SMMA are associated with sensory, affective, behavioral and intellectual aspect of brand experience which has not been examined so far. Also, the novel findings of study add to existing literature of SMMA, brand experience and brand loyalty. The study further contributes to literature by showing the moderation effect of education. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand experience; Brand loyalty; Continued usage intentions; Social media marketing activities (SMMA); Stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory",""

Design/methodology/approach: Following a positivist research philosophy, this study used empirical methods, surveying 263 coffee consumers. The coffee packaging prototypes varied across material and graphic designs. The data was analyzed statistically using the Friedman test and Spearman correlation. Findings: It was found that packaging elements elicit an equal share of emotional responses. Graphics have a greater impact than materials. Females are more affected by visuals, while materials influence males more. Further, packaging design correlates positively and significantly with consumer impressions and willingness to buy. Research limitations/implications: The sampling methodology limits generalizability. Future studies can use integrated models to analyze the effects of additional packaging variables like color and shape. Practical implications: Coffee enterprises should focus on graphic rather than material elements. Paper packs with patterned graphics are most attractive to consumers. Targeted gender-sensitive packaging designs are needed. Standardized packaging can help build the Philippine coffee social enterprise industry and support small-scale farmer livelihoods. Environmentally sustainable materials should be prioritized. Social implications: The findings contribute to the success and growth of small-scale farmers and social enterprises in the Philippines. These businesses can attract more consumers, increase their market share, and ultimately generate more significant social impact by implementing packaging design strategies that effectively communicate product quality, sustainability, and social value. Originality/value: The study uniquely integrates diverse methods to provide holistic insights into jointly analyzing the effects of packaging materials and graphics.

"How names and shapes correspond to the nature of products: an evaluation of auspicious foods","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188988139&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2023-1196&partnerID=40&md5=eb5bd0585578db3e801f1c72e9bbb52d","Purpose: Restaurant operators often use auspicious connotations embedded in the names and shapes of dishes to increase consumers’ purchase intentions. However, the interaction effect of multiple auspicious cues (i.e. food name and shape) on purchase intentions has rarely been examined in the restaurant context. Thus, grounded in processing fluency theory, this study investigates the direct influence of the two-way interaction effect of food name (auspicious vs nonauspicious) and shape (auspicious vs. nonauspicious) on purchase intentions and its indirect influence via perceived auspiciousness and positive emotions. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing a 2 (food name: auspicious name vs. nonauspicious name) × 2 (food shape: auspicious shape vs. nonauspicious shape) between-subjects design, the authors conducted two experimental studies with 356 Chinese customers. In Study 1, which focused on a main dish, we investigated the two-way interaction effect food name × food shape on purchase intentions. In Study 2, we replicated this experimental study by focusing on a different food type (i.e. dessert) to test the direct and indirect influences of the two-way interaction of food name × food shape on purchase intentions through perceived auspiciousness and positive emotions. Findings: The results reveal that the congruity condition of auspicious names and shapes significantly influences consumers’ purchase intentions. Congruity with auspicious food cues also indirectly affects purchase intentions through consumers’ perceived auspiciousness and positive emotions. These effects were consistently observed in two experimental studies analyzing different dish types (main dish and dessert). Practical implications: Restaurateurs should consider utilizing auspicious food cues to attract customers. Specifically, they should combine both food name and shape to increase their perceived auspiciousness and sales. Originality/value: This study tested processing fluency theory using auspicious food cues. This study contributes to the hospitality literature by improving our understanding of the congruence effect by exemplifying the conceptual alignment between food name and food shape. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Auspicious consumption; Conceptual fluency theory; Congruity effect theory; Food names; Food shapes; Processing fluency theory",""

This study aims to understand how the social value gained by tourists from sharing a travel experience with mobile technology affects their satisfaction with the travel experience through onsite mobile sharing behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A second-order hierarchical model is constructed to examine the moderated mediating role of onsite mobile sharing behaviour in improving tourists’ travel satisfaction. Through systematic sampling, 304 responses were collected at ten attraction points in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, China. Findings: The results show that, compared with self-centred values (self-presentation and self-identification), other-centred values (building social connection and reciprocity) contribute more to forming social values of sharing. In addition, onsite mobile sharing behaviour partially mediates and moderates the effect of social values on travel satisfaction.

Additionally, it offers important recommendations for non-life insurers in Taiwan for policy development and improving policyholder retention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of policyholders belonging to the top five non-life insurance companies in Taiwan. The data were then analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings: RMO and SQO mediate the effects of the salesperson’s market orientation on policyholder retention. Thus, RMO and SQO are key factors influencing policyholder retention. Consequently, high levels of market orientation should be maintained to increase RMO and SQO, strengthening the retention rate of non-life insurance policyholders. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature. In the future, researchers should collect data from other countries and service industries (e.g. banks, securities, and other financial institutions), expand to different insurance contexts (e.g. life insurance), and conduct longitudinal studies or experimental research.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study was designed to examine the moderating role of perceived self-efficacy in the intention–plans–behaviour relationship. To test the theoretical framework, data from 453 valid questionnaires were recruited in Hanoi (Vietnam) and were analysed to test validity and reliability before being evaluated for hypothesis testing by Smart-PLS 4.0. Findings: The results indicate that action and coping plans have significant positive effects on the relationship between intention and behaviour. CopS has a significant positive effect on the two paths of the intention-coping plan-behaviour mediation, whereas action plan (AP) has merely a significant positive link to the intention-AP path. Research limitations/implications: There are several limitations of the paper, including a small and undiversified-characteristic sample and general OF.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates the impact of the social influencer spillover effect on manufacturers' production decisions when they collaborate with intermediary platforms to sell products through marketplace or reseller modes. Game theory and static numerical comparison are used to analyze our models. Findings: Firstly, under low-carbon policies, the spillover effect does not always benefit manufacturer profits and changes non-monotonically with an increasing spillover effect. Secondly, in cases where there are both a carbon emission constraint and a spillover effect present, if either the manufacturer or intermediary platform holds a strong position, then marketplace mode benefits manufacturer profits. Thirdly, regardless of business mode used when environmental damage coefficient is high for products; government should implement cap-and-trade regulation to optimize social welfare while reducing manufacturers’ carbon emissions. Practical implications: This study offers theoretical and practical research support to assist manufacturers in optimizing production decisions for compliance with carbon emission limits, enhancing profits through the development of effective influencer marketing strategies, and providing strategies to mitigate carbon emissions and enhance social welfare while sustaining manufacturing activities. Originality/value: This paper addresses the limitations of prior research by examining how the social influencer spillover effect influences manufacturers' business mode choices under government low-carbon policies and analyzing the social welfare of different carbon emission restrictions when such spillovers occur.

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted two studies based on cognitive appraisal theory and artificial intelligence device acceptance theory. Study 1 explored the mechanisms by which the type of anthropomorphic design of the service robot (humanoid robot/nonhumanoid robot) influenced revisit intention after service failure through a one-factor between-subjects design based on a restaurant dining scenario. Study 2 was based on a hotel check-in scenario and explored the moderating effect of robot personalization design on the above mechanisms through a 2 (anthropomorphic design: humanoid robot/nonhumanoid robot) × 2 (personalized design: self-name/no name) between-subjects design. Findings: Study 1 shows that consumers have higher performance expectations for nonhumanoid robots, leading to a higher tolerance for service failure, which in turn generates higher revisit intentions. Study 2 shows that consumers' performance expectations are significantly enhanced after custom naming of humanoid robots, so the serial mediation mechanism for the effect of robot anthropomorphic design on revisit intention does not hold.

Specifically, the study examined the influences of app system success dimensions and TAM determinants on branded sport app usage intention. Moreover, the current study examined the gender differences regarding the relative importance of the drivers and predictors of usage intention. Design/methodology/approach: Data collection (n = 256) was conducted using convenience sampling in South Korea. The data were primarily analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), multi-group analysis and importance–performance map analysis (IPMA) using SmartPLS 3.0. Findings: App users who viewed branded sport apps as having a higher level of system and information quality were likely to have stronger perceptions of enjoyment, usefulness, and ease of use. Among the TAM determinants, perceived enjoyment most significantly influenced their usage intention, followed by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Multigroup analysis revealed that some relationships between app system success dimensions and TAM determinants were significantly different by gender. In addition, IPMA indicated that perceived enjoyment and system quality of branded sport apps were relatively more important than the other predictors. Originality/value: The current study contributes to the literature by incorporating both TAM and ISSM and extending the TAM with the perceived enjoyment construct to examine the key determinants of usage intention in the context of branded sport apps. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Branded sport app; Information system success model; Mobile application; Partial least squares; Perceived enjoyment; Technology acceptance model",""

Design/methodology/approach: This research comprises of a survey (study 1) and a lab experiment (study 2). Findings: Study 1 shows that fantasy (reality) based advergame experience leads to brand patronage through strong mediation of hot (cold) BRQ and weak mediation of cold (hot) BRQ. Introducing a utilitarian (hedonic) advergame reward system positively moderates the effect of fantasy (reality) based advergame experience on cold (hot) BRQ. Study 2 shows that an advergame that elicits fantasy (realistic) experience and offers hedonic (utilitarian) rewards for a brand having affective (vs cognitive) brand personality strongly impacts hot (cold) BRQ.

With a practical focus, this study aims at helping marketers cope with the challenge by developing conceptual typologies for influencers and followers and suggesting marketing implications for each type of influencer and follower. Design/methodology/approach: This study subscribes to the perspectives of virtual community and social information processing to develop conceptual typologies for influencers and followers based on their essential characteristics. Findings: Based on levels of expertise and interactivity, influencers can be categorized as broadcasters, leaders, friends and companions. Each type has advantages in certain branding objectives (e.g. increasing awareness, inducing judgments and feelings, building brand and user imagery, encouraging pro-brand behaviors and managing relationships) and is associated with certain marketing limitations (e.g. reach, domain breadth, informational support, brand congruence and relationship management). Based on levels of behavioral engagement and the point of attachment, followers are categorized into spectators, participants, admirers and advocators, with specific marketing communication strategies most effective for each type (e.g. strategies of content, narratives, engagement and co-branding).

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 262 valid questionnaires were collected. Data were collected using the purposive sampling method and tested using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. Findings: Monetary cost is positively related to only one organism-related factor which is perceived greenwash fear. All organism-related factors are positively related to response, which is green hotel patronage intention. Attitude mediates the relationship between perceived greenwash fear and green hotel patronage intention, as well as perceived behavioural control and green hotel patronage intention. Research limitations/implications: A longitudinal study can be performed in the future to observe the actual green hotel patronage behaviour of customers. Practical implications: Green hoteliers should focus on the development of communication strategies to enhance their corporate reputation. Green hoteliers also need to build trust by showing their green initiatives are genuine, identify consumers who are willing to pay more for green hotels and offer promotions with price incentives such as frequency discounts, coupons and rebates to increase interest and trialability.

(2) Does supply base rationalization play a moderating role in the above relationship? Design/methodology/approach: Survey data consisting of 144 valid responses were collected from supply chain innovation and application pilot projects in 55 cities of China. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the reliability and validity of measures, and hierarchical linear regression and bootstrapping were used to test all hypotheses. Findings: The results obtained reveal that supply chain knowledge sharing partially mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and SCI. Also, supply base rationalization positively moderates the mediated relationship between transformational leadership and SCI. Practical implications: Managers and decision-makers of supply chain leader firms who want to enhance their entire SCI to deal with unexpected supply chain disruptions are highly recommended to adopt transformational behavior across the supply chain, as well as to develop the knowledge sharing culture, resulting from transformational leadership. In addition, leading firms should be dedicated to structuring their supply base, keeping it at the right size and complexity. Originality/value: The present study emphasizes previous results and provides additional evidence that supply chain leaders’ adoption of transformational behavior can reinforce entire SCI through knowledge sharing in light of the disruptions facing supply chains in developing countries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Knowledge sharing climate; Supply base rationalization; Supply chain innovativeness; Transformational leadership",""

How to attract more quantity and quality of contributors to submit their solutions through a crowdsourcing platform has become a vital question. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors use web crawling to obtain 43,265 effective tasks in EPWK website (www.epwk.com) to probe how to elevate the quantity and quality of contributors via task reward design. This study uses the hierarchical linear model to probe the research questions. Findings: Results show that, with the increase of task reward, the quantity of contributors goes up first and then goes down (inverted U shape), whereas the quality of contributors goes down first and then goes up (U sharp). Moreover, the authors investigate the moderating effects of another task design attribute, task duration. This study finds that task duration weakens the effect of task reward on the quantity of contributors while strengthening the effects of task reward on the quality of contributors. Originality/value: First, this study theoretically probes two key aspects of task performance, namely, the quantity and quality of contributors, which expand the scope of task performance evaluation. Second, this study reconciles previous concern about the relationship of task reward and performance, which is different from previous studies that have paid more attention to the single perspective of their relationship. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating effects of task duration, which further uncover the mechanism behind task reward and performance, that is, the quantity and quality of task contributors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crowdsourcing; Hierarchical linear model; Quantity and quality of the contributors; Task duration; Task reward",""
"Shareholder reactions to corporate label change: evidence from South Korean firms","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147294567&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2021-0867&partnerID=40&md5=cf8843bde83cc61adc1e99609398a11b","Purpose: This paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of a corporate label change (CLC) from investors' perspective, especially based on the stakeholder approach to corporate identity. The resource-based theory has been used as a theoretical root of understanding the antecedents and consequences of brands. The authors specifically examine how two important types of firm-level heterogeneity – firm size and firm age – change shareholder reactions. In addition, the authors also test the moderating effects of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using Korean company data, the authors first calculate the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) with the two-day event window [−1,0]. Then, the authors test the impacts of firm size and age on CAR with ordinary least squares regressions. To understand greater dynamics, the authors also test the moderation effects of firm performance. For the robustness check, the authors test using a different event window and different measures as well. Findings: The findings for South Korean companies reveal that CLC itself does not significantly affect shareholder value. However, firm size and firm age show positive and significant coefficients. This means that larger and older firms are more likely to have better investor reactions. In addition, the authors also test a moderation effect of firm performance. The result shows that the impact of firm size weakens when firms have better performance. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation is the generalizability of the findings, particularly those regarding the impacts of CLC on investor reactions. A second limitation is that the authors did not consider the time gaps between CLCs. Third, there are limitations of using an event study with stock market data due to the ambiguity of the causal relationship between a firm's strategic choices and market reactions. Lastly, the authors use all CLCs except CLCs related to corporate governance (i.e. mergers and acquisitions). Practical implications: Although managers expect positive relations by introducing new corporate label, the outcomes may not be sufficient because potential losses (i.e. losing royal customers) are significant. Hence, more careful considerations are required when a manager forms a new CLC. The results provide valuable insights for the conditions when large and aged companies pursue CLCs. In addition, the needs of a CLC are increasing when a company shows underperformance. Poor performance is a trigger for introducing new strategic choices (Boeker, 1997). The finding can be another supporting material for managers to consider when they intend to perform CLCs. Originality/value: The authors probe the effect of CLC on external stakeholders, particularly investor reactions. The current literature has discussed the impacts of CLC on employees, internal stakeholders, and customers, external stakeholders. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no strategy for understanding a CLC under stakeholder aspects. The authors believe that the findings contribute to the extant literature on CLC. This question is also important to a manager. Although introducing a new corporate label is a popular strategy for firms to provide corporate identity to various stakeholders, many cases have shown mixed results. This research provides evidence of what to consider when a manager makes its decision. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate label change; Event study; Shareholder reaction; South Korea",""

Design/methodology/approach: By using Google Forms to distribute links on various social media platforms, data were collected between January 15, 2021, and February 20, 2021. The population participants were all over 18 and had social media accounts. In the questionnaire, participants were asked to write down three influencers that they followed. They were then asked to answer the other statements in the survey with these three influencers in mind. Participants were included through convenience sampling from the population. A total of 514 people answered the questionnaire. These questions were then subjected to a statistical analysis using PLS-SEM. Findings: The results showed that cognitive, moral and pragmatic legitimacies significantly affect brand trust. Moreover, the moral and pragmatic legitimacies significantly affect the attitude towards the brand. Regarding the mediation effect, results showed that brand trust has a mediating effect between the perceived legitimacy of influencers and attitude towards the brand. Research limitations/implications: One of the main limitations of this study is that the data were collected by convenience sampling. Therefore, the research results cannot be generalised. Another limitation is that the study measures general perceptions of influencers' legitimacy, so it has not been addressed in terms of a specific product group, follower or influencer self-branding issues. Practical implications: The managerial contribution of this research centers on the ability to evaluate the influencers and their legitimacy in society; not only by their follower count but also by the legitimacy factors that can be named under the name of primary legitimacy norms. Managers will then be able to use this framework to determine which influencers they want to work with. Originality/value: When the literature was reviewed, no study was found that examined and measured the perceived legitimacy of influencers in terms of social norms, values and morals. This research aims to add the concept of the perceived legitimacy of influencers to the discussion in the literature, embody the legitimate framework of influencers' activities and provide a more general conceptual basis for persuasiveness in influencer marketing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude toward the brand; Brand trust; Cognitive legitimacy; Influencers; Moral legitimacy; Pragmatic legitimacy",""

Secondly, it explores the role of psychological ownership (PO) and consumers' animosity in explaining their WTB domestic products. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper data were collected online from Indian consumers (N = 408) through the survey method, using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS AMOS Version 24 and the PROCESS SPSS macro, using mediations and moderated mediation models. Findings: This study establishes the positive effect of consumers' NI on their WTB domestic products over Chinese ones. With a long history of hostility between India and China in the backdrop, the authors find a significant mediating role of PO and consumer animosity (CA) in the relationship between NI and WTB. The results also demonstrate that while consumer ethnocentrism (CET) positively moderates the mediating path via PO at all levels from low to high, it moderates the path via CA only at the mean and high levels. Originality/value: This study applies the Psychological Ownership Theory, Social Identity Theory (SIT) and the Attribution Theory to explore the interplay between consumers' NI, PO, CA and ethnocentrism in the Indian context. The study asserts the distinction between these constructs by analyzing the interaction and inter-relationships between these variables.

Although many researchers have investigated the optimality of opaque selling for service providers focusing on heterogeneous consumers, one question remaining unexplored is how the service providers’ optimal decisions are impacted by competitive intensity in a heterogeneous market. This paper aims to determine the conditions under which opaque selling is optimal for competing service providers. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes a Hotelling model to characterize the competition between two service providers. The authors also consider the interaction between the service providers and intermediary. Service providers act as game leaders and determine whether they should cooperate with the intermediary to introduce the opaque service. Findings: The authors find that two competing service providers do not always benefit from opaque selling in a heterogeneous market consisting of leisure and business consumers, and the competitive intensity plays a significant role in the service providers’ decision optimization. Opaque selling allows service providers to acquire more profit in a highly competitive market or when the market contains a large proportion of leisure consumers. Otherwise, it is optimal for service providers without introducing the opaque selling. Practical implications: The paper examines the optimality of opaque selling for competing service providers, and provides the suggestions to optimize the service providers’ decisions.

After such crises, firms' product-recall policies varied across countries, which might cause consumers in some countries to feel unfairly treated. Drawing on the relative deprivation theory, this study aims to examine how perceived unfairness of local consumers alters their attitudes toward unfairness-enacting foreign brands and competing domestic brands. Design/methodology/approach: This framework was tested by a netnography study on two product recalls from Samsung along with a consumer survey. While this netnography study provided preliminary support to the framework, survey data collected from 501 Samsung consumers after the Galaxy Note 7 crisis validated the theoretical model again. Findings: Perceived unfairness increases local consumers' avoidance of involved foreign brands and their intention to purchase domestic brands through evoking anger toward the foreign brands. Moreover, the detrimental impact of perceived unfairness is found to be stronger when consumers' prior relationship quality is high. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates unfair product recalls across countries and aims to provide important insights into how consumers react to the unfair treatment of foreign brands in a global product-harm context.

PR and marketing practitioners believe that PR and marketing functions are integrative, and they are willing to work flexibly for both functions within workplaces. Originality/value: This study presents a continuum of PR and marketing functions in the digital era that illustrates the role of digital communication in the convergence of PR and marketing functions. The results help to advance the theoretical discussion on both the functional (excellent PR practices and relationship management) and critical (the social role of PR in the participatory culture) approaches of PR in the digital context. Managerial implications are also discussed in addition to the theoretical contributions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital communication; Domain similarity; Marketing function; Public relations function",""
"How price labeling strategy affects consumers' purchase intention? The role of perceived price difference in price assessment","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160359485&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2022-0917&partnerID=40&md5=cd9b56a3058716970099fd2b358d55d1","Purpose: By conducting an online experiment, this paper proposes and tests a conceptual model about the impact of price labeling strategy on consumers' perceived price difference and purchase intention. The authors also analyze differential influences of shopping channels and price levels on documented effects. The paper provides strategic suggestions for online grocery store managers to adopt profit-maximizing labeling decisions. Design/methodology/approach: In a between-subject experiment, the authors simulated a shopping task with eight scenarios by exogenously manipulating price labeling strategies (unit price/retail price), sales channels (online/offline) and price levels (higher/lower than the average price). Participants are randomly assigned to one of the eight scenarios and asked to report their perceived price difference between the stimuli product and the average market price and their purchase intention on the stimuli product. Findings: Experimental results show that compared to the unit price, the retail price increases the perceived price difference. It shows that the unit price increases consumers' purchase intention when the product price is higher than the average market price. However, these effects only exist in the online shopping context. Originality/value: This paper extends the study of price labeling strategy to an online shopping context and examines the mediation effect of the perceived price difference. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Numerosity effect; Price labeling strategy; Price perception",""

This study contributes to the secret consumption literature by identifying the antecedents of secret consumption along with the explaining mechanism and boundary condition. Design/methodology/approach: An online study with experiment design was conducted to examine the impact of extroversion/introversion, self-presentation and product scarcity on secrete consumption. Findings: The results show that consumer extraverted disposition and the self-presentation motive negatively influence secret consumption intention and suggest this relationship is explained by the self-presentation need. The findings also revealed that perceived product scarcity attenuated the negative impact of extraversion and self-presentation on secret consumption intention. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide interesting insights into advertising and retailing. In recognizing that secret consumption is a prevalent phenomenon in consumer behavior that may improve actual consumer product evaluation and preference, retailers or brand managers may encourage consumers to consume secretly. Originality/value: This empirical study is a first attempt to explore the antecedents, mediating mechanism and boundary condition of consumer intention to engage in secrete consumption. The findings of the study provide important implication to theoretical development and managerial applications in advertising and retailing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Extraversion; Perceived product scarcity; Secret consumption; Self-presentation",""

In order to comprehensively analyze the service of stakeholders, the authors adopted the time duration which provides a unified metric for assessing service performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model analysis to verify the interactions among restaurants, the delivery system, and the platform itself, and to assess their effects on the sales. Data were collected from one of the biggest OFD service platforms in China – Eleme.com. Findings: First, the findings confirmed that the service performance of restaurants, the delivery system and the platform itself influence one another. There is a bidirectional causality between food preparation time (FPT) and actual delivery time (ACDT), as well as between FPT and advance arrival time (ADAT), ACDT and ADAT. Second, the service performance of restaurants, the delivery system, and the platform itself all positively affect sales, thus demonstrating unidirectional causality. Originality/value: The current research is a pioneering empirical study, as it confirms the dynamic interactions between participants in OFD platforms and the dynamic influence of their respective service performances on sales.

Previous research shows the effect from adding participant's personal attributes or social influence factors. This study considers the effects of benefit incentives and cost/reward influences to enhance prosocial behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: Three between-subject experiments were conducted and SPSS Statistics ANOVA was employed to analyze the experimental results. Findings: Rewarding time delays and prosocial efforts have no significant impact on the relationship between other-benefit incentives and willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors, but do significantly impact the self-benefit incentives condition. However, the negative effect of self-benefit condition can be mitigated by high rewards. Research limitations/implications: Since prosocial campaigns proposed by organizations in this study include both profit and nonprofit organizations, perhaps two category organization types should be attentively classified to evaluate the effects. Practical implications: Under social marketing campaigns with self-benefit incentives conditions, the empirical findings of this study show that profit and nonprofit organizations can provide higher reward values to mitigate the adverse effects of high participating costs. Social implications: Social marketing campaigns with other-benefit incentives are less affected by high participating costs and highlight the value of altruism. Originality/value: This study provides valuable suggestions for both profit and nonprofit organizations to use self-benefit/other-benefit incentives under cost related factors influence to encourage customers' prosocial behaviors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Delayed rewards; Efforts; Other-benefit; Prosocial behavior; Self-benefit",""

This study explores whether firms' communication of suboptimal food information to reduce food waste affects consumer perceptions and behaviors based on social exchange theory. Design/methodology/approach: A factorial between-subjects experiment designed with 4 (environmental claims) × 3 (suboptimal food) is used to design 12 scenarios. The measurement scales of variables are adapted from the literature. ANCOVA and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were performed to test study hypotheses using a total of 745 valid samples collected via a web-based questionnaire after testing manipulation checks, reliability and validity. Findings: Among the four types of environmental claims, product orientation and environmental fact claims improve consumers' attitudes, ethical judgments and purchase intentions toward suboptimal food. The effect of ethical judgments on purchase intention is higher than that of attitudes. Additionally, purchase intention is a vital predictor of sustainable consumption and plays a significant mediating role between the variables. Originality/value: The findings of this study address gaps in the literature, which lacks investigations into the effects of communication information about suboptimal food on consumer attitudes and behaviors. Unlike traditional questionnaires using scale items to measure independent variables, the quasi-experimental design with stimulus materials used in this study can reveal the varied effects of different environmental claims. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer attitudes; Environmental claims; Food waste; Information disclosures; Suboptimal food; Sustainability",""

Design/methodology/approach: Consumers are presented with an audiovisual advertisement in which the pitch of background music is lowered or raised. They are subsequently asked to evaluate the music and traits of the advertised brand and indicate their predisposed styles of thinking. Findings: Consumers tend to judge a brand in an audiovisual commercial as possessing a higher level of competence traits when the brand is accompanied by lower-pitched (vs higher-pitched) background music, which is mediated by levels of powerfulness they perceive from the background music. Consumers with holistic (vs analytic) thinking styles, who are known to devote more focused attention to background information, tend to be more (vs less) susceptible to the changes in pitch. Research limitations/implications: The current research approaches thinking styles as predisposed individual differences as in prior works in marketing. Provided that the predisposed thinking styles can be influenced by individuals' cultural backgrounds, the authors suggest cross-cultural studies as an approach to further validate the present findings. Practical implications: Given the recent trends that consumers are increasingly exposed to audiovisual ads with the rapid growth of various video-based platforms (e.g. YouTube) and mobile advertising, this empirical study may assist contemporary marketers in considering an acoustic strategy for brand communication using the audiovisual advertisement. This study suggests that the pitch of ad background music can serve as a manageable strategic tool that can assist in establishing an image of a competent brand. Originality/value: This research highlights a seemingly-trivial element in audiovisual advertisements, the pitch of background music, as a crucial determinant of the perceived competence of an advertised brand upon which further brand evaluations (e.g. brand trust, purchase intention) are based. An important yet overlooked effect of ad recipients' predisposed thinking styles on how consumers respond to the changes of background cues in audiovisual commercials is also proposed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Background music; Brand competence; Consumer perception; Thinking styles",""

The importance of distinct perceived value linked to service quality has also been emphasized for increasing customer satisfaction. Further, customer loyalty facilitators, such as trust, commitment, and inertia, have been actively discussed in building long-term relationships between firms and their customers. Because establishing an iterative customer loyalty journey is the key to a marketing strategy, the purpose of this study was to clarify how the trinity of extended service quality, distinct perceived value, and customer loyalty facilitators works in that journey. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to examine the model fit, composite reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the constructs. PLS-SEM was also used to assess direct and indirect (i.e. mediating) effects. Findings: First, the conceptual framework necessary for establishing an iterative customer loyalty journey has been empirically identified. Second, service technology is a key construct of extended service quality as exhibitions transform into digitalized communication platforms. Third, both distinct perceived value and satisfaction act as significant mediators between extended service quality and customer loyalty facilitators.

Design/methodology/approach: This study explored visual comprehension in memory for 360-degree video advertisements using the theoretical assumptions of the social psychology theory of social information processing by Wyer (2003). The authors conducted two experiments over a timeline of three months. In the first experiment, participants watched the 360-degree video advertisement once, and after one week, the same set of participants watched the same advertisement again. The theoretical assumptions in the comprehension unit were used to design the experiments and to explore visual comprehension in memory for 360-degree video advertisements. The data were collected using surveys and interviews through an experimental research design approach. NVivo software was used to analyse the data. Findings: This study found that while female participants were able to comprehend colours in the visuals better, male participants were better able to comprehend facial expressions presented in the visuals. Further, both female and male participants were able to comprehend locations within the advertisement visuals. It was found that participants understood the plot or the story of the advertisement better after the second viewing than after the first viewing. Practical implications: The two main contributions from this study are as follows: from a theoretical perspective, the application of a social psychology theory for the advertising sector enables us to gather more insights about the social cognition stages of a human mindset such as information retrieval, judgement, decision making, goal stimulation and short- and long-term memory. In doing so, this study not only explored adolescents' visual comprehension memory of 360-degree video advertisements, but it also contributed to the theory of social information processing by Wyer (2003) by exploring consumer visual comprehension memory. From a practical perspective, the findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future advertising firms or agencies, marketers, and salespeople on how to design effective advertisements using 360-degree video versions in a way that appeals to consumer visual memory.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper constructs the development level model of urban logistics economy in Guangdong Province from three aspects: demand level, supply level and support level, and uses the entropy weight method to measure the development level index of urban logistics economy in Guangdong Province. Then, the traffic accessibility index model is used to measure the traffic accessibility index between cities in Guangdong Province. Finally, using the social network analysis method, combined with the development level index of urban logistics economy in Guangdong Province and the urban traffic access index in Guangdong Province, this paper analyzes the spatial connection characteristics and influencing factors of logistics economy network in Guangdong Province. Findings: There are regional differences in the development level of logistics economy in Guangdong Province; The overall network density of its logistics economic connection is large, but there is an imbalance in the network structure, and the core edge phenomenon is obvious; Logistics economic space presents the characteristics of double core development. Research limitations/implications: Because the research object is the spatial connection characteristics of logistics economy in Guangdong Province, the research results may lack universality. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to put forward further tests. Practical implications: By studying the spatial connection mode of logistics economy in 21 cities in Guangdong Province, China, this paper promotes the original methods and empirical contributions, and constructs the research framework of spatial relationship of logistics economy. This research framework is universal to a certain extent. Social implications: This paper is conducive to promoting the integrated development of logistics economy in Guangdong Province and improving the balance of regional development of logistics economy. Originality/value: Firstly, this study provides a new perspective to understand the spatial relationship and spatial spillover of logistics economy from relational data rather than attribute data.

The authors then examine the mediating role of perceived competence and perceived warmth. Furthermore, the authors explore the moderating effect of power distance belief (PDB) on the relationships between green advertising receptivity with different appeals and consumers' perceived competence and perceived warmth respectively. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the online survey platform, a total of 468 responses were obtained in China from January to March 2022. 408 valid replies were collected and analyzed in this study. The research hypotheses were empirically verified with bootstrap approach. Findings: The empirical results indicate that both functional green advertisi\ng receptivity and emotional green advertising receptivity are significantly positively correlated with green purchase intention, and perceived competence and perceived warmth play the mediating role. Besides, PDB significantly strengthens the relationship between functional green advertising receptivity and perceived competence, but weakens the incentive effect of emotional green advertising receptivity on perceived warmth. Originality/value: The psychological mechanism of the receptivity of green advertising with different appeals affecting green purchase intention remains unclear. This is one of the first studies to uncover how functional green advertising receptivity and emotional green advertising receptivity influence green purchase intention. Besides, the impact of PDB on the formation process of consumer perception is also a black box.

Design/methodology/approach: The research model was examined empirically by targeting 360 consumers who follow Royal Jordanian Airlines on Facebook pages. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data collected. Findings: Using the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) theory and customer engagement model as the theoretical foundations, this study confirms that SMMEs are a strong predictor and play a vital role in developing and building social media customer engagement and brand loyalty. This study also found that the cognitive aspect of CBE is a key driver in enhancing brand loyalty. Furthermore, cognitive social media CBE positively mediated the relationship between SMMEs and brand loyalty. Contrary to expectations, emotional CBE had no mediating effect on the relationship between SMMEs and brand loyalty.

"Being natural is aesthetic: the effects of “natural” labeling on lay beliefs and the purchase intention of unattractive produce","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140987828&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2022-0316&partnerID=40&md5=e74ce387ecf21a4ab7f0388ba4754bdd","Purpose: Individuals, organizations, firms, and governments have been making strenuous effort to promote sustainable and green consumption. However, it is noticeable that a large amount of unattractive produce is ruthlessly discarded and wasted around the globe, resulting in unsustainable consumption behavior, harming long-term business development, and breaking the harmonious relationship between humans and nature. Therefore, to increase consumer literacy toward unaesthetic produce, this research investigates the pivotal role of “natural” labeling in increasing purchase intention toward visually unattractive fruits and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach: By recruiting participants from one of the largest online crowdsourcing platforms (the Credamo), this research conducts three online experimental studies (with two pilot studies) to test three hypotheses based on the cue utilization theory and the lay belief theory. Findings: The results show that unattractive produce with the “natural” label could significantly increase consumers' purchase intention compared with those without specific labels. The results also reveal that consumers' lay beliefs that natural foods are perceived to be tastier and healthier mediate the positive effects of “natural” labeling (vs no specific labeling) on willingness to purchase. Originality/value: This research explores competing lay beliefs about unattractive produce. It identifies the positive effects of lay beliefs “natural = tasty and healthy” through “natural” labeling appeal, thus attenuating the misapplication of lay beliefs “unattractive = tasteless and unhealthy” and broadening the application scope of consumer lay belief theory. The findings also contribute to the cue literature by manifesting the positive consequences of the “natural” label playing as a cognitive cue in priming lay beliefs about naturalness. In addition, it also paves a positive way for business practitioners and marketers to develop the produce industry sustainably. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food waste; Lay beliefs; Natural” labeling; Purchase intention; Sustainable consumption; Unattractive produce; “",""

This paper examines the opposite situation. It also investigates the process underlying consumer responses by identifying a moderator and mediators. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to assess the effect of extension direction (upward vs downward) on consumers' extension evaluations. Study 1 incorporated implicit theories of relationships (the growth belief) as a moderator and inferred motives for launching a vertical line extension as mediators in the effect. Study 2 presented a firm's rationale for undertaking the extension to examine whether it influenced evaluations. Findings: Consumers' preferences for downward over upward extensions appeared in markets where the exclusivity of luxury brands had been reduced. However, the resistance to upward extensions was weaker when consumers endorsed stronger growth beliefs in human relationships. Consumers inferred customer- and selling-oriented motives more strongly from downward than upward extensions, enhancing the evaluations. Finally, when presenting a rationale for launching an extension in the launch announcement, customer-oriented reasoning raised the evaluations higher than selling-oriented reasoning but did not elevate the evaluations higher than the announcement showing no reason. Originality/value: This study advances the literature on vertical line extensions and shows that consumers' preference for upward over downward extensions is not universal. The opposite pattern exists in markets with a lower distinction between high- and low-end brands. It supports the theoretical notion that responses are driven by the differences in growth belief and in cognitive inferences vis-à-vis motives. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Downward extension; Implicit theories of relationships; Inferred motive; Upward extension; Vertical line extension",""

While its implementation has been pervasively attempted, there is a lack of systematic and academic exploration of the practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the LSS ecosystem and its development through a literature review and an industry analysis. Moreover, by pinpointing the pitfalls in current practices, this paper presents the practical implications of LSS and provides recommendations and directions for future academic exploration. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the present study was to investigate the developing trajectory, exclusive elements (such as multi-channel networks (MCNs) and live streamers) and other critical components of the LSS ecosystem using a mixed-methods approach that comprises content analysis of newspaper articles and press releases, literature view and industry analysis. Findings: The results of the analyses indicate the presence of several nonfungible modular components in the LSS ecosystem, including upstream suppliers, MCNs, live streamers and platforms. It was also found that inequalities and hierarchies are inherent to the LSS ecosystem as it currently exists: low-end participants in the LSS industry and small- and medium-sized enterprise owners, who constitute the majority of LSS practitioners, cannot reach the break-even point via LSS hosted by top-level live streamers or others (low-level live streamers, employees, etc.). Originality/value: This article discusses the LSS ecosystem based on the nature of the nonfungible modules within it. In addition, it discusses the modules (roles) and relationships among them based on the theory of ecosystem developed by previous studies. Furthermore, drawing from an analysis of the pitfalls in the LSS ecosystem, this article highlights strategies for two critical e-commerce processes: 1) choosing which type of LSS to apply based on the factors of brands, products and consumers and 2) integrating LSS to optimize post-sale service and appeal to the sustainability of development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Endorsement; Live streaming sales (LSS); LSS ecosystem; Multi-channel networks (MCNs); Social media influencer",""

This study examines the importance of attributes associated with the visibility of COO labelling in the context of packaged fresh meat. Design/methodology/approach: Best–worst Scaling (BWS) is used to investigate consumers' preferences for label attributes. Treatments involved two countries (New Zealand and Australia), four font sizes and two placement positionings of COO information on the packaging. Findings: First, the study indicated consumers' preference for domestic than imported meat. This finding supports the intent of COO labelling, which is to inform product selection. Second, the authors ascertained that how COO information is displayed in terms of visibility is important also. Consumers indicated a preference for larger than smaller font size. However, where the COO detail is located on the packaging is of less importance.

Despite this growth, little research has examined customer experiences with C2C e-commerce. This study examines how informational and emotional interactions affect customer patronage behaviors by increasing customer trust in both sellers and platforms. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 181 customers of C2C platforms in the United States. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: The results show that informational interactions affect customer trust both in sellers and platforms, resulting in customer loyalty. The findings also show that emotional interactions affect customer trust in sellers. Multi-group analyses suggest that the impacts of informational and emotional interactions on trust vary depending on customer demographics. Research limitations/implications: Theoretical implications in this study arise from (1) examination of customer experiences with C2C platforms using the stimulus-organism-response framework, (2) identification of the role of informational and emotional interactions in the formation of trust and (3) exploration of the ways in which customer gender, age and income affect the connection between experiences and consequences in C2C settings.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative analysis approach. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and entropy weight were utilised to analyse 17 airports in three Airports Council International regions: Asia, Europe and North America. Through operational and financial factors, these sample airports identified the most efficiently operated airports from 2016 to 2019. Findings: Overall, Asian airports were superior in operational and financial efficiency. Unlike operating performance, the sample airport’s financial and total performance results show a similar trend. There were no noticeable changes in operational factors. Therefore, differences in financial variables for each airport may affect the total performance. Practical implications: This study provides insightful implications for airport policymakers to establish a standardised information disclosure foundation for consistent analysis and encourage airports to provide this information. Originality/value: The adoption of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) to debt ratio and EBITDA per passenger, which had previously been underutilised in the previous study as financial factors, demonstrated differences between airports for airport stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical basis of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was utilized. An online survey of 46 questions and 190 responses of Chinese consumers between the ages of 18 and 23 was conducted. PROCESS and a linear regression were used to analyze the results. Findings: Through the lens of the TAM (Davis, 1989), the findings of this study determined that for participants TAM was deemed more useful when TAM was viewed than as easier to use. However, in this case perceived ease of use and usefulness did not directly relate to attitude. Instead, attitude was directly related to self-expression, confidence and involvement as the determining factors of positive attitude leading to intention.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate the text-posting behaviors with mobile device usage. To examine the authors' hypotheses, the authors collect online reviews posted in London hotels on Booking.com. The authors first use a logistic regression model to examine the relationship between the usage of mobile devices and text-posting behavior. Then, the authors explored the characteristics of textual content in mobile reviews compared to reviews written via traditional devices. Findings: The authors' finding shows that the use of mobile devices negatively influences text-posting behavior. Compared to traditional devices, consumers are less likely to post texts in their reviews with mobile devices. Although consumers decide to post text comments in consumers' reviews, the quality of textual content is relatively low – short in length, with limited analytical thinking and less authenticity.

However, previous studies are divergent regarding the impacts of satisfaction on eWOM. This survey aims to (a) investigate the impacts of perceived quality by restaurant consumers on positive emotions, negative emotions and satisfaction; (b) verify the impacts of satisfaction on the propensity to loyalty and eWOM; (c) test whether the consumers’ behavioural engagement in the SNS (CBE-SNS) moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM. Design/methodology/approach: This survey included 416 university students in Peru who completed an electronic form about their experiences at à la carte restaurants. PLS-SEM tested the hypothetical model based on S-O-R Theory (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974). Findings: The perceived quality by consumers regarding their restaurant experiences positively impacts satisfaction and positive emotions and negatively affects negative emotions. Satisfaction strongly influences the propensity to loyalty but weakly the eWOM. The CBE-SNS moderates the intensity of the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM. Originality/value: This study is the first to concomitantly test the relationships between perceived quality, positive and negative emotions, satisfaction, the propensity to loyalty, e-WOM and CBE-SNS. Consumer engagement moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM.

"Investigating the impact of authenticity of social media influencers on followers' purchase behavior: mediating analysis of parasocial interaction on Instagram","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148659358&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2022-0598&partnerID=40&md5=8cef32a6237e75925730a976a3b7a7ab","Purpose: The current study has drawn attention to investigating the impact of social media influencers’ (SMIs) authenticity on followers buying behavior by using followers who have an ongoing relationship with an influencer and are knowledgeable about the influencer. The study further intends to reveal the mediating effect of parasocial interaction on the relationship between SMI's authenticity and followers' purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study has analyzed data from an online survey of 458 participants (Instagram followers) using structured equation modeling (CB-SEM) to investigate the relationship among authenticity attributes, parasocial interaction and followers' purchase behavior. Findings: CB-SEM results reveal that authenticity attributes positively influence followers' buying behavior. The findings from mediation analysis specify that parasocial interaction mediates the relationship between authenticity attributes (sincerity, truthful endorsement and visibility) and buying behavior excluding expertise, uniqueness attributes. Practical implications: The findings of the study reinforce the need to use authentic influencers by the marketers for the brand endorsements. Further, the findings of the study can benefit marketers in implementing strategic practice of social media influencer marketing. Originality/value: The study overcomes the limitations of preceding studies by using Instagram followers who are well-informed about SMIs and have an ongoing relationship with them. This study has uniquely combined the behavioral data from real influencer campaigns with followers' assessment of an influencer's authenticity. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer buying behavior; Internet marketing; Parasocial interaction; SEM; Social media influencer marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted with customers who are located in the USA via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Study 1 employed a 2 (visual entropy: neat vs non-neat) × 2 (time-related positioning: traditional vs modern) between-subjects design using four advertisements for a fictitious ice cream brand. Study 2 employed a 2 (visual entropy: neat vs non-neat) × 2 (time-related positioning: traditional vs modern) between-subjects design using four book covers for fruit salad recipes. Findings: The findings demonstrate low entropy (i.e. neatness) increases purchase likelihood when being paired with modern positioning, whilst high entropy (i.e. non-neat presentation) positively influences the propensity to purchase a traditional product on account of temporal fit. These relationships are mediated by perceived quality and nostalgia. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of visual entropy and addresses the inconclusive evidence of the impact of the neatness of product presentation on consumer behavior. The authors elucidate the mechanisms behind which neatness and non-neatness of food presentation affect purchase likelihood when different types of time-related positioning are featured. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food presentation; Neatness; Nostalgia; Perceived quality; Purchase likelihood; Time-related positioning",""

It then produces the research model of impulsive purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the online questionnaire survey method was used to survey users who participated in live-streaming shopping, and a total of 335 valid questionnaires were collected. Then SPSS and SmartPLS were used for data empirical evaluation and hypotheses test. Findings: Research results show that demand, convenience, interactivity, and playfulness are positively stimulating consumers' perceived enjoyment. And their perceived enjoyment directly drives their intention of impulsive purchase. Practical implications: The choice of the live streaming platform, the design of the interactive interface, and the design of the shopping process are all factors that the streamer must carefully consider. The results of this study can be used as a reference for the development of live-streaming shopping and provide the industry with an understanding of the main factors that affect users' live streaming and impulsive purchases to plan an effective live streaming platform and content.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, and data were analysed. Manual coding was chosen as an efficient method to process qualitative interview data given the relatively small sample size in this study. Findings: Three main themes emerged from analysis: (1) tourists' negative perceptions of child sex tourism; (2) tourist boycotts against child sex tourism destinations and activities as reactions to this socially deviant and illegal phenomenon and (3) tourist advocacy to enhance public awareness of child sex tourism. These themes suggest that tourists, as key tourism stakeholders, have difficulty accepting that child sex tourism occurs and would like to identify solutions to end illegal activities. Tourist boycotts would positively affect sustainable tourism development by eliminating illegal businesses, including those involving child prostitution, from the tourism industry. The qualitative method is applied here to develop a conceptual framework explaining tourists' perceptions of and reactions to child sex tourism. Practical implications: A conceptual framework of Chinese individuals' perceptions of and reactions to child sex tourism has been devised using a qualitative approach. Although this framework takes child sex tourism as its focus, it can also be applied to better understand tourists' perspectives of other socially deviant or illegal behaviours within the tourism industry. The findings of this study provide valuable implications for various tourism stakeholders. Originality/value: The current study makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to an under-researched topic – child sex tourism. A conceptual framework of Chinese individuals' perceptions of and reactions to child sex tourism has been devised using a qualitative approach. Findings from this study may inspire campaigns to protect children from being drawn into sex tourism.

Design/methodology/approach: A review of research on COO and the concept of “Cool Japan” was conducted, including commentary of previous relevant theoretical frameworks. Findings: The evidence has shown that the brand images of various COOs is dependent on their cultural exports. In the case of Japan, the “Cool Japan” initiative, which initiated the creation and dissemination of Japanese cultural contents such as anime, games and art, has led to tremendous and sustainable economic growth in Japan till date. Research limitations/implications: As previous studies on COO are wide-ranging, they are not exhaustively presented in this paper. However, the importance of considering not only animosity, which has traditionally been taken into account, but also the coolness aspect is suggested. Practical implications: This paper shows that “coolness” is an important concept when nations or regions consider their branding strategies and an integrated approach is needed. Originality/value: This paper extends previous COO research and adds coolness to the traditional animosity. It also considers these in comparison across countries and goes as far as the need to propose a new scale.

Yet many of the variables found in inter-personal relationships are also found in B2B relationships and both types of relationships have similar fail rates. The authors take a multi-disciplinary approach by adapting an instrument from marriage therapy into a new measure called the Business Relationship Health Index (BRHI). In the process we re-evaluate the drivers of B2B relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the Global Assessment of Relational Functioning (GARF) psychiatric system to B2B relationships. The GARF instrument incorporates three components: interaction/problem solving, organization/structure and emotional climate. Using US panel data of 500 B2B relationships based in the USA, the authors use partial least squares analysis and develop a structural equation model to test the validity and reliability of the BRHI with some well-known relationship measures including, satisfaction, trust, commitment and performance. Findings: The findings support a strong link between the BRHI (emotion, interaction and organization) and relationship performance. The proposed measure shows a strong link between BRHI and relationship performance (R2 = 0.54). Originality/value: The GARF instrument has never been applied to a B2B context. BRHI is a holistic instrument used for assessing the specific relational characteristics of B2B relationships. The BRHI can benefit relationship stakeholders when used as a diagnostic tool to prioritize B2B investment strategies. Managers can use BRHI to determine the extent to which the relationship is healthy or needs repair, re-evaluation, re-commitment, or repositioning. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B relationships; Emotion; Interaction; Organization; Psychotherapy",""

The study assesses the predictive effect of BSSC on consumers' brand evaluations and its variation according to the brand types and consumers' attributes. The purpose is to provide managerial suggestions as well as theoretical implications to build an effective BSI strategy from the perspective of consumer psychology. Design/methodology/approach: The data from 409 respondents in Japan are assessed to discuss the relationships among BSSC based on actual/ideal self-concept (actual/ideal BSSC), brand trust, brand affect and purchase intention according to hypothetical BSI settings. Findings: The results suggest a significant role of BSSC in consumers' brand evaluation mechanisms associated with BSI: mostly, actual BSSC affects non-luxury brand evaluation, while ideal BSSC affects luxury brand evaluation. Likewise, the effects of actual/ideal BSSC seem to vary according to consumers' income levels. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers strategically consider consumer psychology of brand evaluation with actual/ideal BSSC, income levels and brand attributes such as luxury level in BSI planning. Thus, they may predict its contribution to brand equity, leading to companies' performance being compatible with environmental contribution. Originality/value: This study uniquely extends the self-congruity theory and discusses the psychological brand evaluation mechanism comprising BSSC, presenting the switching role of actual/ideal self-concept according to brand types and consumers' attributes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Actual self-concept; Ideal self-concept; Luxury; Self-congruity; Sustainability",""

But the adoption of such apps has varied across product categories, and research on user acceptance of AR marketing has been fragmented. The current study aims to develop and test a general model that explains the formation of decision comfort (DC) in the majority of AR try-on experiences for mobile shopping. Design/methodology/approach: After reviewing 30 VTOs available on the iOS app store, the authors chose the Wanna Kicks sneaker shopping VTO as the most representative to test their hypotheses for AR try-on in general. Overall, 178 online consumers performed a sneaker shopping task on their mobile devices, and their responses were analyzed with the partial least squares method. Findings: The study confirmed the key role of perceived augmentation in leading to DC via a utilitarian and a hedonic path. These effects were attenuated for younger users, and haptic imagery only had a utilitarian impact. Scholars should pay more attention to the variable of age, while managers should act quickly to enhance the basic AR affordances of mobile try-on apps.

Next, using the quality function deployment technique, three quantitative case studies were performed to determine the most important challenges and resilience strategies. Finally, utilising fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, the authors determine sufficient conditions of challenges and strategies leading to improve vaccine O&DP. Findings: The findings reveal that strategies alone are not effective instead a combination of strategies and nullification of challenges is needed to enhance vaccine O&DP. Further, the findings revealed that not only the presence of challenges, but also the lack of strategies reduces the vaccine O&DP.

Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments tested recipients' attitudes and behaviors across cultures in each gift-giving stage. Study 1 explored the gestation stage (gift search and purchase). Study 2 tested recipients in the prestation stage (actual exchange), and Study 3 examined the reformulation stage (gift disposition and realignment of the relationship). Findings: Results show that relationship closeness between the giver and the recipient plays a role among interdependent self-construals. Thais (interdependent self-construals) are more likely to give a hint or make a request for a gift to close friends than distant friends and are also more likely to accept, keep and use gifts from close friends than from distant friends. Moreover, for interdependent self-construals, a gift from a close friend improved the relationship more than a gift from a distant friend. In contrast, Americans (independent self-construals) present no differences between close and distant friends.

There is a need to understand the performance and limitation of the relatively novel GPD, because the importance of pricing and the surprise element inherent in GPD could cause the promotions to backfire when inappropriately applied. This study compared the performance of GPD and RPD via consumers' perception of their attractiveness through quality cues of product types (experience and search goods) and word-of-mouth (WOM) content (affective and cognitive). Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied on a 2 (product type: experience goods [hotel rooms] vs. search goods [printers]) × 2 (word-of-mouth type: affective vs. cognitive) × 2 (price promotion type: GPD vs. RPD) between-subjects scenario experimental design (resulting in eight conditions). Findings: Analysis of the 600 returns revealed that RPD does well for both search and experience goods, but GPD is more attractive for the marketing of experience goods. GPD works better with cognitive than with affective WOM. Originality/value: GPD is a relatively new domain in marketing research. This study contributes to GPD literature and behavioral pricing literature. The study also adds to a better understanding of the dynamics, usefulness and limitations of GPD by considering the roles played by surprise element inherent in GPD and comparing it with RPD. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affective-cognitive word-of-mouth; Experience-search goods; Gambled price discount; Regular price discount",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 386 restaurant managers' viewpoints to examine the mutual relationships among CBBE and other critical attributes of corporate social responsibility (CSR), electronic word of mouth (EWOM) and brand personality. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to examine the proposed moderation and mediation hypotheses. Findings: The results show that corporate social responsibility (CSR) mediates the relationship between brand personality and brand image. Furthermore, the mutual relationship among CBBE is discovered in that brand image may indirectly affect brand loyalty through perceived quality and brand awareness. Furthermore, with the reliance on social media, the moderating roles of electronic word of mouth (EWOM) are also revealed that strengthen the indirect effect of brand personality on brand awareness through CSR and brand image. Originality/value: With the increasing attention to CBBE, which aims at tourism destination brand equity, hotel branding from the customer perspective, restaurant managers' viewpoints are not considered. Further, because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, customers are paying more attention to food safety and food delivery processes, which are important for CSR and connected to CBBE. However, until now, fewer studies have addressed these issues as such.

"Developing a feature-centric and affordance-based conceptualization of social media interactions","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135417540&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2022-0121&partnerID=40&md5=3a3b088cf390ff74fa792a93b2192ca1","Purpose: Despite the significance of online communication and interactions, previous research has not systematically compared all features on a single platform from the users' perspective. This study aims to fill this gap by extensively reviewing the current literature on social media affordances and proposes and tests a feature-centric and affordance-based conceptualization of social media platforms (SMPs) between users, features, the audience and content. Design/methodology/approach: This research surveys users on Facebook, one of the largest SMPs, and asks them to assess 20 features of Facebook on six relational affordances between users, features, audience and content. The data in this study were collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) with participants from the US Correspondence analysis was employed to examine the relationship between affordances and the ties among affordances, features and outcomes. Findings: Results of the study indicate that users perceive features differently, and employing features as the unit of analysis captures users' interactions effectively. The findings support the presence of user-oriented affordances, such as presentation flexibility, association and content association. These three affordances can be summarized in two higher-level ones: self-expression and connection (SEC) and persona-linked content (PLC). Our findings of the two dimensions, SEC and PLC, highlight the importance of targets and their connections in understanding social media interactions' dynamic nature. Practical implications: By proposing to shift the focus from platforms to features, this study suggests that companies should focus on understanding the features they use for their users to interact with their brand, rather than merely ensuring that their company is omnipresent on all platforms. This study underlines the need to focus on features that will help managers influence interpersonal and user-brand communications and interactions on social media. Originality/value: This research is the first to put features at the center of its investigation and quantitatively examine the relationship between social media features and affordances in a social media context. In all, this research provides a new unit of analysis that is more suitable for researchers to build a robust conceptual foundation for affordances. We believe that conceptualizing audience and content as outcomes, distinguishing it from features and creating connections between them as affordances is the unique aspect of our conceptualization. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affordance; Feature-based analysis; Feature–affordance relationship; Social media",""

However, the rise of web-based technology has highlighted consumer-manufacturer interaction in mass customization (MC). This paper explores the relationships between CPMA, manufacturing flexibility, customer participation and customized product quality, inspired by module decomposition and integration theory. Design/methodology/approach: The study carried out a questionnaire survey of 241 directors who are specifically responsible for MC in the apparel industry in China and tested hypotheses with structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: CPMA has a direct positive influence on customized product quality and an indirect positive effect through manufacturing flexibility. Also, customer participation after placing an order (CPAPO) has a negative moderating effect on the linkage between CPMA and manufacturing flexibility. Research limitations/implications: A more dynamic relationship between CPMA and MF can be explored in the future, and the findings can be tested in other industries with more abundant data. Practical implications: Manufacturing flexibility should be improved along with CPMA in MC. Also, disruptions caused by customer participation in the post-design stage should be noticed. In this context, better consumer service in the early design stage may be one possible solution. Originality/value: First, the essential but unexplored mediating role of manufacturing flexibility is identified, adding knowledge to the consumer–manufacturer interaction literature in MC production.

The case of ecolabel brands was chosen as the context of the investigation. Findings: The results suggest that brand awareness and perceived CSR dimensions positively impact consumer relationship intention. It was also observed that perceived CSR dimensions moderate the relationship between brand awareness and relationship intention. Consumers with more favorable sentiments of economic, environmental and social dimensions as reflected by the firms' CSR programs exhibit a higher degree of relationship intention. Research limitations/implications: Using the stakeholder theory as well as the brand value chain framework, this study adds to the literature regarding the significance of perceived CSR dimensions to better build and maintain relationships with the targeted customers of an environmentally friendly product. CSR strategies should be emphasized for relevant companies in terms of the economic, environmental and social aspects. According to this research, customer views about the three CSR initiative characteristics may act as a moderator in the interactions between consumer awareness and relationship intention. Practical implications: CSR may be utilized in addition to traditional marketing communication to represent the firm's unique value proposition in the market.

However, few studies have considered whether DIF strengthens the substitution of household financial investment for consumption behavior. To clarify the relationship between DIF, household financial investment and household consumption behavior, the authors combine matched data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and Peking University Digital Inclusive Finance Index (2011–2018) to explore the impact of DIF on household financial substitution. This study aims to discuss the aforementioned objectives. Design/methodology/approach: This study's empirical analysis applies ordinary least squares (OLS) to answer how DIF affects household financial investment substitution for consumption. This study uses three approaches to examine the robustness of the benchmark regression model. These three approaches are replacing the core explanatory variables, using the lagged Digital Inclusive Finance Index and using the data of additional years. This article also assesses endogeneity by applying the instrumental variable method. Findings: The results indicate that DIF significantly enhances household financial substitution. This article also assesses endogeneity by applying the instrumental variable method and robustness test methods. The impact mechanism test shows that DIF positively affects household financial substitution, by improving information dissemination efficiency and enhancing financial participation. Further research finds that the impact of DIF on household financial substitution is more pronounced in households with low to moderate savings rates, low to average income households and homes without family members who start their businesses. Research limitations/implications: This study analyzed the effect and mediating mechanisms of digital financial inclusion on household financial substitution. Like all studies, the research had some limitations. First, due to differences in culture and infrastructure development, people do not understand and judge economic behaviors, such as household financial investment and consumption, in the same way. It can lead to certain biases in their understanding and study responses. Second, the study is mainly based on data from China. Future studies should be extended to foreign countries for comparative analysis. Third, the development of DIF has not yet completed a full cycle, and many problems have not been fully identified. Practical implications: This study provides some practical implication. First, the public sectors should effectively weigh the spending relationship between household financial investment and consumption. Second, the public sector should focus on the policy optimization and consistency of DIF. The public sector should both enhance the breadth of coverage and depth of impact of DIF and focus on long-tail groups to fully reflect the equity and inclusiveness of DIF. Originality/value: This study responds to the discussion on the relationship between financial investment, saving and consumption games in household expenditures and enhances our understanding of how DIF affects households' complex economic behavior. The most revealing finding is that DIF reinforces the substitution of household financial investment for household consumption. DIF positively affects household financial substitution by improving the efficiency of information dissemination and increasing financial participation, which is a valid extension of the study on the mechanisms of information dissemination and financial participation in financial investment and consumption proposed. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital inclusive finance; Financial participation; Household financial substitution; Information transfer",""

At the same time, social exclusion and loneliness occur widely, influencing consumers' product preferences and choices. Hence, this study aimed to explore the impact of social exclusion on green consumption and its underlying mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for an empirical study with different research designs and green consumption measures. This pilot study investigated the relationship between social exclusion and green consumption by examining the frequency of green consumption behaviours in the past. Study 1 established a causal link between these two variables by manipulating social exclusion in a controlled experiment and assessed green product preferences. Study 2 further generalised the results of the secondary data analysis from the World Values Survey (WVS). Findings: Overall, the research study provides convergent evidence that chronically or transiently excluded consumers are less likely to implement green consumption than their counterparts who do not feel socially excluded; this effect is partially mediated by a reduced sense of control and willingness to sacrifice for society after social exclusion. Originality/value: Based on social exclusion theory and considering the unique characteristics of green consumption, this study enriches research in the fields of social exclusion and green consumption, revealing the negative effect of social exclusion on green consumption and the dual mediators in this relationship. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Green consumption; Sense of control; Social exclusion; Willingness to sacrifice for society",""

"How the construal of power impacts healthy food preference: the mediating role of self-discipline perception","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143083104&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2022-0290&partnerID=40&md5=a920f0b08d2d25fa2601a0809317338d","Purpose: With the improvement of consumers' health consciousness, healthy food has attracted great attention in daily consumption. Previous research into the sense of power often distinguishes it into high and low level, ignoring the impact of different construal of power on consumption behaviors. This article divides power into dual construal (responsibility vs opportunity) and aims to examine the differential impacts of the construal of power on healthy food preference. Design/methodology/approach: Two pretests and three formal experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the construal of power on the consumer's healthy food preference, the mediation of self-discipline perception and the moderation of the relative strength of prevention over promotion focus (i.e. RSPPF). Findings: Results indicate that individuals who construe power as responsibility (vs opportunity) exhibit higher self-discipline perception, which in turn leads to greater healthy food preference. However, the main effect above can be weakened among the low-power group. Moreover, the above mediating effect of self-discipline perception is stronger for individuals with higher RSPPF. Originality/value: First, based on the binary-construal perspective, this study refines the classification of high power and introduces it into the antecedent research of healthy food preference. Second, this paper reveals the self-discipline perception as the inner mechanism underlying the effect of the construal of power on healthy food preference, while RSPPF as the boundary condition for this mediating mechanism. Moreover, this research also provides practical implications for healthy food enterprises that the construal of power, self-discipline perception and regulatory focus should be taken into consideration in advertising design and healthy product promotion. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Healthy food preference; Self-discipline perception; The construal of power; The relative strength of prevention over promotion focus",""

Moreover, the cultural difference between the United States and China was explored in the integrated model. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,589 responses were collected from American (n = 725) and Chinese consumers (n = 864). The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to perform measurement assessment, structural model and multiple group analysis. Findings: Results showed that consumers' continuance intention to purchase in social commerce was significantly predicted by the integrated model. Within the ECM, confirmation of expectations positively affected information usefulness and satisfaction, and information usefulness positively influenced satisfaction, which further led to continuance intention. Moreover, within the IAM, both argument quality and source credibility positively affect information usefulness, which leads to information adoption and continuance intention to purchase in social commerce. In addition, the influences of information usefulness on information adoption and continuance intention to purchase in social commerce were stronger for American consumers.

"Toward a better understanding of the attitude–behavior gap in organic food conative loyalty: a moderation and moderated mediation analysis","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136782650&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2021-0420&partnerID=40&md5=16b0780c67e27c1a8078f533012d71e9","Purpose: Previous research has found mixed evidence of an attitude–behavior gap in organic food consumption. However, the complex mechanisms underlying this gap warrant further investigation. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of word-of-mouth (WOM), trust, and involvement in the relationship between consumer organic food attitudes and conative loyalty. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used as underlying framework for modeling our conceptualized arguments. Design/methodology/approach: A moderation and moderated mediation analysis was performed on a cross-sectional sample of 1,011 Australian organic food consumers. Findings: The results support the TPB-inspired moderated-mediation model. Specifically, the authors found moderated mediation effects of WOM, trust, and involvement on conative loyalty via attitudes toward organics. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional research design and the focus solely on Australian consumers constitute limitations of this study. Practical implications: The authors' findings imply that an analysis of the attitude–behavior gap should go beyond the testing of contingent consistency hypotheses and instead combine moderation and mediation mechanisms to better model consumer decision-making leading to conative loyalty. Practitioners would face a resource challenge when targeting low-trust, low-involvement, and low-WOM consumers as developing conative loyalty of these segments would require a longer-term approach through building favorable attitudes toward organic foods. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to demonstrate the potential of examining the attitude–behavior gap in the organic food context through a moderated mediation lens in explaining the dynamics of conative loyalty. © 2022, Tatiana Anisimova and Jan Weiss.","Attitude-behavior link; Conative loyalty; Involvement; Moderated mediation analysis; Theory of planned behavior; Trust; Word-of-mouth",""

The difference between generations (Generation Z vs. X) is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected through an online survey firm. The participants are Vietnamese consumers residing in Vietnam, varying in age from teens to those in their 50s (n = 500). The collected data are analyzed by SPSS 21.0 for the descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and reliability analysis. AMOS 21.0 is employed for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Findings: This study reveals that global identity affects Vietnamese consumers' attitudes toward Korea and their intent to consume Korean lifestyle products and services. Results show that only global identity affects attitudes and behavioral intention toward Korea among generation Xers, while national identity has no effect. For Generation Z (Gen Z), both global and national identities have a positive effect on attitudes toward Korea, which also increases the intent to consume Korean lifestyle products and services. Practical implications: Measuring individuals' global and national identities will allow brands and retailers to better understand international consumers of various generations and develop global marketing strategies.

At the same time, the study incorporated emotional engagement and two forms of trust as possible organisms for this model. Design/methodology/approach: Through snowball sampling, data collected from 263 respondents were analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The findings revealed that among the different forms of hedonic and utilitarian factors, all but perceived entertainment has a significant positive relationship to emotional engagement. Additionally, emotional engagement positively influences trust in the product and seller. However, the results show that only trust in the seller has a significant relationship with travelling intention. Predictive analysis shows that the model displays a strong predictive power. Originality/value: This study differentiates from the existing literature by investigating the effect of VR technologies on the two different forms of trust and emotional engagement on travelling intention.

Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (logo type: conventional vs. novel) X 2 (product involvement: high vs. low) between-subjects experimental design was employed. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was run on the dependent variables (i.e. attitude toward the brand, attitude toward social distancing guidelines, intention to follow social distancing guidelines, purchase intention, logo evaluation and WOM). Findings: The results indicate a significant moderating effect of product involvement. Individuals who were exposed to a novel logo for a low-involvement product demonstrated improved purchase intentions, attitudes towards the brand, WOM and intentions to follow social distancing guidelines. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, the results suggest that managers at global brands should consider their brand’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. For example, Nike chose to frame its consumers’ athletic habits as a lifesaving call to action with a new advertising copy that proposed, “If you ever dreamed of playing for millions around the world, now is your chance: play inside, play for the world,” to stress the necessity for people to stay at home. Social implications: From a theoretical perspective, the results of this study add to the emerging literature on CSR and logo changing, and particularly on following social distancing guidelines introduced in response to COVID-19, by exploring the link between COVID-19 advertising in promotional materials (logo changing) and outcomes such as attitude toward the brand, attitude toward social distancing guidelines, intention to follow social distancing guidelines, purchase intention, logo evaluation and WOM. Originality/value: This research study adds to the literature on CSR and logo changing, primarily the contribution is based on the understanding of the impact of social distancing guidelines introduced in response to COVID-19.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the hypotheses using a structural equation model using two countries' datasets obtained from 191 Japanese and 207 French consumers. Findings: The perceived attractiveness of a picture/photo on a book cover can positively influence feelings of delight. Such emotion enhances a book's perceived value, resulting in active online book purchases. Furthermore, when the perceived value of a book is evident, the French are more strongly motivated to purchase books compared to Japanese consumers.

However, the complex online shopping scene makes it challenging to directly identify the association between the characteristics of contextual cues and consumer behavior. Presently, few studies have only systematically extracted and refined the types and characteristics of contextual cues. The purpose of this study is to explore the types and mechanisms of contextual cues in online shopping scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the word2vec algorithm, grounded theory and co-occurrence cluster method, along with online shopping word-of-mouth (WOM) text and consumer behavior theory, in order to explore different types of contextual cues and its efficiency from 5,619 comment corpus. Findings: This study puts forward the following conclusions. (1) From the perspective of online shopping, contextual cues comprise aesthetic perception cues, value perception cues, trust-dependent cues, time perception cues, memory attention cues, spatial perception cues, attribute cues and relationship cues. (2) Based on the online shopping scenarios, contextual cues and their interaction effects exert an effect on consumer satisfaction, recommendation, purchase and return behavior. Originality/value: The study conclusions are helpful to further reveal the deep association between contextual cues and consumer behavior in the process of online shopping, thus providing practical and theoretical enlightenment for enterprises to not only effectively reshape the scene but also promote the consumers' active purchase behavior. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Contextual cues; Online consumer behavior; Online shopping; Perception cues; Text mining",""

Thus, this study aims to examine the impact of customer experiences with communication via overseas purchasing websites. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from overseas purchase customers in the United States, this study examines communication as either firm or customer generated and assesses their effects on brand-related outcomes. Findings: The results show that both firm- and customer-generated communication influence brand awareness, perceived quality, and loyalty. Also, the impact of brand awareness on perceived quality is supported. Differences in the relationship between communication and behavior across demographic characteristics (i.e. gender, age, income) are identified, and the impact of firm-generated content on customers is found to be greater than that of customer-generated communication. Research limitations/implications: Given the limitations of quantitative surveys to examine overseas retailing practices, the results of this study provide a starting point for future researchers to conduct more qualitative studies with customers from various cultures.

Male consumers showed more positive attitudes toward masculine sustainable brand stories than feminine ones. The authors also identify the moderating effect of consumer generation: Gen Z (versus Gen Y) consumers demonstrated stronger character identification with hybrid masculinity (versus hegemonic masculinity) sustainable brand stories, resulting in more favorable sustainable brand attitudes. Originality/value: The study provides a new angle for exploring the relationship between gendered sustainable brand stories and sustainable brand attitudes.

The aim of this study is to examine whether colour affects sponsorship effectiveness on printed advertisements of sports events. This is an area that has received less research interest. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 85 participants were randomly assigned to a control group and three experimental groups. In each of the groups, the participants viewed an advertisement of a sports event on a computer linked to an eye tracker. In the control group, the logos of sponsors were in their original colours. In each of the three experimental groups, the logos were manipulated and featured greyscale, blue or red backgrounds. Findings: The study found that sponsor recall and recognition rates were highest for the control group. Visual attention was also the highest in the control group. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that manipulating colours of the sponsors' logos can negatively affect attention and sponsorship effectiveness. Originality/value: While there exist studies that focus on the effects of colour in sponsorship, they are typically conducted with regard to physically attending the event itself. However, sponsorship involves other marketing collaterals such as printed advertisements on the event. In such mediums, colour contrast is also important in print advertisements as it affects readability and legibility.

Under the theoretical lens of the SOR model, this study aims to explore the nexus between brand social media marketing (BSMM) activities and online consumer brand engagement (CBE) via mediating consumers' emotions in the modest luxury fashion branding post-pandemic context. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a post-pandemic survey in five major metropolitan cities in Pakistan with a total of 584 eligible young consumers who follow the fan pages of fashion brands. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses. Findings: The findings reveal that BSMM activities have a significant influence on three emotion states (pleasure, arousal and dominance); however, only pleasure and arousal significantly drive CBE (i.e. affective engagement and activation). Moreover, the results show that pleasure and arousal partially mediate the relationships between BSMM activities and affective and activation dimensions of CBE, while dominance fully mediates the relationship between BSMM activities and cognitive engagement. Interestingly, only affective engagement was shown to be the most potent component of CBE in fostering positive emotions toward luxury fashion brands.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a face-to-face survey of 334 respondents. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to identify consumer segments, and econometric analysis is used to model the factors contributing to different levels of food waste. Findings: A total of six lifestyle segments are identified: the freshness lovers, the vegetarian and organic food lovers, the recycle/reuse advocates, the waste-conscious consumers, the label-conscious/sensory consumer and the food waste defenders. This research distinguishes between low and medium levels of food waste based on marginal effects analysis. At low levels of food waste, consumers who worry about the food waste cost, making efforts to reduce food waste are less likely to waste food. Affluent consumers, who claim to be waste conscious, have young children and frequently eat outside, are more likely to waste food than others, lying in the medium waste group. Originality/value: Australia, like many other countries, has high levels of food waste and despite policy efforts, curbing household food waste remains a challenge.

Design/methodology/approach: This study collected the casino's data from the financial reports during the period of 2007–2018. The proposed model incorporates a brand structure moderator, and the peculiar characteristics (e.g. ΔS, HHI) of the casino industry based on previous research. We constructed three models for dependent variables using Tobin's Q−1. Model (1, 2, 3) as the primary regressions to firms' intangible assets (and thus serving as tests of hypotheses), as depicted in the diagrams of the firm's brand equity in different scenarios. Findings: The results suggest that: (1) advertising expenditure has an adverse effect on firms' intangible assets; (2) the coefficients associated with brand structure dummy variables are both positive and significant; and the adverse effect is stronger for firms with house-of-brand's (HOB) and brand of house (BH) structure than for those with mixed branding structure (BH-HOB hybrid); (3) global brands have higher brand equity than local brands, with higher variance over time.

"What motivates consumers to be in line with online shopping?: a systematic literature review and discussion of future research perspectives","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129479086&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2021-0777&partnerID=40&md5=c109cb7c35ccf2c22236fe142af1e5a5","Purpose: This study conducts a systematic literature review to synthesize the extant literature primarily on “online shopping consumer behavior” and to gain insight into “What drives consumers toward online shopping”. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed guidelines for systematic literature reviews with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review is based on 79 research papers published from 2000 to 2020 in 21 reputed peer-reviewed international journals. The papers were analyzed and synthesized based on their defining characteristics, methodologies, major constructs and themes addressed. Findings: The literature synthesis indicated that consumers have to make a trade-off between 11 perceived benefits and six perceived sacrifices to improve their net perceived value before making the final decision to adopt online shopping. It is important to decode these factors as they could improve both the functional and recreational value of the shopping experience for online consumers, resulting in an improvement in conversion rates from a prospect to the final purchase at e-stores. This could improve turnover as well as profits for the e-tailers. Originality/value: This study pioneers to consolidate these factors through the lens of the value adoption model. This study also suggests insightful directions for further research perspectives in the online context from both consumers' and retailers' perspectives. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Online shopping; Perceived sacrifices; Perceived value; Systematic literature review; Value-based adoption model (VAM)",""
"The more envious the consumer, the more impulsive? The moderating role of self-monitoring and product type","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118975660&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2021-0399&partnerID=40&md5=19d38afce94d923f7c3c6e1d4c9d77e1","Purpose: This paper aimed to explore the influence of envy on impulsive consumption from aspects of the internal psychological mechanism and boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach: Based on social comparison theory, four studies were conducted in this research: The first study explored the effect of envy on impulsive consumption; the second study explored the moderating effect of self-monitoring and the mediating effect of materialism; the third study explored the moderating effect of product type and the fourth study explored the effectiveness of social comparison contexts on the arousal of envy. Findings: Study 1 showed that envy could significantly trigger consumers' impulsive consumption. Study 2 indicated that participants experiencing self-monitoring had a higher level of materialism and a stronger propensity to consume impulsively once the emotion of envy emerged. Study 3 suggested that when participants were more envious, their levels of materialism increased with more impulsivity to buy material products. Study 4 revealed that upward comparisons led to a higher level of envy and re-validated the mediating role of materialism between envy and impulsive consumption. Research limitations/implications: This study provides evidence for the association between envy and consumer behaviour and clarifies the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between envy and impulsive consumption. Practical implications: Marketers could take advantage of consumers' envy after social comparisons without damaging brand image. Originality/value: First, this study extended the effects of envy on consumer decisions, suggesting that envy stimulates impulsive consumption by increasing consumers' materialism. Second, this study revealed the boundary condition of product type, namely, material and experiential. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Envy; Impulsive consumption; Materialism; Product type; Self-monitoring",""

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on self-disclosure theory, the authors carried out simple linear regression analyses on a Chinese sample of 10,000 participants. Findings: The results revealed that significant gender differences exist between males and females in their IDW in mobile internet context, and females have higher IDW than males do. And the authors also found that first-tier (third tier) citizens have the lowest (highest) IDW in their mobile internet usage. Originality/value: This study offers three implications. First, this paper captures the insight of IDW within the mobile internet context, while previous studies mostly focus on the desktop internet context. Second, the results show that females have higher willingness to disclose than males do in the context of mobile internet, which is different from the findings of prior studies that females have higher privacy concerns and lower disclosing willingness in the context of desktop internet. Thirdly, this research introduces city tiers as a new approach to the study of IDW, which is one of the first studies exploring the geographical effect on information privacy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","City tiers; Gender difference; Information disclosing willingness; Mobile internet; Perceived risk; Perceived trust; Privacy",""

This study identifies changes in the market environment variable (i.e. pandemics) and their impact on clothing consumption behavior. Moreover, it examines consumer behavior characteristics and provides implications for future fashion marketing and merchandising strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed post-pandemic consumption trends by obtaining luxury brand sales data from the Korea National Statistical Office and department stores. Moreover, it investigated luxury consumption fluctuation after the pandemic and statistically analyzed the characteristics of luxury consumers by customer level (CL) that affected sales. Findings: The results of the study showed that offline (online) clothing consumption at mass markets has decreased (increased) since the pandemic, whereas sales of luxury fashion brands at offline department stores have grown. Moreover, the in-depth analysis showed a significant sales decline (increase) for clothing-centered (leather-centered) luxury brands. Practical implications: If such a trend in luxury brand consumption continues, current polarization is expected to be maintained. Therefore, the study’s findings can be used as basic data in strengthening luxury brands and planning products. Originality/value: This is the first work to undertake a comparative study of fashion consumer behavior, before and after the pandemic, involving the mass and luxury markets in South Korea. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumption behavior; COVID-19; Luxury fashion market; Mass fashion market; Pandemic",""

Consumer responses to promotion individualization and notification exclusivity","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128653457&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2021-0505&partnerID=40&md5=8bb87eb585b699bad8d87ab2cf145403","Purpose: Although there are at least two important characteristics of targeted promotions—promotion individualization (i.e. whether the offer is personalized for the recipient) and notification exclusivity (i.e. how small the number of recipients is)—most previous studies on targeted promotion have conceptualized them synonymously. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of targeted promotion on consumer purchases by conceptualizing these separately and incorporating them in a single model. Also, this study explores how the effects of these differ depending on customer loyalty. We particularly examine the promotional responses of extremely loyal customers, distinguishing them from other loyal customers. Design/methodology/approach: Using actual customer purchase data, we develop a two-stage model of the consumer decision-making process involving decisions of whether and how much to purchase. The two characteristics of targeted promotions—promotion individualization and notification exclusivity—first influence the probability of purchase and then the purchase amount given purchase. Findings: The results show that customers respond positively to individualization and exclusivity. The effect of individualization is reduced as customer loyalty increases from loyal customers to extremely loyal customers while that of exclusivity remains the same. Originality/value: By clearly identifying the two characteristics of targeted promotions and developing an empirical model that captures the effects of these separately, this paper provides new academic and managerial insights that were not clearly identified in the current literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Extremely loyal customer; Notification exclusivity; Promotion individualization; Targeted promotion; Two-stage consumer decision model",""

(“PRL”) in their attempts to stop various competitors and businesses from using the word “polo” and/or a device of a polo player. Hitherto, there has not been any concerted study of these lawsuits that seeks to analyse the legal principles underpinning the case judgements and translate them into actionable marketing insights using both legal and marketing perspectives. Applying both of such perspectives through the domains of trademark law, consumer attitudes towards counterfeiting and marketing perspectives, such as targeting, promotion and pricing strategies, this article will distill practical and managerial implications for marketers in the luxury brand industry. Design/methodology/approach: An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, using both legal and marketing frameworks to analyse the decisions, reasoning and implications from the PRL trademark lawsuits. Findings: There are key practical considerations for marketers and luxury brand managers to consider, both at the conception and during the life cycle of the luxury brand, in order to optimise the level of legal protection under the trademark regime. These include the use of invented words and imaginary content in trademarks, exercising a balancing of various considerations in the use of “composite marks”, and the selection of market pricing, promotion and distribution strategies, which are elaborated in the article. Research limitations/implications: Given the commonality of the subject matter involved in the trademark lawsuits involving PRL (i.e. the use of the word “polo” and/or the device of a polo player), this study has chosen to focus only on these lawsuits in the context of the Singapore market, and based on Singapore's legal framework, to glean thematic and practical insights. Further studies based on other types of businesses, geographical markets and legal frameworks could be explored to form a better basis for the applicability and comparability of the findings. Originality/value: While there have been case studies and analyses performed on some of the individual PRL trademark lawsuits around the world, this will be the first study to look at the series of Singapore PRL lawsuits in a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand strategy; Luxury brands; Marketing strategy; Trademark",""

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 208,806 social media user-generated content (UGC) pieces were collected from Twitter in three countries – the USA, UK and Australia. The analysis of this big qualitative data was performed using machine learning–based software – Leximancer. Findings: Positive and negative sentiment towards panic buying during the COVID-19 crisis was observed in the UGC. No significant differences in social media UGC sentiment between the three countries were found; however, differences did exist in key themes. This suggests that the focus, not the sentiment, of consumers’ responses to panic buying differed across countries. Social media users follow their location-based and topic-consonant social “herd”, rather than the global “herd”. Research limitations/implications: This study was the first to show that social media users’ herd mentality differs in a crisis. The herd mentality of social networks is dependent on factors such as the geographic location of the social network (herd), which can differ from the global herd’s reaction, specifically in terms of topics evident in UGC. Practical implications: Operations and supply chain managers need to include social media UGC analysis in their strategies in crisis management responses. The topics, not the sentiment, of consumers’ responses to panic buying require managerial actions. Originality/value: This is the first study to show that herd mentality during a crisis, such as COVID-19, is not unidimensional and varies according to the location of the social media network with profound implications for operations and supply chain managers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data analysis; Crisis; Crisis response; Herd mentality; Leximancer; User-generated content",""
"The optimal subsidy scheme and technology innovation strategy considering consumers' green premium","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117183795&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2021-0351&partnerID=40&md5=045a7f3fc359a8be3b1aab367f8d76d1","Purpose: This paper investigates how a regulator pursuing social welfare maximization designs an optimal subsidy scheme to stimulate technology innovation in the presence of a consumer green premium. Specifically, the authors solve the following questions: (1) Does the consumers' green premium affect the design of the subsidy scheme? (2) How should the firm choose a green technology innovation strategy under the optimal subsidy scheme? (3) Does technology innovation bring higher social welfare and lower environmental impact? Design/methodology/approach: The authors first develop a game model to explore the impact of subsidy schemes on social welfare without considering technology innovation. Then the authors investigate two innovation strategies, in-house innovation and external introduction, under the optimal subsidy scheme. Finally, they illustrate the optimal choices of innovation strategy for the firm, consumers and regulators. Findings: The results reveal that the subsidy scheme will not always increase social welfare, which depends on the environmental improvement coefficient of the unit green level. The optimal subsidy level increases with the green premium, but it is not related to the size of the consumer green segment. Moreover, the success rate of in-house innovation will raise the optimal green level, but the company benefits from an increased success rate of in-house innovation only when the green segment is large enough. The green segment size and external green level jointly determine the choice of technology innovation strategy. Originality/value: This research is the first to analyze this problem while considering the green demand and subsidy scheme simultaneously as drivers of a firm's technology innovation, thereby providing new managerial implications for decisions by the regulator and firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental impact; Green segment; Social welfare; Subsidy scheme; Technology innovation",""

Design/methodology/approach: A replication research study with extensions was conducted following previous studies' suggestions. Using a Chinese sample, the author further evaluates a Western conceptual framework with hypothetical relationships of variables. Different from the original study using students in a simulated network environment, this study used channel members involved in actual network activities. Data were collected by a questionnaire survey and analyzed. Findings: The results show CM of channel members in China and do not fully support the hypotheses in the Western model. This study identifies the determinants of an effective approach toward resolving conflicts among members from the perspectives of network outcomes, conflict types and management styles. The choice of CM style is imperative to member performance, especially for achieving specific network outcomes or CM goals.

The mediating effect of fashion innovativeness (FI) and the moderating effect of culture were examined. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study were collected through a survey from 217 millennials in Shanghai and 268 millennials in Tokyo. Moderation analysis and mediation analysis using Hayes PROCESS macro were applied to test proposed hypotheses. Findings: Results show that NFU and SPI have a significantly positive effect on millennials' ALB, and fashion innovativeness plays a mediating role in this process. Furthermore, the positive impact of NFU on millennials' ALB for relatively individualistic cities (Shanghai) is stronger than for relatively collectivist cities (Tokyo). The positive impact of susceptibility to informative influence (SII) on millennials' ALB for Tokyo is stronger than for Shanghai. Practical implications: The research results suggest how different cultures can support marketers in effectively carrying out their business strategy. Originality/value: Under the cross-cultural background, the social identity mechanism behind the attitudes of millennials towards luxury brands has been widely recognised. However, little is known about how culture could moderate the social identity mechanism behind millennials' ALB.

This study aims to compare cannabis tourists' perceived constraints between first-time and repeat tourists to gain comprehensive understanding. Design/methodology/approach: This study involved 32 conversational field interviews (5–10 min) with Chinese tourists who had smoked cannabis in coffee shops in Amsterdam to identify perceived constraints to engaging in cannabis tourism. The hierarchical constraint model (HCM) informed qualitative data coding using a deductive approach to compare first-time and repeat tourists. Content analysis was conducted manually. Findings: Results showed that both tourist groups faced intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural perceived constraints to cannabis consumption. Differences in first-time and repeat cannabis tourists' perceived constraints were explained using the neutralization technique framework and psychological tactics, such as the defence of necessity, claims of entitlement, normal practice and claims of relative acceptability. In addition, social exchange theory was employed to explain why repeat cannabis tourists perceived fewer constraints than first-time tourists. Practical implications: Although the current study did not intend to address the importance of cannabis tourism in places where cannabis is commercially available, findings offer empirical guidance for industry practitioners and policymakers regarding cannabis use education, prevention and policy in tourism contexts; related efforts can promote the sustainable development of this tourism market while protecting cannabis tourists' physical and psychological well-being.

Findings: The results showed that innovation resistance negatively affected innovation adoption, and consumers are more likely to adopt innovations simply under the influence of customer loyalty. In addition, the moderating effect of customer loyalty is different in that how the three dimensions of innovation resistance influence innovation adoption. From the perspective of affective response, when consumers become emotionally disgusted with innovative products, loyalty can hardly change their minds.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of consumer cultural identity and consumer knowledge on purchase intentions of ICHP, as well as the role of the perceived scarcity for such effects. Design/methodology/approach: Three between-participants experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of cultural identity on purchase intention of ICHP and the underlying mechanism of the effect. Findings: The results show that cultural identity has a positive influence on ICHP purchase intention, and this effect is stronger for consumers with higher level of consumer knowledge. Furthermore, perceived scarcity underlies such effect, but the scarcity account holds only for handmade ICHP, not for machine-manufactured products. Practical implications: The current research suggests that ICHP should remain handmade to preserve their scarcity as a distinctive feature. Additionally, business practitioners handling ICHP should target consumers of high cultural identity, and/or provide iconic cues to activate their cultural identity situationally. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of consumer education programs about ICHP-related knowledge in enhancing the cultural identity effect.

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical research framework was developed by synthesising the past literature on masstige marketing and brand extension. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire from 396 respondents availing M-Wallet. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the brand revitalization attributes; further, the binary logistic regression model examined the effect of revitalization attributes on the chance of increasing customer's perception of masstige. Findings: The exploratory study suggested brand image, service quality and value for money pricing as essential attributes to revitalize mass brands into masstige brands; furthermore, path analysis validated the positive effects of these attributes on the perception of masstige. The proposed binary logistic regression model suggested brand image as sensitive attributes, increasing the odds ratio by 9.39 times in favour of perceiving brand as masstige followed by the perceived service quality that is 5.87 times. The prediction capability of the proposed binary logistic regression model is found to be 96%. Practical implications: The methodology of this study provides the basis for future researchers to advance research on masstige. This study will assist the marketers of mass brands to make better marketing decisions related to how masstige image can be sustained or a new or less known brand can be revitalized into a prestigious brand.

"Implicit vs explicit expression on advertising in a cross-cultural study: the mediating role of processing fluency and number of alternatives","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117363554&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0289&partnerID=40&md5=01a1497e8683ad4e51f88a5105e116e0","Purpose: This study aims to examine the moderating effect of culture on the phrase expression type that affects product attitude. Moreover, to identify the mechanism by which these effects occur, the authors investigated the mediating role of processing fluency, and examined how such a mediating effect of processing fluency varies with number of alternatives. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments were conducted to verify the hypotheses presented in this study. Experiment 1 tested the effects of phrase expression type and culture on product attitude; a two-factor design (phrase expression type: explicit expression vs implicit expression) was applied, and culture was classified according to nationality. Experiment 2 tested the mediating effect of processing fluency on product attitude, using the same approach as Experiment 1. Experiment 3 tested the moderated mediating role of the number of alternatives, a between-group experimental design of 2 (phrase expression: explicit expression vs implicit expression) × 2 (number of alternatives: many vs few) was applied. Findings: Experiment 1's results demonstrate that product attitude is more favorable when implicit expressions are used for Asians, whereas it is more favorable with explicit expressions for Westerners. Experiment 2 verifies that the interaction effect between phrase expression type and culture on product attitude is mediated by processing fluency. Experiment 3's results demonstrate that the number of alternatives moderates the mediating role of processing fluency for Westerners, but has no effect on the processing fluency for Asians. Originality/value: This study provides novel insights and expands the field of study of phrase expression types by separating the ambiguous boundaries among phrase presentation types. Furthermore, this study provides practical guidelines for establishing effective advertising strategies for companies by suggesting suitable phrase expression types based on culture. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Number of alternatives; Phrase expression type; Processing fluency; Product attitude",""

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire survey and analyzed with hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: The results indicate that moral obligations, green self-identity, environmental concern and social pressure are positively related to green purchase intention, while perceived cost of green purchasing and price sensitivity are negatively. Meanwhile, social pressure positively moderates the relationship between price sensitivity and consumers' green purchasing intention, but negatively moderates the relationship between perceived cost of green purchasing and consumers' green purchasing intention. Originality/value: First, this study is a comprehensive model of the concept and empirical validation of the integration of negative (ego-centric) and positive (altruistic and ego-centric) drivers of green buying. Specially, this study emphasizes the neglected importance of positive ego-centric factors of green consumer behavior. Second, this study explicitly incorporated the moderating effect of social pressure in the context of China. Since green buying is a social dilemma, the changes in this social dilemma after being affected by social pressure under the Chinese collectivist culture are also worth noting. Third, little is known about what motivates green consumption in emerging economies, and this has been hampered by a lack of cultural knowledge, conceptual richness and behavioral research that critically analyses consumer behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental concern; Green products; Green self-identity; Moral obligation; Perceived cost of green purchasing; Price sensitivity",""

The study demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organizations to explore online tourist-generated content and to understand tourists' perceptions of the destination image (DI). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,291,057 reviews (535,317 for Macau and 755,740 for Zhuhai) were collected, analyzed and examined to determine how the DI s of Macau and Zhuhai changed during the period of 2015–2019 based on tourist-generated content on travel websites (TripAdvisor, Ctrip.com and Qyer.com) through a text-mining approach. Findings: The result revealed that Macau and Zhuhai were in a hybrid of competition and collaboration on tourism DI s. First, Macau and Zhuhai competed in hotel and catering industry. Macau was appealing to international tourists and provided high-end and prestigious offerings; while Zhuhai was impressed by cost-effective accommodation and food. Second, Macau diversified industrial structure with diverse “Tourism, Leisure and Recreation” and “Culture, History and Art” more than Zhuhai did. Meanwhile, Macau should balance the different demands of international and Chinese tourists. Third, complementary potentials were found in natural resources, urbanization technology and tourism innovation and related projects. Practical implications: The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and industrial managers on their endeavors to develop DIs. Policymakers should be able to develop supportive mechanisms and tourism facilitators to promote industrial collaboration and mutual DIs. Managers could refer to the components in the changing DIs and identify the developmental gaps and cooperation potentials in their targeted areas. Originality/value: The research fulfills the gap in regional tourism studies on Macau, in which the evaluation on synergetic influence and neighbor effect from Zhuhai has been underexplored. Facilitated by up-to-date data mining techniques, the study contributes to both DI and coopetition literature in tourism marketing; and this should inspire further studies on the antecedences of DI changes, resolutions to the competing interests and DIs of different stakeholders in different forms of strategic cooperation in regional tourism. The employment of DIs is an explicit demonstration of tourists' immersion and values attached to the destination, providing effective cues on the status of coopetition. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Destination image; Macau – Zhuhai metropolis; Online reviews; Regional integration; Text mining; Tourist-generated content (TGC)",""

However, the interface that presents the mobile marketing contents triggers much user attention, especially the layout. Without significant usability defects, the layout poses influences on the user's aesthetic experience. Identifying the layout attributes that affect user aesthetic preference is critical to the design of mobile marketing interfaces since they influence users' interaction intention, cognitive process, and decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, 6 layout attributes that quantify the aesthetic design of the interface layout and 3 eye-movement indicators that connect to human aesthetic preference were identified through literature research. An eye-tracking experiment measuring the 3 eye-movement indicators on 6 pairs of interface layout materials corresponding to the 6 layout attributes was conducted. The experiment was designed to mimic the free browsing context in mobile marketing. The materials were divided into Liked/Disliked preference groups according to the response of the subjects. Analysis of indicators on materials between the L/D groups shows that the attributes of balance, centricity, density, simplicity, and symmetry affect user aesthetic preferences. Findings: Analysis of the attribute value levels shows that balance, centricity, and density are responsible for addressing users' aesthetic preferences for a disliked interface layout. The study suggests an attribute set for quantitatively optimizing the aesthetic design of mobile marketing system interfaces and provides evidence for the visual attention and cognitive process under the free browsing context. Originality/value: The study contributes to the field both theoretically and practically: (1) it provides support for optimizing the interface layout of mobile marketing systems quantitatively from the aesthetic perspective. (2) It promotes the cognitive attention theory by providing evidence for the cognitive process of interacting with mobile marketing interfaces from the perspective of visual attention and cognitive fluency. (3) It expands the objects of visual perception from traditional or symbolic artworks (such as logos) to the abstract visual stimuli of interface layout.

Addressing the lacuna in the current literature, which predominantly focuses on the cost and benefits analysis of sales promotion, the study revealed that cross-channel price promotion results in consumers' sophisticated emotional responses. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anticipated regret; Discontent; Omnichannel retailing; Omnichannel usage; Patronage intention; Price promotion; Surprise",""
"Motivation for users' knowledge-sharing behavior in virtual brand communities: a psychological ownership perspective","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120307275&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2021-0436&partnerID=40&md5=2136c476b8c95726214b6d8bf7874e45","Purpose: Users' knowledge sharing provides valuable resources for brand community participants and is, therefore, critical for the viability of virtual brand communities. Drawing from both self-determination theory (SDT) and psychological ownership theory, the paper aims to investigate the impact of fulfillment of three basic psychological needs on brand users' knowledge-sharing behavior and examines psychological ownership as a mediator. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data consisting of 316 valid responses were collected from users of Huawei Pollen Club Community. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the reliability and validity of measures, and hierarchical linear regression and bootstrapping were used to test all hypotheses. Findings: Fulfillment of the need for autonomy, relatedness and competence in a virtual brand community boosts users' psychological ownership and has a positive influence on their knowledge-sharing behavior. Furthermore, psychological ownership partially mediates the relationships between the fulfillment of psychological needs and knowledge-sharing behavior. In addition, the authors found that when users participate in more offline brand activities, the positive impact of the fulfillment of the need for relatedness on psychological ownership is strengthened, while the positive impact of the fulfillment of the need for autonomy on psychological ownership is weakened. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the existing literature by exploring the relationships between fulfilling users' three basic psychological needs and their knowledge-sharing behavior through the mediating role of psychological ownership. The authors also provide insight into how offline brand activities interact with the fulfillment of psychological needs in virtual brand communities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand community; Knowledge-sharing behavior; Offline brand activity; Psychological needs; Psychological ownership; Self-determination theory",""
"The influence of e-customer satisfaction, e-trust and perceived value on consumer's repurchase intention in B2C e-commerce segment","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120478626&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2021-0221&partnerID=40&md5=02336acf5f1fc30d07a7ae10ee455197","Purpose: This research study investigates the factors that influence e-customer satisfaction, e-trust, perceived value and consumers repurchase intention in the context of the B2C e-commerce segment. It investigates the mediation effect of e-customer satisfaction, e-trust and perceived value on repurchase intention. It also examines the moderating role of prior online experience. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the adapted questionnaire, pre-recruited enumerators collected the data from five leading business universities of Karachi. They distributed 425 questionnaires and received 415 questionnaires. The study has used Partial Least Square-Structure Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique for data analysis. Findings: We have tested 20 hypotheses, of which our results do not support five, including two direct, two mediating. Our results support all the direct hypotheses except the following two: (1) delivery service affects e-satisfaction (2) customer services quality effect on trust. We did not find support for the following two mediating hypotheses (1) e-satisfaction mediates delivery services and repurchase intention, (2) service quality mediates customers' service quality and repurchase intention. Our results do not support one moderating relationship. Prior online experience moderates e-perceived value and repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications: This research provides valuable information to the online retailers of B2C e-commerce, which can help them make strategies based on their consumers' behavior and encourage them to make repeat purchases from online retailing stores. It allows future researchers to replicate the model in cross-cultural studies in different product categories. Originality/value: We have examined the moderating effect of prior online experience between (e-satisfaction, e-trust and perceived value) on the repurchase intention. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business to consumer; e-Customer satisfaction; e-Trust; Perceived value; PLS-SEM; Repurchase intention",""
"Willingness to pay for traditional ready-to-eat food packaging: examining the interplay between shape, font and slogan","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117247802&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0233&partnerID=40&md5=0bcb774e6346083a1f073f59c0ac2f5f","Purpose: This paper investigates how to design traditional ready-to-eat food packaging by manipulating its shape, font and slogan to promote consumer buying intention and willingness to pay (WTP). Design/methodology/approach: Two package designs, interplaying the square shapes (vertical vs horizontal), font formality (formal vs less formal/casual) and slogans (ethno-positioning vs short and catchy), were created and tested in an online experiment with 483 participants. Findings: The results revealed that the differed package designs elicited relatively equal levels of attractiveness to consumers and their buying intentions. However, the designs significantly differentiated consumers' WTP. The results further show the significant direct and indirect effects on WTP of packaging attractiveness when it is moderated by package designs and mediated by buying intention. However, the varied package designs did not have significant direct or indirect impacts on WTP when mediated by packaging attractiveness and buying intention. Practical implications: The vertical square-shaped packaging, written in a less formal font and highlighting a short and catchy slogan, is more financially promising for marketers to get a better price for local food products perceived as hedonic and bought impulsively on casual occasions. Furthermore, besides prominent package design elements such as font, color, size, material and picture, packaging designers or marketing practitioners should consider other supporting factors, such as shelf efficiency. Originality/value: This study complements existing studies of “cue utilization theory” and “packaging design theory” by demonstrating the importance of extrinsic packaging cues, such as shape, font style and slogan, in improving consumers' WTP for traditional food products. The study also fills some gaps in the literature by exploring the direct, mediating and moderating relationships between package design, packaging attractiveness, buying intention and WTP, especially in an emerging market such as Indonesia. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buying intention; Font style; Packaging attractiveness; Shape; Slogan; Willingness to pay",""

However, the concept of robo-advisers is new, and few studies have addressed issues related to them. To help readers to better understand robo-advisor adoption by a wide range of potential customers, this study explores integrated models of the attitudes (ATT) and behavioural intentions (BI) of users towards robo-advisors. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was used to gather data to determine how the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) applies to robo-advisors. A total of 242 valid questionnaires were collected. Findings: The results of our study show that performance expectations (PE), effort expectancy (EE), and social influences (SI) may have indirect influences on robo-advisor behavioural intention (BI) through attitudes. Furthermore, behavioural intention was also positively influenced by facilitating conditions (FC). Moreover, the investment to income ratio (IIR) moderated the relationship between the PE, EE, and SI influence on ATT. Additionally, experience is found to positively strengthen the relationship between EE and SI on ATT, and it moderated the relationship between FC and BI.

"Sales promotion: the role of equity sensitivity","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119283889&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0249&partnerID=40&md5=b938d564e62e14418a5be2538b320ed7","Purpose: This paper explores how consumer psychographics impact responses to sales promotions (SPs), and specifically whether equity sensitivity (ES) moderates attitudes towards sales promotion in the retail purchase experience (PE). Design/methodology/approach: The study examines data from a survey of 284 Hong Kong consumers, using a shopping mall-intercept method. Every third person walking past the researchers was asked to participate in the survey. After obtaining their permission, those agreeing to take part in the study were surveyed either inside or outside of the shopping complex. The face-to-face intercept surveying method also increases confidence in sample and response reliability. Findings: The study finds that ES has a significant positive relationship with evaluations of the retail PE. Consumers identified as “Benevolents” were significantly more positive towards SPs and reported significantly higher satisfaction with the PE. In contrast, consumers identified as “Entitled” were less positive towards SP and less satisfied with the PE. In addition, noncash SPs significantly positively influenced Benevolents' PE. Research limitations/implications: The current study extends and expands equity theory and ES research by applying these concepts to consumer SPs. The study is limited to an examination of common consumer purchases, across different product categories and SP types. While this allows us to examine the relationship between SP attitudes, ES and purchase satisfaction, future comparisons between individual sales promotion techniques (SPTs) and specific consumer profiles are recommended. Practical implications: From a retail perspective, it is important to understand individual differences and what influences and motivates the consumers' retail PE. Retail managers are advised to track customer purchases and satisfaction levels linked to SPs as this would allow for the identification of which customers are more likely to fit the Entitled or Benevolent psychological profiles and predict their likely responses to SP offers. Originality/value: To date, there has been little research on individual psychological differences between consumers when offered SPs at retail stores. The current study contributes to the marketing literature by extending the price fairness equity model to the retail PE, thereby addressing a prominent gap in the literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer perceptions; Equity sensitivity; Purchase experience; Retail; Sales promotion",""

Also, it examines the effect of ecological conscious consumers' behavior (ECCB) on green intention and behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study has focused on the upper-middle-class segment of Karachi. The authors have used area sampling for collecting the data. Six recruited enumerators distributed 450 questionnaires in five areas of Karachi and received 423 filled-in questionnaires. The study has used the Smart PLS version for data analysis. Findings: The study found that biospheric egoistic and hedonic values affect attitudes toward green products, and altruistic values have no effect on attitude. Also, the authors did not find any association between attitude and green purchase intention, but found that attitude stimulates ECCB. Subjective norms and perceived behavior control strongly affect green purchase intention and ECCB. The results also suggest that pro-environment self-identity and ECCB are significant predictors of green purchase intention.

It also assesses the variations in these effects according to brand luxury. The purpose of the paper is to provide strategic suggestions for building luxury apparel distribution tactics that balance maintaining brand luxury with business growth through both physical stores and digital stores (e-retail). Design/methodology/approach: Based on 418 samples collected in Japan, consumers' perceptions of hedonic shopping value and SWB are examined according to two channel factors, such as physical retail vs e-retail and mono-brand stores vs multi-brand stores. Additionally, the moderation effects of brand luxury are discussed. Findings: Multi-group path analyses reveal that physical mono-brand stores contribute to hedonic shopping value. In addition, this experiential value is found to increase SWB, especially when the brand luxury level is high. Practical implications: These findings suggest that managers should place a high level of importance on consumers' shopping experiences via physical direct retail especially in the case of a higher luxury level, even in today's highly developed digital environment. Originality/value: The current study uniquely discusses the effects of shopping channels and experiences on SWB based on an acquired branded product, i.e., an evaluation of the outcome of shopping behavior and product acquisition. The study also reinforces the importance of physical stores suggested in previous luxury research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer experience; e-retail; Hedonic shopping value; Luxury; Mono-brand store; Subjective well-being",""

Motivating factors, including entertainment, information seeking, reward and social interaction, are regarded as antecedents of consumers' OLT, as manifested by CIEB dimensions, including consumption, contribution and creation, and subsequently drive consumer engagement with the endorsed brands. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Malaysian social media users. A total of 263 responses were collected and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the impact of motivational factors on CIEBs. Findings: The results show that the three dimensions of CIEBs can be predicted by different gratifications (information seeking, entertainment, reward and interaction). In addition, two of the CIEB dimensions, consumption and contribution, were found to have a significant positive influence on consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. Practical implications: This study provides insights into how social media influencers (SMIs) could lead to CIEBs by creating entertaining and rewarding content that facilitates social interaction between consumers. SMIs and marketers that encourage consumers to browse, comment and share SMI-created posts will enhance consumer engagement with the endorsed brands, as engagement is driven by the consumption and contribution to SMI-created content. Originality/value: SMI marketing is increasing, and many brands are beginning to rely more on SMIs to promote brands. Yet, there is a dearth of studies that have examined how SMIs play a role in affecting consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. This study contributes to the marketing literature by developing and empirically testing the research model. Results suggest that social interaction, reward and entertainment are key motivational factors that drive CIEBs, which, in turn, foster consumer engagement with endorsed brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COBRAs; Consumer online brand-related activities; Consumer-brand engagement; Influencer engagement; Social media influencer",""

Mouse hover is a vital interaction method for users to access shopping sites and significantly impacts their decision-making experience. A well-designed mouse hover function can effectively enhance the user's search performance and improve the user experience. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the dynamic prompt designs at the hover position and the degree of feedback transparency may affect the user's task performance and personal feelings when operating the hover function on the shopping website. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed two independent variables in the experiments: dynamic prompt and background transparency of hover feedback. A between-subject design of 2 (single flicker and continuous flicker) × 3 (transparency at 0%, 25%, and 50%) was adopted in the experiment. A total of 60 participants were invited to participate in the experiment using the purposive sampling method. Participants were asked to complete four operation tasks, and the time of each was recorded. They were then asked to complete the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire and conduct subjective evaluations before they were briefly interviewed. Findings: The generated results revealed that: (1) In the interaction with a shopping website, the degree of background transparency of hover feedback affected the participants' task performance. (2) The effect of a single flicker had significantly higher subjective evaluation results regarding the degree of rationality compared with a continuous flicker. (3) The participants' perceptions of the information clarity were affected when the background transparency of hover feedback was 50%. (4) The effect of a continuous flicker was better than that of a single flicker when the background transparency of hover feedback was 25%. The participants' attraction to a continuous flicker was significantly higher than that of a single flicker. Nonetheless, when the degree of background transparency was at 0% or 50%, the results were the opposite.

The authors further tested the chain mediating role of cocreation efficacy and cocreation outcome expectation and the moderating role of perceived CSR image. Design/methodology/approach: Using a survey, we collected a dataset of 683 consumers through stratified random sampling in main shopping malls in four Chinese cities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the conceptual framework and hypotheses, and bootstrapping was used to estimate the mediated standardized regression coefficients. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test the moderating effect. Findings: GTMC, firm-created content (FCC), and user-generated content (UGC) all had positive effects on ICGV. Cocreation efficacy and cocreation outcome expectation had a chain mediation effect in GTMC and ICGV, UGC, and ICGV. Perceived CSR image positively moderated the effects of both GTMC and FCC on ICGV.

"Encroachment in a three-echelon supply chain: manufacturer encroachment or distributor encroachment","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122191341&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0225&partnerID=40&md5=973b5018d94cb4af7898121be186781e","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate manufacturer encroachment and distributor encroachment in a three-echelon supply chain consisting of an upside manufacturer, an intermediate distributor and a downside retailer. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors use the optimization theory to mathematize the proposed question and build a model. First, the authors consider sequential quantity decisions, where the encroacher decides on the direct selling quantity after determining the retailer's order quantity. Second, the authors relax this sequential decision process assumption by reconsidering a circumstance in which quantity decisions are decided simultaneously. Findings: In contrast to previous studies, this study shows that in three-echelon supply chains, the upside firm is more likely to encroach compared with the downside firm. The “bright side” of encroachment exists for all players only when the encroachment cost is at a moderate level. However, in manufacturer encroachment under simultaneous quantity decisions, the “bright side” skips the distributor but benefits the retailer directly as the encroachment cost increases from zero to a certain level. The main reason lies in that the distributor loses its pricing power because the end-market has been disturbed by the simultaneous quantity decisions. A comparison of the results of sequential and simultaneous quantity decisions reveals the merit of simultaneous quantity decisions. The authors find that the intermediate role (the distributor in our model) in three-echelon supply chains may benefit more from simultaneous quantity decisions. That is, the distributor may achieve a better profit even in a market with intensified competition. Originality/value: The findings of this paper contribute to the marketing science literature on encroachment. The majority of existing literature has focused on manufacturer encroachment in two-echelon supply chains. This paper innovatively investigates and compares manufacturer encroachment and distributor encroachment in a three-echelon supply chain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Direct selling; E-Commerce; Encroachment; Online retailing; Supply chain",""

Design/methodology/approach: College students (n = 789) were surveyed about five advertising choices for luxury skin-care products consisting of scarcity messages of high-demand, low-stock, limited-time, countdown timer and regular advertising without any scarcity message. Outcomes were product classification attitudes of functional and symbolic and psychological attitudes of persuasion knowledge and advertising skepticism. Findings: The study found that high-demand message had greater functional attitudes and greater symbolic attitudes than regular advertising. Limited-time message had greater symbolic attitudes than regular advertising. High-demand message had lower advertising skepticism attitudes than regular advertising. Practical implications: The authors recommend that when a luxury skin-care product is in high demand, that marketers should use high-demand messages in their advertising. Marketers of luxury skin-care products may also benefit from using limited-time message advertisements.

The study proposed a framework utilizing stimulus–organism–response (S-O-R) theory to suggest that fashion involvement and opinion-seeking would act as sociopsychological stimuli, while product variety as an objective stimulus. Perceived quality is proposed as an organism, moderated by perceived price. Consumer buying behavior within e-commerce environments presents the framework's response. The study looked at variables with deeper insights into Malaysian fashion consumers. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative method was used to assess the significance of relationships within the proposed model. Partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was implemented to assess the framework's relationships with a sample size of 374. Findings: Results indicate that fashion involvement is significantly associated as a sociopsychological stimulus, with product variety being an objective stimulus for Malaysian fashion e-consumers. Perceived quality is significantly represented as an organism through the framework, and buying behavior is the latent response. Price would significantly moderate the relationship between fashion involvement and quality. Opinion-seeking was found not to be a significant stimulus for Malaysian e-consumers.

The paper aims to explore the impact of two marketing strategies on the remanufacturing decisions of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and investigates the design of the optimal warranty service (WS) and consumer education (CE) strategies. Moreover, the authors also examine the optimal marketing strategy choices using the three criteria of OEM: profitability, consumer surplus and environmental impact (EI). Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a stylized model by game theory, which characterizes how an OEM that produces and sells both new and remanufactured products (RPs) should design the optimal remanufacturing marketing activity, and how to choose between different remanufacturing marketing strategies. Moreover, consumer's utility theory is used to describe consumers' perception of different remanufacturing marketing strategies to derive product demand. Findings: The results reveal that increasing the warranty and education levels will not always improve the firm's profitability; the result depends heavily on the size of the functionality-oriented consumer (FOC) segment. Remanufacturing marketing strategies might harm the OEM, consumers and environment under certain conditions. Moreover, the optimal marketing strategy selections are jointly influenced by the FOC segment and the new production cost. There exist triple-win regions in which the OEM should not hesitate to perform WS and CE. Originality/value: Few studies focus on the design and choice of remanufacturing marketing strategies, especially considering the role of consumer perceived behavior. This research contributes the behavioral remanufacturing marketing management and provides managerial implications for the implementation of OEM remanufacturing marketing strategy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer education; Functionality-oriented consumer; Perceived risk; Remanufacturing; Warranty service",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore what innovative characteristics of entity shared products can accommodate consumers' concerns and are likely to motivate adoption of consumers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a conceptual model that combined the innovation diffusion theory and technology acceptance model to explore shared products adoption. It identified the direct and indirect effects of perceived app ease of use/online, perceived convenience of access/offline, perceived utility advantages and personal innovativeness on shared products adoption intention. Structural equation modeling was used for analyzing the questionnaire data from a sample of 479 users who used entity shared products such as shared cars, shared bicycles and shared power banks for mobile phones. Findings: The empirical tests indicate that perceived utility advantages based on market innovation, perceived accessibility of usage rights based on technology innovation (including perceived app ease of use/online and perceived convenience of access/offline) and consumer personal innovativeness are the key factors affecting consumer adoption. Originality/value: This paper constructs an innovation-adoption coupling model of entity shared products to understand shared products usage.

Few studies have examined the underlying motivations behind sex-driven travel, and little is known about factors inhibiting tourists' procurement of commercial sex when traveling. Therefore, this study explored male Chinese tourists' perceived constraints during decision-making and developed a comprehensive scale to assess constraints to commercial sex consumption overseas. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from male Chinese tourists purchasing commercial sex while traveling overseas. This study involved a four-stage process as recommended by Churchill (1979) for scale development research. In Stage 1, preliminary items were generated through a comprehensive review of the constraints literature and in-depth interviews with 16 sex tourists, which generated an initial 26 items. During the second stage to purify the measurement items, six items were eliminated, resulting in 20 items. Stage 3 involved exploratory factor analysis (N = 275) to extract the scale's underlying factor structure. Results revealed a five-factor structure with sufficient evidence of internal reliability given Cronbach's alpha coefficients between 0.722 and 0.843. The final stage included confirmatory factor analysis (N = 259) to verify the scale's reliability and validity. Findings: Ultimately, 20 items were developed to measure sex tourists' perceived constraints toward engaging in commercial sex services overseas based on five factors: structural constraints, intrapersonal constraints, interpersonal constraints, value conflicts and service supply–related constraints. Originality/value: This study advances the scope of sex tourism research by verifying how these five constraints are independent, generalized and can influence the procurement of sexual services overseas. This study is the first in sex tourism research to explore the difficulties facing sex tourists. Results offer marketers important insight on how to better address these constraints while providing a safe and legal sex tourism experience. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commercial sex; Male Chinese tourists; Measurement scale development; Outbound tourism; Perceived constraints",""
"Warmth or competence?

Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilizes experimental design and survey methods to collect data and the ANOVA, independent sample t-test and bootstrap analysis methods to verify the assumed hypotheses. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that cuteness (vs cool) is more likely to promote the perception of brand warmth (vs competence), and the brand perception plays a mediating role between cuteness (cool) and the perceived quality. Study 3 replicates the findings of Study 2 and indicates that people with high-cuteness (vs low-cuteness) perception are the same to perceive the brand warmth to promote the perceived quality of digital products, but people with high-cool (vs low-cool) perception are more likely to perceive the brand competence to promote the perceived quality of digital products. Practical implications: Based on the conclusions in this paper, marketers could emphasize the cool information of digital products in advertisements to promote the perceived quality to promote younger consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Furthermore, firms could shape warm brand images by the perception of cuteness because cuteness is positively associated with the warmth of brand perception (e.g. the logo of Three Squirrels, a Chinese nut business brand that consists of three cute squirrels). Originality/value: From a theoretical standpoint, this paper contributes to the brand perception when consumers accept product information with the characteristics of cuteness or cool. Second, a model of perceived quality of digital products is built based on the stereotype content theory. Third, this paper considers individual perception levels on cuteness and cool as the boundaries to conduct further conceptual model. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand competence; Brand warmth; Cool and cuteness; Perceived quality; Stereotype content theory",""

By drawing on two theories – Sirgy’s theory of the self and Sundar’s theory of interactive media effects (TIME) – the study tests a PLS model with two new constructs: Photo Satisfaction and Consumer Inspiration, and their impact on Adoption Intention. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed methods study examines the effects from personalization and customization affordances in the latest generation of apparel VTOs. The proposed model was tested in a quasi-experimental within-subjects design, as 61 female participants completed a goal-directed and an exploratory apparel shopping task using two VTO apps available on the market. Findings: Inspiration induced from the customization affordance in the exploratory task influenced Adoption Intention as strongly as Fit Confidence did. For both conditions, users’ satisfaction with their avatar picture had a stronger effect on Perceived Augmentation than the individual trait of Body Esteem. The study also demonstrates how TIME’s Sense of Agency component could help theorize positive consumer responses to mobile marketing technology, which in our study were induced via the app’s Mix and Match feature. Also demonstrated was that Perceived Augmentation could be influenced by body-image affective judgments made during the pre-task VTO avatar creation phase. Practical implications: VTO’s customization feature “Mix and Match” appears vital for the adoption of such apps for exploratory m-shopping of apparel. Also important is the satisfaction with one's photograph during the avatar-creation phase. We further suggest that apparel retailers work with Augmented Reality developers to include dynamic avatar capability as well as social sharing affordances in VTOs. Social implications: 60 billion USD worth of returns occur annually in the online apparel retail industry, mostly related to fitting problems, not to mention the larger carbon footprint from the increased transportation. A more wide-spread adoption of VTOs can not only help with these problems but also lighten the traffic in brick and mortar fitting rooms, a potential hazard at this time of pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine Consumer Inspiration in the context of online apparel retailing and to demonstrate the importance of Photo Satisfaction during the avatar-creation phase in influencing the subsequent user experience in apparel VTOs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Avatar; Body image; Consumer inspiration; E-commerce; Personalization; Virtual try-on",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the Cournot equilibrium and Stackelberg two-stage master-slave game model to describe the evolutionary process of knowledge pricing in an open innovation environment of first-mover and late-mover companies. Findings: Research shows that in an open innovation environment, the formation of a dual innovation strategy in the pricing process of corporate intellectual property transactions is a complex process. Changes in one-time transaction costs and changes in the inverse demand coefficient of the innovation market play the decisive role in the choice of dual innovation strategies. When the demand of the innovation market is moderate, the inverse demand coefficient of the innovation market and the one-time transaction cost has an inverted U-shaped influence relationship. As the innovation market's inverse demand coefficient and the one-time transaction cost increase at the same time, the degree of differentiation of the enterprise's dual innovation strategy choice gradually reduces; when the one-time transaction cost is the largest, the degree of strategy differentiation is minimized.

Findings: The results show that perceived quality has a negative indirect influence on brand risk and brand trust has a strong direct negative effect on brand risk. However, the findings also show that in the luxury market, the greater the affection for the brand, the greater the risk perceived by consumers. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in a single market, luxury watches and the sample includes both enthusiasts and consumers of the luxury brands. Practical implications: Managers should be aware of the double-edged role of brand affect on brand risk. The quality of a brand and the trust in its promise decrease the risk to the consumer. Originality/value: This pioneering study is one of the first to approach an underexplored topic as is the case of the risk associated with a brand in the context of the luxury goods market. Moreover, it relies on an international sample composed of consumers from several countries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Involvement; Luxury; Marketing strategy; Risk perception; Risk-taking theory; Social value",""
"Deciphering the impact of responsiveness on customer satisfaction, cross-buying behaviour, revisit intention and referral behaviour","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120055201&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2021-0465&partnerID=40&md5=61e30fe6edfa6b48a654d9557ba30cf9","Purpose: The ease and convenience of online shopping are shifting the customers to e-tailers. This has prompted offline retailers to re-examine behavioural patterns along with a reconfiguration for a responsive retail model. The paper investigates the influence of responsiveness on customer satisfaction, cross-buying behaviour, revisit intention and referral behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via a survey answered by 793 fashion customers from India, and for data analysis, partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed. Path analysis was used to determine the interrelationships amongst the constructs used in the study. Findings: The standardized path coefficients depict competitive responsiveness as the highest contributor of retailers' responsiveness followed by service responsiveness, employee responsiveness and customer responsiveness. The findings suggest that customer satisfaction acts as the biggest contributor to referral behaviour followed by cross-buying behaviour and revisit intentions. Originality/value: This study has made a substantial contribution to fashion apparel retailing. The findings revealed that responsive retailing influences the customers' post-purchase behaviour as they engage in more cross-buying, revisiting and referral behaviour. The retailers are encouraged to carefully monitor their preparedness to deliver a combination of sensory, emotional, cognitive and social experience to their customers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intentions; Fashion; Partial least square; Quantitative analysis; Responsive retailing; Responsiveness; Satisfaction",""
"Objective vs subjective design newness","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116932215&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2020-0897&partnerID=40&md5=6edacba25aed9f5b6b2cd474c711e63b","Purpose: The paper aims to examine whether (1) deviation of design (i.e. objective design newness) is distinct to consumers' perception of design newness (i.e. subjective design newness) and (2) subjective design newness rather than objective design newness evokes the emotion of interest and enhances product evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: In total five sets of quasi-experiments were conducted on the natural manipulations of design newness. Specifically, the first four studies examine consumers' perception of design newness, feeling-of-interest and product evaluation toward old and new Apple's iOS (i.e., iPhone OS) icons when a new Apple's iOS is released. The fifth study generalized the findings to the new design of XiaoMi MiPhone. Findings: Across five quasi-experimental studies, the authors found that (1) consumers do not necessarily perceive an objectively new design to be subjectively new; (2) subjective design newness, but not objective design newness, evokes interest and (3) interest, in turn, enhances product evaluation and behavioral intention toward an innovation. Research limitations/implications: The current finding extended the current literature on design newness by demonstrating that subjective (vs objective) design newness provides a more holistic account of consumers' interest and positive product evaluation toward the innovations. Practical implications: The research showed that simply updating or altering the design of a product does not evoke consumers' perception of design newness and positive product evaluation. Instead, designer and managers must explore ways to evoke consumers' perception of novelty, complexity, unfamiliarity, atypicality and difference. Furthermore, the current finding demonstrated that subjective design newness can be used to evoke consumer interest and, therefore, result in positive purchase evaluation. Originality/value: The current research is the first to examine (1) the difference between objective and subjective design newness, (2) the emotional response toward design newness and (3) the emotion of interest as a mediator that explain the strong relationship between design newness and positive product evaluation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design newness; Interest; Novelty",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose an integrative causal model derived from employees OCBs perceived by the collectivistic 50-and-older outpatients in Korean medical-care organizations and test the causal relationships using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The three dimensions of OCBs are external stimuli to the synergistic relationship of both cognitive and affective organisms for enhancing the organization's external outcomes. The customers' organismic processes mediate the relationships between OCBs and the resultant outcomes. Customer satisfaction plays a pivotal role in determining customers' future behavior when converting the business relationship to friendship. Practical implications: The proposed integrated model provides an overall mechanism of the collectivistic customer decision process in the medical-care service setting. The integrated model helps to understand better how customers proceed mental and emotional states with the encountered services and how frontline employees offer extra-roles beyond in-roles to their customers in touching points to maintain superior organizational performance. Originality/value: The authors respond to the underexplored agenda in the OCB research discipline.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider a Stackelberg game with a platform, seller, inductor and inductee, where the inductee's altruism plays a vital role in determining the optimal RRP in equilibrium. Findings: The authors show that the conditions under which it is optimal to reward the inductor only or reward both inductor and inductee are equal or unequal depending on the degree of the inductee's altruism. Suppose the platform is unable to dynamically decide the commission fee. In that case, the platform may not always be involved in RRPs and will gradually reduce the rewards for inductees as the altruism increases. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on a free-to-consumers model where sellers pay membership fees. Thus, this study has limitations regarding other pricing schemes such as a model in which consumers pay a fee while sellers do not or a model in which both types of users pay fees. Practical implications: This analytical work can help platforms optimize referral reward strategies and referral reward allocation considering the influence of an inductee's altruism. Originality/value: In a Cashback and Referral RRP on a shopping guide platform, the authors provide applicable conditions for the platform to involve in the RRPs when rewarding an equal bonus for the inductor and inductee first.

The research study aims to improve the prior conducted literature by concentrating on the precursors of innovation in marketing and its impact on building a sustainable competitive market. The paper intends to address this by examining the following variables using a mixed-method approach. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher employed the mixed methods particularly the sequential explanatory design to explain and interpret the quantitative data collected from 89 business owners/managers using Jamovi Software while the qualitative data were collected through an in-depth interview conducted with 10 SME owner-managers of new and established businesses in Angeles City, Pampanga using Taxonomic Coding Scheme. The sequential explanatory design was used to explain and interpret quantitative results by collecting and analyzing follow-up qualitative data. Findings: This study investigates the relationship between marketing capabilities and marketing innovation towards sustainable competitive advantage of micro-small and medium enterprises in the Philippines through mixed method approach. For quantitative result, the study found that marketing competency significantly influenced marketing innovation. The result shows that all SMEs have enough people in place who are capable of implementing marketing innovation activities and use new technology like the use of information technology. The paper also found that marketing innovation, significantly predicted sustainable competitive advantage. MSMEs exhibit this innovation such as product, price, place, and promotion can create a distinctive position in the market towards sustainable competitive advantage. The paper also tested the mediation effect of marketing innovation that influences the relationship between marketing competence and sustainable competitive advantage. Most of the hypotheses posited were supported. For qualitative data, it was revealed that these SMEs through their key informants and key leaders are open to innovations thus, willing to learn by establishing networks with customers and other managers/business owners to expand and improve their business. The food business in Pampanga is highly competitive, and most of the SMEs are engaged with it. In order to survive the saturated market, continuous improvement is important in the identified areas for growth and innovation. Mixed method analysis supported quantitative and qualitative findings. Hence, it indicated that marketing competency significantly influences sustainable competitive advantage, which can be achieved through marketing innovation. In this study, the researcher analyzed the influence between marketing competence and marketing innovation to achieve a sustainable and competitive market. Research limitations/implications: There were certain limitations of this research study. First, the lack of panel data limits the investigation of causality that is instrumental in substantiating the findings. Second, the proposed conceptual framework offers a deeper understanding of innovation performance, examining how integrating activities of the R&D department, human resource department, and marketing department affect innovation commercialization will likely provide more meaningful insights. Moreover, finally, future studies may go beyond the scope of our study to examine (1) food and meat processing, (2) agriculture, hunting, and forestry, (3) hotels and restaurants, (4) mining and quarrying, (5) wholesale and retail trade, (6) transport, storage communication. Practical implications: To remain relevant in this extraordinary time, this paper suggests a support instrument to offer vital data on different categories of innovation to the foodservice sector SMEs in Angeles City to embrace and implement new innovative methods in their practices. The key practical implication of this research, therefore, is the requirement for small and medium business owner-managers to improve their technical capability to realize the full benefits, particularly in terms of more responsive and user-centered, data-driven marketing personnel. Social implications: These findings may influence positive social change by contributing to more effective and efficient marketing practices in small and medium firms that can lead to better financial performance, higher survival rates, and a healthier economic system. This study demonstrates that SME owner-managers require new skillsets to overcome the barriers to adopting technology for marketing. This primary capability is a prerequisite to the competitive advantage of the business, yielding to brand equity, business growth, and marketing dominance.

However, current research in the area is still developing in terms of offering practical insight in conjunction with a decision model that may help to determine optimal strategies for efficient service design in the sharing economy from a service triad perspective. Exploring this gap in the literature, this paper aims to develop and apply a decision model that enables managers to identify and prioritise the efficiency attributes of sharing economy-based services. It also aids in designing optimal strategies to enhance efficiency over time based on the insights obtained from users (buyers and sellers) and platform providers. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative approach comprised an extensive literature review followed by in-depth interviews, and the quantitative approach adopted the quality function deployment (QFD) integrated optimisation technique to design and prioritise the most optimal strategy emanating from the application of a decision model. Findings: The findings revealed that establishing global distribution, continued technological research and development (R&D) and enhancing the transactional platform are the most important strategies in the context of sharing economy platform providers (e.g. accommodation-based-platform service providers). This study also revealed that as the importance weights of the efficiency attributes changed over time, so too did the portfolio of strategies used to attain an optimal efficiency level.

An emerging economy perspective","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125413601&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2021-0486&partnerID=40&md5=69f9b96235c768c3ed35a6aae46e898c","Purpose: The quest to acquire new customers and retain the existing ones is a challenge for all aviation companies. This paper attempts to assist the aviation companies in tackling this challenge by revealing the most important factors that their customers consider to be the most important while making purchasing choices. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on three separate studies, this paper identifies the most important factors that influence consumers' choice of airlines in an emerging economy context. The first study adopts a qualitative approach with 20 respondents (Max QDA is used for analyzing these data), followed by the second study based on a quantitative survey with 105 participants, and finally, the third study which employs a multi-criteria decision-making technique named fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) on a sample of 12 expert customers. Findings: The findings of this paper reveal that customer care quality and on-time arrival are the two most important factors that aviation customers consider while making their purchase decisions. In contrast, baggage allowance and fastest route to destination are the two least considered by aviation customers while making their purchasing choices. Research limitations/implications: This study includes only a geographic-specific segment of passengers. Future studies of consumer preferences in the aviation industry may include consumers belonging to other geographic regions. Furthermore, future studies may segment their sample populations based on factors other than age, the purpose of travel and booking medium. Practical implications: This investigation attempts to give a rich and holistic understanding of the different factors that influence the aviation choices of consumers of varying segments. This study has significant practical implications as modern-day airlines aim to optimally cater to the needs of their target segments without incurring additional costs on services that consumers do not deem to be as important. Originality/value: This study highlights the importance attributed to each identified factor by passengers, something that previous research has mostly ignored. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aviation industry; Fuzzy AHP; Modeling; Purchase decision-making; Qualitative research; Quantitative research",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the theoretical framework based on survey data of 328 Chinese LSPs. Archival datasets complement the survey data. Findings: The research reveals that intra-national institutional forces of formal and informal environment-related institutions can mitigate LSPs' reliance on their firm-specific advantages when engaging in TI and green practices. Results from a three-way interaction indicate that intra-national innovation ecosystems positively moderate the effects of environmental institutions. Research limitations/implications: The research has three critical implications. First, the study reveals the contingency role of intra-national environment-related institutions and innovation ecosystems in shaping green logistics. Second, the study finds new results about the roles of informal environmental institutions. Finally, intra-national innovation ecosystems can override environmental institutions in influencing the green practices of LSPs. Originality/value: Taking a unique angle of institution embeddedness coupled with the resource-based view, the authors examined how intra-national ecosystems and environmental institutions impact LSPs' TI and green practices. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Green practices; Institutions; Intra-national innovation ecosystem; Logistics service providers; Technological innovation",""
"Effect of channel integration quality on consumer responses within omni-channel retailing","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124347240&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0270&partnerID=40&md5=b242b9db939ed0e1dc49c77b868863ff","Purpose: The aim of this research is to explore the influence of channel integration quality on consumer perception and response from the individual customer perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 517 online questionnaires from residents in Taipei (Taiwan) and Shenzhen (China) in 2020 based on quota sampling. The empirical study employed structural equation modeling. Findings: Based on the empirical results, the primary path indicated that channel-service configuration positively affected experience quality, which mainly positively affected customer engagement. The secondary path showed that channel-service configuration positively affected experience quality, which positively affected customer empowerment. Furthermore, experience quality and relationship proneness are mediating variables concerning the impact of channel integration quality on customer responses. Research limitations/implications: This study had time and budget limitations; thus, 517 questionnaires were collected from Taipei and Shenzhen. If the budget allows, it would be better to collect 1,000 questionnaires in total (500 from Taipei and 500 from Shenzhen). Practical implications: Retailers should realize the core of omni-channel retailing, which is no longer concentrated on the “quantity” of channels but on consumers. When omni-channel retailers integrate online and offline channels, the retailers should try to understand what consumers want and then provide similar and diverse products and services in different channels so that consumers have more choices. Originality/value: The novelty of this research is the investigation of the mediation effect of channel integration quality and consumer responses on retailers and consumers, and enriching current research on omni-channel retailing from the bottom-up perspective, as well as a comprehensive study on the two types of channel integration quality and two types of consumer responses. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Channel-service configuration; Consumer engagement; Consumer empowerment; Experience quality; Integrated interactions; Omni-channel retailing",""

It also investigates the moderating role of ethical leadership through sales managers' aggressiveness on service recovery performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the model using multilevel analysis with cross-sectional data of 367 salespeople from different sales organizations. Findings: The study shows that the aggression of sales managers has an adverse influence on service recovery performance. Additionally, aggressiveness among sales managers is positively connected with surface acting while adversely affecting deep acting. The study’s findings also indicate that ethical sales leadership is positively moderate among sales managers' aggressiveness and service recovery performance. Research limitations/implications: The authors collected data from individual salespersons, which is the limitation; however, future studies could collect data using the dyadic approach, such as matching responses from both managers and salespersons. This method could enhance the model's internal validity. Originality/value: Several studies have mainly focused on positive supervision styles in the literature on service recovery. At the same time, building a negative supervision model in the B2B service recovery context, which has been persistently ignored, is noteworthy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aggressive sales management; Deep acting; Ethical leadership; Multilevel analysis; Service recovery performance; Surface acting",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study explored word-of-mouth reputation from four characteristics of information source of influencers: credibility, professionalism, interactivity and attractiveness. The grounded theory was used to extract the characteristic indicators of influencers and used questionnaire surveys to obtain 218 valid samples. The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used for the configuration analysis. Findings: The results revealed the following: (1) a causal asymmetric correlation exists between the driving mechanism of high word-of-mouth reputation and non-high word-of-mouth reputation; (2) influencers matching high word-of-mouth reputation comprises potential, developmental and almighty types, whereas live streaming influencer matching non-high word-of-mouth reputation comprises elementary and groping types; and (3) all factors must be combined to play a role, and neutral permutations of two solutions were found among the three overall solutions to attain high word-of-mouth reputation; (4) the combination of high user activity and high exposure is the core configuration that results in high word-of-mouth reputation. Practical implications: This study provides recommendation for consumers, live streamers, brand and e-commerce platform on how to promote the sustainable and healthy development of influencer marketing.

"Perceptions and desires of Chinese senior outbound tourists receiving travel support from adult children: a qualitative study","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129417845&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2021-0894&partnerID=40&md5=ed21560a44f7e267b2c88a87aefb3b01","Purpose: This qualitative study explores how Chinese senior outbound tourists perceive support from their adult children and what kinds of support they desire. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured interviews with 26 participants. Transcribed interviews were analysed via thematic analysis. Findings: This study captured the contradictory feelings of different types of Chinese senior outbound tourists (i.e. independent, neutral, and dependent) according to the degree of desire for support from their adult children. The results further identified the real desires among Chinese senior outbound tourists for children's attitudinal support, caring support, appropriate financial support, companionship, and timing support. Research limitations/implications: Since this qualitative research is based on small samples with typical social and cultural characteristics, our research results only describe an existence. Our findings provide insight into the existence of the phenomenon, rather than allowing the results to be generalized to the wider population (Gram et al., 2019). Practical implications: The tourism industry could develop products to alleviate such feelings. Integrating the concept of filial piety into adult children's support for their parents' overseas travel can not only meet parents' expectations but also relieve parents' ambivalence. Destination operators and travel agencies could thus design mixed products targeting Chinese elderly parents and their adult children by providing activities for both generations. Purchasing behaviour represents a type of emotional and instrumental support for the elderly. Destination operators and travel agencies can also launch products suitable for in-depth outbound travel that cater to adult children's leisure travel while meeting the elderly's travel needs. Originality/value: This study also extends both intergenerational support theory and intergenerational ambivalence theory regarding Chinese senior outbound tourists. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chinese senior; Desired support; Intergenerational ambivalence theory; Intergenerational support; Outbound travel",""

These online platforms were integrated to enhance customer's shopping experience, promoting different business models including consumer-to-consumer (C2C) secondary e-commerce market. This new online business model has been gaining interest in both academia and industry due to potential opportunities and challenges to serve customers effectively. This study aims to draw upon the means-end theory to test a conceptual model to understand the role of engagement between different types of trust and satisfaction toward shopping on C2C e-commerce. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey method was developed to test the antecedents and mediator of C2C customer satisfaction. A panel service was used to collect the dataset (n = 294) to test the proposed extended means-end chain theory (MEC) model. Findings: The authors found that the role of trust toward the platform provider and the third-party seller differs based on the perceived value (functional and emotional) and impact of trust on satisfaction. This study provides a rich conceptualization of an instrument for a C2C experience that can serve as a starting point for future research to investigate the antecedents and impacts of the C2C context. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed hypotheses further in a different context (e.g. country).

Customer and competitor orientation were examined as two distinct constructs as per the literature, as it has been questioned for its robustness. They have been used synonymously, even though customer orientation is operationalised as a component of a market orientation construct. There is support for the argument from a theoretical point of view to keep customer orientation and competitor orientation separate. The objective of this research was to empirically test market orientation concepts on firm performance and assessing customer and competitor orientation separately. Furthermore, it also tests whether innovation plays a mediating role. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 309 small and medium-sized firms was found eligible for this study. Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyze the data. A multi-industry sample of firms was used to strengthen the generalisability of the results. The sample was acquired from two databases of SMEs directory in Kudus and Pati, East Java Indonesia, participants were randomly selected. Findings: The findings show that innovation mediates the relationship between competitor orientation and firm performance, while competitor orientation had no significant relationship with firm performance. Customer orientation was found to positively influence firm performance. Originality/value: The role of innovation as a mediator within SMEs in a developing country opens up avenues for further research among other developing countries. By examining both the concepts of customer and competitor orientation separately and establishing relationships, we validate support for this argument both from a methodological and theoretical point of view. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competitor orientation; customer orientation; Firm performance; Innovation; Market orientation",""

This study aims to understand the factors that affect smallholder farmers' participation in a newly emerging modern supply chain context. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 6 focus groups of farmers (67 farmers in total) and 14 interviews with market actors and key informants such as government officials and donor organisations. Findings: Influential factors of farmers' participation in the modern chain include buyer attributes and transaction conditions. High prices and prompt payment are the key motivators, with the main inhibitors being personal relationships with buyers and strict market requirements related to quality and quantity supplied. Practical implications: In order to encourage smallholder farmer participation in modern chains, an expansion of the marketing of high-quality vegetables by implementing quality control mechanisms and the encouragement to adopt safe marketing practices is needed. These results are particularly relevant for practitioners and policymakers. Originality/value: Most research to date concentrates on farmers' socioeconomic characteristics and are based in countries with advanced modern chains, and rarely focus on farmer participation in countries where modern chains are relatively new.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors focus on the relationship between acquisition and retention, that is, retained customers (repeated purchases) are based on and come from the acquired (new) customers in the former period. The authors also design a two-period separate incentive on both dimensions. Findings: The authors found that a targeted incentive strategy should be applied for achieving more revenue when the incentive intensities are relatively small. Otherwise, the brand needs to adjust the targeted incentive strategy into incentivizing the opposite dimension, particularly on acquisition. Under the optimal contract, the brand needs to be very careful with deciding the fixed part of the incentive salary and the incentive intensities on both dimensions. For example, the fixed salary initially decreases and then increases in the incentive intensities. For the optimal incentive policies, the brand should incentivize acquisition but outsource retention if the agent is risk-neutral. When the agent is becoming risk-averse, the brand should lower its incentive intensity as the risk degree and variances become larger. Interestingly, the brand may benefit from introducing risks. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by considering the following points. First, the authors extend the principal-agent incentive model by considering two-period decisions of customer acquisition and retention. Second, based on the two-period principal-agent problem, the authors design separate incentive intensities on acquisition and retention, respectively. While, most of the literature focused on acquisition incentives. Third, different from other works focusing on either risk-neutral or risk-averse environments, the authors consider both and compare the cases of risk-neutral and risk-averse to analyze the impact of risk on the optimal decisions and the brand's expected profit. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer acquisition; Customer retention; Decentralized service chains; Incentive design",""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employed a mixed method involving a cross-disciplinary literature review along with reflections from experts in TCM and health communication to inform tourism management. Specifically, this paper examines TCM and its potential benefits as a medical tourism drawcard to combat COVID-19. The selected literature focusses on the image and merits of TCM to frame how this medical philosophy can be used to position China as a tourist destination. Reflections on the use of TCM as a tourism marketing tool can guide promotional strategies from the Chinese government and destination managers during and after COVID-19. Findings: The Chinese government, the tourism industry (e.g. destination managers), the media and tourists must focus on three aspects of the role of TCM: to provide medical benefits to travellers amid COVID-19 and beyond, elevate China as a destination for global medical tourists and be leveraged as a tool for economic recovery.

The present study aims to investigate various self-concepts and their mechanisms for inconspicuous and conspicuous luxury consumption. Design/methodology/approach: An experiment with 215 participants from online survey website was conducted, and the hypotheses were tested using PROCESS Macro 3.4. Findings: The study findings are as follows. Materialistic consumers' preference between inconspicuous and conspicuous luxury products is dependent on distinctive self-conceptual mechanism. More specifically, materialistic consumers with independent self-construal prefer inconspicuous luxury brands because of high need for uniqueness, whereas non-materialistic consumers with interdependent self-construal prefer conspicuous luxury products because of high self-monitoring. Research limitations/implications: The present study uniquely shows conditions (moderated mediation) that the link between need for uniqueness (self-monitoring) and luxury consumption is stronger for those with independent (interdependent) self-construal than for those with interdependent (independent) self-construal. The present results extend and help better understanding of mechanisms and conditions of conspicuous and inconspicuous luxury consumption. Practical implications: Marketers are advised to design and produce unique vs popular luxury brands depending on consumer's motives and different self-concepts. Originality/value: This research contributes to extant literature by distinguishing between conspicuous and inconspicuous luxury consumption with two different mechanisms (need for uniqueness and self-monitoring). The present study further demonstrates that the two mechanisms are strongly sustained differently depending on consumer's levels of self-construal. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Inconspicuous luxury; Materialism; Moderated mediation; Need for uniqueness; Self-construal; Self-monitor",""

"“Income vs. education” revisited – the roles of “family face” and gender in Chinese consumers' luxury consumption","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090314687&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2019-0733&partnerID=40&md5=23e7ec9cdbb48fc9ce1d3bd185580123","Purpose: The transgenerational influence of inherited family capital on consumers' luxury consumption has been studied recently in the mature luxury market. However, little research explores this topic in the emerging luxury market. In China's Confucian culture, “family face” as part of “family inheritance” has been conceptualized as a factor driving luxury consumption. However, this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. The current research, therefore, seeks to examine the impact of economic and cultural capital on Chinese consumers' luxury consumption within the family inheritance context and the roles that face concern and gender play to reveal the particularities of a specific emerging luxury market. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 324 Chinese consumers was recruited in Shanghai. With the full sample, the author first assessed the effects of economic and educational capital (both personal and family sources) and face concern on luxury consumption using regression analyses. Next, the author conducted the regression analyses again by gender. Findings: Unlike trends in the mature luxury market, Chinese consumers' educational levels do not drive their luxury consumption, and the transgenerational influence of economic and cultural capital functions as a negative factor. Influenced by the patrilineal tradition, higher levels of luxury consumption to compensate for parents' lower income and educational levels and to enhance family face are found only in the male consumer group, but not in the female group. Originality/value: This research contributes to expanding the current understanding of emerging luxury markets and how the Confucian tradition influences Chinese consumers' luxury consumption through gender role norms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Concern for face; Educational level; Gender; Income level; Luxury consumption",""

Design/methodology/approach: Through the systematic literature review, 13 design elements were obtained and then verified through interviews of 30 professional designers. The obtained elements were made into a questionnaire to collect data across China from 1,016 consumers of different groups. Data were analyzed using cluster analysis, principal component analysis and difference analysis. Findings: The results show that design elements that influence consumer experience in shopping malls are a four-dimensional construct: visual atmosphere, physical environment comfort, space structure and business planning, among which space structure and business planning play a larger role in the consumer experience. In addition, the perception differences of consumers for those elements are significant due to the individual differences. Originality/value: This paper comprehensively investigates the architectural design elements affecting consumer experience in the Chinese mall context. Moreover, it provides unique insights about the relationship between architectural design and consumer experience by exploring the categories, weights and perception differences of those elements. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Architectural design; Consumer experience; Design elements; Shopping environment; Shopping mall",""
"The effect of self-efficacy on job performance through creativity: the moderating roles of customer incivility and service scripts","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090455395&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0138&partnerID=40&md5=c0608f4267fdea7170bf74010e339715","Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effect of self-efficacy on job performance through creativity. We predicted that exposure to customer incivility and rigid service scripts will moderate the mediating effect of creativity on the relationship between self-efficacy and job performance. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 397 salespersons who were working in a department store in South Korea. The PROCESS macro was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that the positive relationship between self-efficacy and job performance was partially mediated by creativity. Furthermore, exposure to customer incivility and rigid service scripts weakened the positive effects of self-efficacy on creativity. Finally, customer incivility and rigid service scripts also dampened the positive effects of self-efficacy on job performance through creativity. Research limitations/implications: Sales organizations should understand that the extent to which self-efficacy improves job performance by enhancing creativity is contingent on the extent to which salespersons are exposed to customer incivility and are required to adhere to rigid service scripts in the workplace. Originality/value: Our findings paint a more complete portrait of the beneficial effects of self-efficacy. Specifically, they suggest that the development of creativity is an important mechanism that underlies the process by which internal resources enhance job performance and that customer incivility and service scripts weaken this relationship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Creativity; Customer incivility; Job performance; Salesperson; Self-efficacy; Service scripts",""

However, in daily life, individuals notice inconsistencies between religious beliefs and behavior, leading them to ask, in the context of commerce, why religious consumers would behave unethically. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of consumers' intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity on their ethical behavior. Specifically, the moderating effect of ethical ideology on the relationship between Indonesian consumers' religiosity and their ethics was examined by means of a survey. Design/methodology/approach: The data derived from the questionnaire were complemented by convenience samples of Indonesians living in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY) in central Java. The researchers distributed 600 questionnaires in two major shopping malls and several housing areas in the region, of which 467 were completed and returned, for an overall response rate of 77.8%. Findings: The results indicated that the participants' intrinsic religiosity negatively impacted their ethical beliefs and was mediated by their idealistic ethical ideology. The present study also found that idealism had negative effects on three of the four dimensions of the consumer ethics scale (CES) (actively benefiting, passively benefiting and questionable behavior), while relativism had positive effects on two of the dimensions (passively benefiting and questionable behavior. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of the present study was that the analysis did not distinguish among the religions practiced by the respondents to the questionnaire. Originality/value: This is one of the first few studies investigating the mediating role of ethical ideology in a religious society.

The proliferation of mobile shopping practices follows unsteady growth patterns in different countries. Despite challenges of price, quality and privacy matters, young consumers still lead the race to engage in mobile shopping activity in developing countries. This research investigates the determinants that either support or hinder the mobile shopping intentions of aspirant young consumers in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The present research applies a consumer-centric approach to the technology adoption framework to unearth the behavioral patterns of these young consumers in Pakistan. Employing the structural equation modeling technique, this research examines the significant effect of structural assurance, perceived risk, trust and various unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model constructs on behavioral intention to engage in mobile shopping. Findings: This research examines the significant effect of structural assurance, perceived risk, trust and various UTAUT model constructs on behavioral intention to engage in mobile shopping. Results also demonstrate a significant moderating effect of structural assurance and prior shopping experience on the relationship between perceived risk, trust and mobile shopping intentions. Further, the mobile shopping patterns for the male and female segment indicate a significant difference for perceived risk, trust structural assurance and social influence. The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge which advocates the application of consumer-centric customized model approach to explore various factors that either facilitate or impede the adoption of mobile shopping in a developing economy.

"Consumption attitudes and behaviors in Asia: a “discovery-oriented” fresh look","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108355690&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2020-0878&partnerID=40&md5=0d705e07f0e337bb94b577ab119b62e2","Purpose: This paper aims to identify distinct consumption patterns among Asian consumers and examine how these relate to cultural antecedents and key human values. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a large, representative sample of almost 7,000 Asian consumers in 10 culturally varying markets, using latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify the consumption profiles. Findings: The findings empirically demonstrate that the two profiles are “inner-directed nationalistic frugals” (IDNF) and “outer-directed self-eekers” (ODSS). IDNF consumers spend more time and money on education and prefer ethnocentric consumption. ODSS consumers emphasize individuality, self-expression, seeking novelty and impressing others. Consumers with more collective values in Schwartz's typology tend to demonstrate the IDNF pattern; those with more individualistic values demonstrate the ODSS pattern. The distribution of IDNF and ODSS profiles is influenced by demographics, religion and geographical region: IDNF is greater than ODSS in Southeast Asia; ODSS is greater than IDNF in East Asia; IDNF is roughly equal to ODSS in Northeast Asia. IDNF tends to be found among older and more religious consumers, while ODSS is the opposite. Importantly, in the more religious Southeast Asian countries, even younger consumers are more IDNF than ODSS. Research limitations/implications: This research uses an exploratory and discovery-oriented approach; future research can use more confirmatory approaches to systematically examine the relationship between cultural dimensions (e.g. individualism-collectivism) and consumption patterns. Practical implications: For their brands to grow in Asian markets, marketing practitioners are advised to use multiple brands to segment Asian consumers based on their values, demographics, geographical location and what religious/faith traditions they follow.

Design/methodology/approach: For empirical analysis, 45 days of sales and eWOM data for 63 movies released in Korea in 2017 were collected, and a panel regression analysis was conducted on a total of 2,835 data items. In addition, the analysis was rigorously verified through three robustness tests. Findings: The breadth and depth of consumer groups targeted by movies have a non-linear relationship with sales, and this relationship is mediated by the eWOM performance of social media websites. In addition, eWOM performance has a non-linear relationship with sales, and these effects differ depending on the type of eWOM platform involved. Originality/value: The effects of the breadth and depth of the consumer groups targeted by movies on eWOM performance and movie performance have not been sufficiently investigated. This paper expands on previous studies that reported a linear relationship between eWOM and sales by finding that the effects of consumer group breadth and depth on sales are not linear in terms of the mediation of eWOM performance. In addition, a new research direction is suggested by conceptualizing consumer group breadth and depth using eWOM data, on which basis the new concept of eWOM-to-viewing ratio (eWOM ratio) is proposed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Breadth; Depth; eWOM; Movie; Non-linear; Social media",""

"Religious compensatory consumption in the Islamic context: the mediating roles of religious social control and religious guilt","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111902532&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2021-0104&partnerID=40&md5=63fc338b35e9c1a97b607c945e35e7df","Purpose: In general, Muslims consider Islamic consumption to be a religious obligation. Previous research, however, suggests that various socio-psychological factors may influence Islamic consumption. Failure to comprehend the true motivations for purchasing Islamic products may lead to marketing myopia. This research investigates the less explored motivational factors of religious compensatory consumption, namely religious hypocrisy, religious social control and religious guilt. Design/methodology/approach: This research relied on an online questionnaire. Purposive sampling yielded a total of 238 Muslim respondents. The authors employed PLS-SEM analysis with the ADANCO software to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal the following: (1) Higher religious hypocrisy leads to higher religious social control. (2) Higher religious hypocrisy leads to higher religious guilt. (3) Higher religious social control leads to higher religious guilt. (4) Higher religious hypocrisy leads to higher religious compensatory consumption. (5) Higher religious social control leads to higher religious compensatory consumption. (6) Religious social control partially mediates the relationship between religious hypocrisy and religious compensatory consumption. (7) Higher religious guilt leads to higher religious compensatory consumption. (8) Religious guilt partially mediates the relationship between religious hypocrisy and religious compensatory consumption. Research limitations/implications: First, religious compensatory consumption in this research is limited to Muslim consumers. Future research may investigate compensatory consumption in different contexts, such as Judaism and Christianity, which have some common religious tenets. Second, compensatory consumption is a complex concept. The authors’ religious compensatory consumption scale only incorporated a few aspects of compensatory consumption. Future studies may retest the authors’ measurement scale for reliability. Lastly, the samples were dominated by the younger generation of Muslims (e.g. generation Z). Future studies may investigate older Muslim generations. Practical implications: First, this research illustrates how religiosity, guilt and social control may contribute to Islamic compensatory consumption. Islamic business practitioners and retailers targeting Muslim consumers can benefit from this research by knowing that Islamic consumption may be driven by socio-psychological factors, such as religious hypocrisy and guilt. As a result, businesses targeting Muslim consumers can develop marketing strategies that incorporate these religious elements while also addressing their socio-psychological issues in order to promote Islamic products. Second, Islamic business practitioners and retailers may consider the social environments in which Muslims are raised. The authors’ findings show that religious social control has direct and indirect effects on Muslims' preferences for Islamic products as a form of compensatory strategy. Islamic business practitioners may design marketing programs that revolve around Muslim families and their Islamic values. It is in line with the previous studies that suggest the connections between religions, local cultures and buying behaviours (Ng et al., 2020; Batra et al., 2021). In some ways, Islamic products can be promoted to improve the well-being and cohesion of family members and Muslim society in general. In this research, the authors argue that businesses' failures to understand the socio-psychological motives of Islamic consumption may lead to marketing myopia. Social implications: As previously stated, religion (i.e. Islam) may be a source of well-being and a stable relationship among Muslims. Nevertheless, it may also become a source of negative emotions, such as guilt, because of one's inability to fulfil religious values, ideals or standards. According to the authors’ findings, Islamic products can be used to compensate for a perceived lack of religiosity. At the same time, these products may improve Muslims' well-being. The creations of products and services that revolve around Islamic values are expected to improve Muslims' economic conditions and strengthen their faith and love toward Islam in the globalized world. Moreover, Muslims, both as majority and minority groups, face increasing social pressures. On one hand there is the (in-group) pressure to uphold Islamic values and on the other hand there is the (out-group) pressure to preserve the local values and cultures. Indeed, living in the globalized world may require certain compromises. This research calls for various institutions and policymakers to work out solutions that enable all religious groups to work and live in harmony. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to study religious compensatory consumption quantitatively. This research operationalized variables previously discussed using a qualitative approach, namely religious hypocrisy, social control, guilt and compensatory consumption. The authors designed and adapted their measurement scales to fit this context, paving the way for future research in this field. Second, this research provides new empirical evidence by examining the relationships among less explored variables. For instance, this research has proven that several aspects of religiosity (e.g. hypocrisy, social control and guilt) may influence compensatory consumption in the Islamic context. This research also reveals the mediation roles of religious social control and religious guilt that were less explored in the previous studies. To the best of their knowledge, previous studies had not addressed social control as a predictor of compensatory consumption. Therefore, the theoretical model presented in this research and the empirical findings extend the theory of compensatory consumption. Third, Muslims are underrepresented in the compensatory consumption research; therefore, this research fills the population gap. Finally, this research focuses on Islamic compensatory behaviour as the future direction of Islamic marketing. Previous Islamic marketing research had not addressed the sensitive motives of Islamic consumption, which have now been highlighted in this research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Islamic marketing; Religious compensatory consumption; Religious guilt; Religious hypocrisy; Religious social control",""

Property development products such as residential homes, which are generally high-priced, require a long-term financial commitment from the consumers. It makes the property development sector unique. Hence, a specific scale is required to measure greenwash activities in this specific context by the marketers. However, the scale available to measure the greenwash construct is general which is not suitable to use in this particular context. The present study is an attempt to fill this gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies were conducted to develop the GSPD measure in different phases. In developing the scale, qualitative interviews (study 1) were conducted to generate the initial pool of items. The preliminary set of questions were then validated (content and face validity) by experts' opinions. Exploratory factor analysis (using SPSS) was conducted to extract the factor structure of the newly developed measure (study 2) which was then again validated to ensure predictive reliability and nomological validity by using the SEM-PLS technique (study 3). Findings: The exploratory factor analysis result revealed that greenwash in sustainable property development (GSPD) is a multi-dimensional construct. The dimensions are namely, false claims and misleading claims. The confirmatory composite analysis confirmed these two dimensions. Practical implications: This newly developed GSPD scale will enable the researchers to measure the greenwash activities practiced by some of the housing developers. Marketers will be conscious to avoid such activities. Moreover, the government agencies may use this scale to monitor measure and deter greenwashing activities by property development companies. Originality/value: This is a pioneer study that develops and validates a new scale to measure greenwash construct in sustainable property development in a developing context i.e. Malaysia. In addition, this study operationalized the greenwash construct in sustainable property development as a multi-dimensional behavioural construct determined by two dimensions i.e. false claims and misleading claims. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","False claims; Green housing development; Greenwash; Misleading claims; Sustainable property development",""

First, how does brand alliance type, defined by a partner's location and brand quality, affect consumers' emotional value perceptions of higher education brand alliances for dual-degree programs? Second, does perceived brand fit mediate the relationship between brand alliance type and emotional value perceptions? Third, do individual differences in world-mindedness moderate the influence of brand alliance type on emotional value perceptions? Design/methodology/approach: In total, two experiments are performed. Experiment one examines the effect of brand alliance type, at varying combinations of partner brand quality and partner location (domestic or foreign), on consumers' emotional value perceptions. Experiment two examines the moderating role of world-mindedness in the relationship between brand alliance type and consumers' emotional value perceptions. Findings: Results provide evidence that consumers' perception of brand fit mediates the relationship between brand alliance type and consumers' emotional value perceptions of the alliance. Results also indicate that world-mindedness moderates the relationship between brand alliance type and emotional value perceptions. Originality/value: This research extends the previous literature on higher education dual-degree brand alliances and introduces world-mindedness as an important consumer-based characteristic to consider in this line of research. It answers calls for more research on higher education branding and calls for research into the potential mediating role and importance of brand fit. It provides several theoretical and managerial implications relevant to the higher education brand alliances, particularly in dual-degree programs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand alliance; Brand fit; Higher education branding; World-mindedness",""

In addition, how market outcome affects the two types of media in turn has not been examined, which brings the need for a holistic framework. The rare study that examines this relation mostly relies on the volume of media rather than the valence. This study examines the interdependent relation between the volume and valence of social media, the volume of traditional media and TV ratings. Design/methodology/approach: Forty-one South Korean TV drama shows from October 2014 to March 2016 were analyzed using the 3SLS estimation to examine the interdependent relation between the variables. Findings: First, the volume of traditional media has a negative effect on the volume of social media. Second, ratings negatively affect the valence of social media. Third, the volume of traditional media is found to have a negative effect on ratings. This is explained by the displacement effect.

Findings: The results indicate that (1) each guanxi facet exerts a different and positive impact on SIE, but only one guanxi facet – renqing – helps improve PI, (2) guanxi facets can be used to predict the buyer's perceived guanxi position toward the seller, (3) the effect of guanxi facets on SIE and PI varies across B-S guanxi positions and (4) the SIE positively mediates effects of guanxi facets on the PI. Originality/value: This study demonstrates the individual effect of each guanxi facet on SIE and PI and affirms the implicit guanxi position features guanxi facets and determines the buyer's perceived SIE and PI as well. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are rarely proposed in previous research and are beneficial for understanding the guanxi mechanism in social commerce. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ganqing; Guanxi; Guanxi position; Mianzi; Renqing; Social commerce",""

Design/methodology/approach: The respondents were salespeople and customers in selected door-to-door cosmetics companies in South Korea. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data in this study. Findings: Findings show that adaptive selling behavior positively affects customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, sales performance, job satisfaction and relationship quality. These findings suggest that adaptive selling is crucial for the firm's survival depending on the industry and the product. Additionally, unlike previous studies, the authors use salespeople's self-reporting responses and customer-reporting of salespeople, which further enhances the richness and uniqueness of the results. Originality/value: Studies investigating mutual outcomes of adaptive selling behavior are scarce. The study also emphasizes that adaptive selling behavior enhances salesperson outcomes and customer outcomes and primarily uses dyadic data between door-to-door salespeople and their customers, which is not very common. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive selling behavior; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Relationship quality; Sales performance",""

"Does independent goal interdependence impair dynamic capability? The mediating role of supplier integration and the moderating role of internal integration","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116726466&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2021-0078&partnerID=40&md5=101cc0738ddfa22f0968f80b784408bf","Purpose: Rapidly changing technological and marketing environments challenge the survival of business organizations. Developing dynamic capability is critical in helping companies respond to today's turbulent environments. Thus, fruitful studies on the antecedents of dynamic capability have been conducted. However, in the context of the supply chain, little is known about the factors that can be harmful to dynamic capability. Drawing on the theory of cooperation and competition, the first purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between independent goal interdependence with suppliers and dynamic capability by focusing on the mediating role of supplier integration. Combining the information processing theory and transaction cost economics with the theory of cooperation and competition, the second purpose of this study is to discuss and test the moderating role of internal integration. Design/methodology/approach: Using a carefully designed questionnaire, a large-scale survey was employed to collect data in China. The senior manager (e.g. president, vice president, chief executive officer [CEO], executive or purchasing manager) of each company was asked to participate in our survey. The final valid sample in our survey consisted of 233 companies. Hierarchical multiple regression statistical analysis and bias-corrected bootstrapping methods were applied to test the correlation, mediation, moderation and moderated mediation relationships between variables. Findings: The authors found that independent goal interdependence negatively influences dynamic capability through frustrating supplier integration. In addition, the moderated mediation model analysis shows that internal integration weakens the positive direct effect of supplier integration on dynamic capability while neutralizing the negative indirect effect of independent goal interdependence on dynamic capability. The theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed. Originality/value: First, starting from the goal interdependence and supply chain management perspectives, this research not only is consistent with remote theoretical research that explains why interdependence among organizations influences the capability to enhance competitive advantage but also incorporates relevant internal and external factors that influence dynamic capability. Second, by proposing an innovative boundary factor – internal integration – this study also contributes to adjusting the predictions of the theory of cooperation and competition. Third, focusing specifically on the negative antecedent of dynamic capability can provide a better understanding of the antecedents that cause companies to have weakened dynamic capability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dynamic capability; Independent goal interdependence; Internal integration; Supplier integration",""

In addition, the study also aims to test the moderating role of self-control and compare the proposed relationships across the offline and online shopping contexts. Design/methodology/approach: A survey dataset was collected from a sample of 529 offline and online consumers in Vietnam. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test the proposed relationships among the studied constructs. Findings: The consequence of impulse buying is positive and affect-based. In addition, the positive associations between shopping values and impulse buying via dual process are validated and moderated by self-control. In addition, the association between cognitive impulse buying and shopping well-being is stronger in the online shopping context, whereas hedonic value has more influence on affective impulse buying in the offline shopping context. All other relationships are not statistically different across the two shopping contexts. Originality/value: This study introduces an appropriate theoretical framework for studying impulse buying—the duality approach. Second, the research validates the dual process and positive consequence of impulse buying.

This study considers differences in relational outcomes arising from smartphone use to kill time and reduce boredom during leisure travel with different companions, either family or friends, and uses the Riva's emotion regulation model to examine whether such smartphone use provides immediate relief from ostracism. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least square (PLS) method and PLS multigroup analysis were used to analyze the data collected from 205 Taiwanese tourists (104 respondents vacationing with friends and 101 respondents with family). Findings: This study found no negative effect of smartphone use to kill time and reduce boredom on relationship satisfaction and overall trip satisfaction. Smartphone use is rather limited as a contributor to trip satisfaction, and the effect of smartphone use depends on who the tourists are traveling with. The results reflect the effect of the established position of smartphones in everyday life, extending to tourism. The use of smartphones to kill time and avoid boredom is not a sufficiently “active” activity to serve as an effective immediate response to ostracism. Originality/value: This study contributes to the continuing debate on the impact of new technologies on social relations. Although past studies have examined the relational outcomes of smartphone use, few have investigated this subject in the context of different travel companions. Using Riva's emotion regulation model, this study considers smartphone use as a possible response to ostracism. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Relationship satisfaction; Sense of ostracism; Smartphone use; Tourists; Travel companions; Trip satisfaction",""

To expand the scarcity-expensiveness-desirability model and to enhance insights for practical applications, this study modifies the causal relationship among two types of scarcity, three types of expansiveness and desirability. Design/methodology/approach: This study surveyed 400 Taipei city residents who had purchase experience with luxury brands products in Taiwan. The study employed structural equation modeling as empirical analysis. Findings: The empirical results show that limited-quantity scarcity main influences perceived social status and then affects desirability. The second path is that limited-quantity scarcity influences perceived uniqueness and then affects desirability. Therefore, perceived social status and perceived uniqueness dominate the majority of effects on desirability because they are the recognition of the individual compared to others, especially when applied to luxury goods. Practical implications: Because limited-quantity scarcity has a greater impact on desirability than limited-time scarcity in the empirical results, marketers can adopt limited-quantity scarcity messages that are better than limited-time scarcity, to increase consumers’ desire to purchase luxury goods. Originality/value: The first novelty of this study is dividing scarcity marketing into limited-quantity and limited-time scarcity in the scarcity-expensiveness-desirability model. This study extends expensiveness in the scarcity-expensiveness-desirability model with a complete demonstration, that is, perceived social status, perceived uniqueness and perceived value, which is the second novelty of this study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Desirability; Limited-quantity scarcity; Limited-time scarcity; Perceived social status; Perceived uniqueness; Perceived value",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts two experiments by combining a simulated scenario with a questionnaire; overall, 383 and 678 valid samples were collected, respectively. Findings: (1) The existence of GL is extremely important and will give consumers the perception of higher tea quality resulting in higher purchase intention. The tea’s production method and geographic location are strongly correlated. Thus, whether the tea is produced with traditional methods has a moderating effect on the place of origin, GL, and consumer response in study 1. (3) Different tea pricing has a moderating effect on the place of origin/GL and consumer response in study 2.

Drawing on institutional theory, this paper aims to explore how public policy marketing initiatives through institutional narratives and discourses legitimize solar energy's sustainable consumption in a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: Using a post-structuralist approach, the authors undertook a thematic analysis to study the process of sustainable consumption. The authors conducted face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders in the solar energy sector and complemented the primary data with secondary analysis of archived published materials and podcasts. Findings: First, narratives on conformance rules and regulations (regulatory legitimacy) are significant sustainable consumption predictors of solar energy. However, the top-down regulatory legitimation narrative alone is insufficient to overcome poorly developed taken-for-granted (cognitive legitimacy) and morally correct consumption behavior (normative legitimacy), especially among the general population. Second, while consumption is primarily seen as a micro-level, residential and commercial customers phenomenon, the intersecting macro- (government) and meso-levels' (industry/market) narratives and discourses influence and direct micro-level consumption. Originality/value: Future research agenda on legitimizing the sustainable consumption of solar energy needs to consider the dynamic interactions of institutional narratives and discourses through the lens of institutional theory and practice. Sustained, bold and provident government interventions and actions through market structure and policy issues play a crucial role in the consumption process, particularly in developing economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Developing economy; Institutional theory; Narratives and discourses; Public policy marketing; Renewable energy; Sustainable consumption",""

To address this critical but understudied question, the authors examine the strategic choices of two competing firms between retention- and acquisition-focused strategies in consideration of switching costs, technological advancement level, and market share. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop and analyze a game-theoretic model to investigate the strategic choices of two competing firms between retention- and acquisition-focused strategies. Findings: When switching costs are high, findings show that when the degree of technological advancement is high (low), both firms should employ acquisition-focused (retention-focused) strategies to maximize their profits. When switching costs are low and there are a low degree of technological advancement and asymmetric market shares, the firms choose retention-focused strategies in equilibrium, but only the firm with the higher market share can maximize its profit. When switching costs are low, technological advancement levels are high, and the market shares are asymmetric, the firm with the higher market share chooses a retention-focused CRM strategy, while the rival with lower market share adopts an acquisition-focused strategy in equilibrium. However, neither firm can maximize its profits. Originality/value: Prior research focused on a single firm's price discrimination decision without considering a competitor's strategic choice. To address this research gap, the authors examine where firms should assign their CRM resources (retention vs. acquisition) in response to a competitor's CRM strategy.

Design/methodology/approach: We use a contingency approach to modeling different scenarios and analyzing how fairness perception, interplaying with corporative–retailer cost sharing., influences the performance of fresh agricultural produce cold chains. Findings: The findings of the research highlight the crucial role of the retailer's fairness concern. When the retailer's fairness concern is absent, cost sharing (in cold chain equipment and marketing and advertising) is found to help boost demand and enhance the profits of members of the supply chain; bilateral cost sharing is found to have a more significant impact than unilateral cost sharing. When the retailer's fairness concern is taken into account, however, cost sharing is found to reduce demand at a lower level of fairness coefficient but increases demand at a higher level of fairness coefficient; bilateral cost sharing boosts both demand and profit of the supply chain when the retailer is in a “high concern, high anger” state.

"The role of social media elements in driving co-creation and engagement","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102208324&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2020-0176&partnerID=40&md5=aa94e4d400972b868090cf94850e2868","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and empirically test a research model examining the impact of five social media marketing (SMM) elements–entertainment, customization, interactivity, electronic-word-of-mouth (eWOM) and trendiness–on consumers' intent to participate in value co-creation and on consumer–brand engagement (CBE) and perceived brand value in turn. Design/methodology/approach: The research model is tested for wearable healthcare technology, a smart-technology product. Data were collected in China from 294 users using a self-administered online survey. Data analysis uses partial least squares – structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Entertainment, customization and eWOM are the key predictors in driving consumers' value co-creation intention, thereby strengthening the value co-creation process, CBE and perceived brand value. In contrast with previous studies in the area of value co-creation and CBE, the impact of interactivity and trendiness on value co-creation intention is non-significant. Research limitations/implications: The research contributes to the literature by providing an understanding of how to use SMM dimensions to drive consumers' value co-creation intention for smart-technology products, such as healthcare-wearable technology. However, this study is cross-sectional in nature and its focus is solely on wearable healthcare technology in China. To enhance the generalizability of the findings, future research might consider a longitudinal design and include comparisons between countries with diverse cultures, along with other types of smart-technology products. Practical implications: The findings provide guidance for marketers to enhance CBE and perceived brand value by strengthening consumers' value co-creation intention, using SMM with entertaining and customized content and encouraging positive referrals on social-media platforms. Originality/value: Scholarly attention on the importance of SMM in strengthening consumers' value co-creation intention and CBE is limited, and the question of which SMM elements are effective in driving value co-creation and its link to perceived brand value has not been examined. This paper contributes to the marketing literature by developing and empirically testing a research model, revealing entertainment, customization and eWOM as key SMM elements driving value co-creation intention and CBE for a smart-technology product in China. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer-brand engagement; Perceived brand value; Social media marketing; Value co-creation; Wearable healthcare technology",""

The study examines whether animosity that is based on these different causes has differing effects on perceptions and purchase decisions of the tourist destination product. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on data collected via an online questionnaire concerning the perceptions, feelings and visitation intentions of Chinese individuals toward Japan, as the traditional enemy, or toward other countries without a history of enmity with China. A model of relationships is tested. Findings: The findings determine that animosity is formed differently depending on the target country. In addition, the influence of animosity on intention to visit and perceived risk of visiting the destination vary when animosity is based on traditional enmity reasons and when it is grounded on other causes. The influence of animosity on risk perceptions is also verified. Practical implications: The study provides information that can be used to manage a country's brand in the Chinese market and to segment Chinese consumers based on their feelings of animosity toward certain countries. Originality/value: The study is original as it compares animosity and its influence when it is based on causes related to traditional enmity and when it is grounded on other reasons.

The present research investigates the role of cuteness in leveraging the effectiveness of a narrative emphasizing an insight versus an effort in this regard. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents two experimental studies. Study 1 examines the moderating role of cuteness on the likelihood of purchasing a new product featuring an insight-based (vs effort-based) narrative. Study 2 extends the findings of Study 1 using different stimuli and establishes the underlying mechanism. Findings: Results show that when a cuteness appeal is present, an insight-based (vs effort-based) narrative will lead to a higher purchase likelihood. However, these differences do not emerge when a cuteness appeal is absent (a control condition). Further, perceived brand creativeness will mediate this effect.

Despite the pertinence of tourism and hospitality businesses going into bankruptcy, limited studies have investigated the early warning signs and likelihood of a financial bankruptcy occurring in tourism and hospitality firms. This study examined the predictive value of financial ratios as potential indicators in predicting bankruptcy among tourism and hospitality firms. Design/methodology/approach: Altman's z-score bankruptcy prediction model was applied through five key financial ratios to predict bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook Travel Group over a ten year period (2008–2018). Findings: The key findings of this study strongly suggest that besides the size and location of the firm, financial ratios are reliable predictors and play a pivotal role in predicting the bankruptcy of a tourism and hospitality business. Practical implications: The paper provides key stakeholders to adopt checks and balances to identify financial distressed tourism firms through financial ratios.

The study aimed to investigate the neuropsychological responses of consumers to promotion strategies and the decision to buy sports products, in order to determine the more effective strategy. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental design clarifies whether there is a significant difference between the neuropsychological responses resulting from selective promotional strategies (charity, endorsement, advertising and discount). The authors conducted the research with 40 young adults (20 males and 20 females; age range 25–35 years). The Enobio 20-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) is used to record waves, a two-item questionnaire is used to measure purchasing decisions and self-assessment forms are used to measure arousal and pleasure. Data analysis performed by Friedman's statistical methods and logistic regression using SPSS 22 software. Findings: Based on the alpha wave, the results showed the two charity and endorsement strategies had the highest effect on consumer attentions. The pleasure had the highest value in the discount, and the arousal had the highest value in the charity strategy. Neuropsychological responses also explain a significant percentage of the consumer decision to buy. Research limitations/implications: Access to research samples is difficult due to the ignorance of the samples as well as the fear of possible harm from imaging and brain scanning methods. Practical implications: Neuromarketing is a science that can examine human subconscious decisions and activities. Social implications: The information obtained neural methods are more accurate than traditional research methods. Originality/value: This study showed the alpha brainwave (attention), arousal and pleasure explain a significant part of the consumer decision to buy. More scientific data can be obtained through new scientific approaches such as neuromarketing, which has a great impact on understanding consumer behavior.

Environmental sustainability and social dimensions are becoming important criteria for companies in logistics. The purpose of the study is to determine/model the criteria interaction and also determine the criteria priorities in the FV location selection process. Meanwhile, the study aims to evaluate these criteria and present information to researchers and decision makers. Design/methodology/approach: Six main criteria and 29 sub-criteria are selected from related literature. Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used for determining/modeling the criteria interaction and sketching interaction diagram, and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used for determining the criteria priorities. One/two-way pairwise compared main/sub-criteria views are obtained from 48 experts for calculations. Findings: “Trade potential”, “transportation networks” and “economic factors” have the highest priorities, respectively, out of six main criteria, and they have the most powerful interactions that put these criteria to the center of decision process. Sub-criteria of “foreign trade potential”, “proximity to the port”, “market opportunities” and “proximity to the railway” out of 29 have a total 36.42% priority, more than one-third of the importance.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey design was used for this study. Data from 219 salespeople and their visiting customers in selected cosmetics companies in Korea are used to test the conceptual model using structural equation modeling. Findings: Findings show that intrinsic motivation, empathy, and product knowledge are germane to adaptive selling behavior among salesperson-level factors. Similarly, among the customer-level factors, the length of the relationship between salespeople and customers positively affects adaptive selling behavior. Also, while supervisory empowerment among the organizational-level factors significantly predicts adaptive selling behavior, supervisory control has a negative effect on adaptive selling behavior. The study finds that emotional intelligence and customer value demandingness do not significantly affect adaptive selling behavior. Originality/value: Even though there is extant research on adaptive selling behavior, our research differs from previous research because our research focuses on door-to-door personal selling channels. Furthermore, this study departs from previous research because it uses customer-reporting of the salespeople and salespeople's self-reporting responses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive selling behaviour; Cosmetics industry; Customer-level factors; Organizational-level factors; Personal selling; Salesperson-level factors",""

Furthermore, it examines the psychological mechanism by engagement and consumer fantasy proneness. This study is meaningful because it provides a more in-depth understanding of the use of fashion film as a means of consumer-oriented persuasion communication. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a 2(fashion film type: narrative vs non-narrative) × 2(consumer fantasy proneness: high vs low) mixed factorial design to test the hypotheses. ANOVA and the PROCESS macro mounted on SPSS was used to test hypotheses. Findings: The group with high consumer fantasy proneness showed more changes in brand attitude when exposed to non-narrative than narrative fashion films, but the group with low consumer fantasy proneness showed no significant difference in brand attitude change according to the fashion film type. In addition, when consumer fantasy proneness is high, media and brand engagement for non-narrative fashion films increase sequentially, resulting in a greater change in brand attitude, whereas these psychological mechanisms do not work in groups with low consumer fantasy proneness. Practical implications: Fashion brands should identify their respective target group when producing fashion films and choose differentiated narrative forms. In the case of pursuing a fantastic aesthetic value, the non-narrative type induces more attention and curiosity from consumers than the narrative type, which affects the feeling of a special bond or relevance with the brand. Originality/value: This study has value in that it demonstrates the rationale for why a fashion brand needs to select a differentiated content structure according to the aesthetic value pursued when making a fashion film in branding work. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand engagement; Change in brand attitude; Consumer fantasy proneness; Fashion film type; Media engagement; Moderated mediation effect",""

This research explores how framing quantity promotions as either a freebie (e.g. “buy 1, get 1 free”) or a price bundle (e.g. “buy 2, get 50% off”) influences inaction inertia. Relevant mediators are also identified. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments, two using imaginary scenarios and one using an incentive-compatible design, test the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers who miss a freebie quantity promotion express higher inaction inertia than consumers who miss a price bundle promotion. The cause of this difference is higher perceived regret and greater devaluation that result from missing a superior freebie (vs price bundle) promotion. Research limitations/implications: Future research should examine how factors influencing perceived regret and devaluation moderate the quantity promotional frame effect on inaction inertia. Practical implications: The findings provide insights into which quantity promotional frames practitioners should use to reduce inaction inertia. Originality/value: This study's comprehensive theoretical framework predicts quantity promotional frame effects on inaction inertia and identifies relevant internal mechanisms. The findings are evidence that inaction inertia is caused by both perceived regret and devaluation in certain contexts.

The study tests the relationship between Internet self-efficacy (ISE), website aesthetics, and purchase intention through perceived benefit. An investigation of the impact of perceived risk on purchase intention is also carried out. Design/methodology/approach: The paper carried out a quantitative study based on a purposive sample of 180 working women from the Delhi-NCR region of India and used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to test hypotheses based on the extended TAM model. Findings: Perceived benefit, website aesthetics, and ISE positively and significantly impact working women's purchase intention. The study also finds an indirect relationship between ISE and purchase intention through perceived benefit. Perceived risk has a negative and insignificant influence on working women's purchase intention for online shopping. Practical implications: The study finding reflects that perceived website aesthetics fill the gap between offline and online environments. ISE makes shopping easy and increases the shopper's confidence. A mobile-optimized website with ease of navigation would increase women shoppers' conversion rates on mobile devices, leading to a favourable impact on revenue generation for online retailers. Originality/value: Despite the vast literature on constructs derived from the TAM model, very few studies have researched young women consumers from an emerging economy perspective.

Drawn from the sociological approach, this study treats GVC upgrading as an entrepreneurial act and examines factors affecting firms' intention to move up in their chains based on the theory of planned behavior. The authors also further test the moderating effects of firms' knowledge about rule of origin and governmental supports on the intention-behavior gap. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews with eight Vietnamese business managers were implemented to support the development of hypotheses and measurement scales. Afterwards, the authors conducted a survey on decision-makers of 402 Vietnamese firms which currently have export-import activities to collect quantitative data for testing the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The empirical results indicate that both attitudes, behavioral control and social norms have significant positive impacts on the intention to upgrade in GVCs. In turn, such intention could further activate actual behaviors to move up in their chains. However, those who have better knowledge about rule of origin and receive governmental supports either in terms of finance, credit or technology have a higher probability of demonstrating actual behavior to upgrade in GVCs once their intentions are formed than those who do not. Practical implications: This research provides valuable implications for policymakers in accelerating firms' actions to upgrade within their chains, hence, actively enhancing not only organizational performance but also significantly contributes to the national economic development. Originality/value: While most of the previous studies examine the preconditions for firms to participate and upgrade in their GVCs, there is limited attention on determinants of firms' own intention and actual behavior to upgrade in their chains once they have participated in the GVC. Specifically, this research not only contributes to the existing knowledge regarding factors affecting firms' intention to upgrade in their chains but also closes the gap between the intention and the actual GVC upgrading behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Developing countries; Governmental support; GVC upgrading; Rule of origin; Value chains",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two studies to test our hypotheses. In Study 1, the authors explored consumers' general preferences for domestic and foreign brands. Based on the evidence, Study 2 further explored the moderating roles of decision focus and product quality. Findings: In general, consumers in developing countries prefer foreign brands. The effect can be moderated by the decision focus that this preference will be more obvious when consumers buy for others than when they buy for themselves. Product quality can also moderate the role of decision focus; in other words, consumers' preference for foreign brand when buying for others will be stronger when the product quality is low than when the product quality is high. Practical implications: Foreign brands have a natural appeal to local consumers in developing countries. Moreover, foreign brands can also invoke consumers' awareness of buying for others (such as giving gifts) to boost sales. Domestic brands are at a disadvantage comparing to foreign brands, but they can increase their attractiveness by invoking consumers' awareness of rewarding themselves. In addition, domestic brands need to improve product quality to fundamentally improve their competitiveness.

Hence, a research model is proposed with the integration of perceived transaction value, perceived acquisition values, top reviews information, impulse buying tendency and emotional intelligence following the stimulus-organism-response framework, promotional framing effect, and theory of selective attention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the active social media members of organization pages and selling groups by utilizing the self-administered questionnaire. This study employed the partial least squares structural equation modeling to evaluate the data of 358 individuals. Findings: Results reveal the positive impact of targeted constructs on the urge to buy impulsively with complementary partial mediation of impulse buying tendency. Besides, emotional intelligence dissuades users' impulse buying tendencies, but unexpectedly, its moderating effect is insignificant. Further, importance-performance map analysis highlights the highest importance of impulse buying tendency and better performance of perceived transaction value for the urge to buy impulsively. Originality/value: This research is one of the early studies to explore the influence of social media advertising and contextual social factors (e.g. bundle offers and top reviews information) on impulse buying with the moderation of emotional intelligence and mediation of impulse buying tendency. This research is imperative for scholars and managers with pertinent suggestions to arouse impulse buying. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bundle offer; Emotional intelligence; Impulse buying; Social commerce; Top reviews information",""
"Network-aware credit scoring system for telecom subscribers using machine learning and network analysis","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116457264&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2020-0872&partnerID=40&md5=67525b1de1100affc776735542787ba4","Purpose: A good decision support system for credit scoring enables telecom operators to measure the subscribers' creditworthiness in a fine-grained manner. This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence",""
"Augmented reality (AR) app use in the beauty product industry and consumer purchase intention","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103178742&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2019-0684&partnerID=40&md5=bc296774d1490e15a578283df44086d1","Purpose: Due to the lack of relevant literatures on the application of mobile augmented reality (AR) service in beauty industry, the purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the mobile AR service on consumers' purchase behavior and brand awareness in beauty industry. And this study also wants to identify the different effects of the relationship among flow experience (concentration, playfulness and exploratory behavior), decision comfort and purchase intention moderated by different levels of consumer characteristics (individualism and fashion innovativeness). Design/methodology/approach: This study set up a research model based on SOR model. The study used AR mobile app named “Youcam Makeup” as stimulus to do the questionnaire survey. First, the authors describe the way to use this AR mobile app and make sure each participant experience this app for about 5 min to understand AR well and finally, finished the questionnaire. SPSS and AMOS were used to do data analysis. Findings: The results of this study showed that first, in the field of fashion and beauty makeup, compared with the ability to control or modify virtual contents – the perception of vividness, reality and aesthetics – are more relevant to consumers. Second, besides the playfulness that AR provides, AR technology can also encourage exploratory behavior in consumers, which will directly affect their intention to purchase. Finally, when using mobile AR technology, consumers with different levels of individualism or fashion innovativeness will gain different perceptions of their purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: First, the study targets millennial female consumers. The future studies can be conducted on consumers of different age groups. Second, the sampling of this study is insufficient; if it had more samples, the results would be more accurate. Finally, AR is integrated into people's lives; therefore, to not be limited to millennial consumers, demographic characteristics need to be applied to future research. Practical implications: This study provides a theoretical basis for marketers to formulate marketing strategies. First of all, marketers can use this technology to provide consumers with a more vivid and specific online shopping experience. Second, technical developers can focus on developing the features of AR with the strongest consumer perception based on the results of this study. Finally, this study researched consumer traits that can deepen understanding of both emerging technologies and consumer behavior as compared to research only on mobile AR services. Marketers need to understand the characteristics of consumers when making marketing plans and expand the characteristics of AR technology corresponding to the characteristics of consumers to attract consumers with different attributes. Social implications: By using interactive technology, the brand can be closer to consumers and provide help and fun for consumers when they consume online. AR can also lead to future tool reuse behavior, thus establishing long-term relationships with consumers. More than that, AR can be used with the mobile phone, which can be used anytime and anywhere, eliminating space and time constraints. Therefore, the brand can establish cheap and extensive technology as a marketing strategy. Also, it can become one of the most common marketing tools. Originality/value: This research fills the gap in the literature on mobile AR technology in the beauty industry. Such knowledge will not only facilitate the online development of brands but also help support retailers' development in the beauty industry, providing necessary capabilities for the expansion and application of this new technology. With regard to marketing strategies, the study on consumer characteristic provides the knowledge foundation for marketers to create marketing strategies, which is easier for them to formulate marketing schemes favorable to the brand for varying consumers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Augmented reality; Decision comfort; Fashion innovativeness; Flow experience; Individualism; Spatial presence",""

The work aims to ascertain how to boost users' satisfaction, habit and continuance intention toward Zalo based on the expectation confirmation theory (ECT) and its extension through the impacts of expected benefits and emotional motivations. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected via an online survey on a convenience sample of 356 Zalo users. Statistical analysis is performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) to test proposed hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that confirmation positively influences expected benefits (i.e. pervasiveness, socialization, and self-discovery) and satisfaction. Moreover, satisfaction and habit are jointly stimulated by expected benefits and emotional motivations. Outcomes also reveal that satisfaction is a motivator of habit, which in turn surmises evidently to continuance intention. Practical implications: Findings assist practitioners to develop their business trajectories by improving beneficial services of Zalo and positive emotions. This fulfills user satisfaction and habit, and promotes continuance behavior accordingly. Originality/value: Confirmation and expected benefits are acknowledged as the drivers of satisfaction, but existing literature remains inconclusive about dimensions of expected benefits influencing satisfaction and habit in social media. Furthermore, this study, by an extended ECT, explores emotional motivations for satisfaction and habit.

Interestingly, panic buying research has not been given much attention. The purpose of this paper is threefold. Firstly, it examines the influences of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) elements (subjective norm, attitude and perceived behavior control (PBC)) on panic buying. Secondly, it investigates online news and the perceived likelihood of being affected (PLA) as antecedents to the TPB constructs. Finally, to examine online news verification as a moderator on the relationship between the TPB constructs and panic buying. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 371 respondents and analyzed using the partial least squares method structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). PLS predict was applied to determine the predictive power of the model further. Findings: This study found that subjective norms and attitude influence panic buying. The results further revealed that online news has a direct influence on the PLA and attitude. However, PBC has no such effect on panic buying. Surprisingly, online news verification also has no moderating effects on the relationships between the TPB elements and panic buying. Originality/value: This research helps to understand consumer panic buying behavior, especially during shock events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first that extends the TPB incorporating both online news and PLA as antecedents to panic buying in the same model. Furthermore, the study serves as an initial attempt to investigate online news verification as a moderator between the link of three constructs of TPB and panic buying, contributing to existing literature. Lastly, it advances the body of knowledge on consumer behavior and contributes methodologically by introducing the PLS approach. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Online news verification; Pandemic; Panic buying; Perceived likelihood; Theory of planned behavior",""

Design/methodology/approach: The stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) model is adapted to construct a model (i.e. stimulus: patron status, informativeness and entertainment; organism: perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness; responses: impulse buying behavior and luxury brand loyalty). An online survey was conducted by 200 Chinese participants who experienced WeChat Mini Program and luxury brand purchase. Findings: The results indicate that luxury consumption related factors, task-related factors and mood-related factors in WeChat Mini Program have positive effects on consumers' impulsive purchasing behavior through perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a new understanding about factors influencing consumers' behaviors and brand loyalty in WeChat Mini Program. Originality/value: The mobile social platform has been considered as an advanced tool for advertising. As the most popular mobile social media used by over 1 bn monthly active Chinese users—WeChat, little research attention has been attracted by researchers.

Design/methodology/approach: Four experimental studies were conducted to test the hypotheses. Study 1 investigated the framing effect of anthropomorphized brand roles (servant vs partner) in consumers' minds. Study 2 examined the matching effect of anthropomorphized brand roles and product messaging on product attitude. 132 students were randomly assigned to a 2 (anthropomorphized roles: servant vs partner) × 2 (product messaging: higher-level construal vs lower-level construal) between-subject factorial design. Study 3 tested the mediation effect of processing fluency underlying the construal congruence mechanism. Study 4 replicated the results of study 3 and further examined the boundary conditions by introducing product innovation locus as a moderator. A total of 218 students were randomly assigned to a 2 (anthropomorphized role: servant vs partner) × 2 (product messaging: higher-level construal vs lower-level construal) × 2 (innovation locus: core innovation vs peripheral locus) between-subjects design experiment. Findings: The results demonstrate that a construal match between product messaging and anthropomorphized brand roles –anthropomorphized “servant” with higher-level construal messaging and anthropomorphized “partner” with lower-level construal messaging – can positively influence consumers' attitude via enhanced processing fluency. Furthermore, this construal matching effect on product attitude is moderated by the innovation locus of the product. Practical implications: This study reveals that anthropomorphized brand roles with compatible product messaging in the associated construal levels lead to more favorable product attitudes. Furthermore, the matching effect of anthropomorphized brand roles and product messaging is stronger for products with peripheral innovation than with core innovation.

Design/methodology/approach: A research model was proposed and tested using 329 survey responses. Findings: Results show that the identified website disconfirmation and offline service disconfirmation could lead to consumer dissatisfaction. Importantly, the impacts of disconfirmation factors are contingent upon the justice perception of consumers. When a transaction is perceived as unfair, website disconfirmation arouses a higher level of dissatisfaction, and the negative emotions could transfer from O2O and damage the website's reputation.

This study analyses effective persuasion of tourists by simultaneously investigating how these three characteristics influence tourists' healthy and ecological food choices at hotel buffets. Design/methodology/approach: A randomised 4 × 2 between-subject experimental design, replicated in two hotels, collected perceptions of 329 participants on four persuasive messages aimed at increasing food consumption in a realistic and natural setting at hotel buffets. The eight treatments included four persuasive messages (placebo appeal, health appeal, environmental appeal, local origin appeal), each with and without endorsement (i.e. with/without a specific sender). Findings: Message content, in particular health and local provenance-related messages, and the characteristics of the receiver (tourists' attitudes and habits) influence food choices on holiday while the sender (endorsement) was found to be less influential. This implies that appropriate messages can persuade tourists to eat in a considerate manner from hotel buffets, especially for tourists with favourable attitudes and everyday behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to theory and practice in persuasive communication to encourage healthier and more ecological choices in hedonistic consumption.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted with 935 consumers of luxury fashion in mainland China. Structural equation modelling was applied to measure and analyse the relationship between values (i.e. hedonic values, social values, and value for money) and consumer attitude and PI. Findings: Consumers' multidimensional values positively affected their attitude. Social values and value for money had a significant positive effect on PI towards SLP. However, hedonic values had no effect on PI. Research limitations/implications: The sample was drawn from first-tier cities in China, and the results cannot be generalised. The authors examined three dimensions of consumption values. Future research should consider additional markets, values, and influencing factors. Practical implications: Luxury companies should understand Chinese consumers' diverse values and develop sustainable products that meet consumers' principles. These principles increase the perceived value of the products and thereby guide luxury brands to make marketing strategies to increase sales.

Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates the impact of 4P strategy implementation on the potential and profitability of service operators in Nong Khai Province, Thailand, by using an econometric model and defining dependent variables in order to classify firm performance into 3 areas, namely, (1) revenue, (2) cost/expense and (3) profit—in log form. Findings: Study results show that tourism and hospitality service operators have to place emphasis on “development,” starting from upstream processes such as research and development and utilizing local wisdom and reflecting cultural identities as well as focusing on downstream activities, including adoption of modern media. At the same time, operators should also emphasize marketing and sales promotions as well as seek publicity through websites and online social media in parallel with developing downstream activities. Research limitations/implications: This paper only focuses on Nong Khai Province as the research area because, first, Nong Khai has a relatively low income per capita and is located in Thailand's Northeast, the country's poorest region. Second, Nong Khai is a border province, adjacent to the Lao PDR, and thus there are numerous tourists from the Lao PDR and overseas countries who travel in and out of the province through the Thailand–Lao border checkpoints. Practical implications: Relevant government agencies should provide support throughout the development process from upstream to downstream in order to upgrade the potential of tourism and service operators in this small province by incorporating local identities used for creation of service products and by supporting marketing and sales promotions whether in the form of organizing various exhibitions events, publicity via the Internet, etc. Social implications: Raising service standards of an organization and developing an acceptable quality brand and setting fair prices without taking advantage of consumers were strategies that played important roles. This set of strategies was implemented together with a development strategy for people also through the process of team building and knowledge management, including skill development through a training system, which also played an important role toward the sustainability of tourism and hospitality enterprises in Nong Khai Province.

Besides, the current study investigates the moderating role of brand strength in the relationship between BOM and brand equity. Design/methodology/approach: The current study adopted a 4 (BO identification: favorable BOM vs adverse BOM vs non-identification vs correct identification) × 2 (brand strength: strong vs weak) between-subjects design. A total number of 547 participants performed assessments on the automotive brand. The current study selected three strong brands and three weak brands for tests. In the experiment, respondents had to associate the brand with its country of origin. The assignment of BO conditions was based upon respondents' natural responses provided. ANOVA was used for data analysis. Findings: The results indicate that as compared to correct BO identification, BOM (either adverse or favorable) or non-identification exerts a more negative impact on brand equity. Moreover, the study demonstrates that brand strength moderates the effect of perceived BO on brand equity. Originality/value: This study provides empirical support to the notion that BOM is detrimental to brand equity. Specifically, when adverse BOM occurs, a strong brand suffers more from the negative consequences resulted than a weak brand does. Conversely, when consumers misattribute the BO to a country with a stronger image than its real origin (i.e. favorable BOM), the resulting negative effect is reversed. Moreover, the non-identification of BO hurts the brand equity of both strong and weak brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand origin misperception; Brand strength; Country image",""
"Salespersons' self-monitoring, psychological capital and sales performance","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100519732&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2020-0262&partnerID=40&md5=97ef1cceab9c61bb74816475a5995ae8","Purpose: Drawing on conservation of resources (COR) theory and the motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, this study examines how salespersons' self-monitoring and psychological capital influence sales performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses survey data from 293 salespersons employed in China and their archival sales performance to test the hypotheses posited. Findings: The results show that both salespersons' self-monitoring and psychological capital enhance sales performance via adaptive selling. However, these elements are primarily substitutes in influencing adaptive selling. In addition, by dividing social capital into two types (i.e. family-based social capital and customer-based social capital), the results reveal that salespersons' self-monitoring enhances family-based social capital, but not customer-based social capital. Finally, customer-based social capital, but not family-based capital, improves sales performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper extends the literature on sales force management, which examines various psychological traits and their influences on sales performance. While self-monitoring and psychological capital have been investigated separately, this research simultaneously examines these two factors by drawing on resource conservation theory. Furthermore, it explores how these psychological traits impact salespersons' ability development (i.e. adaptive selling) and capital accumulation (i.e., family-based social capital and customer-based social capital), which, in turn, affect sales performance. Practical implications: The results offer managerial insights into sales force selection and management. In particular, managers should encourage salespersons to obtain greater customer-based social capital, which is more valuable than family-based social capital in boosting sales performance. Social implications: The present research is also beneficial for employee psychological health management, as it seeks to illuminate the role of psychological traits, ability development and capital accumulation. It offers insights into sociological research on social capital by categorizing it into family-based and customer-based capital. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature on salespersons' psychological traits, selling abilities and social capital by examining the impacts of self-monitoring and psychological capital on adaptive selling and social capital. Specifically, this study examines the interplay between self-monitoring and psychological capital from the perspective of resources conservation theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive selling; Psychological capital; Sales performance; Self-monitoring; Social capital",""

Consequently, it is unclear how to promote pro-environmental luxury brands. The present research seeks to develop effective advertising strategies for pro-environmental luxury brands by employing mixed emotional appeals. Design/methodology/approach: Two experimental studies were conducted to test two hypotheses. Study 1 examines the effects of mixed emotions (happiness and sadness vs. happiness alone) on intentions to purchase a pro-environmental luxury product. Study 2 replicates the findings of Study 1 using a different product and extends it by establishing the underlying mechanism. Findings: The results reveal that an advertisement featuring mixed emotions of happiness and sadness (vs. happiness alone) enhances intentions to purchase a pro-environmental luxury product. Further, the effect is mediated by cognitive flexibility. Originality/value: The present research tests a novel perspective on how mixed emotional appeals can leverage the advertising effectiveness of pro-environmental luxury brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Cognitive flexibility; Luxury; Mixed emotions; Pro-environmental",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study involved an online experiment and was conducted using online questionnaires. Sampling was done among undergraduate students of a Southwestern university in the US. The data was analyzed using SEM with PLS. Findings: The results showed, for foreign brands, consumer self-brand connection increased through the effect of country affinity and product quality judgment. For domestic brands, self-brand connection was influenced by ethnocentrism (and not country affinity or product quality judgment). Research limitations/implications: This study only focused on one industry (i.e. Television industry), and the authors recommend future studies examine a broader range of industries. Moreover, other country related constructs such as national identity need to be examined in future studies. Practical implications: Marketers focusing on global branding and international marketing can benefit from the findings of this paper by understanding the routes through which consumers build self-brand connections in foreign vs domestic settings. Additionally, marketers can, more effectively, invest their resources by focusing on the factors that can be influential (i.e. ethnocentrism for domestic brands vs country affinity and product judgment for foreign brands).

A four-stage refinement process was used for data reduction, and analysis was informed by complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. Findings: Our findings identify connectivity, collectivity and scalability as key mechanisms through which relationships between organizations contribute to SCRes. These mechanisms draw on IOR elements of information sharing, decision synchronization and incentive alignment to augment self-organization and emergence, and adaptation and coevolution via modifying/advancing resilience strategies and practices. Originality/value: Our study advances theory and practice of SCRes by expounding on how connectivity, collectivity and scalability act as mechanisms that drive and diffuse the contribution of resilient strategies/practices to resilience capability.

The purpose is to provide strategic suggestions to apparel companies attempting to invest in sustainable development of plastic clothing, as well as implications for marketing and sustainability research. Design/methodology/approach: Consumer brand attitude and purchase intention towards sustainable plastic clothing are examined across material types, brand luxury levels and price levels from 315 valid samples collected in Japan. Findings: The results reveal that sustainable plastic clothing raises brand attitude, indirectly influencing purchase intention. However, the direct effect of sustainable clothing on purchase intention is contradictorily negative. These contradictory effects are especially significant when brand luxury is high. Both brand attitude and purchase intention hardly vary across price levels or material types of sustainable plastic, such as post-consumer bottles versus apparel. Practical implications: The results imply that sustainable products are not instantly profitable but contribute to a desirable brand association, especially for luxury brands. An investment in costly closed-loop technology for apparel recycling is found to be commercially disadvantageous. Managers are suggested to discuss this aspect carefully, since it seems partially unprofitable, while sustainable management seems to comprehensively contribute to overall enterprise performance. Originality/value: The study specifically reveals the luxury effect enhancing, yet contradictory, consumer behaviour towards sustainable plastic clothing. To the best of the author’s knowledge, few studies have examined the relationships between these elements.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a self-administered online survey of 340 social media users. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the conceptual model. Findings: Findings indicate that social media involvement, self-brand congruence and firm image are significant drivers of SMBE, while relationship age is not. SMBE subsequently impacts consumer satisfaction, brand trust and perceived value. Research limitations/implications: This study contains some limitations associated with cross-sectional research. It does not investigate consumer engagement with other entities (e.g. other commercial brands) through the use of social media. Practical implications: These findings call for marketing managers and social media brand managers to pay attention and invest resources in the significant drivers of SMBE. They also provide insights on enhancing SMBE to strengthen consumer–brand relationships.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted questionnaires on utilitarian benefits, hedonic benefits, perceived risk, customer satisfaction, customer trust and customers' psychological ownership (CPO) on 205 people. They verified their hypotheses using structural equation modeling analysis. Findings: The authors found that customer trust positively influences CPO, but customer satisfaction does not. Instead, customer satisfaction indirectly affects CPO through the mediating effects of customer trust. They also found that utilitarian and hedonic benefits positively influence customer satisfaction and confidence, but perceived risk negatively influences it. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the service marketing literature by empirically confirming that customers have psychological ownership, such as employees, and by incorporating benefits, risk, trust and CPO into a comprehensive framework. Practical implications: Marketers should formulate service strategies that strengthen customers' perceptions of utilitarian and hedonic benefits and avoid customers' perceived risk, which is expected to exert a significant CPO-enhancing effect. Originality/value: In the service context, customers are perceived as partial employees. The authors empirically explored the role of perceived benefits and risks in enhancing CPO via customer satisfaction and trust by applying EPO concepts. Strengthening perceived benefits and avoiding perceived risk were verified as critical drivers of CPO in the service context. The results of this study confirm that customer trust is required for customers to feel CPO. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer's psychological ownership (CPO); Hedonic benefits; Perceived benefits; Perceived risk; Utilitarian benefits",""

The moderating roles of religiosity on the relationships between perceived value, satisfaction and trust also have been investigated in this study. Design/methodology/approach: This research has carried out in West Sumatra Indonesia. The respondents of this study are Islamic bank customers from five areas in West Sumatra Indonesia. Data have been collected through Survey method. After some preliminary analyses, we employed 390 useable responses in the analysis. Covariance Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) was employed to analyze the data. Findings: This study found that religiosity has significant impacts on perceived value, customer satisfaction and trust. Perceived value and customer satisfaction are also significant antecedents of trust. Moreover, it found the significant moderating impact of religiosity on the link between perceived value and trust, and also on the link between customer satisfaction and trust. Research limitations/implications: This cross-sectional study has been conducted in a single country. Accordingly, this study may have a limitation in result generalization. Moreover, this study only focused on three antecedents of trust, including religiosity, satisfaction and perceived value. Therefore, for future research, we suggest conducting a longitudinal study in some Muslim countries such as Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Middle East countries. We also suggest employing other antecedents of customer trust, such as customer engagement and customer sociocultural. Practical implications: Based on the research findings, the managers of Islamic banks will have input on how to improve their customers' trust by giving more attention to customer religiosity, perceived value and satisfaction. They can develop programs to increase customer perceived value and satisfaction such as a reward program to increase customer trust. Originality/value: A more comprehensive model of the relationship between religiosity, perceived value, satisfaction and trust has been addressed in this study.

The author argues that to understand the phenomenon in the future, different, more contextualized and human-focused lenses and methodologies are needed. He ventures out into philosophy, sociology and anthropology to broaden the perspective on the matter and proposes resonance, the theory of successful world relations, as an alternative view on luxury and luxury consumption. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on the authors' reflections and an extensive review of literature, including contributions from different academic disciplines. Findings: With introduction of resonance the author provides an alternative theoretical and practical lens on a multifaceted and dynamic phenomenon that nurtures lucrative markets which must adapt and fundamentally redefine themselves in response to changing social, ecological, technological and economic circumstances and evolving customer needs pointing towards a new social paradigm. Originality/value: The author presents a critical view on luxury and enriches the discussion in the marketing and business-related literature with the perspectives of philosophy, sociology and other disciplines, linking the phenomenon to resonance theory and the notions of rebellion and escape.

Hierarchical moderated regression and hierarchical linear modeling analyses were used to test the moderating effects of degree centrality, brokerage and density on the relationship between opinion leadership and susceptibility to social influence. Findings: This study documents the significant moderating roles of network positions and network density in the relationship between individual influence (i.e. opinion leadership) and susceptibility to social influence. Interestingly, this study shows that the significant moderating effects of degree centrality and brokerage hold for opinion leaders' responsiveness to informational social influence, whereas that of network density holds for opinion leaders' responsiveness to normative social influence. Research limitations/implications: This research sheds light on the network structural characteristics under which opinion leaders would be differentially responsive to social influence (i.e. informational and normative influence) from others. Practical implications: This research provides marketing managers with insights into leveraging social influence by activating opinion leaders through existing network ties in new product diffusion networks. Originality/value: Although opinion leaders are generally less susceptible to social influence from others than nonleaders, this research finds that, under certain network conditions, opinion leaders would be equally responsive to social influence from their peers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Influencer marketing; New product diffusion; Opinion leadership; Social influence; Social networks",""

However, a paucity of studies in the literature have developed integrative models or have explored domestic tourist behavior in a general, or the sports tourism, context. To address this gap, the present study investigates the relationships between event quality, personal involvement, destination image and destination loyalty in the context of event sports tourism in order to provide sporting destination managers with valuable information for sustainable sports tourism development. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected information from 365 domestic tourists who attended the 100th National Sports Festival held in Seoul, South Korea, in 2019. Construct validity of the measurement scale was verified by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), factor loadings, average variance (AVE) extracted and construct reliability (CR). Reliability of the measurement scale was verified by Cronbach's alpha analysis.

Design/methodology/approach: With respect to the problems of channel conflicts between the traditional sales and online direct sales, to optimize the sale system and get more profits, considering the influences of consumer network acceptance, the authors establish demand and profit function based on consumer's utility, respectively. What's more, we exploit the game theory to analyze the optional decisions of the supply chain under the incentive coordination condition and no incentive coordination condition, and then we discuss the supply chain's optimal pricing, demand, profit and compensation incentive levels with the different effect of consumer network acceptance. Findings: The level of compensation incentive provided by the manufacturer is influenced by consumer network acceptance and product cost. The lower the consumer network acceptance, the better the compensation incentive coordination effect of manufacturers. Manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers are all important players in real supply chain relationships. When a manufacturer exists as a dominant role, it should pay full attention to the impact of consumer behavior on supply chain decisions. Practical implications: The research can clarify the influence and mechanism of consumer behavior on supply chain channel conflict coordination, and deal with channel conflicts.

Design/methodology/approach: Surveys were conducted with 645 Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was performed to estimate linkages between destination image, destination personality, self-congruity and revisit intention. To compare effects on revisit intention across male and female Chinese tourists, PLS-Henseler's multigroup analysis and PLS-permutation test were conducted to analyse gender as a moderator in the proposed framework. Findings: Our results revealed positive direct effects among destination image, destination personality, self-congruity and revisit intention. Our findings indicated a highly significant difference in the effects of destination personality on ideal self-congruity across male and female Chinese tourists. The association between destination image and self-congruity identified through this model represents a crucial contribution to the tourism literature. This study also enriches tourism research by comparing male and female Chinese tourists' intentions to revisit New Zealand, having identified crucial heterogeneity within female tourists.

"Customer segment transition through the customer loyalty program","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108799913&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2020-0630&partnerID=40&md5=5e354916b7918d0aa7c305bd8a6d01b6","Purpose: This study presents the applicability of a model-based approach for loyalty program forecasting using smartphone app in the digital strategy of the retail industry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a dynamic model with the cyclical structure of customer segments through customer experience. They use time-series data on the number of members of the loyalty program, “Seven Mile Program” and confirm the validity of the approximate calculation of customer segment share, customer segment sales share and aggregate sales performance. The authors present three medium-term forecast scenarios after the launch of a smartphone payment service linked with the loyalty program. Findings: The sum of the two customer segment shares for forecasting (the sum of the quasi-excellent and excellent customer ratios) is about 30% in each scenario, consistent with an essential customer loyalty (true loyalty) share obtained in the existing empirical study. Research limitations/implications: Digital strategy in the retail industry should focus more on estimating and forecasting average amounts of customer segments and the number of aggregated customers through the digitalization on the customer side than on individual customer journeys and responses. Practical implications: Multi-scenario evaluation through simulation of dynamic models from a systemic view can be used for decision-making in retailing digital strategies. Originality/value: This study builds a model that integrates the cyclicality of customer segment transition through customer experiences into a loyalty matrix framework, which is a method that has previously been used in the hospitality industry. © 2021, Makoto Kimura.","Customer journey; Customer loyalty; Digital strategy; Forecasting; Smartphone app; System dynamics",""
"Please do not disturb: the effect of Zero-Contact Marketing on Korean consumers' decision-making process","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108163118&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2020-0641&partnerID=40&md5=28e64c8f6b6e0f79b335132efabd0890","Purpose: This study examines the effectiveness of Zero-Contact Marketing that minimizes contact between employees and consumers in marketplaces by adopting an integrated research framework of motivation theory, servicescape model and the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Design/methodology/approach: This study randomly collected 314 respondents through an online survey in May 2020 in South Korea. Structural equation modeling (SEM) assessed the overall hypothetical research model. Findings: Zero-Contact Marketing facilitates the positive impacts of Korean consumers' motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic) and service environment on their word-of-mouth (WOM) intention to spread information about a store offering Zero-Contact Marketing service and the store revisit intention. In addition, consumers' attitude toward Zero-Contact Marketing and shopping pleasure (SPL) has stronger impacts on consumers' WOM intention than they do on the store revisit intention. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study lies in that the survey participants responded only in South Korea, which may lead to biased results. To provide a more generalized insight, this study should be extended by considering consumers in other countries, since many consumers around the world tend to minimize face-to-face interaction and avoid unnecessary interruptions under the current pandemic. Practical implications: By minimizing the social interaction between employees and consumers, Zero-Contact Marketing may increase consumers' shopping satisfaction with free shopping moments and no disturbance, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: The findings provide theoretical contributions by empirically validating the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and service environment on consumers' internal and external responses in a Zero-Contact retail setting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer decision-making; Extrinsic motivation; Intrinsic motivation; Revisit intention; South Korea; WOM; Zero-Contact Marketing",""
"Aging consumers and their brands: the customer journey perspective","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118999682&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2021-0733&partnerID=40&md5=aefa54d891e1df629c1e0a6f78392381","Purpose: With the increasing numbers of the elderly people, the aging segment represents a potential huge market. While this trend is obvious, still little literature focuses on this group. The study thus fills up this gap. Furthermore, the study aims to examine the aging consumers' journeys from the lens of brand resonance pyramid and has its importance using context-specific theories to understand the elderly consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Case study method is conducted using the in-depth interview to collect data and inductive method via MaxQda software to analyze. Two types of aging brand (i.e. age-denial and age-adaptive) are investigated (Moody and Sood, 2010). This study interviews 26 elderly consumers, among whom, 12 have experiences in sports gyms (i.e. age-denial) and 14 in hospital services (i.e. age-adaptive). The author also triangulates the results by interviewing two additional experts in these contexts. Findings: The findings of the paper reveal that (1) brand functional benefit is important for both age-denial and age-adaptive brands while each has different dimensions. Brand experiential benefit (e.g. social, behavioral and intellectual experience) is important motivation for the age-denial brand and brand symbolic and brand psychological benefits are the emotional drivers for the age-adaptive brand. (2) Consequences of this journey include those, for example, brand satisfaction, brand loyalty, word-of-mouth and recommendation and (3) mediating mechanisms, e.g. brand sense of identification, brand psychological attachment and customization for both brand types, with exceptions of diversification and brand psychological attachment, and mutual interaction for the age-denial brand and doctor–patient relationship and consumer inertia for the age-adaptive brand. (4) The current study finds two new concepts for aging consumers, i.e. brand social experience in the age-denial brand and brand psychological benefit in the age-adaptive brand. Research limitations/implications: (1) Results of the paper are context dependent and generalization issue might occur. (2) While it is analyzed using inductive method via MaxQda software, the interviewer's subjective bias might occur. (3) Interviewees are at their different life stages, i.e. early-old vs mid-old, and thus, these contextual factors might also influence the results. Originality/value: (1) The current study explores the elderly consumers' experience journeys at three stages (i.e. pre-service, during-service and pro-service/loyalty loop) for age-denial and age-adaptive brands and deepen an understanding of this aging market; (2) offers practical implications to brands targeting at the elderly consumers, particularly the age-denial and age-adaptive brands; (3) uses customer journey theory and brand resonance pyramid as the lens to understand aging consumers, and results also partly echo with the theories and (4) explores two new concepts for aging consumers, i.e. brand social experience and brand psychological benefit, thus adding new dimensions to important constructs, i.e. brand experience and brand benefit. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aging brand; Aging consumer; Brand resonance pyramid; Customer journey theory; Hospital; Psychological well-being; Qualitative analysis; Senior learning center; Sports gym",""
"Big Five personality traits and green consumption: bridging the attitude-intention-behavior gap","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114670450&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2021-0276&partnerID=40&md5=193105a262d011506d96f0381f28489f","Purpose: This study examines the roles of Big Five personality traits, including conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism and openness to experience, in shaping green consumption behavior, as well as bridging the attitude-intention-behavior gap in environmentally friendly consumption and testing the gender differences between these associations. Design/methodology/approach: A dataset of 611 consumers was collected by means of mall-intercept surveys in major Vietnamese cities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24.0 was employed to test the proposed conceptual framework and hypotheses, while the PROCESS approach was utilized to estimate mediation standardized regression coefficients. Findings: The study revealed that in addition to extraversion, other personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience and neuroticism) were strongly associated with green consumption. Moreover, attitude towards green products and intention to buy environmentally friendly products were determined to have key roles in explaining consumers' pro-environmental behavior. There was also a notable difference in the impact of personality traits on men's and women's green consumption. Practical implications: This study provides useful recommendations for administrational practices seeking to understand consumer behavior, build appropriate marketing and communication campaigns and attract customers to buy environmentally friendly products. Originality/value: This study makes efforts to resolve the attitude-intention-behavior gap, a recurring theme in the green consumption literature, as well as illustrates the significance of Big Five personality traits in explaining attitude, intention and behavior when purchasing green products. This research also demonstrates that Big Five personality traits have significantly different effects on green consumption attitudes and intention to carry out pro-behavioral consumption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude towards green products; Big five personality traits; Gender difference; Green purchase behavior; Green purchase intention",""

To provide evidence for the study’s theoretical framework, the authors focus on the behavior of reducing single-use plastics. Design/methodology/approach: A mall-intercept survey for consumption of single-use plastic products in three big cities of Vietnam (Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh city) was conducted to test the theoretical framework. In total, 468 consumers completed the questionnaires. Data were analyzed with SPSS and AMOS. Findings: Intrinsic and prosocial motivations are found to be significant predictors of sustained PECB. More importantly, beyond the direct effects of intrinsic and prosocial motivations, the authors also found positive interaction effects between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and between intrinsic and prosocial motivation on encouraging sustained PECB. Originality/value: This research offers a new insight for encouraging sustained PECB. Different from the extant perspectives which usually deal with initiating PECB, the authors emphasize sustaining the behavior.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to obtain the needed data and the relationships of interest were examined using a partial least squares structural equation modelling approach. Findings: Brand loyalty and consumer-brand identification were found to be predictors of OBA, while OBA impacted on purchase intent. In addition, a strong reciprocal relationship was found between OBA and brand loyalty, which has not been reported in prior studies. Research limitations/implications: This study highlighted OBA's complexity. It suggested OBA is not only an outcome of a consumer-brand relationship but also that OBA plays a key role in the development of such relationships. A consumer's identification with a brand fosters brand loyalty and purchase intent through the giving of OBA. Practical implications: The more consumers vocalise their brand relationships through OBA, the more they strengthen their relationship with brands. The inclusion of OBA management in brand and marketing strategies should enable organisations to foster opportunities for online consumer-brand interactions that strengthen consumer-brand relationships. Originality/value: First, unlike previous studies that have used makeshift scales to measure OBA, the authors used a recently developed OBA scale. Second, the important reciprocal relationship between OBA and brand loyalty, which has significant implications, has not been reported in prior research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand loyalty; Consumer brand identification; Online brand advocacy",""

Despite intense promotion to opt for the vouchers in digital form, Taiwanese public overwhelmingly chose the paper form. This study considers the reasons that influenced their decision comfort in choosing paper rather than digital vouchers based on two categories: rational (promotion depth and ease of use) and behavioral economics factors (analysis paralysis, mental accounting related to ease of tracking expenses, social influence and payment habits). Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares (PLS) method was utilized to analyze survey information obtained from 183 individuals who chose paper vouchers. Findings: Individuals consider rational and behavioral economic factors in their perception of decision comfort while choosing paper over digital vouchers. Decision comfort is driven more by behavioral economics than rational factors such as ease of use. Interestingly, analysis paralysis related to paper vouchers has the greatest impact, but it positively influences decision comfort, indicating that Taiwanese people view paper vouchers as a safe haven in the midst of uncertainties and information overload. Therefore, when designing public policies or promotional campaigns, possible behavior outcomes should be considered from both rational and behavioral economic perspectives. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the dynamics of how individuals arrive at their decision of opting paper vouchers over digital ones and offers theoretical contributions related to system adoption and behavioral economics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral economics factors; COVID-19; Decision comfort; Digital voucher; Paper voucher; Rational factors; Triple stimulus voucher",""

The purpose of this study is to identify and validate a representative typology of older Koreans based on their lifestyle and value orientations. This study also makes a longitudinal comparison of these segments in two waves using similar survey data collected in 2009 and 2017 and examines any meaningful changes that occurred during the periods. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data collected from 750 older adults living in four major cities in Korea, this study conducted factor and cluster analysis to identify lifestyle segmentation of elderly Koreans. Both descriptive and mean comparison analyses are followed to characterize the segments with relevant demographic and behavioral variables. In addition, this study makes a longitudinal comparison of these segments in two waves (2009 and 2017) and examines any meaningful changes that occurred during the periods. Findings: Six distinctive lifestyle segments of elderly Koreans are identified. The longitudinal comparison reveals some changes that occurred during the period. The level of importance of values and things to own has been declined during the period on most of the aspects, which can be interpreted that older Koreans become more realistic and practical. The level of life satisfaction between the two periods turned out to be similar. However, satisfaction in material comfort and health has been improved during the period, which means that the perception of their financial and physical aspects has been improved over the years. Originality/value: First, based on Tempest et al.’s three grey discontinuity framework (2002), the segmentation model provides comprehensive coverage of psychological transitions experienced by older people due to economic, physical and mental discontinuities with age. Second, this might be the first longitudinal study to examine the changes in segmentation over time in terms of the lifestyle of older adults.

However, in the organizational context, subordinates as customers might choose products with less brand prestige than what they want and can afford, just to make sure their choices are below the invisible “red-line” set by the brands of their supervisors. The authors term the phenomenon as “boss ceiling effect,” and term the behavior that people often downgrade their original choice to make sure the brand prestige is lower than that of the product owned by their boss as “downgrading behavior,” which have not been explored and well explained by existing literature so far. The paper aims to discuss this issue.

It identifies the antecedents of social influence that can positively and negative influence the IBA among a targeted population of conventional and Islamic banks. Moreover, this paper contributes various factors to social influence theory with the purpose of enhancing its implication in the context of Internet banking uptake in developed and developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a social constructivism approach to understand customer experiences, thoughts, knowledge, awareness and perceptions in relation to IBA. For this study, data were collected from 30 respondents using semi-structured interviews and purposive sampling. Findings: Social influence comprises customer recommendations, suggestions, ratings, reviews, experiences and thoughts regarding the IBA of Islamic and conventional banks. The findings reveal that social reviews, social experts, social consensus, social responsibility and social perceptions are the key antecedents of social influence that can enhance IBA of SNPs. The research finds that positive social reviews, expert support, consensus, social responsibility and social perceptions are significant in relation to conventional Internet banking. The respondents revealed serious concerns about the privacy of their personal and financial information especially in relation to Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: The effective and well-organized use of SNPs can foster service reviews, word of mouth, higher levels of service awareness, interactive communication, social consensus and social trust to drive the adoption of Internet banking. This study proposes the conceptual model which has positive business implications and provides the banks direction to use the SNPs to their advantage to influxes their customers to adopt the use of Internet banking. Originality/value: Most previous studies have used technology acceptance model, theory of planned behavior and unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology theories in the adoption of technology and IBA. These theories have not fully illuminated the role of social content as a way to enhance or decrease the number of customers in conventional and Islamic banks. This study develops social influence theory by exploring several dimensions (i.e. social reviews, awareness, consensus, cooperation and experts support) in the context of IBA for users of SNPs. Social influence can create more reviews and can lead to more prepurchase information. It can drive customer inquiries and engagement and can inform purchase decisions for IBA. On the other hand, it can motivate existing customers of Islamic banks to use conventional banking services due to effective word of mouth. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Conventional and Islamic banks; Exploratory study; Internet banking adoption (IBA); Service quality; Social networking platforms (SNPs)",""

Design/methodology/approach: The traditional thinking is that products with high quality and low price will win more customers. However, the authors can notice that high quality products usually have high cost. Therefore, it is necessary to do more research on how customers can accept low quality products. The authors take fast fashion products and smart phones as empirical studies, collecting data from customer’s online survey. Based on the methodology of fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyse the relationship between the factors of short life cycle, low quality, design and price and influence customer purchase intention. Findings: The authors find that price is the most important influencing factor. Low price is a strong competitive factor in the market. As to low quality products, low price can be achieved relatively more easily than with high quality products, resulting from relatively poorer raw material or configurations. Hence the connection between quality and price may give an idea to enterprises that customers will accept low quality products with low price. Moreover, according to the research, different generations are equally affected by the low price condition, regardless of customer gender and household income. Research limitations/implications: Because the study only focuses on fast fashion and smart phones industries, future work needs to replicate this study with individual data for different industries and with alternative methods to reinforce the confidence in the research. Meanwhile, this research studied mainly the customer perspective, it would be desirable to extend the study to the enterprise perspective and find out the difficulties that limit them in using low quality products to meet market needs. This may revel some cultural differences in purchase behavior among different countries and the discussed industries can be expanded to a larger area. Practical implications: The study offers a number of managerial implications. With the rapid changes in people’s aesthetic sense and developing high-tech, it is more and more necessary for companies to think about how to win more customers and earn more profits. Low quality products have advantages as they will lower companies’ costs in many dimensions, improving the speed of supply. It helps firms to take low quality products into consideration and think whether they will influence different aspects of the company assistance firms to get a deeper understanding of customer psychology and make better decisions on their products.

Design/methodology/approach: For study subjects, the author selected general public located in the city of Seoul. A total of 307 respondents were used for statistical analysis after discarding unusable questionnaires. For the purpose of judgment sampling, the author selected those respondents who had prior purchase experience of the products or services provided by socially responsible firms. Findings: This study tested core elements of social capital (reciprocal norm, social network and corporate trust) as predictors of ethical consumption behavior. In particular, the study newly conceptualized and validated ethical consumption behavior as one encompassing the civic engagement behavior whose premise is well encapsulated by value co-creation principle. The results demonstrate that the social network and reciprocal norm significantly influence ethical consumption behavior directly as well as indirectly through corporate trust. Research limitations/implications: The significance of this study may be that it adds to current literature on ethical consumption behavior by validating an empirical model of ethical consumption behavior from the perspective of consumer engagement paradigm. No previous studies of ethical consumption behavior empirically tested this model previously, only offering conceptual similarity between ethical consumption and consumer engagement. The study’s result may provide some insights as to the utility of value co-creation strategy for socially responsible firms as a useful way to promote ethical consumption behavior. Practical implications: This study’s result may provide some useful insights as to how socially responsible firms can improve their performance by understanding what makes their customers voluntarily engage in favor of the firms to create shared values. In particular, the finding on the corporate trust mediating between bonding network and ethical consumption behavior sheds useful insights for the firms on how they should garner customer trust to trigger ethical consumption behavior. In this sense, socially responsible firms need to focus their resources on publicity or endorsements by highly respected celebrities designed to stress the firms’ trustworthiness and create favorable corporate image. Social implications: The finding that reciprocal norm has a significant impact on ethical consumption behavior also provides strategic implications on how to enhance the effectiveness of corporate messages. That is, the socially responsible firms should implement some corporate strategies designed to raise authentic corporate image of the firms by hiring the socially disadvantaged and returning some portion of profit back to society. By doing this, the socially responsible firms can expect to instill some sense of reciprocity into their current as well as potential customers. Originality/value: Despite this conceived linkage, no previous research has empirically approached ethical consumption from the perspective of civic engagement to examine whether ethical consumers voluntarily engage in firm-specific engagement behavior that fulfills their civic responsibility. Therefore, the present research embarks on a new approach to conceptualize ethical consumption as a construct that embodies civic engagement that is conceptually encapsulated by the principle of value co-creation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Civic engagement; Corporate trust; Ethical consumption; Reciprocal norm; Social network; Value co-creation",""
"How and when AR technology affects product attitude","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075521848&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0221&partnerID=40&md5=387f368b946f65f2980314e7db8f9ad3","Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a novel communication tool, which adds virtual computer-generated information to a viewer’s real life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of AR technology on consumers’ experience. Design/methodology/approach: Four experiments were performed to test the effect of AR-based product display on the consumer’s attitude and the underlying mechanism of the effect. Findings: The results have demonstrated that self-referencing reality simulation mediates the effect of AR technology on consumers’ product attitude, and the effect is attenuated when the consumers hold quality beliefs rather than taste beliefs or when the product is a luxury brand. Practical implications: The current research suggests that managers should develop and adopt AR technology when presenting their products in front of consumers, which can improve consumers’ product attitude. Additionally, emphasizing the taste of target products rather than quality will strengthen the positive effect of AR technology on product attitude. Furthermore, managers of luxury brands should present their products in a traditional way, which induce an exclusive perception rather than using AR technology. Originality/value: This paper investigates the underlying mechanism of how AR technology improves consumers’ product attitude and shopping experience, to fill the gap in consumers’ unique experience with AR technology. Furthermore, the moderated effect of consumer beliefs and product difference has also been examined in this study, which attributes to the research of product differentiation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Augmented reality; Consumer beliefs; Luxury; Product display; Self-reference",""

The current research also investigates the mechanism and boundary condition behind these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The study proposed a conceptual framework that included five variables to understand consumers’ approach behaviors toward online stores. By surveying 307 Chinese online shoppers using a comprehensive questionnaire, the authors collected data that were then used to test the hypotheses. Data were examined using regression analysis. Findings: The results showed that online store informativeness and entertainment significantly affected consumers’ approach behaviors. In the relationship between these two online store characteristics and consumers’ approach behaviors, pleasure played a mediating role. Hedonic value moderated the effect of informativeness on consumers’ approach behaviors. However, the moderating role of hedonic value was not significant in the relationship between entertainment and consumers’ approach behaviors.

Findings: Based on the sequential tests, the results confirmed the consistent structure of the measurement instrument of consumers’ perceived value. In practical applications, although the invariance of monetary value could not be established at the metric level, the findings suggest that social value, convenient value and epistemic value were invariant across groups of consumers in the different shopping contexts.

We especially investigate whether consumers' focus on quality versus price affects their multichannel shopping tendency and their flexibilities in their shopping lists (basket flexibility). Design/methodology/approach: We surveyed a representative sample of 400 French shoppers regarding fashion apparel purchasing. We use a logistic regression framework to measure the probability of a shopper becoming a multichannel shopper based on the key constructs and a battery of control variables. Findings: The analysis shows that, in fashion buying, shoppers focused on quality and those with high basket flexibility have a higher probability of becoming multichannel shoppers. The probability becomes even greater when a shopper is both quality oriented and has basket flexibility. Research limitations/implications: We focus on the fashion apparel market for a deeper understanding of multichannel usage of products with both experience and search features. Future research can investigate other industries for higher generalizability. Practical implications: Our research provides insights into multichannel fashion companies whose managements aim to effectively manage high-value customers who tend to use more channels when shopping. Specifically, an omnichannel marketing strategy should focus on capturing the quality-oriented and highly basket-flexible segment of consumers. Originality/value: Our study provides evidence that for products having high experiential as well as search features, quality-oriented and highly flexible shoppers engage more in multichannel shopping. Because these characteristics are related to the long-term value of customers, we provide the link between multichannel marketing and firm profitability in the context of the fashion industry. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Basket flexibility; Multichannel shopping; Omni-channel; Online shopping; Price consciousness; Quality consciousness; Showrooming; Webrooming",""

Design/methodology/approach: Mobile shopping platform characteristics were grouped into five dimensions: information, entertainment, personalization, visuality and economic benefits, and integrated in a model built on the Stimulus-organism-response theory to evaluate the influence on arousal (excitement) and pleasure, the relationship between arousal and pleasure and their impact on impulsive buying. In total, 303 valid questionnaires were collected from Chinese mobile shoppers. The research hypotheses were tested through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings: Entertainment and personalization had significant positive influences on consumer’s arousal and pleasure. Information, visuality and economic benefits had significant positive influences on consumer’s arousal. Arousal had a significant positive impact on consumer’s pleasure. Arousal and pleasure had significant positive influences on impulsive buying. Research limitations/implications: New insights can be obtained by investigating other consumer’s profiles. The model can be improved by including other mobile platform characteristics (product availability, platform ease-of-use and interactivity) and broadening the impulsive buying perspective through assessing flow experience and virtual atmosphere. Practical implications: Marketing strategies are proposed based on the mobile platform characteristics and considering Chinese customer values, for generating positive emotions and impulsive buying.

Design/methodology/approach: We conduct four experiments to test the hypotheses. Study 1a and study 1b provide the initial evidence that consumers strategically engage in differentiation in response to social exclusion in the present and in the future. Study 2 and study 3 replicate the basic interaction effect of social exclusion and temporal distance on product choices and test the underlying mechanism. Findings: We find that temporal distance affects consumer product choices through people’s coping strategies. When consumers are socially excluded, they are more likely to have a problem-solving tendency and more likely to choose utilitarian products. In contrast, when consumers imagine being socially excluded in the future, they are more likely to have to use emotions to solve problems and choose hedonic products. Originality/value: Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it deepens our understanding of the psychological drivers of social exclusion in consumer research. Second, it offers insights into understanding prior findings that document both problem-solving and emotion-regulating behavior in response to social exclusion. Third, by showing that social exclusion and temporal distance can influence the type of products selected, our findings contribute to a new stream of work that examines the impact of people’s fundamental desire for control on consumer behavior. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coping strategies; Hedonic product; Social exclusion; Temporal distance; Utilitarian product",""

Furthermore, brand experience is tested as a mediator of the relationship between perceived social media marketing activities and consumer-based brand equity, whereas co-creation behaviour is also examined as a moderator on the relationship between perceived social media marketing activities and brand experience. Design/methodology/approach: A structured survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to social media users from a large private university in Malaysia. A total of 253 valid responses were obtained. Hypotheses were tested employing partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results indicated that perceived social media marketing activities have a significant positive influence on consumer-based brand equity. In addition, brand experience mediates the relationship between perceived social media marketing activities and consumer-based brand equity. Surprisingly, co-creation behaviour was found to have no moderating effect on the relationship between perceived social media marketing activities and brand experience. Furthermore, using the PROCESS macro, we found that the indirect effect of perceived social media marketing activities on consumer-based brand equity through brand experience is not moderated by co-creation behaviour. Originality/value: This research further extended the current knowledge by demonstrating that the influence of perceived social media marketing activities on consumer-based brand equity is mediated by brand experience. Also, this research utilised the strength of PLS–SEM in dealing with higher-order constructs, allowing us to develop and test a parsimonious model that is useful for practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand experience; Co-creation behaviour; Consumer-based brand equity; Perceived social media marketing activities",""
"Identifying market structure to monitor product competition using a consumer-behavior-based intelligence model","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081406229&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2019-0497&partnerID=40&md5=67360f3f30b7ff4bb1782c629cf7ca91","Purpose: The objective of this paper is to propose a consumer-behavior-based intelligence (CBBI) model to identify market structure so as to monitor product competition. Competitive intelligence extracted from Chinese e-business clickstream data is exploited to examine the relevance of consumers' heterogeneous behavioral feedback, namely, click, tag-into-favorite, time-of-browsing, add-into-cart, and remove-from-cart, to visualize the competitive product market structure and to predict product-level sales. Design/methodology/approach: Our proposed CBBI model consists of visualization and prediction, which explore e-business clickstream data. We conduct the visualization and segmentation of market structure in the form of a perceptual map by employing K-means clustering algorithm and multidimensional scaling technique. Concurrently, we developed an updated Bayesian linear regression (BLR) to predict product-level sales by considering consumers' heterogeneous feedback. Our updated BLR specifically integrated the estimated knowledge of the previous periods to verify whether product sales are period-dependent due to the consumer memory effect in e-commerce, improving the conventional BLR of diffuse prior distribution setup in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Findings: Considering the performance of consumers' heterogeneous actions, the present research visualized three different segments of the competitive market structure in a perceptual map, and its horizontal axis is shown as a signal of the ascending trend of product sales. The previous five-day period was ascertained to be the best size of a time window for the consumer memory effect on product sales prediction. This hypothesis is supported by the concept that product sales are period-dependent. The results of the proposed updated BLR indicate that consumer tag-into-favorite, add-into-cart, and remove-from-cart feedback have positive impacts on product-level sales while click and time-of-browsing have the opposite effect. Originality/value: While the identified competitive product market structure elaborates consumer heterogeneous feedback toward alternative product choices, this paper contributes by extending those homogeneous consumer preferences-related marketing studies. The perceptual map's configuration in respect to period-dependent product sales facilitates the effective inclusion of consumer behavior application in product sales prediction research in e-commerce. This paper helps sellers and retailers better comprehend the impacts of heterogeneous feedback and the consumer memory effect on the degree of competition in the form of product sales. The research results also offer a managerial implication about shaping the competitive edge by conducting different product management strategies in e-commerce platforms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bayesian linear regression; Clickstream; Competitive intelligence; Consumer memory effect; Market structure; Perceptual maps; Product competition; Product sales",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study's core findings are based on four separate focus group discussions with B2B salespeople. Responses were recorded and analysed according to the manifest content of the discussions. These focus groups were preceded by, and followed up with, two other enquiries that sought the perspectives of B2B buyers. Findings: Intended for use as a learning tool for aspiring B2B salespeople and their instructors, a new typology of four generic potential post-decision ‘cognitive states’ is proposed, which, depending on the scenario at hand, will likely reflect the buyer's mindset. Research limitations/implications: The generalisation of findings may be somewhat limited because the focus groups were drawn from a convenience sample totalling just 20 practitioners. Some participants might also have felt slightly constrained, leading to opinions that are subject to bias. Practical implications: Examples of differing buying scenarios are profiled and explained from the perspective of their implications for salespeople. Suggestions as to how sellers can best accommodate the post-decision cognitive states experienced by their buyers are delineated. Originality/value: Conventional wisdom suggests that post-purchase cognitive dissonance is the sole ‘cognitive state’ towards which a B2B salesperson needs to be attuned to for the purpose of taking some form of accommodating action. However, this study indicates that three other states relating to the aftermath of a buyer's decision, whether a purchase is made or not, also merit attention. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business purchasing; Cognitive consonance; Cognitive dissonance; Professional selling; Sales education; Sales training",""

The present study aims to investigate the determinants of compulsive buying, which are conceptualized as impulsive and obsessive–compulsive buying, and the mediation effect of brand attachment. Design/methodology/approach: Using purposive sampling, a self-administered questionnaire was completed by 600 young consumers in Malaysia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The results show that materialism, utilitarian value, and brand attachment are positively related to impulsive buying, while materialism, hedonic value, and brand attachment have a positive effect on obsessive–compulsive buying.

Using cross-sectional data, 262 sets of valid questionnaires were used to perform the statistical analysis for the measurement and structural model using partial least squares equation modelling (PLS-SEM) path modelling. Findings: We position our study by raising the pertinent question of “Seriously, Conspicuous Consumption?” to establish a clear understanding of whether Malaysian Gen Y individuals are conspicuous consumers and, if they are, which of the three values matter the most. In order to answer the question of whether Malaysian Gen Y engages in conspicuous consumption, we arrive at an understanding that, given multi-value orientations, conspicuous behaviour can be motivated and impacted by one value orientation and constrained by others. Hence, value orientation offers an insightful explanation of one specific type of consumer behaviour in the context of Asia as an emerging global market. Thus, our study provides two key theoretically significant findings. In general, our findings provide insights into how the multi-value orientations (i.e. cultural, material and religious orientations) contribute to several bodies of literature—namely, conspicuous consumption, international marketing and transcultural marketing. The results revealed that collectivism and materialism were positively and significantly related to conspicuous consumption. Uncertainty avoidance, although significant, had a negative relationship with conspicuous consumption. The other values (masculinity, power distance and religious values) were not significantly related to conspicuous consumption. Research limitations/implications: Purchasing luxury goods is becoming an emergent phenomenon in Asia, particularly among young consumers. This paper provides marketing managers, particularly brand owners, with practical and realisable examples of how to plan and execute their marketing plans. A more profound understanding of this relationship may also serve to aid marketing managers in devising more focused marketing strategies and thus allocate marketing resources more efficiently. Hence, marketers could develop an effective communication strategy so that the target consumers will be aware of their goods because the purchase of luxury goods is likely to be motivated by social, cultural and personal factors. Originality/value: This article examines the impact of value orientations on conspicuous consumption behaviour in Malaysian Gen Y consumers. The model proposed in this study is useful in predicting conspicuous consumption among Gen Y. By identifying the factors influencing this emergent type of consumer behaviour, global retailers will be informed about this particular market segmentation in terms of its preferences and desires. The article discusses the research findings and concludes with managerial implications and limitations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Conspicuous consumption; Culture; Generation Y; Luxury brands; Materialism; Religiosity",""
"The impact of advertising self-presentation style on customer purchase intention","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075067873&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0150&partnerID=40&md5=8b4bb30b6f86b61376f68416e3b33349","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose the self-presentation styles of advertising influence consumer self-image, which in turn influence purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Using virtual brands as stimuli in a series of experiments, this study collects data on consumer self-image and purchase intention in the conditions of different advertising styles. Findings: While consumer self-image mediates the relationship between advertising self-presentation style and purchase intention, the consumption situation (public vs private) moderates the relationship between self-presentation style, consumer self-image and purchase intention. That is, self-enhancing advertising promotes customers’ ideal self, which in turn increases their purchase intention for publicly consumed products, whereas self-deprecating advertising solicits customers’ real self, which in turn increases their purchase intention for privately consumed products. Practical implications: This study informs product/brand managers and marketers of the importance of aligning the self-presentation style of advertising with the consumption situation of the product being advertised. Originality/value: Based on self-consistency theory, this study not only finds a relationship between the self-presentation style of advertising and purchase intention, but also uncovers the mediating role of self-image in this relationship. Furthermore, the relationship chain of “self-presentation style of advertising – self-image – purchase intention” is moderated by the consumption situation of the product. This is one of the first studies to explore the intricacies of these relationships. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Product advertising; Purchase intention; Self-deprecation advertisement; Self-Image",""
"Emerging masculinities in Chinese luxury social media marketing","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075444151&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2018-0256&partnerID=40&md5=cac0761934cf43bec2cc6020444da1ab","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate masculinity in Chinese social media marketing for global luxury fashion brands through two studies. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 compares physical characteristics of males in visually oriented US (Instagram) and Chinese (Weibo) social media posts promoting global luxury fashion magazine brands (e.g. Vogue, Cosmopolitan, GQ and Esquire). Study 2 examines the prevalence of and Chinese consumers’ responses (reposts, comments and likes) to different masculinities depicted in luxury fashion brand-sponsored Weibo posts. Findings: Male portrayals for Chinese audiences feature more characteristics associated with emerging East Asian hybrid masculinities – “Little Fresh Meat” (LFM) and “Old Grilled Meat” (OGM) – than associated with global or regional hegemonic masculinity (i.e. the scholarly Wén and action-oriented Wu). Wén remains common in social media posts for luxury fashion goods, but LFM and OGM engender more consumer responses. Practical implications: Chinese luxury fashion marketing depicts masculinity more similarly to other East Asian marketing than to Western marketing. Some luxury fashion brands are struggling for acceptance among Chinese youth. Luxury fashion marketers should incorporate hybrid rather than hegemonic masculinities to prompt more favorable responses among Chinese consumers, especially younger female target markets. Originality/value: Growing female occupational and consumer power and shifting male employment from blue-collar to white-collar jobs have influenced media portrayals of masculinity. Social media marketing for luxury fashion brands demonstrates the prevalence and appeal of hybrid masculinities in China. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Hegemonic and hybrid masculinity; International advertising; Luxury fashion brands; Luxury fashion marketing; Male gender roles; Marketing in China; Masculinity; Social media marketing",""

"How manufacturer brand erosion shapes consumer assortment perceptions","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076883406&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2019-0235&partnerID=40&md5=432617048c2811e5647367c0becbef38","Purpose: Recently, the popularity of store brands has resulted in some manufacturer brands being removed from shelves. The current literature lacks empirical work on the effect of manufacturer brand erosion on consumer assortment perception and repatronage intention. Based on signalling theory, the purpose of this paper is to manufacturer brands play a signalling role and contend that manufacturer brand erosion has detrimental effects on the assortment perception due to reduced signalling efficacy. Design/methodology/approach: A 3 (low manufacturer brand erosion vs high manufacturer brand erosion vs manufacturer brand dominance) ×2 (assortment size: small vs large) between-subject experiment was conducted. Findings: Manufacturer brand erosion exerts a negative effect on assortment attractiveness and consumers’ repatronage intention; the greater the erosion, the larger the negative effect. These negative effects are mediated by reduced consumer perceptions of assortment quality and variety. A large (vs small) assortment size attenuates the negative effect of manufacturer brand erosion by improving perceived assortment quality. Practical implications: To engage in strategic positioning through efficient assortment management, retailers should cooperate with brand manufacturers, instead of promoting their own private labels. Nevertheless, a large assortment dominated by store brands signals that the retailer has built a strong private brand, which in turn gains a differentiation advantage. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to take the signalling perspective and explicitly investigate whether and how manufacturer brand erosion exerts a significant impact on assortment perception. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Assortment quality; Assortment variety; Manufacturer band erosion; Repatronage intention; Store brand",""

Since purchase activity goes through the actional phase which has not been studied yet, the purpose of this paper is to explore the characteristics of the actional mindset compared with those of the planning and deliberative mindsets. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts three experiments to examine whether the implemental mindset can be differentiated from the actional mindset via recalls and perceptual processing measures. Findings: The findings provide evidences that the actional mindset is different from the implemental mindset, and the planning phase is associated more with broad-mindedness, whereas the actional phase is with narrow-mindedness. Research limitations/implications: Manipulation of the actional mindset can be extended to real purchases in physical shopping spaces, and various choice objects could be tested with a larger number of participants. Practical implications: To boost the shopping momentum effect, marketers should put customers into an actional mindset by leading them to show their decisions such as carrying a shopping bag and uploading their purchased items. To avoid overbuying, customers should stay in planning mindsets without verbalizing their decisions. Putting goods into virtual shopping baskets in online shopping could be a good way to avoid overbuying.

The present research examines the effects of different types of donation strategies (frequency-focused vs. amount-focused). Design/methodology/approach: Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 provides initial evidence to our prediction that a frequency-focused strategy is beneficial for luxury (vs. non-luxury) brands to leverage their positive brand evaluations. Study 2 further replicates this using a different brand and establishes the underlying mechanism. Findings: Findings show that a frequency-focused strategy is beneficial for luxury (vs. non-luxury) brands to leverage their positive brand evaluations. This is because a frequency-focused strategy makes consumers perceive the luxury brand's commitment to help, which in turn reduces consumers’ skepticism toward their CSR activities.

Design/methodology/approach: A convenience sample of Australian A-League soccer fans completed a paper-and-pencil, self-administered survey to evaluate their team on the focal constructs. A total of 207 participants were recruited from a major Australian east-coast university. Findings: Using partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), the study found that fan engagement influences both team brand image and cumulative fan satisfaction, while team brand image also influences cumulative fan satisfaction, and both of these constructs influence attitudinal loyalty and behavioural loyalty. The moderating role of enduring involvement was also found for two relationships: team brand image → attitudinal loyalty and team brand image → behavioural loyalty, along with a mediating role of attitudinal loyalty. Originality/value: This study increases our understanding of the reasons why soccer fans are committed to and exhibit fan-related behaviours for a team, thus contributing to the sports-marketing literature on the relationships amongst fan engagement, team brand image, cumulative fan satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty and behavioural loyalty, along with the moderating role of enduring involvement.

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires were distributed conveniently to urban customers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Altogether 658 useable questionnaires were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics, general linear model of univariate analysis of variance and structural equation modeling. Findings: Quality, price, popularity and status signaling represent the main motivating factors for their brand choices of counterfeit luxury products among the two country groups of customers. As expected, customers' social status insecurity influences their ATPCLP, but not their status consumption. However, status consumption does positively moderates the relationship of their social status insecurity and their ATPCLP. Furthermore, customers' value consciousness influences their ATPCLP and moderates the relationship between status consumption and ATPCLP. The impact of status consumption on ATPCLP depends on the importance one places on the value of the products. However, the authors found no differences in social status insecurity, status consumption and value consciousness, on their ATPCLP among the customers. Some implications and limitations of the results are discussed. Research limitations/implications: The use of convenience sampling and mainly college students (in Saudi Arabia) as respondents represent the main limitations of this study. Practical implications: The practical implication of this study is to discourage the purchasing of counterfeit luxury products in their respective country Malaysian marketers need to stress that their genuine products are of top quality while Saudi marketers need to stress that their genuine products are of well-known brands that are sourced from well-known countries of origin. Besides, Malaysian marketers need to offer genuine products that are not overly priced or ones that indicate value-for-money while Saudi marketers need to convey the message that their genuine products could help enhance or uplift their customers' social status. In this study, the authors did not find any support for differences in ATPCLP between the two rather different Muslim-majority countries. This could be due to the fact that the majority of the respondents were females in their mid-20s and that both countries have a growing number of young customer base, which makes them particularly attractive target customers for branded/luxury products and, at the same time, easy preys to luxury products counterfeiters. This implies that there are still more opportunities for academics to study the topic or related topics in the future. Originality/value: As far as the authors know, no one has undertaken a comparative study involving two very different Islamic majority countries (more conservative mono-cultural and mono-ethnicity Saudi Arabia versus less conservative multicultural and multi-ethnicity Malaysia) before. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counterfeit luxury products; Malaysia; Saudi Arabia; Social status insecurity; Status consumption; Value consciousness",""

However, little is known about the effect of group characteristics on brands. To partially fill this gap, this study examines how group characteristics influence brand loyalty from the perspective of social identity theory. Specifically, by collecting data from an online survey, this paper investigates the effects of group similarity, group receptivity and group involvement on brand loyalty, the mediating role of community identification and the moderating effect of tenure in a community. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 482 brand community members were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that group similarity, group receptivity and group involvement increase brand loyalty; furthermore, the effect is mediated by community identification. Moreover, group receptivity is more effective in fostering community identification of short-tenure members, whereas group similarity plays a more important role for long-tenure members.

Online surveys were conducted with 421 consumers in China. Findings: The results indicate that consumers with individualistic values show favorable dispositions toward Japanese brands because of weak CA and strong COS values. In addition, the study found that younger consumers also harbor weak CA and do not avoid Japanese brands because of it. However, younger consumers were not found to be more cosmopolitan than their older counterparts. Originality/value: Our findings suggest that the modernization and individualization of a society can have impacts on consumer values in emerging Asia and that changes in consumer values among young and individualistic consumers can lead to increased preferences for foreign brands, especially brands from a country with historical animosity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asia; Consumer animosity; Consumer cosmopolitanism; Individualism; Modernization",""

The purpose of the paper is to address the following research questions: (1) What are the optimal pricing policies and green strategies of the dynamic decentralized supply chain with the competitive or supportive retail service? (2) How does the dynamic consumer's perception of green product affect these equilibrium solutions? Design/methodology/approach: The paper establishes the dynamic game models and then derives a firm's instantaneous and steady-state feedback equilibrium solutions in three scenarios as follows: (1) the integrated supply chain; (2) the decentralized supply chain with competitive retail service and (3) the decentralized supply chain with supportive retail service. Finally, we conduct numerical analyses to compare the firm's instantaneous and steady-state equilibrium solutions and profit in the three scenarios. Findings: The theoretical and numerical analysis results suggest that the supportive retail service is less inefficient than the competitive retail service in the decentralized supply chain and that the types of retail service have no influence on the green strategy. Moreover, a firm's myopia leads to lowering the greenness degree, retail service level and severe price competition, resulting in economic losses. Consumers’ initial perception of greenness degree determines whether the retailer should adopt the skimming pricing strategy or penetration pricing strategy. Furthermore, only when consumers’ perception of greenness degree is higher than a threshold, will the manufacturer produce green product with positive greenness degree. Originality/value: This is one of few studies on the effect of different types of retail service on horizontal competition in green supply chain.

In particular, it examines when affect can directly influence satisfaction and when such an impact is mediated by perceived service quality. Design/methodology/approach: This research explores consumers’ consumption goals in three different service contexts, i.e., a primarily pleasure-seeking hedonic service context, a primarily arousal-seeking hedonic service context and a utilitarian (non-affect-seeking) service context. Findings: Results from two studies show that the primary affective consumption goal determines which specific affect can directly influence satisfaction. Other desirable non-primary affect influences satisfaction through the mediation of perceived service quality. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on the service contexts in which consumers’ primary consumption goals vary. Further research may focus on the priority and strength of a consumer’s various consumption goals in different services and study how the priority and strength of different consumption goals determine how affect influences quality and satisfaction. Practical implications: The study provides several insights for service providers and retailers to recognize that consumers’ primary consumption goals may vary in different service contexts, for different consumers, and even at different usage situations. Accordingly, marketers need to develop different strategies for consumer with different goal pursuit in services. Originality/value: While the literature has documented that consumer affect influences consumer satisfaction in general, it is unclear how different consumption goals influence the impact of affect on satisfaction. This research contributes to the consumer goal literature by demonstrating the importance of primary consumption goals in the post-consumption evaluation of services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affect; Arousal; Consumption goals; Perceived service quality; Pleasure; Satisfaction",""

Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses were tested using a mixed-model experimental design of three between-subjects factors, including manipulations of homophily (high vs low), consensus (high vs low), and firm crisis response (accommodative vs defensive), and one repeated measure within-subjects factor of attitude toward the company at three different points in time (A0, A1, A2). Data were collected from 328 Thai participants who were randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. Findings: High homophily and high consensus online social media network conditions worsen the negative impact of NeWOM on consumer attitudes. However, high homophily and high consensus strengthen the positive influence of an accommodative response in regaining favorable attitude toward the company. Low homophily and low consensus negate the impact of the firm's defensive response, preventing any further deterioration of attitude toward the company. Practical implications: Marketers need to understand the relational patterns among members of online social media networks in order to assess the extent to which consumers are influenced by others in the network. In doing so, the firm can better anticipate and manage the impact of NeWOM and can launch an appropriate response strategy that optimizes the recovery, or minimizes the deterioration, of lost company image and reputation.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct three experimental studies with two levels of SRC (high vs low) × two evaluation modes (joint evaluation (JE) vs separate evaluation (SE)) between-subjects design. The dependent variable is purchase intent toward the CRM-enhanced product. Findings: The results indicate that consumers with high SRC are more likely than those with low SRC to purchase a CRM-enhanced product when two products are presented side by side (JE). However, consumers’ SRC level does not impact purchase intention when they see only one product (SE) independently (Study 1). The authors confirm that the proposed effect is mediated by perceived price fairness toward the product (Studies 2 and 3).

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a single factor (close social distance vs great social distance vs control group) using a between-subjects experimental design. The social distance was manipulated by the presence (i.e. a close social distance) or absence (i.e. a great social distance) of a consumer scene in a craftsmanship video shown on social media. The control group watched a video with non-craftsmanship content. Then, brand experience, perceived luxury and purchase intentions were measured. Findings: The results showed that the control group perceived less luxury and had lower brand experiences and purchase intentions than the group that watched the video without a consumer scene. In addition, participants who watched the craftsmanship video that included a consumer scene (i.e. a close social distance) had stronger brand experiences than those who watched the video without the scene (i.e. a great social distance). The brand experience increased perceived luxury and purchase intentions. Originality/value: By manipulating social distance and providing better brand experiences in social media, experiential marketing allows luxury brands to reconcile two apparently incompatible goals: maintaining an exclusive image while increasing purchase intentions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construal level theory; Craftsmanship; Experiential marketing; Social media",""

Design/methodology/approach: The primary data was collected from the customers of 17 day spas throughout Thailand. EFA and SEM were used to analyse the data and test the interrelationships among service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value, perceived switching costs and behavioural intentions. A third-order conceptualisation of service quality is also included in the modelling framework. Findings: Customer satisfaction is the key determinant of behavioural intentions. Service quality and perceived value are two important descriptors of customer satisfaction. Service quality is the most important determinant of customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is the most significant antecedent of behavioural intentions. Service quality is a significant determinant of perceived value and perceived switching costs. Customer satisfaction plays a partial mediating role on the relationship between service quality and behavioural intentions and between perceived value and behavioural intentions. Originality/value: There is a conceptual gap in the literature as no published empirical research on the day spa industry has comprehensively modelled the behavioural intentions of day spa customers. The comprehensive hierarchical modelling approach used in this study provides a complete and integrative analysis of the constructs under investigation in a day spa context and closes the research gap. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comprehensive hierarchical modelling; Service quality; Thai day spas",""
"An alternative view of the millennial green product purchase: the roles of online product review and self-image congruence","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082183609&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2019-0612&partnerID=40&md5=71e1950bfe7d213b9fd71a0da6ad9a4a","Purpose: The paper aims to provide an alternative view to green consumption behaviors of millennials. In fact, studies on green consumption have usually assumed a common attitude–behavior model for different generations. Instead, the view in this paper highlights two other constructs, online product review and self-image congruence, as the key antecedents to the behavior among the generation. Design/methodology/approach: To test our proposed model, an online survey with a sample of 305 millennials in Vietnam was conducted. The sample shares similar demographic features with the millennials in the country. The data were collected in popular social networks and then validated before being analyzed with AMOS. Findings: The model analysis results provided supports for the key roles of online product review and self-image congruence among millennials. In particular, online product review was found to have both direct and mediational impacts on green product purchase intention. Self-image congruence was also found to be a key antecedent to the intention. Research limitations/implications: The model in this paper only examined the purchase intention. Moreover, only a single sample of millennials in Vietnam was investigated. Future research may incorporate the green consumption behavior to enhance the external validity and/or directly compare models for different generations or across countries to further confirm the differential generational patterns. Practical implications: The paper includes recommendations for managers to use the online channels and to promote green product self-matching among millennials. These recommendations are not contrary to but go beyond the frequently suggested ones for attitude-related training or communication campaigns for green consumption. Originality/value: This paper fills an identified gap to provide an alternative view to green consumption behaviors of millennials. Different from the common attitude–behavior view in green consumption research, two key constructs of online product review and self-image congruence are highlighted for the generation in this paper. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Green purchase; Millennial; Online product review; Self-image congruence; Sustainable consumption",""
"Influence of virtual CSR gamification design elements on customers’ continuance intention of participating in social value co-creation: The mediation effect of psychological benefit","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078281988&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0213&partnerID=40&md5=aa5f6dcbb4e2827595be7110952cc983","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of gamification design elements of virtual corporate social responsibility (CSR) game on customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation and the mediation effect of psychological benefit. Design/methodology/approach: Three scenario simulation experiments of the between-subjects design were conducted to examine the influencing mechanism of reward mechanism of virtual CSR game on customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation. Findings: The findings indicated that: there are significant differences between the effect of behavior-based reward and result-based reward on customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation; the psychological benefit plays a moderating role between game reward mechanism and customers’ intention to continuously participate in social value co-creation; the game narrative mode plays a moderating role in the influence of game reward mechanism on customers’ intention to continuously participate in social value co-creation; the background for game placement moderates the interactions of game narrative mode and game reward mechanism on customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation, namely there is significant interaction of gamification design elements on psychological benefit and customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation. Research limitations/implications: This research has the following limitations. First, restricted by research conditions, the game scene, as the experiment material, can only be exposed to the participants in the form of text, thus customers’ psychological benefit (especially the entertainment experience) may be affected. Second, theoretical argument and literature support were not enough when the authors put forward the research hypotheses, due to the lack of research on the application of gamification in the CSR field. Third, considering the complexity, the authors took the psychological benefit as a unidimensional variable, in this research; it may be funnier to divide it into three variables. Finally, because the game design elements form into a virtual customer environment that jointly influences customers’ psychological benefit, the method of qualitative comparative analysis can be considered in future research. Practical implications: It provides insights for marketers on the planning and design of a CSR strategy. The conclusions of this research have a certain guiding significance to the formulation of CSR strategy and the practice of social value co-creation. First, enterprises can apply gamification to the design of virtual CSR projects to promote customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation. Second, on the consideration of customers’ psychological benefit, enterprises should reasonably match such game design elements as game placement background, game narrative mode and game reward mechanism, when designing a virtual CSR game, so as to promote customers continuously participating in a virtual CSR project. Social implications: Virtual CSR projects are in fact the activities that enterprise co-create social value with their stakeholders. So, the research on customers’ continuous participation in virtual CSR projects is helpful for increasing social welfare. Originality/value: This study confirms the effect of reward mechanism of a virtual CSR game on customers’ continuance intention to participate in social value co-creation from the perspective of customer psychological benefit. It also provides insights for marketers on the planning and design of a CSR strategy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance participation intention; Game reward mechanism; Psychological benefits; Social value co-creation; Virtual CSR game",""

Design/methodology/approach: Using an online survey, the study collects data in Hong Kong from 214 experienced social-media users, as indicated by their consumption of a durable technology product, a smartphone. We used partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS–SEM) to test the links between social-media marketing elements, consumer–brand engagement and brand knowledge. Findings: The results reveal that interaction, electronic word-of-mouth and trendiness are the key elements directly influencing consumer brand engagement, then strengthening brand awareness and brand knowledge. This contrasts with the non-significant results found for the influence of entertainment and customisation on consumer–brand engagement. Research limitations/implications: Having cross-sectional nature, the study focuses on one single product, smartphones, at one location, Hong Kong. Future research may enhance the generalisability of the findings by replication in other countries with diverse cultures, such as countries in Latin America and Africa and examine other industries and other products, such as the service sector and convenience products with a low involvement level. Practical implications: Marketers may strengthen consumer–brand engagement by using content that is trendy, along with encouraging interaction and positive EWOM on social-media platforms, in order to build strong and positive brand knowledge in consumers' minds. Originality/value: This study contributes to the branding literature by providing an understanding of the role of social-media marketing elements in the brand-building process. Social media is a marketing channel recognised by its effectiveness in communicating brand-related information and its role as a means to stimulate consumers' brand engagement and brand knowledge. However, how effective these elements are for these purposes remains to be established. By empirically testing a theoretical model, this study confirms that specific social-media marketing elements, namely interaction, EWOM and trendiness, are critical drivers in the brand-building process in Hong Kong. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand awareness; Brand image; Brand knowledge; Consumer–brand engagement; Hong Kong; Social media marketing",""

The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing customer participation in trading stamp campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: Through an extensive literature review, a research model was proposed and its validity evaluated through structural equation modeling. An empirical investigation using a questionnaire survey was conducted among Taiwanese consumers. Findings: The functional value of premiums and the enjoyment value of a campaign will directly entice a customer to participate, whereas a customer’s purchase intention will be enhanced due to the functional and emotional values of the premiums, social influence of the campaign and motivation to help others obtain premiums through gift-giving. However, the perceived effort to accumulate stamps will inhibit a customer from participating. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of sampling bias may limit the applicability of the findings. Practical implications: Effective trading stamp campaigns can be implemented by the careful design of premiums to emphasize their functional and emotional values and by emphasizing enjoyment and social values of the campaign. Originality/value: This study aims to pioneer the application of the consumption value model in discussing trading stamp campaigns to fill the gap in marketing research. Another goal is to help retailers design successful campaigns. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Campaign evaluation; Consumption values; Convenience store; Promotional premium; Promotions management; Sales promotion",""

Drawing on the knowledge–attitude–behavior (KAB) model or practice, this study aims to predict Chinese consumers' purchase intention of ethical fashion by employing and extending the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach: The extended TPB model incorporates knowledge of ethical fashion and trust in the fashion industry and two critical variables in ethical fashion literature to explain the purchase intention of ethical fashion. Primary data from 245 Chinese respondents were collected in 2019. The model was tested and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Results show that the extended TPB model has higher predictability than the original TPB model. Attitude toward ethical fashion and subjective norm significantly predicts purchase intention while perceived behavioral control (PBC) does not. In addition, trust of ethical fashion is positively related to attitude toward ethical fashion and purchase intention, whereas knowledge of ethical fashion plays a significant role in predicting trust and the three TPB factors. The subjective norm was found to have the most significant impact on consumers' intention to purchase ethical fashion, which shows that social pressure from one individual's reference group is the most dominant factor in forming consumer's purchase intention on ethical fashion. Originality/value: The findings enrich the past literature on ethical fashion that trusting belief is a salient determinant of consumers' attitude toward ethical fashion and purchase intention of ethical fashion products. The findings also supported the applicability of KAB and TPB in the domain of ethical consumption in the context of a developing country. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethical fashion; Knowledge; SEM; Theory of planned behavior; Trust",""

We propose a research framework to empirically test the influence and interaction of factors, including entertainment (ENT), and interaction (INT) through the effect of trust (TR), and perceived value (PV) as mediators on purchase intention (PI). Design/methodology/approach: The study employs an online survey to collect data. We collect 301 qualified questionnaires and employ structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed model. The research findings enrich our understanding of the mediating role of TR and PV. Trust and perceived value significantly mediate the relationship between SMM factors and PI during initial stages of decision-making toward purchasing airline products and services. Findings: Research findings provide support for most hypotheses regarding the significant influence of the variables proposed in the model. Furthermore, trust mediates the relationship between two of the SMM factors (INT and ENT) and purchase intention. Notably, perceived value mediates the link between entertainment and purchase intention. Originality/value: This study successfully offers a model to examine the influence of social media marketing on Indonesian consumers’ purchasing intentions of airline products and services. Social media marketing components progressively impact the fundamentals of purchase intention, creating a new marketing communication style. These changes generate new opportunities and challenges for companies. This study provides a better understanding of how social media factors influence Indonesian consumers’ initial decision to purchase airline products and services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Perceived value; purchase intention; Social media marketing; Trust",""

A conceptual model is constructed to test how congruity between online advertisements, advertised products and online videos impact consumer post-viewing attitudes via processing fluency. Design/methodology/approach: An online experiment with eight versions of mock video sections (with embedded online video advertisements) was conducted. The study is a 2 (type of appeal: informational vs emotional) × 2 (Ad-Video congruity: congruent vs incongruent) × 2 (Product-Video congruity: congruent vs incongruent) full-factorial between-subject design. A total of 252 valid responses were collected for data analysis. Findings: Results show that congruity is related to the improvement of processing fluency only for informational ads/videos. The positive effect of Ad-Video congruity on processing fluency is only significant for informational appeals but not emotional appeal. Similarly, the positive effects of Product-Video congruity on processing fluency are only significant for informational appeals but not emotional appeal. Involvement has been found to be positively related to processing fluency too. Processing fluency has a positive impact on the attitudes toward the ads, advertised products and videos. Research limitations/implications: The finding that congruity is related to the improvement of processing fluency only for informational ads/videos extends the existing literature by identifying the type of appeal as a boundary condition. Practical implications: Both brand managers and online video platform owners should monitor and operationalize the content and appeal congruity, especially for informational ads on a large scale to improve consumers’ responses. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the effects of Ad-Video and Product-Video congruity of embedded advertisements on video sharing platforms.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were amassed using retrospective experience sampling. The hypothesized relationships were examined utilizing structural equation modeling. Findings: The results demonstrate that the perceived quality of the friend-interaction (e.g. [non-]verbal online interaction with friends), neighboring customer-interaction (e.g. [non-]verbal online interaction with stranger users) and the audience-interaction (crowding) has a significant impact upon customer participation intention, mediated by customer–firm affection. Research limitations/implications: This research was performed in the situation of online mass services (e.g. massively multiplayer online role-playing games). Future studies could extend the findings by conducting further studies across various types of services and by comparing results across different categories of mass services (e.g. hedonic vs utilitarian). Practical implications: Online mass service marketers should focus on facilitating all three types of online customer-to-customer interactions (i.e. friend-, neighboring customer-, and audience-interaction). For example, online game developers may need to require users to communicate and collaborate with not only friends but also stranger users to progress and succeed in online multiplayer games.

The purpose of this paper is to further explore this premise in a practical study, using a psychometric assessment of macro and micro country images by ascertaining the nature of differences in macro and micro images of leading exporters, the USA and China, for consumers in Malaysia, a top import destination of US and Chinese goods; the images of Malaysian goods were similarly assessed. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a systematic sample, with questionnaires distributed to adult respondents using a street intercept. Interviewers asked every other passer-by to fill out a questionnaire, and stood in close proximity to address any questions from respondents. The study hypothesized that there is a significant difference between country macro and micro image, respectively for the USA, China and Malaysia, and that there is significant relationship between country macro image and country micro image in each country, respectively, USA, China and Malaysia. Findings: The study found support for the reliability of existing country micro and macro image measures, and further refined them for increased validity. The study compared between the countries and found significant differences on both macro and micro dimensions of country image. The US scored highest on technological research, high quality products, standards of living, labor costs, welfare system, industrialization, civilian government, development, literacy, free-market system and democracy, followed by China on technological research, industrialization, development and free-market system, with Malaysia scoring higher on product quality, labor costs, welfare system, civilian government is civilian/non-military, literacy, free-market system and democracy. Research limitations/implications: A broader study of countries that share geopolitical and cultural similarities might offer additional insights into country macro and micro image. Practical implications: The study cautions marketers to assess the acceptance of their products in the context of their country’s macro and micro image perceptions in target markets, and steer those perceptions in a manner that would be beneficial to their marketing efforts. Originality/value: The conceptualization of the macro and micro aspects of country image has been one of the less studied dimensions of country image. This study is the first to address these dimensions from an emerging-market perspective, suggesting that, at the macro level, country perceptions regarding technology, economy, and politics contribute to an overall impression of the country, which would then influence the desirability of its products originating there. For the micro country image, products from countries perceived as innovative, excelling in product design, and producing prestigious products, are likely to be perceived as desirable. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Country image; Country macro image; Country micro image; Country of origin",""

The conceptual model encompasses four elements (subjective norms, perceived behaviour control, moral norms and attitude) and one consumer response (purchase intention). Design/methodology/approach: The current research employs a questionnaire survey and two experiments. In Study 1, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling with 485 consumers in China. Study 2 employed a single-factor, two-condition (morally engaged vs control), between-subject design. Findings: The findings reveal that the morally extended TPB framework is more applicable in predicting Chinese consumers' green purchase intentions than the original TPB model. Attitude plays the most significant role in predicting purchase intentions, and moral norms prove to be a mediator of the relationship between the original construct of subjective norms and purchase intentions. The findings further revealed that moral norms comprise the underlying mechanism of the relationship between subjective norms and attitude. Originality/value: This study therefore expands the TPB theory by including moral norms. Moreover, it contributes to the literature by clarifying the direct, indirect and total effects of each TPB element on the purchase intentions towards green products.

The literature offers two main approaches to such predictions: stochastic modeling efforts represented by Pareto/NBD and machine learning represented by neural network analysis. As these two approaches have been developed and applied in parallel, this study systematically compares the two approaches in their prediction accuracy and defines the relatively appropriate implementation scenarios of each model. Design/methodology/approach: By designing a rolling exploration scheme with moving calibration/holdout combinations of customer data, this research explores the two approaches' relative performance by first utilizing three real world datasets and then a wide range of simulated datasets. Findings: The empirical result indicates that neither approach is dominant and identifies patterns of relative applicability between the two. Such patterns are consistent across the empirical and the simulated datasets. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by bridging two previously parallel analytical approaches applicable to customer base predictions. No prior research has rendered a comprehensive comparison on the two approaches' relative performance in customer base predictions as this study has done. The patterns identified in the two approaches' relative prediction performance provide practitioners with a clear-cut menu upon selecting approaches for customer base predictions. The findings further urge marketing scientists to reevaluate prior modeling efforts during the past half century by assessing what can be replaced by black boxes such as NNA and what cannot. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Activity prediction; Neural network analysis; Pareto/NBD; Rolling comparison; Transaction frequency",""
"Path to discontinuance of pervasive mobile games: the case of Pokémon Go in Australia","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085704767&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2019-0710&partnerID=40&md5=ed41ba9552663f9b124c29d6ad66b44c","Purpose: Pervasive mobile games (PMG) expand the game context into the real world, spatially, temporally and socially. The most prominent example to date is Pokémon Go (PGo), which in the first 12 months of its launch achieved over 800 million downloads and huge revenues for Pokémon, its majority owner Nintendo, and its developer Niantic. Like many mobile apps and innovative services, PGo's revenue structure requires continual usage (through in-app purchases and sponsorships) as it is free to download. Thus, as many players discontinued after initial adoption, substantial drops in Nintendo's share price occurred alongside the damage to brand equity. Such a case highlights the need to extend scholarship beyond traditional ‘adoption’ and begin to truly illustrate and explain the consumer behaviour phenomenon of ‘discontinuance’, particularly in the emerging and lucrative domain of PMGs. Design/methodology/approach: Like many emerging marketing channels before it, large-scale discontinuance of PGo occurred and still remains unexplained in the academic literature. Herein, we address this shortcoming through a consumer case study methodology analysing a variety of data sources pertaining to PGo in Australia. Findings: The development of the P2D_PMG model provides a new conceptual framework to illustrate the distinct forms discontinuance manifests in, for the first time. Scholarly rigour of the P2D_PMGs is achieved through validating and extending Soliman and Rinta-Kahila's (2020) framework for ‘discontinuance’ through its five forms. These forms are revealed as access and on-boarding (rejection), disconfirmation and hedonic adaptation (regressive discontinuance), technological, social, third parties, and personal issues (quitting), re-occurrences of hedonic adaptation (temporary), and alternatives and iterations (replacement). Originality/value: Conceptual contributions are made in developing a model to explain what drives PMG discontinuance and when it occurs. This is particularly crucial for products with revenue structures built on continual usage, instead of initial adoption. In deriving data from actual players and aggregate user behaviour over an extended time period, the innovative case study methodology validates new discontinuance research in a manner other methods cannot. Managerial implications highlight the importance of CX, alpha/beta testing, promotion and research, gameplay design and collaboration/community engagement. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Consumer behaviour; Discontinuance; Pervasive mobile games; Pokémon go",""
"Impact of CSR news reports on firm value","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079445936&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2019-0352&partnerID=40&md5=068d7718c37a974c5239474375a146c7","Purpose: This study clarifies the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) news reports and firm value and identifies the mechanisms that constitute this relationship. Specifically, it identifies the roles of word of mouth (WOM) and traditional advertising in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The data set used for the analysis covers 77 firms in Korea from 2012 to 2015. The random-effects model is applied to verify three hypotheses. Using a three-step regression analysis and the Sobel test, this study reveals the roles of WOM and advertising expenditure in the relationship between CSR news reports and firm value. Findings: CSR news reports positively affect firm value, and this relationship is mediated by WOM and moderated by advertising expenditure. Notably, the positive effect of WOM on firm value is stronger for companies that spend less on advertising. Practical implications: The evidence implies that marketing managers could benefit from not only conducting CSR activities but also widely publicizing them. CSR news reports could help companies enhance public awareness of and interest in them. Originality/value: This is the first study to investigate the influence of CSR news reports using empirical data in Korea. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising expenditure; CSR; CSR news reports; Firm value; Word of mouth",""

The overarching goal of this novel, discovery-oriented approach is to illuminate the interactive relationships between business and consumer ethics, and to offer contextualized insights into consumers' (un)ethical behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: Three focus group interviews were conducted with senior business executives representing nine different industry sectors. Thematic analysis was performed to identify key themes for an integrative model. Findings: Four key themes emerged, highlighting: (1) the mutual influence between business and consumer ethics, (2) the nature and intensity of consumer ethics, (3) the dual influence of digital communication, and (4) the partial influence of consumer education. The themes gave rise to an integrative conceptual model. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited somewhat by the small and judgmental sample. Practical implications: Consumers' growing demands for business ethics underscore the need for companies to elevate ethical considerations. The amplified consumer voice on social media is dreaded by business practitioners and is regarded as unethical consumer behavior to be actively managed. Social implications: Business and consumer ethics can mutually influence each other in a benign or vicious circle. Consumer education is effective in some but not all domains. Originality/value: Business practitioners' insights reveal (1) the interactivity of business and consumer ethics and (2) the diversity of (un)ethical consumer behaviors. They point to the need for an enriched definition of consumer ethics and an expansion on the categorical structure of consumers' (un)ethical practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Consumer education; Consumer ethics; Digital communication",""
"The role of musical priming in brand recall","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074038883&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2019-0231&partnerID=40&md5=b082753e79f49e448866fabee4478c1a","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to analyze whether musical priming induces greater recall of brands and, second, to study the emotional priming effects of music, in comparison with non-emotional music, including gender comparison. Design/methodology/approach: Through the utilization of neuromarketing tools and protocols (quantitative and qualitative), the study explores facial eltromyography (EMG) capabilities and skin conductance responses (SCR) measuring consumers’ emotional responses. Findings: The findings show that at least, 40 percent of the total sample recognized a musical priming effect. The study measures the emotional response to musical priming as positive. Emotional video recognition was much higher in females. Both the self-report and physiological measures support the notion that emotional background music can elicit emotional responses in consumers. Research limitations/implications: The research measured emotional response to musical priming without testing how these responses influence consumers’ attention and overall behavior. Practical implications: The five senses, especially hearing, play an important role in the purchasing decision process and in the individual customer experience. People become aware of the products and brands that surround them and make their choice. In terms of digital trading activities and online sales, increasing physiological understanding of musical priming reactions may mean that, for companies, selling low-end online goods may be economically worthwhile to cooperate with platforms such as Spotify or iTunes to select individual users. Social implications: More research is needed in priming process techniques in order to better understand how primes activate knowledge in the consumer’s mind. Understanding this process will inform marketers how close a prime needs to be to a target to have an effective influence, as well as when marketers should be concerned about negative priming effects. Originality/value: At the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that music priming is analyzed in terms of self-report and physiological measures From the measurement’s perspective, the results reaffirm that physiological and self-report measures capture different levels of information. While SCR and EMG capture real-time subconscious responses, MAN scale self-report data provide information regarding how cognitive effort, in terms of intensity and valence, affects brand recall. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand recognition; Emotional responses; Music in television commercials; Musical priming; Neuromarketing",""
"What kind of emotions do emoticons communicate?","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076850758&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0136&partnerID=40&md5=f62e20d2745a74d93e4bbacdfd2ef58c","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the nature and concept of emoticons/emojis. Instead of taking for granted that these user-generated formats are necessarily emotional, we empirically assessed in what extent are they and the specificity of each one. Drawing on congruent mood state, valence core and emotion appraisal theories we expected a compatible statistical association between positive/negative/neutral emotional valence expressions and emoticons of similar valence. The positive emoticons were consistently associated with positive valence posts. Added to that analysis, 21 emotional categories were identified in posts and correlated with eight emoticons. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were used to address this question. The first study defined emoticon concept and interpreted their meaning highlighting their communication goals and anticipated effects. The link between emojis and emoticons was also obtained. Some emoticons types present more ambiguity than others. In the second study, three years of real and private (Facebook) posts from 82 adolescents were content analyzed and coded. Findings: Only the neutral emoticons always matched neutral emotional categories found in the written interaction. Although the emoticon valence and emotional category congruence pattern was the rule, we also detected a combination of different valence emoticons types and emotion categories valence expressions. Apparently the connection between emoticon and emotion are not so obviously straightforward as the literature used to assume. The created objects designed to communicate emotions (emoticons) have their specific corresponding logic with the emotional tone of the message. Originality/value: Theoretically, we discussed the emotional content of emoticons/emojis. Although this king of signals have an Asian origin and later borrowed from the western countries, their ambiguity and differing specificity have never been analyzed. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Content analysis; Emojis; Emoticons; Emotion communication; Facebook; Generation Y; Media (new media); Word of mouth marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach: A survey research method was utilized to collect data from mobile users. A real sample of 459 respondents was deemed and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze data. Findings: The results unveil that contextual offers, social facilitation, and advertising values have significantly positive effects on attitude; in turn, attitude mediates between these factors and purchase intention, information seeking and recommendation behaviors. Moreover, social facilitation is a significant stimulator of purchase intention. Otherwise, perceived encroached risk negatively impacts attitude.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws upon the uses of a “free” collectable toy premium promotion with a fixed purchase spend (via an IRP) in the supermarket industry as a marketing instrument to increase customer basket spend and repeat visits. Reflections on the recent use of toy premiums by Australian supermarket retailers are also utilised to highlight the ingredients for a successful promotion but also the controversies associated with such promotions. Findings: One of the key findings suggest that the role of toy premiums is a successful marketing tool by retailers to increase customer total basket spending. However, notable points of caution regarding offering IRPs incorporating collectable toy premiums promotions are established, including environmental concerns and the social, ethical dilemma as to whether these promotions are indirectly targeted at children rather than adult consumers. Practical implications: The findings have important implications for retailers to attract customer attention, increased market spend and repeat purchases through a desired collectable premium promotion (via an IRP). Originality/value: This is the first paper to critically review the usage of collectable toy premiums within the supermarket retail industry. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Instant reward promotions; Sales promotion; Supermarkets; Toy collectable premium",""

Design/methodology/approach: This article examines the topic in the context of different national cultural attributes, including individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, power distance, and long-term orientation. We use brand values of the Financial Times Global 500 companies and national cultural values reported by Hofstede, GLOBE, and Schwartz. Findings: Results exhibit that brands are more value-additive to companies in highly individualistic cultures. Furthermore, a valuable brand contributes more to firm value in countries with low uncertainty avoidance, high masculine, low power distance, and short-term oriented cultures. Originality/value: The evidence suggests that while a valuable brand contributes to firm value, the level of its effect on firm value varies by national cultures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand value; Consumer behavior; Firm value; Hofstede; MNE; National cultures",""

"Hedonism or self-growth? The influence of perceived control on individual product preferences for individuals under self-threat","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072125044&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2019-0072&partnerID=40&md5=4f3058e6f5931ca3065a423baf7662f9","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of perceived control on product preferences of consumers under self-threat. Design/methodology/approach: By conducting four experiments, this paper manipulated the participants’ self-threat and three sources of perceived control – namely, the controllability of the threat itself, the internal and external locus of control of the individual and priming the existing positive or negative experience of the individuals. After the manipulations, the participants’ product preferences for self-growth goods or hedonic goods were measured. Findings: The findings of this research indicated that when consumers have a higher perceived control of the threats they are facing, they are more likely to adopt problem-focused coping strategies and show a preference for self-growth goods, which can help them resolve their threats. However, when consumers have a lower perceived control on the threats they are facing, they are more likely to adopt emotion-focused coping strategies and show a preference for hedonic goods, which can help them adjust their emotions. Originality/value: This paper systematically confirms the interactive effect of perceived control and self-threat on consumers’ product preferences, as well as the meditation role of problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. It also provides insights for marketers to know what factors may affect consumers’ preferences for products in self-threat situations, thus contributing to marketing practices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coping; Perceived control; Product preferences; Self-threat",""
"Using text mining to track changes in travel destination image: the case of Macau","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084003539&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2019-0477&partnerID=40&md5=d034a78719a6666a79c126d402f48e9f","Purpose: Travel websites allow tourists to share their thoughts, beliefs and experiences regarding various travel destinations. In this paper, the researchers demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organisations to explore online tourist-generated content and understand tourists' perceptions of the destination image (DI). Specifically, the researchers initiated an investigation examining how the destination image of Macau changed during the period of 2014–2018 based on user-generated content on travel websites. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawlers developed by Python were employed to collect tourists' reviews from both Ctrip and TripAdvisor regarding the theme of “Macau attraction”. A total of 51,191 reviews (41,352 from Ctrip and 9,839 from TripAdvisor) were collected and analysed using the text-mining technique. Findings: The results reveal that the frequency of casino-related words decreased in reviews by both international and mainland Chinese tourists. Additionally, international and mainland Chinese tourists perceive the DI of Macau differently. Mainland Chinese tourists are more sensitive to new attractions, while international tourists are not. The study also shows that there are differences between the government-projected DI and the tourist-perceived DI. Only the “City of Culture” and “A World Centre of Tourism and Leisure” have built recognition with tourists. Originality/value: Given the easy accessibility of online information from various sources, it is important for destination marketing organisations to analyse and monitor different DI perspectives and adjust their branding strategies for greater effectiveness. This study uncovered the online DI of Macau by using text mining and content analysis of two of the largest travel websites. By analysing and comparing the differences and relationships among the frequently used words of tourist-generated content on these websites, the researchers revealed some interesting findings with important marketing implications. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Destination image; Online reviews; Text mining; Tourist-generated content",""

Design/methodology/approach: In total, three experiments were conducted to gather data. The assumed hypotheses were verified using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and bootstrap analysis. Findings: Study 1 illustrated that loss-framed messages are more persuasive than gain-framed messages for less-involved consumers in idle item recycling, whereas message framing shows no significant difference in more-involved consumers' intention. Study 2 suggested that perceived impact tends to increase less-involved consumers' recycling intention when the message is framed as loss. Study 3 demonstrated that less-involved consumers would react to idle item recycling messages when they are strongly attached to a product. Further, gain-framed messages are more efficacious than loss-framed messages in influencing more-involved consumers' recycling intention when they are strongly attached to a product. Originality/value: Previous research focuses on promoting waste recycling behavior initiated by local, city or national governments.

"Dual path effects of self-worth on status consumption: evidence from Chinese consumers","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076755389&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2019-0364&partnerID=40&md5=e9779c65ff7159ef7cb5e6d7f7c8289d","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of self-worth on status consumption, focusing on the mediation of self-enhancement and self-compensation and the moderation of power distance belief (PDB) in the relationship of threats to self-worth and consumer choice. Design/methodology/approach: Experiments are used to collect data. Three studies are designed to test the relationship between self-worth, self-enhancement and self-compensation, PDB and status consumption. In total, 180 MBA students participate Study 1, 186 and 244 undergraduate students participate Studies 2 and 3, respectively. ANOVA and bootstrapping method are adopted to analyze the data by using SPSS version 19.0. Study 1 tests the influence of self-worth on status consumption; Study 2 examines the mediation role of self-enhancement and self-compensation; and Study 3 tests the moderation role of PDB. Findings: Results indicate that situational self-worth perception has dual path effects on status consumption. Both improvements in – and threats to – self-worth have a positive impact on status consumption. Improvements in self-worth affect status consumption through the mediation of self-enhancement motives. Threats to self-worth affect status and non-status consumption through the mediation of the self-compensation motive. In the context of a threat to self-worth, compared with consumers with a low PDB, high-PDB consumers have higher purchase intention for status goods but not non-status goods. Research limitations/implications: In this study, improvements in – and threats to – self-worth are momentarily manipulated. The authors present one product in each experiment, but what would happen if both status goods and non-status goods were shown to participants? Which one will the authors choose under different self-worth manipulations? And how long can the effects last? These questions should be answered in future research. Practical implications: This research provides a venue for marketers to introduce and advertise status goods. Marketing practitioners should establish the link between self-worth and status consumption appeals. In the Asia-Pacific markets, Confucian value is important to consumers, and high power distance is important in Confucianism. Thus when developing markets in China, international companies should emphasize Confucian values in the design of advertisements or other promotional items. Further, marketing for status goods should attach importance to the expression of their symbolic meanings. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on self-worth and status consumption. It also explores the dual path of the effect of self-worth on status consumption. The motives of self-enhancement and self-compensation are first proposed and tested to explain the mechanism, which differentiates the study from prior work and gives a more reasonable explanation for status and compensatory consumption. The moderation role of PDB delineates the boundary for the effect of a threat to self-worth on status consumption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Improvements in self-worth; Power distance belief; Self-compensation motive; Self-enhancement motive; Status consumption; Threats to self-worth",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment with 56 young adults (23 females; mean age 24 years) with normal vision and hearing and no record of neurological disease. The authors calculated total blood flow (TBF) and hemodynamic randomness and examined their relationships with online popularity. Findings: The authors found that TBF to the right medial prefrontal cortex increased more when the young adults heard music that presented acoustic stimulation well above previously defined optimal sensory level. The hemodynamic randomness decreased significantly when the participants listened to music that provided near- or above-OSL stimulation. Research limitations/implications: Online popularity, recorded as the number of daily hits, was significantly positively related with the TBF and negatively related with hemodynamic randomness. Practical implications: These findings suggest that a new media marketing strategy may be required that can provide a sufficient level of sensory stimulation to Millennials in order to increase their engagements in various use cases including entertainment, advertising and retail environments. Social implications: Digital technology has so drastically reduced the costs of sharing and disseminating information, including music, that consumers can now easily use digital platforms to access a wide selection of music at minimal cost. The structure of the current music market reflects the decentralized nature of the online distribution network such that artists from all over the world now have equal access to billions of members of the global music audience.

Further, optimistic estimation (OE) is examined as an underlying mechanism of the uncertain reward effect, as well as the impact of combining this with other marketing strategies: the controllable lottery and the delayed reward. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies were conducted to examine the influence of DUR on CE, which included online experiments and a laboratory experiment. In total, 337 participants were recruited from China and the USA to enhance the study’s reliability and validity. Findings: The research demonstrated that a high-degree uncertain reward led to less OE than a low-degree uncertain reward (LDUR), which subsequently decreased CE (Study 1). However, when other marketing strategies were combined – the controllable lottery (Study 2) and time-delay reward strategy (Study 3) – the uncertain reward effect was reversed (Study 2) or attenuated (Study 3). Research limitations/implications: The current research only presents two possible reward amounts and independently explores the influence of two popular marketing strategies. Future research can explore customers’ responses to engagement when they face multiple rewards and thoroughly investigate the influence of other social or psychological factors. Practical implications: Firms could apply an LDUR to enhance CE effects. Furthermore, this could be done at a low cost by empowering customers’ controllability. Nonetheless, firms should be cautious with trade-offs when using time-delay reward strategies. Social implications: The research contributes to establishing networks of customer–company and interpersonal relationships, as well as fostering closer social ties and social harmony. Originality/value: This research offers not only initial research on CE in the promotion stage, but also a novel psychological perspective in CE literature. Meanwhile, the study provides substantial value in guiding managers to effectively transform customers into value co-creators. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Co-creation; Customer engagement; Optimistic estimation; Uncertain reward",""

Its rapid rise has affected Asia and the world, becoming the world’s largest shopping festival beyond Black Friday. The success of Singles’ Day Online Shopping Festival demonstrates Chinese experience of online shopping festive atmosphere marketing. The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of Singles’ Day Online Shopping Festival atmosphere and Chinese cultural background, especially Confucian values, on Chinese consumers’ purchase intention in Singles’ Day Online Shopping Festival. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conceptualized consumers’ most perceptive atmosphere characteristics as the three dimensions of perceived economic temptation, perceived festival entertainment and perceived mass participation. Taking Confucian values as moderators, based on the stimulus-response theory, this study constructed an influencing factor model of consumer purchase intention in online shopping festival, collected data of 398 Chinese consumers by questionnaire, and used structural equation modeling for hypotheses testing. Findings: The results showed that online shopping festival atmosphere and Confucian values affect purchase intention; the two factors of “keeping face” and “listening to others” of Confucian values play moderating roles in the effect of online shopping festival atmosphere on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The sample of this study was biased toward the young and well-educated consumers; besides, this study focused on young consumers’ purchase intention of online shopping festival, rather than their actual consumption behaviors. Practical implications: Confucian values have deeply influenced China and other Asian countries, especially East and Southeast Asian countries. Meanwhile they are the fastest growing regions of e-commerce in the world, the paper provides theoretical basis and reference for the e-commerce enterprises in the Confucian cultural societies to improve the atmosphere marketing of online shopping festivals, and attracts consumers to shop online, having particular significance in shedding light on the Asian “e-commerce Miracle.” Social implications: This study found that Singles’ Day purchase intention is dependent on online shopping festival atmosphere stimuli, Confucian values and their interaction. Marketing researchers should consider both online shopping festival atmosphere as a marketing tool and the influence of consumer cultural values, so as to help e-commerce platforms and e-commerce merchants establish shopping festival marketing strategies that suit consumers’ cultural values.

To determine a way to maximize profit, optimal pricing and inventory control strategies are studied for both the RTD coffee as well as the coffeehouse chain network. Design/methodology/approach: It is assumed that the company sells only drip coffee through its coffeehouse chain and would like to launch RTD coffee via other channels such as convenience stores, supermarkets and so on to maximize its total profit. A mathematical model–based optimization is adopted to address the decision-making for the given problem situation, where the demand for both drip and RTD coffee are dependent on the values of decision variables. To solve the proposed mathematical model, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied due to nonlinearity of the developed model. Findings: It is confirmed that a company can earn more profit by launching RTD coffee, even though the profit from drip coffee would reduce. In addition, the scenario analysis shows that by launching RTD coffee under various conditions, the total profits would also improve. Originality/value: The value of this study is the proposed basic framework for the industry. In addition to the modeling framework and cost structure, realistic cost figures and technical details can be considered when applying the model to a practical setting. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chain stores; Particle swarm optimization; Production capacity decision; Revenue management; Substitute product",""

It also seeks to investigate the mediating effect of perceived value and the moderating effect of intention to visit the destination on the intention to participate. Design/methodology/approach: Using purposive sampling technique, 177 valid Singapore marathon enthusiasts were sampled to look into their intention towards participating in destination marathon in Sarawak (marathon held in Kuching). The data were analysed using the partial least squares–structural equation modelling (PLS–SEM). Findings: The results show that amongst the other determinants, perceived organisation and perceived service quality do not contribute to perceived value and intention to participate in destination marathon. Perceived value is found to mediate all path relationships except the relationship between perceived organisation and intention to participate. Moreover, the relationship between perceived value and intention to participate is significantly moderated by intention to tour Sarawak. Originality/value: This study makes a substantial contribution to the extant literature pertaining to destination tourism and value-based marketing in an emerging market. In particular, it highlights the importance of perceived value and the relevance of destination tourism in joining a sport event on foreign soil. The use of PLS–SEM also allows a rigorous assessment of the relationships under investigation and provides better estimations of the phenomenon. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Destination marathon; Intention to tour; Perceived value; PLS-SEM; Self-determination theory; Tourism",""

Specifically, the impact of PWYW endogenous price discrimination on consumers’ price fairness perception of and reactions to PWYW is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Three empirical studies with different product categories were conducted through lab experiments with student sample using scenario-based experimental approach. Findings: Results indicate the viability of PWYW with lower suggested external reference price. The impact of PWYW endogenous price discrimination is dependent upon the magnitude of price deviation from regular market price and product category. Consumers’ negative perceptions of price differentiation interacted with their underlying beliefs about the retailer’s cost of products across different channels. PWYW acceptance can be fostered in multi-channel by communication of additional-value generated in offline selling. Originality/value: The current research is possibly the first to explore PWYW viability in the multi-channel context by exploring the consumer’s price perception process and critical consumer reactions through a well-structured research framework. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","External reference price; Multi-channel retailing; Pay-What-You-Want pricing; Price discrimination",""

This study thus adopted the stimuli–organism–response (S–O–R) model to create a comprehensive framework to understand consumers' organic food purchase decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 592 valid samples in organic food chain stores and markets by random sampling method. Meanwhile, structural equation modelling was adopted to test hypotheses. Findings: The research findings indicate that consumer preference for natural food was the most important factor for enhancing purchase intention, followed by health consciousness, health risk, attitude towards organic food and trust in labelling. Perceptions of nutritional value positively influenced attitudes towards organic food and trust in labelling, followed by perceptions of environmental effects; conversely, attitudes towards organic food labelling had the least effect on increasing trust in labelling. Attitudes towards organic food labelling was the most important factor influencing positive attitudes towards organic food, followed by consumer perception of environmental protection effects. Originality/value: This study demonstrates the relative influence of different variables on organic food purchase intention. Compared with consumer attitude towards organic food and trust in labelling, consumers' individual health was the most important factor influencing their purchase intention. As health and naturalness are attractive factors for consumers, the organic food industry can emphasize health protection in their marketing strategies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Certification mechanism; Organic food; Perception; Purchase intention; S–O–R model",""

In this study, the authors especially focus on individual preferences during a wine tasting experience. Design/methodology/approach: A consumer neuroscience experiment was carried out with 26 participants that evaluated different red wines while their brain activity was recorded with EEG. A within-subjects design was employed and the experiment was carried out in two sessions. All participants took part in a blind taste session (no label session), in which information about the wine was not disclosed, and a normal taste session (label session), during which the bottle and its label were visible. Findings: The findings suggest that EEG is a useful tool to study brain activity during product experience. EEG has high temporal resolution, low costs, small dimensions and superior manoeuvrability compared to other consumer neuroscience tools. However, it is noticed that there is a lack of solid theoretical background regarding brain areas (e.g. frontal cortex) and brain activity (e.g. brain waves) related to consumer preferences during product experience. This lack of knowledge causes several difficulties in replicating and validating the findings of other consumer neuroscience experiments for studying consumer behaviour. Originality/value: The experiment presented in this paper is an exploratory study. It provides insights into the possible contribution of EEG data to the prediction of consumer behaviour during product experience. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Beta band; Consumer neuroscience; EEG; Neuromarketing; Wine preferences; Wine tasting",""

Design/methodology/approach: A natural quasi-experiment was conducted within a month after the public relations incidents. Participants randomly viewed one of the two videos relating to the incidents. Path analysis was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of anger, acceptability appraisal, motivational incongruence appraisal, relevance appraisal and other accountability appraisal on consumers’ intention to harm the brand and future purchase intention. Findings: Appraisals of acceptability, motivational incongruence and relevance, but not other accountability, have both direct and indirect effects on anger and its motivational tendency. Acceptability appraisal directly increases consumers’ intention to harm, whereas relevance appraisal directly increases their intention to harm and reduces future purchase intention. The degree to which these appraisal structure and anger occur account for the level of negative consumer responses toward the two public relations incidents. Practical implications: The current findings empirically replicate the diverse consumer responses toward two public relations incidents and use anger and its appraisal structure to account for the negative responses.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts the multi-case study method based on a sample of four Chinese logistics enterprises, in which the authors consider the logistics service maturity (LSM), a distinct characteristic of logistics enterprises. Findings: NLSPD is directly related to the degree of supply–demand matching (SDM) and LSM. Customer demand, service capability and peer competition influence the performance of NLSPD through the SDM degree, whereas LSM moderates these influencing mechanisms. Moreover, the degree of SDM has a positive impact on LSM. Practical implications: The findings can help the managers of logistics enterprises and practitioners in the logistics industry understand the complexity of NLSPD. First, they should broaden and deepen their service offering to enhance the degree of LSM. Second, they should pay attention to the factors that affect SDM systematically. Finally, it is vital to balance the relationship between LSM and SDM.

Design/methodology/approach: SME data were collected via surveys. A sampling frame of 3,000 exporting manufactures was developed based on a database sourced from the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The authors first contacted the managers of each firm in the sampling frame through e-mail or phone to receive permission, and then sent a paper questionnaire. The authors analyzed 392 valid cases using a path analysis. Findings: The findings largely confirmed the hypotheses in the proposed framework based on the RBV. While social networks only enhanced marketing capabilities and did not directly lead to international performance, business networks enhanced both. Also, unlike social networks, the influence of SME business networks on international performance was weakened as international experience increased. This study found that marketing capabilities mediated the path from business networks to international performance. Research limitations/implications: The study explained the distinctive roles played by social and business networks in international performance, extending our knowledge of the RBV by showing how firm resources can turn into sustainable competitive advantages. More importantly, the integration of time into the discussion on networks and international performance extended the business network internationalization process model. Practical implications: The authors suggest that Korean SMEs focus on developing their own marketing capabilities by capitalizing on their social and business networks, which could directly enhance international performance. Governments can also offer assistance to SMEs for developing their own marketing capabilities during the initial stages of internationalization, since the benefit of business networks diminishes as international experience increases. Originality/value: By testing the proposed link between resource capabilities and performance, this study suggested how SME networks can contribute to international performance, extending our understanding of RBV. This study further confirmed the dynamic impact of business networks on international performance, such that it changes over the course of the internationalization process. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","International experience; International performance; Marketing capability; Network; Resource-based theory; South Korean SMEs",""

The mediating effects of brand image and customer trust on the relationship between CSR and customer behavioural loyalty are also considered. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 298 valid responses to questionnaire surveys were collected from a convenience sample in China in 2017. A structural equation model was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Hotel customer behavioural loyalty can be enhanced by CSR performance. Performance in each of the three CSR domains positively impacted customer behavioural loyalty to different degrees. The impact of CSR on the customer had the strongest influence on Chinese customers’ behavioural loyalty among the three CSR domains of customer, employee and society. Brand image and customer trust were found to be mediators of the relationship between CSR performance and customer behavioural loyalty.

Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data collected from 372 front line employees (FLEs), employed in different banks in Pakistan, the path analysis through structural equation modelling procedures is used to perform data analysis. Findings: The results show that BI, BK and BPO strongly predict BCB in a mediating role of brand pride. Practical implications: The results have pragmatic value to guide managers and marketing policymakers to develop a brand culture where the company as a brand is internally owned by its employees. The supervisors should offer FLEs with opportunities to speak up and must socialize with them so that communication touch points can be established and strengthened. Furthermore, delegation of authority and positive enforcement are important tools to trigger psychological ownership among FLEs. Originality/value: Three antecedents (i.e. BI, BK and BPO) to advocate and channelize brand-oriented citizenship behaviours are unique to this study. Furthermore, the mediating role of brand pride is yet another unique contribution. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Brand knowledge",""

Design/methodology/approach: A pretest (survey) and two main studies (experiments) were conducted to examine the proposed mediation model of “Chief Marketing Officer background—enhancement of capabilities—brand competitiveness”. Findings: An emerging-market brand marketer gains enhanced resources and capabilities when a new chief marketing officer is recruited from a developed-country incumbent with a superior reputation, leading to improved brand competitiveness. This positive effect accrues from the new chief marketing officer's background (i.e. prior work organization) spilling over to his/her new emerging-market employer.

"Effects of service encounter barriers on situational abnormality and consumers' behavioral intentions at food and beverage restaurants","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097500405&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2020-0192&partnerID=40&md5=dc9cec1b46ca6849d291b472388c1fb1","Purpose: The present study unveils the service encounter barriers – interactional and instructional – faced by foreign consumers at food and beverage restaurants in China. It builds a conceptual framework and examines (1) how service encounter barriers create situational abnormality, (2) how situational abnormality engenders foreign consumers' felt discomfort that influences their revisit intentions and (3) how expectations disconfirmation moderates situational abnormality. Design/methodology/approach: Convenience sampling using the survey method was employed to collect data from 517 foreign consumers – who stay in Beijing (China) – at food and beverage restaurants. The study used IBM SPSS 25.0 and Amos Graphics 24.0 to analyze the data and interpret results. Findings: Findings reveal that interactional and instructional barriers positively create situational abnormality, which ultimately leads to foreign consumers' felt discomfort and their negative revisit intentions. Expectations disconfirmation significantly aggravates situational abnormality as a moderator. Research limitations/implications: This study investigates foreign consumers' behavior at food and beverage restaurants in China and cautions its generalizability. It suggests corroborating the foreign consumers' behavioral intentions in the context of other countries to generalize the findings and unleash other factors additive to comprehend their behavior in the wake of restaurant industry. Originality/value: The extant literature has not examined the service encounter barriers faced by foreign consumers at food and beverage restaurants in China. The present study, responding to the previous calls, incorporated the service encounter barriers and their downstream effects on foreign consumers' behavioral responses. By doing so, it adds value to the domestic food and beverage restaurants and service firms in China, in particular, and paves the way to understand the interactional and instructional barriers in the global context, in general, by engaging the foreign consumers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Communication barrier; Expectations disconfirmation; Felt discomfort; Revisit intention; Service counter; Situational abnormality",""
"Consumer involvement with corporate ads vs product ads: a cross-national study","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074045882&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2017-0219&partnerID=40&md5=514e1b297c180ec7c4bfa1a95a2eb7ee","Purpose: Increasing consumer skepticism of corporate behavior has led companies to actively manage and advertise their corporate brands. However, it remains unclear how receptive consumers across different markets are to such efforts. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate differences and similarities between corporate and product advertising by examining consumer ad involvement (AI) levels (a motivational state activated by the personal relevance of stimuli) and its antecedents and consequences for these ad types across two markets with varying degrees of economic development. Design/methodology/approach: Using a 2 (ad type: corporate vs product) × 2 (market type: developed vs emerging) between-subject experimental design, the study was conducted in two markets with varying degrees of economic development, specifically, the USA (n=285) and Pakistan (n=311). Findings: Results show that consumer involvement with corporate ads varies for developed (USA: high) and emerging (Pakistan: low) markets but that it remains the same for product ads across markets. Developed market consumers tend to be as involved with corporate ads as they are with product ads, whereas emerging market consumers are more involved with product ads than with corporate ads. Aside from differences in involvement levels, the findings demonstrate substantial similarities in the antecedents and consequences of consumer involvement for both ad (corporate vs product) and market (developed vs emerging) types. Practical implications: With advertising and communication campaigns increasingly being standardized across different markets, this study demonstrates that corporate messages do not function similar as product messages across markets. For effective corporate campaigns, ad designs should fit with the motivation levels of the target consumers across markets.

The study used a Breusch–Pagan test to detect heteroscedasticity. Accordingly, the model is analyzed using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error estimators. Findings: The results show that the volume of the early e-WOM does not significantly contribute to explaining average ratings, but the valence does. Originality/value: Because the advertising revenue of television broadcasters is determined according to expected TV ratings, the average ratings should be predicted as early as possible.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a model with organizational learning (OL) and supply chain orientation (SCO) as antecedents of dynamic logistics capabilities and firm performance as the outcome. The study tests this model on a sample of logistics service firms. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data collected from 103 logistics firms drawn from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transportation of Hong Kong. Findings: Results show that OL directly enhances DC and indirectly through SCO. The relationship between OL and SCO is stronger than the relationship between OL and DC. DC are positively related to logistics firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study relied on perceptual and self-reported data from senior management. Relationships among variables may also be inflated by common method variance but efforts were taken to reduce this threat. Practical implications: Logistics firms should promote a learning culture in the organization. Organization learning enhances a firm’s willingness to change and innovate. It also helps employees to gain a better understanding of clients’ supply chains and possibilities. SCO helps the firm to direct its reconfiguration and renewal efforts where the returns are the highest. Originality/value: There is scant empirical research on the antecedents of DC outside of manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services. The study focused on the logistics services industry. SCO, a necessary strategic orientation for firms in the supply chain, has not been empirically investigated in the previous research. This study addressed these gaps in the literature and contributes to the understanding of the factors giving rise to DC. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dynamic capabilities; Firm performance; Organizational learning; Supply chain orientation",""

Design/methodology/approach: Two online experiments were conducted. Study 1 was a 2×2 factorial design (with 280 participants), while Study 2 was a 2×2 ×2 factorial design (with 320 participants). Data were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test and simple effect analysis. Findings: Results demonstrated that Chinese female consumers are more likely to have a positive attitude toward advertisements for luxury goods and brands when a local Chinese (vs Western) endorser is used and portrayed as smart (vs sexy), particularly if consumers have low appearance self-esteem. Research limitations/implications: The research focused only on female consumers and only one product type was used for the experiments. The use of controls for potential confounding effects was insufficient in this study design. Practical implications: To maximize profits, marketers should choose the most appropriate combination of endorser ethnicity and portrayal in the Chinese luxury goods market. Accordingly, if adopting a localization strategy and using a Chinese female endorser, the endorser should be portrayed as smart rather than sexy. In contrast, if a luxury brand adopts an internationalization strategy and uses the same Western female endorser as in other countries, it is more effective to portray her as sexy rather than smart. Furthermore, advertisers should pay particular attention to Chinese female consumers who have low appearance self-esteem when advertising their product and/or brand. Originality/value: Compared with past studies concerned with consumers’ perceptions of endorser image in advertisements through a focus on endorser ethnicity, this study linked endorser portrayal with his/her ethnicity and discussed the interaction effects between these two factors on consumers’ attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand portrayed in the advertisement.

Design/methodology/approach: Validity and reliability of the measurement scale were proved through a confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach’s α analyses and correlation analyses. A structural equation modeling test with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted to test the relationships among the research variables using 440 participants. Findings: The results revealed destination image had a direct influence on tourist satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty, and that tourist satisfaction had a direct influence on attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty. Moreover, tourist satisfaction was found to partially mediate relationships between destination image and attitudinal loyalty, and between destination image and behavioral loyalty. Practical implications: First, destination marketers and organizers of a small event should provide tourists with an international or domestic newsletter of the small event. Second, destination marketers should place well-educated employees at popular hotels and restaurants and the event organizers should arrange that trained volunteers be positioned at stadiums, to enable tourists to find the locations of interest, which would help develop a positive image of the destination. Third, marketers and organizers should actively use social media to improve destination images and promote sporting events. Originality/value: The authors offer a new perspective of tourist satisfaction as a mediating effect. Existing studies show tourist satisfaction fully mediates on the relation between destination image and loyalty, but the present study shows tourist satisfaction partially mediates this relation. In this respect, the term “sporting event” should be regarded important when attempting to understand tourist psychology and behavior because the level of tourist satisfaction can be affected by a term like “sporting event” in the mediating effect context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudinal loyalty; Behavioural loyalty; Destination image; Destination loyalty; Small-scale sporting event; Sport tourism; Tourist satisfaction",""
"Early bird or versioning: Which pricing strategy is better for creators in reward-based crowdfunding?","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069432655&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-12-2018-0529&partnerID=40&md5=db55f3780a8ec3a4dfd1162213c152ac","Purpose: Crowdfunding, especially reward-based crowdfunding, has quickly evolved into a commonly used vehicle for innovating entrepreneurs to develop their products. Many crowdfunding platforms allow creators maximum flexibility in terms of the prices and rewards offered in a project to gain sufficient capital. However, creators need to understand how to design project rewards and how to select a pricing strategy, in addition to whether the creator should spend resources on designing multiple rewards of varying quality. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues by answering whether and why there are significant differences in the application of early-bird and versioning pricing strategies in crowdfunding. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a two-stage dynamic game model with incomplete information, proposes a corollary calculated by analyzing a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and then tests Corollary 1 by empirical analysis. Findings: Contrary to the findings of other studies, the results show that an early-bird pricing strategy is likely better than a versioning pricing strategy for earning greater revenue in a crowdfunding context, on average. This finding means that creators do not have to spend as much in designing rewards of various qualities; rather, they should only provide multiple price options for high-quality rewards. However, if the heterogeneity of target backers’ valuations and the quality difference between two types of products are adequately high, a versioning pricing strategy may be a good choice for creators. Practical implications: This paper provides a reference for creators regarding the selection of pricing strategies and the design of reward quality when launching crowdfunding projects. Originality/value: This paper explains an interesting and practical issue in the design of reward quality and the selection of a pricing strategy after fully considering the role of the crowdfunding all-or-nothing mechanism and special backer behavior. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Backer behaviour; Early-bird price; Pricing strategy; Reward-based crowdfunding; Versioning",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of ULD on consumers’ perceived quality compared with RD and to identify the relevant influencing mechanism and boundary for the effectiveness of ULD. Design/methodology/approach: Three online experiments were conducted with 445 participants from China. First, experiment 1 compares the attractiveness of ULD and RD. Second, experiment 2 evaluates the impacts of ULD and RD on consumers’ perceived quality and clarifies the mechanism in this process. Finally, experiment 3 examines the moderating effect of product knowledge. Findings: ULD has the same level of attractiveness as RD with equivalent expected discount value for consumers. Besides, consumers in ULD give higher ratings to product quality compared with those in RD, and the lower diagnosticity of price cues in ULD underlies the differential effects of ULD vs RD. Furthermore, product knowledge moderates the relationship between the two promotions and perceived quality. Practical implications: The findings provide valuable guidance for managers to conduct promotional campaigns. ULD is an effective promotion to attract consumers to purchase with keeping consumers’ perceived quality high, and such effectiveness will rise for products that consumers are unfamiliar with. Managers can make rational use of ULD to achieve positive promotion results in both the short and long term. Originality/value: Few studies pay attention to the long-term effects of the uncertain promotion. This research profoundly investigates the impact of ULD on perceived quality, which complements existing studies from a more integrated perspective that combines short- and long-term effects. Also, this research identifies the mechanism based on the cue diagnosticity theory and puts forward a new explanation for positive uncertainty in uncertain promotions. Finally, this research applies the impact of product knowledge on information process strategies into the uncertain promotion, which clarifies the utility boundary of ULD from a new perspective and offers a more comprehensive understanding for this promotion. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Cue utilization theory; Perceived quality; Promotion effects; Regular discount; Uncertain level discount",""

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey is conducted in Beijing and Shanghai. A random sampling technique is used to collect data from 854 respondents. Two scenarios of eWOM communication – positive and negative consumption experiences – are randomly assigned to each respondent. This study employs the structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. However, it uses ordinary least squares and logistic regression to analyze 137 participants in the experimental study. Findings: Promotion-focused customers that aim for self-enhancement and obtaining social benefits are motivated to spread positive eWOM on social networking sites. However, prevention-focused customers are driven by vengeance and anxiety, revealing higher intentions to post negative eWOM on review sites. eWOM generation is subject to gender, as promotion-focused male customers spread it more than both prevention-focused and promotion-focused female customers. Moreover, platform assistance (PA) has a significant positive impact upon regulatory-focused customers and eWOM (positive vs negative) relationships. Practical implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of motivational factors of eWOM communication. Specifically, in case of product or service failure, negative consumption experiences drive prevention-focused customers to generate negative eWOM. Thus, using various tactics, marketers need to shift customers from focusing on prevention to focusing on promotion. For example, redeemable free coupons can shift customer attention and generate positive eWOM. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights about eWOM motivation across genders.

The authors conceptualize customer orientation as a firm’s capacity to create and deliver superior customer value through the processing of market intelligence, as demonstrated by the firm’s composite operant resources of market-sensing, customer-relating and customer-response capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via qualitative in-depth interviews for scale development followed by a mail questionnaire survey for quantitative responses. A final sample size of 190 firms based in Thailand participated and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping multi-group comparisons to investigate the hypothesized mediation and moderation effects.

Meanwhile, it also aims to explain the main reason for the low efficiency of suppliers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a modified data model considering undesirable output and dual-role factors. The study integrates the modified data envelopment analysis model into the distance function of the Malmquist–Luenberger index. Moreover, this study uses the global benchmark technology to formulate a two-stage model. To verify the validity of this model, a model application is conducted on an automotive spare components company in China. Findings: The results identify the unique status of dual-role factors based on the global optimality of the model and then categorize inefficient suppliers in an individual evaluation cycle. In addition, each supplier is projected on a frontier curve after obtaining the improved data. Furthermore, through the status plot of M-L and its components, this paper concludes that efficiency scale change is the main reason for the gap in ecological performance between different suppliers.

However, little is known about the effect of consumer awareness on customer orientation and loyalty. The purpose of this paper is to examine how changes in consumers’ awareness of interest rates in Korea can influence customer loyalty, considering banks’ efforts to improve customer orientation. The authors explicitly rationalize the fact that consumers’ awareness of interest rates can play an important role in moderating the strength of the relationship between customer orientation and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from participants (n=327) who had made banking transactions based on their real income in Seoul. Participants mainly focused on personal loans and debts, and most people had banked with a specific bank (one of the main Korean banks) for longer than three years. The authors tested the effect of interest rates using two methodologies, namely, a field study using SEM and an experimental design. Findings: The study tested these relationships with survey data and two simulated experiments. The findings indicated that the influence of customer orientation on customer loyalty decreased with the increase in loan interest rate awareness. Moreover, the customer orientation-loyalty link weakened with the increase in awareness of central bank base rates. Conversely, the awareness that loan rates were decreasing strengthened the relationship. Research limitations/implications: Banks need to know the importance of periodic consultation services with valuable consumers who transact with one or more banks because changes in the consumer awareness of interest rates influence customer loyalty (or switching behavior), particularly when their awareness of loan interest rates increases.

A conceptual structural model is developed to investigate the impact of service quality, perceived service fairness and convenience on customer service satisfaction. The impact of service satisfaction and brand trust on word of mouth (WOM) is also explored, and the study assesses the mediating effect of customer service satisfaction on the relationship between service quality and WOM. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a questionnaire-based survey of 259 users of automobile maintenance and repair centres were analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings indicate that service quality dimensions (reliability, responsiveness and empathy), perceived service fairness and convenience are positively associated with customer service satisfaction, and that service satisfaction and trust positively influence WOM. The findings support the mediating effect of service satisfaction on the relationship between reliability and responsiveness and WOM. Research limitations/implications: The study’s main limitation is the cross-sectional design, which limits the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications: To ensure customer satisfaction and generate trust and WOM, automobile maintenance and repair service centres should improve reliability, responsiveness and empathy, as well as perceived service fairness and convenience. Originality/value: The study demonstrates that the reliability and responsiveness dimensions of service quality are the most significant predictors of customer service satisfaction in the automobile maintenance and repair industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Satisfaction; Service quality; Structural equation modelling; Trust; Word of mouth marketing",""

While previous literature confirms that product innovation triggers premium segment emergence, and vice versa, there is no satisfactory explanation regarding the underlying mechanisms that drive the mutual shaping of premium segments and product innovation. This paper attempts to address this gap in literature. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a cognitive model of technology trajectories and empirically examines the Japanese rice cooker market using a mixed-methods approach. The methods used consist of content analyses of newspaper articles and press releases and case analyses of manufacturers' new product development. Findings: Content analyses show the emergence of a premium segment within the Japanese rice cooker market as well as a simultaneous change in technology trajectories. Case analyses subsequently reveal the mechanisms that link the premium segment emergence and technology trajectory changes. The analyses also explore this linkage in detail; market actors' technological frames and interpretation processes mediate the mutual shaping of the premium segment and product innovations. Originality/value: This study presents quantitative evidence indicating the emergence of a premium segment and changes in technology trajectories. It provides a qualitative explanation for the linkage between these two phenomena, which may serve as a viable foundation for future research in premium strategy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cognitive perspective; Premium segment; Pricing strategy; Product innovation; Technological frame; Technology trajectory",""

"Exploration of patriotic brand image: its antecedents and impacts on purchase intentions","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096213832&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2019-0660&partnerID=40&md5=da279c24d0cd19ba2f7f48dcf42aefea","Purpose: The recent rise of economic nationalism intensifies consumers' patriotic attitudes toward goods or services and thus encourages enterprises to build patriotic brand images. Nevertheless, few studies have discussed how a patriotic brand image is developed. The purpose of this study aims to fill the gap by examining whether and how a positive corporate image helps a domestic brand establish a patriotic brand image and in turn enhances consumers' purchase intentions in relation to domestic brand products. Design/methodology/approach: A research model identifying the antecedents of patriotic brand image (the components of corporate image) is proposed and empirically tested using structural equations with a questionnaire investigating Taiwanese college students' attitudes toward Taiwanese smartphone brands. Three competing models are also proposed and tested to confirm the appropriateness of the research model. Findings: In addition to the widely recognized impact of perceived quality on purchase intentions, patriotic brand image is found to be effective in enhancing local consumers' intentions to purchase domestic brand products. To shape a patriotic brand image, perceived quality, perceived corporate ability and perceived corporate integrity are the direct approaches, while perceived corporate social responsibility works through perceived corporate integrity, and perceived employer brand enhances only perceived corporate social responsibility. Research limitations/implications: Potential sampling (college students) and subject (smartphones) biases may limit the generalizability of the presented findings Practical implications: While patriotic appeals have long been used in marketing communication, they are also likely to precipitate negative brand associations (e.g. nationalism), offending consumers in other countries. By contrast, the development of a positive corporate image serves as an implicit and neutral approach to building a patriotic brand image and can help domestic brands attract local consumers with less harm to foreign markets. Originality/value: This study is one of notably few studies discussing patriotic brand image and its impacts on purchase intentions. This study also identifies the antecedents of patriotic brand image and how each of them affects patriotic brand image. The findings can help guide domestic brands in building a patriotic brand image. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer patriotism; Corporate ability; Corporate integrity; Domestic brand; Employer brand; Patriotic brand",""
"Grit: the good, the bad and the ugly","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096208282&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2020-0271&partnerID=40&md5=be226540d277b0d55a5024fcc720f9c9","Purpose: The concept of grit has been receiving increased attention in recent years. Grit is a trait that enables individuals to persevere while facing challenges and obstacles in life, sometimes “winning at any cost”. The purpose of the study is to understand how ethical views may vary among different groups of people segmented on grittiness. Our key argument is that grittier segment is more inclined towards Machiavellian factors (amorality, desire for control, desire for status, distrust of others) and materialism. Design/methodology/approach: Data derived from self-administered questionnaires completed by convenience samples of Indonesians living in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), a region commonly considered as the miniature of Indonesia. Turning to market segmentation tools (n = 467), we first segment people based on their level of grittiness and, subsequently, investigate each segment's perception towards various Machiavellian factors (amorality, desire for control, distrust of others) and materialistic attitudes. Findings: The study identified three segments of grittiness: The Least Gritty (the Good), The More Gritty (the Bad) and The Most Gritty (the Ugly). The results of this study showed the dark side of grit. Individuals with higher grit traits are more likely to behave unethically which could be referred to as “bad” and “ugly”. To help them succeed, cheating and lying are more likely considered acceptable by gritty individuals compared to less gritty “good” individuals. Practical implications: Merely focussing on grit–be it grit promotion or training–may produce individuals who achieve success at all costs and disregard ethical values. An implication from the study is not to discourage developing grit in individuals but instead to add and emphasise ethical components. This implication is especially critical for educators and managers developing grit as a part of their activities. Originality/value: The results of this study will have important theoretical implications and managerial implications educators balancing the consequences of teaching grit, but also for managers interested in understanding employees' level of grit within their workplaces along with ethical considerations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Grit; Machiavellian; Materialism; Segmentation",""
"The impact of online reviews on product returns","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099753045&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2020-0074&partnerID=40&md5=26db6cc9b59761205d7cfa33b1c8b87e","Purpose: The value of online reviews has been well documented by academics and practitioners. However, to maximise the benefits of consumer reviews, online sellers must avoid the negative consequences associated with customer feedback, such as reputation loss, or product returns after purchase. In developing a better understanding of the relationships between online reviews and their potential for negative impacts, this research aims to explore product returns. Through a quantitative model, this research demonstrates why online reviews can result in product return behaviours. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses were tested via two studies. In Study 1, the authors examine the direct effects of review valence and review volume on product returns by analysing secondary data on 4,995 stores on China's Taobao.com. Study 2 further extends and validates the findings of Study 1 with a survey sample of 795 participants across several online shopping platforms. This analysis examines the mechanics and conditions that influence the relationships between online reviews and product returns through partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that both review valence (i.e. average star ratings) and the number of reviews can increase the probability of product returns due to the high expectations that result from positive online reviews. Further, the effect of review valence on product returns is stronger for first-time purchasers at a store. In terms of mitigation, the analysis shows that bilateral communications between sellers and buyers can temper the unrealistic expectations set by positive reviews, leading to fewer product returns. Originality/value: This research adds to the literature on online reviews by exploring the negative consequences of online reviews and the role they play in online purchasing decisions. The findings also provide direct evidence as to why online reviews can result in more product returns, adding clarity to extant research which contains conflicting conclusions as to how online reviews affect product return behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bilateral communications; Consumer expectations; Consumer experience; Online reviews; Product returns",""

Design/methodology/approach: Using 548 effective samples, this study employed structural equation modeling to test proposed hypotheses. Findings: Based on levels of perceived self-responsibility, post-purchase regret due to forgone alternatives, under consideration and over consideration was positively associated with customer complaining, whereas post-purchase regret due to significance change exhibited no such correlation. Moreover, a higher level of risk aversion increased the effect of utilitarian motivation on post-purchase regret due to over consideration but decreased this effect on post-purchase regret due to under consideration. Research limitations/implications: First, regret can positively influence consumer complaints. Next, consumers are unlikely to complain to third parties unless they experience strong action regret. Finally, risk aversion can alleviate or reinforce the effect of utilitarian motivation on regret. Future research could examine the customer group who feel less or no regret of their purchases to contribute to regret theory. Practical implications: To reduce regret among such consumers, marketers are advised to apply precision marketing techniques to reach their target consumers. Second, to forestall customer regret due to forgone alternatives, sellers should proactively provide target buyers with information regarding their products and those of competing brands. Third, another method of minimizing regret is to ensure that consumers’ risk-aversion activities are effective. Originality/value: This study empirically demonstrated a multidimensional scale of regret to illuminate the multicausal role of regret in relation to consumers’ complaining and risk-aversion behaviors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Complaining; Emotion; Post-purchase regret; Risk aversion; Self-blaming",""

The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a model for evaluating the consumers’ perceived quality of à la carte restaurants and to review the impact on their attitudes and behavioural intentions. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted with 508 university students in Brazil, and the data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The results showed that global perceived quality (GPQ), which is a multidimensional construct with nine dimensions, directly impacted emotions, the satisfaction and perceived value by consumers. This satisfaction positively affected word-of-mouth (WOM) communication and the propensity for loyalty. Price did not have a statistically significant impact on customer satisfaction. Originality/value: This paper, based on the structural model herein proposed and tested, is the most complete of all available articles in the literature about à la carte restaurants, as this study contemplates a greater number of perceived quality factors. In addition, both tangible and intangible perceived quality factors were included in this tested model, which goes beyond what is typically contemplated in other such. Moreover, none of the existing articles in the existing literature simultaneously observed the relationship between perceived quality, positive and negative emotions, price, perceived value, satisfaction, WOM communication and propensity to loyalty.

Design/methodology/approach: A research model with five hypotheses was proposed. Data were collected from 911 Taiwanese consumers who had a minimum of two years of multichannel shopping experience. The consumers were asked to complete a survey about their experience with MSDQ. Structural equation modelling was adopted to analyse the data. Findings: The results of the analysis suggest that MSDQ positively impacts customer experiences, which in turn influence their continued engagement intentions. Furthermore, the analysis found that customer involvement positively moderates the effects of MSDQ on customer experiences. Research limitations/implications: This study adopts the customer experience view to examine the effect of a holistic MSDQ design (including information transparency and accessibility and channel integration) on continued engagement intentions. By integrating a different conceptual lens, this study investigates the relationships among multichannel service quality, customer experiences and customer involvement, which adds alternative insights to the existing findings. Practical implications: Managers must provide approaches to enhance the customer experiential values of utilitarianism, aesthetic appeal and playfulness; facilitate the information flow to be transparent and easily accessible; and provide different degrees of service based on customers’ experiences with their multichannel services to satisfy all consumers’ shopping needs.

The results reveal the implications of different product innovativeness for leaders of NPD projects in achieving successful outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of NPD team members who were involved in NPD. Participants were employees from different departments, including research and development (R&D), quality control (QC), production and marketing. These individuals worked in innovative manufacturing industries such as automotive and auto parts and electronics. Findings: Results show that transformational leadership has a significantly positive effect on new product success and NPD speed, whereas transactional leadership has a significantly negative effect on both outcomes. Furthermore, the positive impact of transformational leadership on new product success for high innovativeness is stronger than for low innovativeness. In addition, the negative impact of transactional leadership on both new product success and speed for high innovativeness is stronger than for low innovativeness. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample size was fairly small because of limited access to middle-level management and low willingness to share information involving the firms' production. Second, since both transformational and transactional leaderships are multidimensional, each dimension may affect performance in different ways. Third, the respondents were mainly from a single department which could omit varying perspectives. Practical implications: The research findings provide recommendations on how different leadership styles support team members to effectively perform NPD tasks in either high or low innovativeness. Originality/value: This study extends the theory of leadership by providing a holistic understanding of how leadership styles affect NPD performance. It also extends the understanding of how the impact of two different leadership styles on NPD performance is moderated by product innovativeness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","New product development; Product innovativeness; Transactional leadership; Transformational leadership",""

However, most of the research done in the past has mainly centralized around western societies. To make it even more interesting is the fact that the significance of customer emotions has been ignored by the previous studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper to explore the impacts of CED on loyalty intentions along with exploring the moderating role of customer emotions (positive emotions and negative emotions). Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 661 Chinese banking customers was collected by making the use of store-intercept survey design. The gathered data were then utilized to empirically validate the proposed model by making the use of hierarchical moderated regression. Findings: Loyalty intentions were found to be driven by emotions of Chinese banking customers. Consequently, in order to better forecast the loyalty intentions of the customers, the emotional aspect is vital and therefore should be incorporated along with other cognitive aspects (value equity, brand equity and relationship equity). Practical implications: The managers of the banks should make every effort to make the visit of their customers as pleasant as possible as the emotional responses of customers have a significant impact on the formation of loyalty intentions.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on dynamic capability view and contingency theory, the study conceptualizes a moderated mediation model to investigate the underlying influence of process integration (PI), supply flexibility and product-related complexity on supply chain agility and the subsequent effect of supply chain agility on firm’s business performance. Survey data from a sample of 148 firms, in the garment manufacturing industry, in Pakistan were analyzed using partial least square methods. Findings: The results revealed that supply flexibility (i.e. volume and mix) mediates the effect of PI on supply chain agility. Supply chain agility, in turn, influences a firm’s business performance. Furthermore, the competence‒capability framework is not consistent across the varying degrees of product complexity such as product complexity hinders the effect of supply flexibility on supply chain agility, whereas it amplifies the impact of PI on supply chain agility. The conditional indirect effects suggest that the indirect effect of PI on supply chain agility through supply flexibility becomes stronger when product complexity is high.

Design/methodology/approach: This study utilises a mixed-method approach. First, a study with a non-experimental causal design was performed with 248 cell phone users characterised by exhibiting sustainable consumption behaviours. Subsequently, 13 in-depth interviews were conducted to obtain a better understanding of the switching intention. Findings: For sustainable consumers, green purchase behaviour and attitude towards remanufactured products have a significant effect on their switching intention. These results contrast with previous literature, where it was found that price differences, government incentives and environmental benefits were significant for consumers in general. Practical implications: Switching intention towards remanufactured products in sustainable consumers may be encouraged by influencing factors related to green behaviour, rather than factors related to the market (e.g. reducing price, specific labelling or governmental regulations). Moreover, sustainable consumers could be regarded as the first adopters of remanufactured products.

The study simultaneously explores the effect of telepresence on shoppers’ perceptions of product authenticity and their trust in retailers, key drivers of behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Two experimental conditions were utilized. Geographic cues depicted a famous shopping district in the retailer’s country (South Korea) or the shopper’s country (China). Study participants were female Chinese consumers in their 20s and 30s who had purchased Korean fashion products in the past (n=236). Structural equation modeling was conducted using AMOS 21.0. Findings: Results indicate that participants in the “retailer’s country” experimental condition experienced higher telepresence and greater perceptions of product authenticity. Furthermore, telepresence increased participants’ trust in the retailer and perceived product authenticity, which led to positive behavioral intentions. Practical implications: Findings offer important implications for cross-border online retailing. First, results suggest a highly successful tactic for enhancing shoppers’ perceptions of product authenticity and retailer trust on a cross-border platform. Second, cross-border online business professionals should focus on the role of telepresence. Finally, this study provides insight about Chinese cross-border shoppers.

"Ride-hailing apps' continuance intention among different consumer groups in Indonesia: the role of personal innovativeness and perceived utilitarian and hedonic value","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094855644&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2019-0332&partnerID=40&md5=ec75f42d2039f23b5567c02495075d4e","Purpose: This research aims to examine the relationship of personal innovativeness, perceived value (consisting of perceived utilitarian and hedonic value) and continuance intention in the context of ride-hailing apps and to investigate consumer behaviour differences between metro and non-metro consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The survey sample included 402 consumers of popular ride-hailing apps in Indonesia to test the research framework. Then, PLS-SEM-based software was utilised to examine the hypothesised relationship. Findings: The findings indicate that the effect of personal innovativeness on continuance intention in using ride-hailing apps will operate through the full mediation role of perceived hedonic and utilitarian value, respectively. The findings also show that there are consumer behaviour differences between metro and non-metro consumers, in which the cognitive belief of consumers in the metro areas regarding the usage of ride-hailing apps is more related to hedonic value. Research limitations/implications: The variety of respondent demographic profiles in this research is limited in that most of the research respondents are students. In such a case, the study may face the issue of generalisation. Originality/value: This research generates an extended idea of the information technology continuance model by validating the important role of perceived hedonic and utilitarian value as an integral part of the model and strengthens the insights that Indonesia has consumer behaviour differences regarding technology-based services, particularly ride-hailing apps, between metro and non-metro consumers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; Multi-group analysis; Perceived hedonic value; Perceived utilitarian value; Personal innovativeness; Ride-hailing apps; Sharing economy",""
"Effect of country image and materialism on the quality evaluation of Korean products: Empirical findings from four countries with varying economic development status","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073946842&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2018-0456&partnerID=40&md5=3d5942ff3fa288a026404078e6fe5094","Purpose: It is critical to understand how global consumers evaluate the quality of Asian products while marketing Asian products in the global marketplaces. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of Korea’s macro and micro country image and global consumers’ materialism level on the quality evaluation of Korean cosmetics among consumers in four countries. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 900 participants were collected from consumers aged 20 or older living in economically developed countries (the USA and France) and economically developing countries (China and Vietnam) via professional online survey firms. Multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Findings: Along with the direct effect of macro and micro country image and materialism on product quality evaluation, a moderating effect of materialism and the respective country was discovered. Subsequently, the effect of macro country image on quality evaluation was found to be only significant in the USA and France and not in China and Vietnam. In contrast, the impact of micro country image was robust across all four countries. Furthermore, the effect of materialism on product quality was significant only in Vietnam. This implies that materialistic consumers in emerging markets might have favorable perceptions regarding the quality of Korean cosmetics. Originality/value: This study advances country image research by providing new theoretical and managerial implications for countries whose image is less distinctive with respect to the effective marketing of products by the destination countries’ development status and consumers’ familiarity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Country image; Korean cosmetics; Materialism; Product quality",""
"Social media and Chinese consumers’ environmentally sustainable apparel purchase intentions","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063001663&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2017-0183&partnerID=40&md5=5a3173d0b39df06cfdaeec962c81aae6","Purpose: Social media and sustainability are changing Chinese consumers’ consumption behavior in notable ways. Few apparel industry sustainability efforts are enforced or well known in China. As China operates its own social media sites, it is necessary to study Chinese social media, rather than Western types, in order to understand its influence on Chinese consumer behavior with regard to sustainability. By extending the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the prototype willingness model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how Chinese consumers were taught their environmentally sustainable apparel (ESA) consumption behavior through social media, and also how the influence of peers affected their purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 238 survey responses were collected and analyzed from a Chinese research firm in 2016. In accord with the study objectives, an exploratory factor analysis was first conducted, and then a two-step analysis of a structural equation model was employed for hypothesis testing. To test the significance of hypothesized mediated effects, a bootstrap procedure with 2,000 bootstrap samples from the original data was used to compute bias-corrected 95% CI for indirect effects. Moreover, hierarchical regressions were demonstrated to verify the unique contribution of social media influence. Findings: The study findings support the previous literature that indicated positive attitudes toward environmentally sustainable purchasing behavior increased as Chinese consumers learned about social and environmental issues. Also, results of the analysis revealed that Chinese consumers’ engagement with social media and their peers were important social influences that were directly tied to increasing sustainable apparel purchase intentions. Originality/value: By extending two grand theories of the prototype willingness model theory and the TRA, this study underlines a novel link between the influence of social media and ESA purchase intentions among Chinese consumers. Results are valuable in a global context as it is one of only a few studies to explore Chinese consumers’ purchase intentions of ESA through an exclusive social media platform – WeChat – in China. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apparel; Chinese consumers; Influence of peers; Social media; Sustainability",""
"Straight eye for the queer ad: attitudes, skepticism, inferences of manipulative intent and willingness to buy","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095808563&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2020-0124&partnerID=40&md5=0f8ac3b764e28744f5d5f2098d874f75","Purpose: This study aims to provide a conceptual framework to investigate the effects of consumer attitudes toward brands and attitudes toward a series of fashion oriented print advertisements with and without homosexual themes, on consumer willingness to buy from brands. The influence of consumer skepticism and inferences of manipulative intent (IMI) as moderators between these variables is also investigated. This study also closes various research gaps identified within the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered survey instrument was designed using established scales to collect data through an online questionnaire. Fashion advertisements namely one advertisement representing homosexual content and one heterosexual advertisement were used in the study within subjects (e.g. male and female) design. Statistical techniques, specifically factor analysis, regressions and multiple regressions are used to analyze the data. Findings: The findings indicate significant and positive relationships between attitude toward the brand and advertisement as well as willingness to buy for both males and females. The moderation analyses noted that consumer skepticism enhanced the relationship between attitude toward the brand and attitude toward the advertisement, but weakened the relationship between attitude toward the advertisement and willingness to buy, only for the female cohort. Similarly, a weakening effect of IMI was noted on the relationship between attitude toward the advertisement and willingness to buy. Research limitations/implications: The current study contributes to the literature on homosexual imagery in advertising. In applying the persuasion knowledge model, the current study demonstrates the applicability of the model to homosexual themes in fashion advertising while accounting for the effects of consumer skepticism and IMI. Practical implications: The current research highlights the importance of accounting for gender differences when introducing homosexual themes in fashion advertisements. Heterosexual males and females differ in their attitudes toward homosexual themes in fashion advertising, as well as how skeptical they are with regards to the motives of the advertiser. While a great deal of acceptance is already present in today's society, these differences still need to be accounted for in future fashion advertising campaigns. Originality/value: The present study represents an examination of consumer responses to a series of fashion advertisements in Australia and provides useful implications to marketers of fashion products. The study further contributes to the literature on consumer skepticism and IMI with regards to cause-related advertising. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Homosexual imagery; Inferences of manipulative intent; LGBTQ; Skepticism",""
"Does consumer customization strategy always benefit the platform firm’s profit?","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066837828&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2018-0279&partnerID=40&md5=7f0091510fe52ae1480bcd868c363c2c","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the price decisions and profits of two firms in a competitive market in which one platform firm considers whether to adopt a consumer customization strategy. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops the consumer’s utility function, which captures consumers’ behavioural and emotional factors in the self-customizing process, and it adopts a game theory approach to analyze the equilibrium price and equilibrium profit for each firm. Findings: The results show that increased sensitivity in consumer customization might not benefit the platform, especially when the size of the consumer group deriving positive additional utility from the self-customizing process is small. Interestingly, if the consumer customization sensitivity is high, increasing sensitivity can benefit both firms by relaxing competition between them, while it can hurt consumer surplus. The study also further identifies the conditions under which platforms can adopt a consumer customization strategy. Research limitations/implications: Two major limitations of the study are that the model does not involve price discrimination or explore the value of adopting a consumer customization strategy in a vertically differentiated market. Practical implications: This study offers managerial insights for the platforms that intend to invest in a consumer customization strategy, including providing a more simple, more efficient self-customizing process for consumers; empowering consumers to broadcast their creations to a large network by social media technologies; addressing how to determine what consumers really need and want; and so on. Originality/value: Little research has been performed to analyze the impacts of adopting a consumer customization strategy on pricing decisions in a duopoly market by capturing consumers’ behavioural and emotional factors. While this study explores the above research issue, it also illustrates the effect of the adoption of a consumer customization strategy from a consumer surplus perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer customization; Pricing decision; Product customization; Production strategy; Self-customizing process",""

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the approach of the empirical study. Based on the literature review, a theoretical model of the impact of nostalgic emotion (NE) on brand trust and brand attachment is constructed and corresponding research hypotheses are proposed. Then nostalgia-themed restaurants are selected to complete a questionnaire survey, and SPSS22.0 and LISREL8.70 are used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. Findings: The results of the paper show that NE consists of four dimensions in the context of China: atmosphere nostalgia, interpersonal nostalgia, family nostalgia and personal nostalgia. Among these, NE has a significant positive impact on brand trust and brand attachment; further, brand trust has a significant positive impact on brand attachment and plays a partial mediating role in the impact of NE on the latter. Research limitations/implications: As the nostalgic restaurant industry is the research object, the theoretical model described here may be limited to this specific industry. The potential applicability of the theoretical model to other service industries requires further study. Practical implications: The results of the paper are helpful in building a good nostalgic experience, increasing consumer trust in restaurant brands, and strengthening the connection between NE and restaurant brand reconstruction. Social implications: The results of the paper on the impact of NE on brand trust and brand attachment provide a referential basis and guide for services’ companies (e.g. restaurants) to revitalize the services’ brands. Originality/value: The first contribution is that NE scale is constructed for the nostalgia-themed restaurants. The second contribution is that the paper reveals the mechanism of the impact of NE on brand trust and brand attachment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand attachment; Brand trust; Chinese consumers; Nostalgia-themed restaurants; Nostalgic emotion",""

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The study used quantitative surveys and employed purposeful sampling and rolling snowball surveys of consumers in Chinese fine dining restaurants in Taipei; 581 effective surveys were collected from the test subjects. The research tools included a plate colour appetite preference scale and a dining emotion scale. Findings: There were significant differences in age and gender in terms of appetite preference and plate colour. The plate colours with the highest appetite preference were gold, white and black. There were significant differences in plate colour appetite preference in terms of dining mood, with white and gold plates eliciting positive dining moods. Originality/value: Most academic papers have focused on studying plates in Western dining, while very few studies have focused on the colour of Chinese dining plates. The greatest contribution and value of this study is its discovery of the colour combination of dining plates that can elicit appetite preferences and positive dining emotions among diners in Chinese fine dining restaurants. This information can be used to stimulate positive dining emotions among consumers and help restaurateurs improve the level of dining aesthetics. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Appetite; Chinese fine dining restaurant; Dining emotions; Plate colour preferences",""

The authors discuss the complex interaction of factors that have contributed to the decline in reef ecosystems and the challenges presented by multiple industries operating within the GBR catchment area. The authors then discuss measures employed to address agricultural run-off, claimed to be a significant factor in declining reef water quality. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys of land managers were undertaken in partnership with two of the six natural resource management (NRM) organizations operating in areas adjacent to the GBR identified as having very high risk of natural and anthropogenic runoff. The sample population was obtained from a membership database within the two regions. Participants include land managers from the both regions who engaged in sugar cane production (Region 1 and Region 2, included in this paper) and cattle production (Region 2, to be reported later). Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed including open-ended responses. Findings: A large-scale study of land managers reveals several reasons for the lack of success at reducing agricultural run-off.

Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 used a single-factor, two-condition (distinctive pose and casual pose) between-subject design. Both Study 2a and Study 2b employed a single-factor, two-condition (distinctive pose, casual pose) between-subject design and tested the mediator of pose matchiness. Study 3 employed a 2 (pose condition: distinctive, casual)×2 (cognitive capacity: no load, load) between-subject design to test the moderator. All data were sourced from more than 600 respondents in China. Findings: Study 1 illustrated that the existence of a distinctive pose can lead to higher consumer attitudes regarding advertising stimuli and the endorsed brands as well as more positive behavioural intentions towards endorsed products. Study 2a and Study 2b replicated such finding and demonstrated that the feeling of pose matchiness mediates the relationship between celebrities’ pose and endorsement outcomes. Study 3 further revealed that the cognitive capacity moderates such a relationship, that is, that the effect of a distinctive pose is stronger (lesser) when audiences’ cognitive capacity is loaded (not loaded). Originality/value: Research efforts to date examining the nature of celebrity advertisement have been limited to celebrity’s faces and facial expressions. Little investigation in the marketing domain has considered the consequences of celebrities’ poses.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on previous literature and the characteristics of the smartphone purchase, this study identified one pushing, two pulling and five mooring factors. Online questionnaires were collected to test hypotheses using the structural equation modelling approach. An additional netnography study provides further support to the hypotheses. Findings: Results show that regret is a push factor that enhances consumers' switching intentions. Moreover, two pull factors, subjective norms and alternative attractiveness positively influence consumers' switching intentions. Finally, switching costs, emotional commitment and brand community engagement are mooring factors that negatively affect brand-switching intention, whereas consumers' variety seeking has a positive effect.

This assumption, however, may not always hold true. Employing equity theory and Veblen’s theory of the leisure class, this study tested two moderating effects to ascertain the relationship between perceived price and purchase intention. The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to examine the relationship between perceived price and willingness to purchase; second, to discover the effects of two moderators (perceived price fairness and vanity) on this relationship; and third, to compare how these moderating effects differ by consumers’ brand familiarity. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 287 usable data sets were collected from college students in the southeastern region of the USA. Findings: The findings showed no negative relationship between perceived price and willingness to purchase. Only perceived price fairness was found to moderate the perceived price–purchase intention relationship. Furthermore, the moderating effect of price fairness was only confirmed in the high brand familiarity group, while the moderating effect of vanity was only confirmed in the low brand familiarity group. Research limitations/implications: Generalization of the findings is cautioned because findings may vary by demographic backgrounds. Practical implications: Since purchase intention increases when price is fair even though price is high, marketers should put efforts into promoting and creating the perception of fair price of their products and brands. Originality/value: This study extends price perception research by incorporating two theories (equity theory and Veblen’s theory of the leisure class) that help further elaborate the relationship between perceived price and willingness to purchase. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer perception; Marketing management; Pricing",""

The rising number of female online shoppers has compelled the analysts and online vendors to believe that understanding the attitude and behaviour of the female consumers is very crucial for their growth. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model is proposed that expands the theory of reasoned action (TRA) with three additional constructs, namely, trust, convenience and customer service. The proposed model is examined with the help of questionnaire responses collected from 909 online shoppers from India. Findings: The paper empirically shows that there is a significant influence of attitude, convenience, customer service and subjective norm on the female consumer’s intention to buy online. Customer service acts as the most crucial factor in influencing the attitude of female consumers towards online shopping. The paper also points out that trust does not directly affect the female’s intention to shop online but indirectly influences it through attitude. Practical implications: The paper has significant implications for practitioners. First, the results advocate that convenience and customer service are the vital antecedents to both behavioural intention and behavioural attitude. Second, the paper also showcases that trust influences behavioural intention indirectly through attitude, stressing the need for the online retailers to develop consumers’ trust in online shopping. Originality/value: The paper examines TRA framework in the context of female online shopping, while earlier studies have concentrated completely on efficiency-based software tools like word processing, spreadsheets, etc. The integration of the three constructs – trust, convenience and customer service – in the TRA framework has not been studied in the past. The interaction effect of the different elements of customer services on the female consumer behaviour has never been examined in the previous research works. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Convenience; Customer service; Female; India; Intention; Online shopping; Subjective norm; TRA; Trust",""

Design/methodology/approach: Studies on the relationship between selection attributes and satisfaction per golf facility type were retrieved from the Korean Citation Index. Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2, the effect sizes (ESs) for the following relationships were calculated: between selection attributes and satisfaction with golf facilities in general; between selection attributes and satisfaction per distinct golf facility types (outdoor golf courses vs screen golf facilities); and between the sub-factors of selection attributes and satisfaction per golf facility. Findings: Medium ESs were found between selection attributes and satisfaction with golf facilities in general (0.394), outdoor golf courses (0.336) and screen golf facilities (0.370). The choice attribute factors of accessibility, employees and concession had large effects on golfers’ satisfaction with outdoor golf courses, while services and concession had large effects on golfers’ satisfaction with screen golf facilities. Originality/value: Among many Asian countries, golf is extremely popular and attracts more business than other sports; however, changes in consumer viewpoints and business trends necessitate consistent refinement.

Sharing economy requires trust in strangers. Based on trust transfer theory and a dyadic conceptualization of trust from cognitive to affective, the purpose of this study is to examine trust building through the use of Didi, a third-party, ride-sharing platform that mediates exchanges among strangers. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling (SEM) results based on 242 observations indicate that the platform functions as an important enabler of trust, which influences a consumer's behavioral intention. Findings: Specifically, Didi's reputation and security assurance have a positive influence on passengers' cognitive trust in drivers. There is also evidence that the interaction as mediated by the app between passengers and drivers helps the formation of affective trust, while the results do not support a relationship between cognitive and affective trust. Originality/value: The research findings address trust transference between participants in the sharing economy and its effects, which have significant theoretical and practical implications and offer opportunities for future research in other sectors of the sharing economy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affective trust; Behavioral intention; Cognitive trust; Ride sharing; Trust transfer",""

This research explains how reciprocal expectations behind the two relationships trigger gift givers' disparate behavioral goals and further determine their gift choices. Design/methodology/approach: The current work uses three lab experiments (N = 482) and one consumer survey (N = 422) to collect Chinese gifting data. Multiple data-analysis methods – crosstab analysis, ANOVA, linear regression and bootstrapping procedures – confirm the hypotheses. Findings: Gift givers distinguish communal and exchange recipients. When selecting gifts for communal (exchange) recipients, people depended more strongly on rational analyses (intuition), preferring products superior on cognitive (affective) attributions. Further, givers primed to be rational decision-makers by anticipating that recipients would evaluate the gifts immediately in their presence, regardless of the communal or exchange context, preferred cognitively superior products. Practical implications: From a managerial perspective, marketers can make targeted recommendations by highlighting the appropriate attribute dimension (cognitive or affective) after learning givers' reciprocal expectations. Originality/value: This work contributes to the gift-giving literature by revealing the direct link between gifting goals and gift choices, extending the understanding of consumers' gift-selection strategies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision strategy; Gift giving; Motive; Relational norms",""

Design/methodology/approach: A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to determine key factors in exhibition service quality, perceived value and satisfaction. A structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze the causal relationships among the factors. Findings: The empirical results indicated that service product and service environment were significantly and positively associated with all factors of perceived value, which in turn significantly influenced satisfaction. Service delivery, however, was associated only with emotional value. On the other hand, all three factors of perceived value significantly influenced general attendees’ satisfaction. The findings indicated perceived value as an important mediator between exhibition service quality and general attendees’ satisfaction. Originality/value: Clearly identifying specific trajectories from service quality to satisfaction through distinct perceived values can be a stepping stone to establishing effective and efficient marketing strategies for general attendees and customizing for their needs. The distinct and clear associations between service quality and perceived value can help exhibition organizers and practitioners understand the process of determining general attendees’ overall satisfaction. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Exhibition; Perceived value; Satisfaction; Service quality; Structural equation modeling",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a 2 (high/low product involvement) by 2 (high/low brand credibility) between-subjects factorial design experiment to test the hypotheses. Findings: Brand credibility has a positive effect on followers' attitudes toward advertising and products, and product involvement influences its moderation. PSI has salient positive effects on followers' attitudes and behavioral intention, regardless of high/low product involvement. Brand credibility mediates PSI's influence on celebrity endorsement. Research limitations/implications: The results reinforce the significant effect of PSI on endorsement effectiveness and brand credibility, show the influence of brand credibility and product involvement and show how their influence conditionally interacts with others. Practical implications: The corporate advertiser should prefer a high PSI celebrity as their endorser. The advertising message design on the microblog also deserves the attention of advertisers.

Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to the conditions of explicit advertising disclosure (e.g. #AD, #Sponsored) and subtle advertising disclosure (e.g. #ThankYou), and indicated their inference regarding influencers' recommendation motives and their own purchase intentions. One-way ANOVA analysis reveals the effect of advertising disclosure on consumers' purchase intentions and the PROCESS model indicates the mediating role of consumers' inferences regarding influencers' sincere recommendation intent. In Study 2, we implemented a 2 (explicit vs. subtle advertising disclosure) × 2 (moderate vs. large size of followers) between-subjects design, using a two-way ANOVA analysis. We analyzed the moderated mediation effect via the PROCESS model. Findings: Consumers are less inclined to purchase products when influencers express explicit advertising disclosures, compared to when the advertising disclosures are subtle (Study 1). These negative effects of advertising disclosure can be caused by consumers' inferences regarding influencers' sincere recommendation intent in terms of posting content (Studies 1 and 2). Additionally, the negative effect is particularly prominent when an influencer has a large (vs. moderate) number of followers (Study 2). Originality/value: By examining (1) the effects of explicit advertising disclosure on consumers' inference regarding influencers' persuasion motives and (2) the role of the influencer's number of followers, this research provides both theoretical and practical insights for understanding how best to implement influencer marketing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising disclosures; Inference regarding persuasion motives; Influencer marketing; Number of followers",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of monetary rewards on buyers’ purchase decisions and review contributions, as well as the impact on the seller’s price decisions and profit. Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider an online seller in a two-stage setting. Prior to Stage 1, the profit-maximizing seller sets the price and decides whether to offer a monetary reward secretly to motivate online reviews. Then, a continuum of buyers arrives and makes purchase decisions at the beginning of each stage. First-stage buyers may contribute reviews if they are satisfied, which will affect demand in the second stage. Using this analytical framework, the authors analyze the impact of monetary rewards. Findings: If the monetary reward is small, it decreases the seller’s profit and fails to generate more reviews. It also increases price, leading to a decline in total demand. Thus, when the reward is lower than a certain threshold, all buyers are worse off. Only when the reward exceeds the threshold are buyers who contribute reviews better off. Profit and total demand both increase in review quality, while the price may either increase or decrease in it. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze theoretically the impact of monetary rewards on buyers’ purchase decisions, review contributions and on online sellers’ decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Monetary rewards; Online reviews; Pricing; Review quality",""

Design/methodology/approach: In achieving this objective: the domain of the construct is specified; items are generated through qualitative interviews; the initial scale is purified, and finally it is validated. A survey yielded 1,002 complete, usable questionnaires in order to run the analysis. Data were splitted in half. First half was utilised for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the second half of the data were utilised to run confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The initial pool of item was tested using EFA via SPSS version 23. The CFA was conducted using SmartPLS-3.2.7 to confirm the dimensionality of sustainable consumption behaviour (SCB) scale. Findings: The EFA result revealed that SCB is a three-dimensional construct which is consisted of 24 items. The scale includes: quality of life; care for environmental well-being; and care for the future generation. The CFA confirmed the dimensionality, reliability and validity of the SCB scale. Research limitations/implications: This sustainable consumption scale can be used to determine individual’s level of responsibility towards living a quality life, environment welfare, as well as responsibility towards sustainability of the future generation. It is expected that this initiative will stimulate further research on regional, cultural and demographic differences in understanding sustainable development. Practical implications: Marketing practitioners may benefit from this scale by understanding the SCB of the socially and environmentally conscious consumers. It may eventually assist them to shape their strategies to meet the increasing demands of environmentalists. Originality/value: The notion of sustainable consumption received significant research attention in present decade. It is regarded as one of the major catalysts of the sustainable development. However, in most cases sustainable consumption phenomenon is discussed from greater economic perspective and not much effort has been paid to consider it from consumer’s perspective. Furthermore, there is a lack of readily available scale to measure this construct in the existing literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Care for the environmental well-being; Care for the future generation; Confirmatory factor analysis; Exploratory factor analysis; Quality of life; Sustainable consumption behaviour",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors review the major conceptual literature on both UTAUT and BT to identify their principal common factors. They examine the complementarity between UTAUT and BTRAN and further test the moderating effect of perceived helpfulness. The authors used the PLS technique for data analysis because this technique can test the direct and interaction effects. Findings: The complementarity between UTAUT and BTRAN strongly affects BT adoption intention. The authors further show that perceived helpfulness moderates the relationship between adoption intention and usage behavior. At high levels of perceived helpfulness, usage behavior increases rapidly with adoption intention. Originality/value: The results indicate that UTAUT is a valuable theory to identify the determinants of adoption intention, confirming its robustness in blockchain-enabled supply chain management.

This paper calls the problem as the capacitated pollution-routing problem with pickup and delivery (CPRPPD). The goal is to find an optimal route to minimize operational and environmental costs, as well as a set of optimal speeds over each arc, while respecting capacity constraints of vehicles and pickup sites. Design/methodology/approach: To solve this problem, this research proposes a two-phase heuristic algorithm by combining a hybrid ant colony optimization (HACO) in the first stage and a multiple population genetic algorithm in the second stage. First, the HACO is presented to find the minimal route solution and reduce distribution cost based on optimizing the speed over each arc. Findings: To verify the proposed CPRPPD model and algorithm, a real-world instance is conducted. Comparing with the scenario including HD service only, the scenario including both HD and PS option is more economical, which indicates that the CPRPPD model is more efficient. Besides, the results of speed optimization are significantly better than before. Practical implications: The developed CPRPPD model not only minimizes delivery time and reduces the total emission cost, but also helps logistics enterprises to establish a more complete distribution system and increases customer satisfaction. The model and algorithm of this paper provide optimal support for the actual distribution activities of logistics enterprises in low-carbon environment, and also provide reference for the government to formulate energy-saving and emission reduction policies. Originality/value: This paper provides a great space for the improvement of carbon emissions in the last mile distribution. The results show that the distribution arrangement including HD and PS services in the last mile adopting speed optimization can significantly reduce the carbon emission. Additionally, an integrated real-world instance is applied in this paper to illustrate the validity of the model and the effectiveness of this method. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Home delivery and pickup site services; Hybrid two-phase algorithm; Pollution-routing problem",""

The purpose of this paper is to establish the combined effects of motivation, store attributes and demographic factors on the predictive outcome of store format choice in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: A logistic regression model is used to determine the effect of these factors on the predictive outcome of traditional markets or supermarkets in purchasing non-food products or processed food products. Findings: The dichotomy between what supermarkets and traditional markets have to offer is simple but effective. Utilitarian-motivated shoppers are more likely to shop at traditional markets. They emphasize the need to buy products quickly, find a good price, with less travel time and hence lower travel costs. Hedonistic shoppers are motivated by feelings of happiness; they shop to relieve stress and to keep up with trends. Significant difference in store choice also exists between older and higher income shoppers. Research limitations/implications: Future research should examine the sociocultural dimensions of shopping at traditional stores by exploring how such shopping relates to, and is embedded in, the formation and changes of individual identity, especially in communities outside of Ho Chi Minh City where shoppers are almost entirely dependent on traditional stores. Practical implications: Traditional stores have the benefit of convenient location and savings in both time and travel costs.

"Determining factors of tourists’ loyalty to beach tourism destinations: a structural model","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070310611&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2018-0334&partnerID=40&md5=fd949e574cecf92a1490bf195d6f9a65","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate and develop an integrated theoretical relationship by including destination image and attitudes into the quality-value-satisfaction-loyalty paradigm in the context of beach tourism. Design/methodology/approach: A personal-administered survey was conducted using a convenient sampling technique to collect data from 601 tourists who had visited popular beach destinations in Bangladesh. Then, the structural relationships between the factors likely to affect tourist attitudes and loyalty were examined. Findings: The findings reveal that both service quality and perceived values have a direct effect on destination image, tourist attitudes and satisfaction. Additionally, destination image and satisfaction significantly affect tourist attitudes and loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The direct relationship of perceived service quality and perceived value with tourist loyalty was ignored in the model due to reporting consecutive indirect relationship between them in prior studies. Practical implications: These findings contribute to the extension of theoretical and managerial knowledge, especially in a beach tourism setting, where little research has been done to investigate the proposed relationships. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in providing theoretical and empirical evidence regarding the effect of service quality and perceived value, especially on destination image and tourist attitude to behaviour in the loyalty model, which has been scarcely examined in the prior tourism literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes to behaviour; Beach destination; Destination image; Destination loyalty",""
"Antecedents of students’ identification with university brands: A study on public universities in Iran","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062950552&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2018-0242&partnerID=40&md5=b4a58abd9eaefb1f3d1fb877051affd2","Purpose: Universities are increasingly encountering high levels of national and international competition. In order for universities to continue with their business success and expansion, they have relied on developing and maintaining a differentiated brand identity by improving their branding strategy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents of students’ identification with the brand of public universities in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: Sampling was done in multiple stages. In the first stage – using stratified sampling – students were recruited from distinct degree programs and universities based on the Iranian national demographic proportions. In the second stage, convenient sampling was used within each degree program category. For data collection, the interviewer distributed questionnaires among students regardless of age and gender. The number of questionnaires distributed in each university (i.e. the sample size in each university) was determined using the number of students in the country and percentage of students at each university. Findings: The results showed support for the hypothesized positive relationship between brand identification and the antecedent factors including prestige, interorganizational and intraorganizational competition. On the other hand, the results showed no significant relationship between brand identification and the antecedent factors including distinctiveness and memorable experience. Outcomes (i.e. word-of-mouth, active engagement and loyalty) of brand identification were also tested and their relationships with brand identification are supported. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted in the higher education sector in one cosmopolitan Iranian city (i.e. Tehran) to which Iranians from other cities travel to for studying. Thus, the results of this survey include a variety of sub-cultures. In the future, a study that incorporates all major metropolitan cities of Iran may increase the generalizability of the findings. Unrelated to the purpose of this study, a future research study may extend the currently studied geographical dimensions and examine the antecedents of students’ identification with the brand of public universities across different nations using a cross-cultural approach. Practical implications: A study of the antecedents of students’ identification with the university brand can provide a guide for universities to manage their brand and marketing strategies. Managers of higher education institutions can take important steps in establishing a link between students and university brands. Managers can highlight interorganizational competitions. The authors recommended universities publicize and honor students’ success in academic competitions on the university website, via ceremonies dedicated to the student winners, and using print banners that identifies their name and achievement, among other mediums. Additionally, competitions can be promoted among students through professors and motivational speeches from recognized leaders. Originality/value: Results revealed that brand prestige of public universities positively affects students’ identification. This study highlights the importance of national and international rankings of universities and the sensitivity of students to such rankings. Undoubtedly, this is evident in Iranian students’ behavior in selecting their university. Additionally, this study showed that brand distinctiveness of public universities does not significantly affect students’ identification with the university brand. Further examination is recommended to help explain this finding and a cross-cultural comparison will assist in this endeavor. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand identification; Brand personality congruence; University brand; Value congruence",""

In addition, it examines the moderating effects of gender and past experience on the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected, using an on-site survey, from spectators (n=349) who attended the men’s or women’s basketball tournaments of the 2016 William Jones Cup held in Taiwan. Findings: The results showed that perceived event prestige partially mediated the relationship between sport involvement and attendance intention of sporting events. Moreover, the moderating effects of gender and experience were found in the proposed model. Specifically, male spectators’ involvement had a significantly stronger influence on perceived event prestige, and, in turn, their perception of event prestige played a more significant role in influencing attendance intention. Also, sport involvement was more important in predicting attendance intention for experienced spectators whereas the prestige of the event was more important for first-time spectators. Originality/value: This study suggests that sport event organizers need to employ different strategies in developing the subsequent editions of the event and retaining fans’ interest in the sport. Specifically, event organizers need to enhance the prestige of the sporting event through effective marketing communication to attract first-time spectators to the event. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attendance intention; Event marketing; Perceived event prestige; Sport event; Sport involvement; Sport spectatorship",""

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed conceptual model is well grounded in the extensive literature from e-tailing as well as retailing domain and to assess the plausibility of the model. Total 246 female online apparel shoppers were surveyed from an Indian university and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling through SmartPLS. Findings: The outcomes of the study indicate that the e-customer may derive a substantial share of shopping assistance and service interface through product assortment offered by e-tailing sites. Customer-perceived performance of this e-shopping process – a crucial element of e-tail servicescape – directly affects the shopping assistance, along with order fulfillment capability of retail scope. Research limitations/implications: The study used a sample of graduate students at a north-west university in India, which limits the generalizability of the research to other consumer groups. The paper links a significant body of literature within a conceptually developed framework and identifies key research areas in the e-tailing realm. Practical implications: By better understanding the role of product assortment as a value-added feature in online value co-creation process, the e-tail managers can leverage the proposed integrated capability to improve e-tailing performance and customer outcomes in the form of business. Social implications: With rapid advancements in internet-led communication, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era of e-tail innovations around us which is expected to change the way people experience shopping.

This research aims to investigate whether the influence of “fit” to individuals’ goal pursuit strategies on the effectiveness of advertisement frames can intensify persuasion to consume healthy (virtue) foods or restrain the consumption of unhealthy (vice) foods in health promotion. Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted to investigate how goal-framed messages for different food types affect consumer decision making by moderating regulatory focus. Findings: The results demonstrate that the compatibility between the mere exposure to virtue (vice) food in a negative (positive) frame drives the effectiveness of a given goal framing. However, when additional regulatory focus is added, the fit in the vice/promotion and virtue/prevention condition causes the effect of framing to disappear. Moreover, the unfit in the virtue/promotion and vice/prevention condition suppresses the virtue (vice) preference in the positive (negative) frame. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that under different valence framing, advertising messages provide different amounts of persuasion in virtue/vice conditions and the moderation effect of regulatory fit on framing to influence virtue/vice food preference. Practical implications: Public policy executives and marketers can increase the likelihood that consumers will make healthy food choices by fitting goals to strengthen persuasion. The unfitted goal orientation between food and regulatory focus enhances the framing effect leading to food preference changes. Originality/value: The framing effect disappears when additional regulatory fit the food type, but is enhanced when additional regulatory focus does not fit the food type. By bringing fit into the frame and the virtue/vice food type, this research extends the notion of regulatory fit into three pairs of given goal orientations on the persuasiveness of message framing to health-related communication.

Design/methodology/approach: Through a series of multiple linear regression models, this study examined the direct and interaction effects of innovation-driven polices and firm characteristics on R&D investment for sport firms listed on the New Third Board in China. Findings: Results showed that financing constraints and certification as a high-tech enterprise were not themselves significant predictors of R&D investment; instead, the number of R&D staff and a firm's total assets were identified as key internal factors predicting the level of a firm's R&D investment. Other effective policy tools for stimulating Chinese sport firms' R&D investments included pre-tax deductions of R&D expenses, government R&D subsidies and income tax relief for high-tech enterprises, although their effects were heterogeneous. Research limitations/implications: This study observes a new theoretical discovery that when the financing constraints do not limit R&D investment, innovation-driven strategies remain effective tools to stimulate the R&D investment of sports firms.

Based on data from pre-communist China (1912–1949), product hybridization – defined as a process or strategy that generates symbols, designs, behaviors and cultural identities that blend local and global elements – emerges as a popular intermediate strategy worthy of further inquiry. After examining the mechanisms and processes underlying this strategy, a schema for classifying product hybridization strategies is developed and illustrated. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Critical historical research method is applied to historical data and historical “traces” from pre-communist China’s corporate documents, memoirs, posters, advertisements, newspapers and secondhand sources. Findings: Strategic interactions between domestic and foreign companies in pre-communist China fostered products and a city (Shanghai) containing Chinese and non-Chinese elements. Informed by historical traces and data from pre-communist China (1912-1949), a 2 × 2 classification schema relating company type (i.e. foreign or domestic) to values spectrum endpoint (i.e. domestic vs foreign) was formulated. This schema reflects the value of communication, negotiation and cultural (inter)penetration that accompanies cross-culture product flows. Research limitations/implications: Cross-culture marketing strategies meant to help companies satisfy diverse marketplace interests can induce a mélange of product design elements. Because product hybridization reflects reciprocity between domestic and foreign companies that embodies multiple interests and contrasting interpretations of product meanings, researchers should examine globalization and localization synergistically. Practical implications: Strategies adopted by domestic and foreign companies in pre-communist China (1912–1949) can help contemporary companies design effective cross-culture marketing strategies in a global marketplace infused with competing meanings and interests. Originality/value: Examining historical strategies adopted in pre-communist China (1912–1949) can inform contemporary marketers’ intuitions.

The purpose of this paper is to propose that, regarding Mexican consumers, the “comparison-based perceived attribute performance” (CAP) approach is a better predictor of outcomes, such as satisfaction, value and loyalty, compared with the traditional measurement of “non-comparison-based perceived attribute performance” (NCAP). These two forms of assessing attribute-level performance may be considered as different constructs. Design/methodology/approach: Using these two approaches, empirical tests were performed to attribute performance measurement and were conducted on products from two different categories: tequila and liquid dishwashing detergent. Regression analyses were performed using Mexican consumer samples of n=295 and n=239, respectively. Findings: As opposed to NCAP, CAP measurements yielded higher statistical levels of satisfaction, value and loyalty for both product categories. In the case of tequila, factor analysis indicated a clear separation between the two types of measurements, suggesting that they should be considered distinct constructs. However, this was not found for the other product category. Originality/value: CAP, which has better potential to predict outcomes than NCAP, could have relevant implications in brand positioning assessment and importance-performance analyses. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attribute performance; Brand loyalty; Brand positioning; Comparative performance; Customer perceived value; Customer satisfaction; Importance-performance analysis; Product performance",""

Design/methodology/approach: Focussing on general product category brands, the study was conducted across two countries, i.e. New Zealand (Study 1) and Pakistan (Study 2), using online surveys. Study 1 explores the perceptions of university students, whereas Study 2 evaluates the perceptions of a more heterogeneous population across the country. Partial least squares–structural equation modelling was used to analyse the model. Findings: First, the results confirm that individual-level identity-based drivers (undesired self-congruence and negative social influence) consistently predict brand avoidance for foreign brands across both markets, whereas country-level drivers (consumer ethnocentrism and animosity) have inconsistent effects across the markets. Second, the study demonstrates that avoidance attitude fully mediates the relationship between antecedences and intentions to avoid foreign brands. Practical implications: The finding that undesired self-congruence is the strongest predictor of brand avoidance across the markets reinforces the importance of brand image congruence with the target audience. Considering the negative effect of social influence, especially on social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter), this finding cautions managers to constantly monitor the prevailing negative word of mouth (online or offline) about the brand to mitigate its potential effect. Originality/value: Drawing on social identity theory, this study explores the identity-based pre-purchase determinants of brand avoidance at the country level and at the individual level. These determinants have never been explored yet in the context of brand avoidance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Animosity; Anti-consumption; Brand avoidance; Ethnocentrism; Negative social influence; Undesired self",""

"The mechanism of positive emotions linking consumer review consistency to brand attitudes: A moderated mediation analysis","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074048898&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2019-0224&partnerID=40&md5=774f386e34d497dc40be99291961a0d1","Purpose: As consumers read multiple reviews, so consumer review consistency is important. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of consumer review consistency in influencing attitudes toward brands by examining its underlying effect on consumers’ emotions after they read consistent consumer reviews. In addition, the moderation effect of hedonic and utilitarian purchase values on positive consumer emotions and attitudes toward brands is explored. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative design in which 329 participants – undergraduate and MBA students at a university in Taiwan – were asked to complete online questionnaires. To generalize the results, the questions in the questionnaire were based on any consumer reviews that the participants had recently browsed. Findings: Consumer review consistency positively influences attitudes toward brands. Positive emotions are also developed when reading consistent consumer reviews, and this positively influences consumers’ attitudes toward brands. However, positive emotions are not derived from consistent consumer reviews in all contexts. The results show that positive emotions work well when consumers shop using hedonic value. Positive emotions create positive consumers’ attitudes toward a brand when they shop using hedonic value, but this significant effect does not occur when consumers shop using utilitarian value. Research limitations/implications: This study’s results suggest that only investigating the quality of a consumer review or other aspects of a single review might overlook the impact of consumer review consistency, as consumers read multiple reviews. Consumer review consistency plays an important role in brand effectiveness, as consumers form positive attitudes toward brands when they read consistent reviews. Positive emotions can strengthen consumers’ attitudes toward a brand. Moreover, positive emotions increase positive attitudes toward brands only when consumers shop using hedonic value. However, positive emotions do not enhance consumers’ attitudes if they shop using utilitarian value. Practical implications: Rather than focusing on the quality of a single review, online shops should carefully consider consumer review consistency. Although positive reviews are better than negative reviews, it is quite difficult for every shop to maintain 100 percent positive reviews. Therefore, maintaining and offering quality products and services are rather important to acquiring more positive reviews. Online shops should consider experimental marketing strategies when managing online shops. The layout of online sites that show consistent consumer reviews can provide consumers with cues that shorten decision making, especially for products that consumers tend to shop for using hedonic value. Originality/value: This research extends the previous consumer review literature. Previous research was focused mainly on the quality of consumer reviews or other aspects of a single review. This research shows that focusing a single consumer review is not sufficient, as consumers generally read more than one consumer review. In addition, the role of positive emotions as a mediator between consumer review consistency and attitudes toward a brand was investigated. Furthermore, the moderated mediation effect was applied to investigate the role of shopping value (hedonic vs utilitarian value) as a moderator of positive emotions’ mediation effect. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand attitudes; Consumer review; Emotion; Experience; Hedonic",""

The mediating influence of self-image congruity and the moderating effect of self-esteem were also examined. Design/methodology/approach: These data were gathered through an online research portal from 302 Korean millennials. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses and moderated mediation analysis using Hayes PROCESS macro were applied to test proposed hypotheses. Findings: The result of the structural equation analyses showed strong, positive associations between social media usage, self-image congruity and conspicuous online consumption, while self-image congruity also acted as a mediator between Korean millennials' usage of social media and conspicuous online consumption. Moreover, in moderated mediation analysis, the pathway between self-image congruity and conspicuous online consumption was stronger for millennials with higher self-esteem. Originality/value: Millennials' social media usage and conspicuous consumption are widely acknowledged in consumer research.

It analyses supply chain risks in a systematic manner and develops a hierarchical methodology for identifying, prioritizing and managing the potential supply chain risks. Design/methodology/approach: This research reviews supply chain risk management literature and develops a conceptual framework, which outlines general principles and guidelines for managing risks in a systematic manner. Through decomposition, the complexity of supply chain risk can be identified by analyzing smaller subsystems. Findings: The paper provides a conceptual framework to identify supply chain risks from multiple overlapping perspectives. The structured filtering and ranking procedure enables decision-makers to focus on the most critical risks. The research shows that the supply chain risks associated with the sub-systems within the hierarchical structure contribute to and ultimately determine the risks of the overall supply chain system. Research limitations/implications: The risks associated with each sub system within the hierarchical structure can contribute to and determine the risks of the overall supply chain system. Further applications in various companies and industry sectors would benefit supply chain managers on a case-by-case basis. Practical implications: The hierarchical risk identification framework can serve as guidance for applications to specific supply chain systems and processes. The framework from a holistic overlapping perspective can efficiently and effectively help supply chain managers identify supply chain risks and facilitate the evaluation of the subsystem risks.

The purpose of this paper is to understand what platform incentives are available and to explore the influence mechanism of these incentives on actual carriers’ continuous intention to participate in non-vehicle operating carrier platform. Design/methodology/approach: Based on organizational institution theory and behavioral motivation theory, the paper established the influence mechanism model of platform incentives on actual carriers’ continuous participation intention of non-vehicle operating carrier platform. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed by Road Transportation Management Bureau of Zhejiang Province and a third-party questionnaire survey platform, and 176 valid questionnaires were collected.

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts one online experiment-questionnaire study and one between-subject lab experiment to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study finds that consumers are more likely to choose unique choices in hedonic service customization. Consumers' CDOU has a positive effect on their attitudes toward WTPM. In addition, consumers' processing mode moderates the relationship between service category and CDOU. Practical implications: The findings provide new insights into better understanding the factors affecting the choice of service customization and have significant practical implications. First, consumers' different desire for uniqueness of different service should not be neglected when examining the values of service customization. Second, high-level CDOU is quite prevalent for hedonic (vs utilitarian) service customization, especially for consumers with experiential processing mode. Originality/value: While previous studies state “need for uniqueness” as a key characteristic of product customization in general, we extend it to intangible service customization and connect it with consumers' WTPM. In addition, the moderating role of individual trait and decision-making processing mode is also checked.

"Co-production strategy, retail competition, and market segmentation","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074878465&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2018-0408&partnerID=40&md5=ef033358a315a997dcb7377ac297518b","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of manufacturers’ co-production strategy on market segmentation and channel performance under retail competition. Design/methodology/approach: It differs from previous empirical studies by primarily focusing on the increment in consumer value accompanying co-production. The authors establish a game-theoretical model to analyze the impact of co-production on market segmentation and the profitability of channel members in a competitive retail environment. Findings: The results reveal that manufacturers introducing co-production expand market coverage and benefit all channel members, when the intensity of competition is sufficiently high, especially for retailers with low-quality levels, who are out of the market without co-production. Furthermore, with the increase in customer valuation through co-production, employing a co-production strategy is always a dominant strategy for manufacturers. Research limitations/implications: First, although the authors assume a monopoly manufacturer and two duopoly retailers, adding competition between manufacturers should enrich the model. Multiple products with vertical or horizontal differentiation could also be introduced into the model. Second, the authors use the multiplicative utility function to model the value co-creation effect on consumers; however, different utility functions may yield significantly different results and implications. Third, the authors model a one-shot game in a single product selling period; future studies may employ multi-period games to obtain further insight into co-production strategy. Finally, the model assumes that all consumers are homogenous in the extent of value creation and hassle cost. Future research may find it interesting to consider heterogeneity in these characteristics. Practical implications: The business world today already sees the power of leadership in a supply chain to have shifted from manufacturers to retail giants such as Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy. The findings also propose a new route to counteract the emergence and rise of dominant retailers. On the other hand, with the application of new technology in the retail industry such as 3D avatar, AR/VR, Internet of Things, consumers are more likely to participate in various forms of co-production activities, how to execute the co-production strategy has become more and more important for managers. Social implications: The conclusion of this study points out the way to achieve a win–win outcome under which both channel members including manufacturer and retailers and consumers can be better off, that is, the channel can reach Pareto improvement, so the social welfare is increased accordingly. Originality/value: The authors propose an analytical framework to examine the effects of co-production and competition on market segmentation and profitability, and prove that co-production is a powerful marketing tool that can attract consumers and increase profitability, which manufacturers can incorporate into their products even in a competitive environment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Market segmentation; Marketing theory",""

Design/methodology/approach: A laboratory experiment involving 400 participants was conducted to test for the moderating effect. Factorial ANOVA is used to measure brand attitude. Findings: The results identified that the web banner advertisement type acted as a moderator between frequency and brand attitude. However, the moderating effect of banner advertisement appeal was found to be insignificant at a single banner advertisement frequency (i.e. exposure) but significantly different at a higher frequency. The study findings provide better directives for online marketers. Practical implications: The major limitation is the fact that the impact of banner advertisement frequency was manipulated from one to five exposures. Future research needs to determine what happens after the fifth exposure, perhaps ten exposures or more, to determine the wear-out effect and in turn, to decide on the optimal frequency level in an effort to design more appropriate web communication strategies. Social implications: The result shows that pop-up banner advertisements are intrusive, and that high level of exposures to pop-up banner advertisement could annoy online users. Thus, online advertisers should avoid repeating the pop-up banner advertisements because this could adversely affect the attitude towards the online advertising in general, and could also negatively influence attitudes towards the brand and ultimately effect online purchase. Originality/value: This study contributes to the theory by providing more insights into the repetition effect, and comprehensive conclusions can be drawn based on the manipulation of banner advertisement frequency on different frequency levels. The research identifies that if the communication objective is to generate brand attitude, different strategies can be adopted depending on the banner advertisement type (pop-up vs static) and banner advertisement appeal (emotional vs rational). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advertising appeal; Banner advertising frequency; Banner advertising type; Online advertising",""

The purpose of this paper is to reason the consumer’s intentional visit to an online store prior to making purchases offline by linking it with perceived channel benefits and uncertainty reduction approach through an application of the theory of planned behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was administered online, and a total of 374 responses were obtained. Respondents were queried with respect to the webrooming sequence, if at all they were into webrooming. The PLS-SEM was used to test the formulated hypotheses. Findings: The factor “Access to reviews online” emerged as the prime perceived search benefit which drives consumers’ to first visit an online store, while factors like “access to touch and feel the product,” “better post-purchase services offline” and “immediate possession of product” induced customers to later purchase offline. Factors like “E-distrust” and “perceived risks related to purchasing online” notably determined consumer’s movement to the physical store for purchasing the product in the second phase of the webrooming sequence. Research limitations/implications: A small sample size limits the authors from drawing definitive generalizations. Due to the lack of studies, individually examining webrooming conduct, a prior qualitative exploration can be conducted to draw more insights. Practical implications: The findings of the study can be utilized by the online retailers for devising strategies to push the webroomers to make purchases online. Social implications: The study creates awareness as to what motivates consumers to webroom, which has been realized as one of the serious issues being faced by the online retailers today.

Yet, little is known about marketing’s contribution to successful strategic decision making in emerging markets. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the usage of conventional strategic marketing practice, as it relates to developed markets, within groups of higher- and lower- performing manufacturers in the emerging market of India, comparing it against that of their counterparts in the developed market of the USA. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on separate web-hosted questionnaire surveys conducted in India and the USA, yielding samples of 71 and 84 self-reported manufacturing companies, respectively. Data analyses were conducted using independent-sample t-tests and logistic multiple regression, and sought to compare and contrast successful strategic marketing decision making in each country. Findings: The results confirm that conventional strategic marketing plays a vital role in facilitating the competitive success of manufacturers in India. However, they also suggest that differences in the strategic environments faced by manufacturers in both countries necessitate quite different priorities for success at each stage of the strategic marketing decision-making process. Research limitations/implications: Due to relatively low response rates, the extent to which the study samples are representative of the population under scrutiny remains unknown. Also, differences in the respondents’ interpretation of certain questions and some of the marketing vocabulary and terminology used cannot be ruled out. Practical implications: The research highlights the important contribution that conventional strategic marketing makes to the achievement of competitive success of manufacturers in India. However, it also identifies several specific practices that differentiate higher firm performance in the two countries, drawing into question the direct applicability of the conventional model of strategic marketing within an emerging market.

"The effects of government relation and institutional environments on channel performance","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047903674&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2017-0091&partnerID=40&md5=47806e6864f6679711d0490741e30f02","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of channel partners’ government relations within channel performance and explore how institutional factors interact to influence channel performance. A theoretical framework, inclusive of hypotheses, is proposed to demonstrate the interaction of government relations and institutional environments on firm performance. Drawing on an institutional perspective, this paper suggests that the effect of partner’s government relations on firm performance is moderated by institutional environment factors, such as government interference, legal protection, and the importance of guanxi. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a questionnaire survey and collected data from 393 Chinese manufacturer managers in China. Findings: Partner’s government relations increase focal firm’s performance and this effect is moderated by different levels of legal protection. Partner’s government relations increase firm performance only in the context of high-legal protection; whereas, when legal protection is low, partner’s government relations decrease focal firm performance. As for the interaction of institutional factors, legal protection and importance of guanxi, all three moderate the negative effect of government interference on firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides insights on how channel partner’s government relations, representing a key institutional capital, interact with institutional environment factors to influence channel performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Government interference; Government relation; Guanxi; Institutional environment; Legal protection",""
"Direct and indirect effect of brand experience on true brand loyalty: role of involvement","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047909010&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2017-0189&partnerID=40&md5=059b75bbc0a02a3459a840c571410a99","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of product and customer dimensions in the contribution of brand experience to the formation of true brand loyalty. The dimensions included are brand credibility, affective commitment and involvement. Synthesising past studies, the researcher proposes brand credibility and affective commitment to mediate the relationship between brand experience and true brand loyalty. Furthermore, the researcher investigates the variation in hierarchical pattern, i.e. brand experience-brand credibility affective commitment-true brand loyalty, under different levels of involvement. Design/methodology/approach: The variations in hierarchy were compared by design. The authors investigated the variations in hierarchy on the basis of products which belong to different level of involvement, on the basis of individual differences in involvement, and on the basis of the interaction of product involvement and subject involvement. Multi-group invariance tests in SEM were used to explore model variations. Findings: The hierarchy-of-effect model was found to vary based on the level of product involvement, subject involvement and interaction involvement. Three patterns of hierarchy have been observed: the first pattern was observed in high-high groups (both product involvement and subject involvement were high), the second pattern was observed in low-low groups (both product and subject involvements were low) and the third pattern among high-low or low-high groups. Practical implications: The variation observed highlights the need to segment the market by interaction involvement. This would be useful for managers engaged in building sustainable consumer-brand relationships. Originality/value: This study considered the interaction of product approach and subject approach in defining involvement which is rarely attempted in research. The study also integrates the variations in the role of customer dimensions, namely involvement, brand credibility and affective commitment with the relationship between the central constructs brand experience and true brand loyalty. The variations observed are among a socio-economically homogeneous sample of respondents. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affective commitment; Brand credibility; Brand experience; Involvement; Multi-group invariance test; SEM; True brand loyalty",""

Design/methodology/approach: Using a validated survey instrument, 384 respondents in China and 145 respondents in Taiwan are collected. The research model is analyzed using component-based estimation approach to structural equation modeling. Findings: The structural equation analysis of the study found that post-purchase shipping and tracking have an impact on customer satisfaction in both China and Taiwan. It also found that customer service is the most significant factor among the examined antecedents for online shoppers in China. While, return service is more important for shoppers in Taiwan. Finally, customer satisfaction played a stronger positive role for online shoppers in Taiwan as compared to their counterparts in China. Research limitations/implications: This research extended the current literature about post-purchase logistic services in an online shopping environment with a literature-based research model and good empirical data support. However, one limitation of the study is that the data collected represents a cross-sectional sample; future research should examine longitudinal sample to study customers’ purchase intentions over time. Practical implications: This study can help both scholars and practitioners understand the importance of tracking, return, shipping, and customer service in an online shopping environment and across countries. It provides insights on designing e-commerce relevant shipping services to satisfy and attract customers across countries. Originality/value: The study investigated how post-purchase activities contributed to customer satisfaction in online shopping and explored the influence of customer satisfaction on future purchase intention in China and Taiwan.

"Social capital, relational learning, and performance of suppliers","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044543776&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2017-0022&partnerID=40&md5=f1a2fd94daef48358e47193489d95f3d","Purpose: The relationship between buyers and suppliers over the years – social practices – facilitate the development of social capital (SC), and it contributes to the relationship performance (RP) for both parties. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mechanisms that transform SC into RP. By exercising the relationship learning (joint sense-making, information sharing, and knowledge integration), this paper proposes that SC will transform into RP. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative study was employed in this study. Questionnaires were distributed to first-tier supplier of Astra Group (Astra International) in Indonesia. In total, 211 questionnaires were used for data analysis in this study. Findings: The results exhibit that cognitive and structural SC contribute to the development of relational SC. Further, relational SC was positively associated with joint sense-making, which then goes through information sharing, knowledge integration, and finally RP. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional data in a specific context (a firm) in Indonesia serve as a major limitation of this study. The development of SC and learning as a social process might not be captured well by using the current method – surveys. Furthermore, a major problem is caused by a one-sided survey that depends on the suppliers’ perceptions and judgments of relationship learning and performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers and other relationship actors would benefit from the competency to develop practices and activities with suppliers regarding developing trust. The trust development is facilitated by having common understanding and interactions regularly, either by participating in formal and/or informal activities with suppliers. Building consensus – joint sense-making, between buyers and suppliers are crucial practices in relationship learning before knowledge sharing and knowledge integration practices are in place. And finally, managers should actively integrate this knowledge in order to increase their RP. Originality/value: This study empirically tests the supply chain practice view as a new theoretical perspective in the supply chain management literature. It also extends the utilization of social practices – SC – since it is crucial in a buyer-supplier relationship. It also presents that relationship learning is a mechanism that could transform SC into RP, and thus bridge the SC and collaborative learning theory. Finally, this study indicates that inside relational learning, there are sequences of joint sense-making-information sharing-knowledge integration, before it moves on to RP. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Information sharing; Joint sense-making; Knowledge integration; Relational performance; Social capital",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider two risk-neutral LSPs in which one is an existing company and the other is a new entrant. The existing LSP has a sound distribution network and provides service in both local and remote areas. The new entrant LSP should determine the freight price and service coverage to compete for business. The authors use a Stackelberg game to model the competition between two LSPs with assumptions of consumers’ utility and demand distribution. Numerical examples are used to validate the findings. Findings: The findings show that the distribution strategy for LSPs depends on the ratio of the cost difference and shipping speed difference and demand structure. The LSP with higher shipping speeds only need to meet demands in local areas and may stay out of the market in some cases. To compete for business in the whole areas is more profitable for the LSP with lower shipping speeds when either unit service cost or the potential demand in remote areas is low enough. Otherwise, the LSP with lower speeds should stay out the market of remote areas. Originality/value: This study is a preliminary research on the relationship between market competition and distribution strategy for LSPs and contributes to service operations management literature and strategic management for LSPs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competition; Distribution strategy; Logistics; Logistics service providers; Pricing; Service coverage",""

Unlike typical product-harm crises, in defaming product-harm crises, the truth often emerges only after substantial damage has been done to the victim firm. Thus, crisis management strategies in these two cases may be different. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Using a defaming product-harm crisis that involved two competing firms, this paper examines how the firms changed their advertising strategies and how the changes affected consumers’ online search behavior regarding the two firms. Findings: The analyses show that after the crisis, the offending firm sensitively reacted to its own and the victim firm’s advertising levels, but the victim firm did not react to the offending firm’s advertising as it had previously. The effectiveness of advertising on consumers’ online search weakened for both firms after the crisis.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 309 logistics managers were invited to participate in this study and structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the measurement and structural models. Findings: The results show that both flexibility and collaboration positively influence trust and dependence. Moreover, dependence does not appear to influence commitment. Finally, the authors hypothesize and find that trust plays an important role in the research model and positively increase commitment. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is that this study used a cross-sectional survey approach to collect data on all research variables. Compared with longitudinal data, cross-sectional data might not be able to demonstrate completely the temporal sequence of the antecedents and consequences, which might result in spurious cause-effect inferences. Practical implications: The findings offer several important implications for LSPs. First, the findings imply that LSPs need to make their customers want to share useful information related to operations and logistics. Second, flexibility plays an important role in forming customers’ trust in logistics service industry. Originality/value: Little research has been done on combining a resource-based view (RBV) and relationship marketing (RM) together in logistics service context.

Design/methodology/approach: To understand the effects of social capital on value co-creation, the authors conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey with a selected group of 400 adult respondents aged more than 20 years. To verify precision in wording and sentence structure and the validity of questions in reflecting the study objective, the authors conducted a pretest on 40 respondents before administering the main survey. Ultimately, 50 questionnaires considered inappropriate and with inconsistent response patterns were discarded, leaving 350 questionnaires for the statistical analysis. Findings: This research adopts the consumer-centric as well as societal perspectives to conceptualize value co-creation behavior, and tests the moderating roles of psychometric measures of self-monitoring and corporate trust. Next, the research confirms whether social identity and perceived corporate authenticity mediate the relationship between social capital and value co-creation.

Taking a psychological position and based on the Mindscape Theory, the purpose of this paper is to support the hypothesis that there is intra-cultural and intra-market heterogeneity. Design/methodology/approach: The translated survey for international use has many problems. These problems can greatly be minimized by the use of pictorial/geometric shapes that were used in this study. These shapes were constructed using redundant and non-redundant complexity, and made to be culture neutral. Findings: Data analysis supported the presence of three of the four Mindscape types as was hypothesized, indicating individual intra-market heterogeneity in the three cultures under investigation. Additionally, the corollary hypothesis of transcultural heterogeneity was confirmed. Research limitations/implications: It has been proposed that Mindscape types are partly innate and partly learned. What proportions constitute each part? Can the learned aspect be unlearned? Can different marketing strategies appeal to each? What marketing programs are better suited to influence the learned aspect? Future studies could explore these issues.

DoL were broken down into being, belonging and becoming domains. Relationship between the DoL and luxury consumption behavior (LCB) was analyzed as well. Being domain included elements that indicated who one is and how one defines the self; belonging domain linked an individual to his/her environment; and becoming domain referred to the set of social activities that an individual performed. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to get insights into the LCB of affluent Muslim consumers and how these insights related to key demographics and DoL. The researched population was Qatari consumers who were buying luxury products and belonged to a high-income bracket. Stratified sampling method was considered appropriate because the key objective of the study was to generalize the results across the affluent Qatari population. Stratification of the population was primarily done through the selected demographic variables. This research survey, conducted in Qatar, resulted in the collection of 213 usable questionnaires. General Linear Model Multivariate Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis were used to establish the goodness of fit and to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Results indicated that there were significant LCB differences between the genders, age groups, income levels and educational background. Furthermore, there was a significant association between the three DOLs and LCB. There were indications that for affluent Qatari Muslims, consumption of luxury products had become a socially accepted norm. Fulfillment of luxury needs did not isolate rich Muslims from their family and friends or made them unhappy about luxury consumption. This behavior could be related to high levels of affluence among Qataris that makes acquisition of luxury products easy and not effort or time intensive. Practical implications: Islamic luxury markets need to adopt an appropriate balance of global (considering global luxury trends) and local (based on cultural, social and religious forces) marketing strategies to engage rich Muslim consumers.

The authors also explore whether a retail strategy of supply base diversification for managing suppliers moderates the association between innovativeness and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses were tested using a structural equation model and survey data drawn from general merchandise managers of 149 supermarket retailers in Japan. Findings: The results indicate that inter-departmental communication between merchandising and store divisions drives innovativeness among retail buyers and ultimately strengthens firm competitiveness. Moreover, when buyer innovativeness is evident and less actively the retail buyers utilize supply base diversification, the stronger is the retailer’s competitiveness. The study failed to find any direct impact of inter-departmental communication on retail competitiveness. Practical implications: This study offers managerial insights into the roles that buyer innovativeness, inter-departmental communications, and supply base diversification play in developing effective competitive strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: The data set comprises 108 responses of senior managers within the logistics sector. The multi-level sequential mediation path analysis is used to examine the above mediating role. Findings: Results indicate that intelligence dissemination (ID), response implementation (RI) and business performance relationship is significantly mediated via fellow-feelings and organisational harmony. However, the relationship between dissemination, implementation and overall business performance is mostly mediated by fellow-feelings and followed by organisational harmony. Furthermore, when overall market orientation (intelligence generation, dissemination and RI) is used as a determinant of business performance, organsiational harmony emerged as the most significant contributor to organsiational performance. Practical implications: Managers are urged to focus on building fellow-feelings among their employees, resulting in a harmonious work environment between functional units and market orientation organisation wide. Originality/value: Compared to previous research, this is one of the first attempts to develop an understanding of fellow-feelings, contributing to organsiational harmony resulting market orientation and, hence, business performance. Market orientation conceptualisations lump intelligence generation, dissemination and RI of business activities together but do not explain how market orientation impacts fellow-feelings and organisational harmony which in turn leads to performance. The authors specifically address this important lacuna in our conceptualisation and propose that ID and RI lead to fellow-feelings within functional departments and results in organisational harmony. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Fellow-feelings; Logistics; Market orientation; Organizational harmony",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of logistics service quality (LSQ) on omni-channel capability. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to evaluate the new concept of “omni-channel capability” and LSQ from the consumer’s perception. A two split sample technique was used to validate omni-channel capability and test the impact of LSQ on it through structural equation modeling. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were performed to introduce, test and validate omni-channel capability, and test the study’s hypotheses. Consumers who had previously shopped from both the online and physical stores of a particular retailer completed a self-administered survey. Findings: The findings supported the use of the term “omni-channel capability,” which has three elements: channel consistency, cross-channel and social media. The results also revealed the positive impact of operational LSQ on omni-channel capability. Practical implications: Taking consumer perceptions as a reference point, this study reveals major issues that retailers should focus on while pursuing an omni-channel strategy. The findings also highlight the need for retailers to ensure operational LSQ to implement an omni-channel management strategy. Originality/value: To improve on the limited theoretical understanding and empirical grounding of omni-channel management, this study described the three elements of omni-channel capability. The impact of operational LSQ on omni-channel capability gives empirical support for the theorized hierarchy of dynamic capabilities (zero- and first-order capabilities). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer perception; Dynamic capabilities; Logistics service quality; Multi-channel management; Omni-channel management; Structural equation modelling",""

Furthermore, it assesses whether CC use and IB behaviour mediate the relationship between materialism and CB behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from adult consumers with CCs via an online survey. For model assessment, a two-step approach was followed. First, a measurement model was created and tested using maximum likelihood estimation and validity of the study constructs was assessed. This was followed by structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings: Materialism influences CC use and increases the propensity for IB (IB), which then precipitates CB habits. Reduction in CC use can decrease both IB and CB. Out of the six hypotheses assessed, only the one linking CC use to CB was not supported, requiring further investigation. Mediation relationships were identified, where CC use and IB act as mediators between materialism and CB. Research limitations/implications: The paper captured responses from adult consumers of India. Hence, the findings may not be generalised across geographies and age groups. The study contributes to the debate on the impulsive–CB paradigm by showing that impulsive and CB are not distinct constructs. In fact, the former could lead to the latter. Practical implications: CC use in itself need not necessarily lead to CB. The only way CC could cause CB is through IB. Hence, firms must promote responsible buying habits, as there has been an increase in IB, which, if not controlled, could lead to debt trap resulting from CB. The findings of this paper will help both retailers and CC institutions to better understand the spending pattern of consumers. Those will also help the policymakers to chalk out ways to the curb indiscriminate issuance of CCs without educating users.

"Organic food consumerism through social commerce in China","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059680229&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2018-0150&partnerID=40&md5=faaf52273a30c1f4bf15e8faaa983e52","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of consumers’ attitudes towards organic food on online impulse buying behaviour as well as the moderating effect of three website features (visual, information and navigation design) on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected via an online survey using social media platforms. A total of 653 online questionnaires were collected (response rate = 72.5 per cent) and analysed by applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The proposed hypotheses were tested through structural equation modelling. Findings: Social media forums, ratings and reviews shape Chinese consumers’ attitudes towards organic food and positively influence their online impulse buying in this market. Website features are critical for disseminating information on organic food. Informative webpages featuring product quality and certification have a greater moderating effect on purchase. Information cues such as nutritional content; production and processing methods, and environmentally friendliness also influence consumers’ attitudes and thus impulse buying decisions. Practical implications: Marketers should reconsider their tactics for dealing with modern consumers, as webpages should be user-friendly and visually appealing with a social learning mechanism to drive organic food consumption. Originality/value: This study bridges a gap in the literature on social commerce initiatives for developing consumers’ attitudes towards organic food and online impulse buying. Further, it proposes measures that can enhance organic consumption and contributes to the literature on the importance of social factors, resulting in enhanced knowledge on the online impulse buying of organic food. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Online impulse buying; Organic food; Social commerce; Website quality",""
"A bi-level programming for transportation services procurement based on combinatorial auction with fuzzy random parameters","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057609108&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2017-0154&partnerID=40&md5=b8cd9846e17187785e3619fbb6ffaa3f","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study a transportation service procurement bid construction problem from a less than a full truckload perspective. It seeks to establish stochastic mixed integer programming to allow for the proper bundle of loads to be chosen based on price, which could improve the likelihood that carrier can earn its maximum utility. Design/methodology/approach: The authors proposes a bi-level programming that integrates the bid selection and winner determination and a discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) solution algorithm is then developed, and a numerical simulation is used to make model and algorithm analysis. Findings: The algorithm comparison shows that although GA could find a little more Pareto solutions than PSO, it takes a longer time and the quality of these solutions is not dominant. The model analysis shows that compared with traditional approach, our model could promote the likelihood of winning bids and the decision effectiveness of the whole system because it considers the reaction of the shipper. Originality/value: The highlights of this paper are considering the likelihood of winning the business and describing the conflicting and cooperative relationship between the carrier and the shipper by using a stochastic mixed integer programming, which has been rarely examined in previous research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bi-level programming; Combinatorial transportation auctions; Discrete particle swarm optimization; Fuzzy random; Winner determination",""
"Does online shopping make consumers feel better? Exploring online retail therapy effects on consumers’ attitudes towards online shopping malls","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062037424&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2018-0210&partnerID=40&md5=1ce0f3e65239b4688c93279088908cc1","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between online retail therapy and consumers’ attitudes towards online fashion shopping malls (ATO) based on the stimulus–organism–response model. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined how online retail therapy factors (e.g. the aesthetics of web design and attractiveness of the models) affect consumers’ ATO. In particular, the authors examined the mediation of positive mood reinforcement (PMR) and negative mood reduction (NMR). Findings: The results indicated that aesthetics has a significant and direct effect on ATO. However, model attractiveness has an indirect effect on ATO through PMR and NMR. In addition, the direct effect of aesthetics on ATO is greater than the indirect effect of model attractiveness. Therefore, online fashion shopping malls need to concentrate on improving the aesthetics of the shopping malls. For fashion shopping malls that do not have the capacity to improve the aesthetics, it is possible to improve ATO by using highly attractive models. Originality/value: This study applied the concept of retail therapy to the online environment and verified the effect. This study expanded the scope of the study of retail therapy by examining the effect of mood improvement on ATO as well. Further, this study examined the structure of two online retail therapy factors, aesthetics and model attractiveness, that affect ATO through PMR and NMR, and suggested managerial implications for online shopping malls. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aesthetics; Attitude; Attractiveness; Online retail therapy; Online shopping; Therapeutic effect",""

The real-time data processing based on big data technology (such as NoSQL MongoDB and Apache Kafka) is utilized to handle the vast amount of customer behavior data. Design/methodology/approach: In order to extract customer behavior patterns, customers’ browsing history and transactional data from digital signage (DS) could be used as the input for decision making. First, the authors developed a DSOS and installed it in different locations, so that customers could have the experience of browsing and buying a product. Second, the real-time data processing system gathered customers’ browsing history and transaction data as it occurred. In addition, the authors utilized the association rule to extract useful information from customer behavior, so it may be used by the managers to efficiently enhance the service quality. Findings: First, as the number of customers and DS increases, the proposed system was capable of processing a gigantic amount of input data conveniently. Second, the data set showed that as the number of visit and shopping duration increases, the chance of products being purchased also increased. Third, by combining purchasing and browsing data from customers, the association rules from the frequent transaction pattern were achieved. Thus, the products will have a high possibility to be purchased if they are used as recommendations. Research limitations/implications: This research empirically supports the theory of association rule that frequent patterns, correlations or causal relationship found in various kinds of databases. The scope of the present study is limited to DSOS, although the findings can be interpreted and generalized in a global business scenario. Practical implications: The proposed system is expected to help management in taking decisions such as improving the layout of the DS and providing better product suggestions to the customer. Social implications: The proposed system may be utilized to promote green products to the customer, having a positive impact on sustainability. Originality/value: The key novelty of the present study lies in system development based on big data technology to handle the enormous amounts of data as well as analyzing the customer behavior in real time in the DSOS. The real-time data processing based on big data technology (such as NoSQL MongoDB and Apache Kafka) is used to handle the vast amount of customer behavior data. In addition, the present study proposed association rule to extract useful information from customer behavior. These results can be used for promotion as well as relevant product recommendations to DSOS customers. Besides in today’s changing retail environment, analyzing the customer behavior in real time in DSOS helps to attract and retain customers more efficiently and effectively, and retailers can get a competitive advantage over their competitors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Association rule; Customer behaviour",""

Most prior studies have considered religiosity as an individual’s tendency to be religious. However, the present study employed perceived religiosity as one’s perception regarding shariah compliance practices of family takaful schemes. Moreover, this study examines the direct relationship between perceived religiosity and attitude and the indirect relationship between perceived religiosity and trust. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 224 salaried individuals was selected with an age range of 24–50. Variance-based partial least squares structural equation modelling was employed for data analysis. Findings: The results showed that knowledge and perceived usefulness (PU) had significantly positive relationships with attitude towards family takaful schemes. Perceived trust completely mediated the relationship between perceived religiosity and attitude towards family takaful. Attitude was positively related to purchase intention regarding family takaful. Practical implications: The findings of the study are important for Islamic financial institutions, especially for takaful companies to revamp their marketing strategies. With enhanced understanding regarding consumer behaviour, takaful companies can sell their products in a more effective manner to increase their market share. Originality/value: Behavioural aspects regarding the purchase of Islamic insurance products have yet to be profoundly explored in the literature.

Building on the Norm Activation Model and Value-Belief-Norm Theory, the purpose of this paper is to report on research exploring consumers’ eco-socially conscious behaviours related to the choice and use of personal cars in a developing country, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: To test a moderated-mediation model of environmental values, perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE), spirituality and eco-socially conscious consumer behaviours (ESCCBs), data were collected from 447 customers of three automobile manufacturing firms from eight different cities of Pakistan. The data collection was undertaken by using a self-administered questionnaire based on key themes in the literature. Findings: Analysis of the data revealed that altruistic and egoistic values were negatively while biospheric values were positively associated with eco-ESCCB. PCE mediated all the relationships and spirituality moderated the mediated paths.

In East Asia, solitary households are growing along with low marital rates and birth rates under high economic pressure. Because of these population changes, malls must provide good quality service to meet the specific needs of solitary households and social households. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, relationships among service quality, customer satisfaction (CS), perceived value, corporate image and customer loyalty were compared between social and solitary customers of Taiwan click-and-mortar malls. The effects of five service quality dimensions on CS and customer loyalty were investigated by structural equation modeling. Findings: The analytical results show that all hypothesized relationships among factors were supported with the exception of the impact of perceived value on satisfaction and the impact of the corporate image on satisfaction. Additionally, the comparison between solitary and social customers showed that service quality, corporate image and customer loyalty have strong relationships without differences between both kinds of customers. Solitary and social customers only differed in the impact of perceived value on loyalty. Practical implications: The managerial implication of this study is that, to satisfy both social and solitary customers and to increase their loyalty, Click-and-mortar malls (CAM malls) should apply different service quality strategies for social and solitary customers. To satisfy both types of customers, a strategy for increasing visible cares should be applied in social customers, and a strategy for increasing the perception of reliability, assurance and visible cares should be applied in solitary customers. To enhance the loyalty of solitary customers, a CAM mall should enhance the value perceived by solitary customers, which can help CAM malls increase the loyalty of solitary customers in the solo economy. Originality/value: The solo economy is a hot topic in East Asia because the issue of solo economy impacts the market. A CAM mall must evolve its business to attract solitary customers. However, no studies compared perceived quality, satisfaction, perceived value, corporate image and loyalty between solitary customers and social customers. This study is the first study investigated the business model of CAM malls. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Click-and-mortar mall; Corporate image; E-tailing; Multi-group analysis (MGA); Perceived value; Service quality; Social households; Solitary households; Solo economy",""

The paper also investigates the effects of experiential values on customer satisfaction (CS) and post-purchasing behaviour. In addition, the paper intends to strengthen the shift in marketing paradigm and to provide insightful enhancements to the literature. Design/methodology/approach: An instrument was developed to measure how strategic experiential module (Schmitt, 1999), social judgement module (Rosenberg et al., 1968) and service quality perceptions of customers influence functional and emotional values. Primary data were gathered through surveying 402 respondents in order to diagnose young customers’ experiences in popular coffee stores in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The constructs and their interrelationships were examined based on partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).

The results revealed that some of experiential modules and service quality have positive stimuli on experiential values. These contributions postulate an impetus for potential exploration in numerous service settings. Originality/value: The study assesses the effect of shopping experiences of young customers on experiential values, social judgement, CS and post-purchase shopping attitudes. It is anticipated that by filling this gap, this study will assist in strengthening marketing strategies, which requires an alteration in the existing business atmosphere.

Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire comprising a total of 29 items was employed over a sample of 272 respondents. The structural equation modeling using partial least squares was used for data analysis. Findings: Psychological risk emerged as the most influential of the various risk facets in affecting perceived overall risk. Financial, physical, and performance risks emerged as the second, third, and fourth most influential risk facets, respectively, which affect the perceived overall risk. Surprisingly, social risk did not emerge as an influential facet when it comes to affecting perceived overall risk. Further, psychological and financial risks appeared to have a positive medium-level influence on the perceived overall risk, whereas physical and performance risks appeared to have a positive weak influence on the perceived overall risks. The influence of financial risk on the perceived overall risk was found to be partially mediated by performance risk.

However, the increasing cross-border economic activities create new opportunities for corruption. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of corruption on trade facilitation using logistics performance index (LPI). This paper also examines the moderating effect of governance or government effectiveness (GE) on the relationship between corruption and LPI within Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach: A panel of time-series data from year 2007 to 2014 of 26 Asian countries was collected for analysis. Static linear panel models which comprised of pooled ordinary least squares, fixed-effect model and random-effect model were utilised to analyse the panel data. Findings: The findings show that corruption significantly affects LPI and each of the six dimensions in LPI. The results also show that governance or GE has a moderating effect on the relationship between corruption and LPI. Practical implications: This study benefits Asian governments to gain a better understanding on influences of corruption on trade facilitation and triggering suggestions of a government role in the relationship. Practically, the results could be used as a guideline in improving national LPI. Besides, the findings could be used to support policy decision to modify corruption regulations at the national and regional levels.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations. Findings: Service quality, customer satisfaction and restaurant image all have a strong, positive impact on the behavioural intentions of moderate upscale restaurant patrons. Service quality, perceived value and restaurant image are also important determinants of customer satisfaction. Behavioural intentions to re-patronise a restaurant and recommend it to friends are influenced more strongly by restaurant image than by customer satisfaction. Three primary dimensions and ten pertaining sub-dimensions are modelled in the third order conceptualisation of service quality. The primary and sub-dimensions also vary in importance amongst the customers in the sampling frame. Originality/value: This is the first empirical research that develops and tests a comprehensive hierarchical model for moderate upscale restaurants to provide a complete and integrative analysis of a service setting. The interrelationships among service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value restaurant image and behavioural intentions are assessed. A third order conceptualisations of service quality is also included in the modelling framework. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intentions; Comprehensive hierarchical modelling; Moderate upscale restaurants; Structural equation modelling",""
"Redesigning one-warehouse n-retailer routing model in inter-store stock transfer operations of an international retail chain distribution","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047914971&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2017-0124&partnerID=40&md5=77daa8b0930e5a609c9f5ad60e325d10","Purpose: The effectiveness of product replenishment and responsiveness of customer service delivery impact largely on satisfaction and retention of customers in retail chain logistics distribution. The fast moving goods in the complex delivery network and limited vehicle resource often lead to long customer waiting time in stock replenishment. With lack of literature systematically reviewing factors affecting retail distribution in inter-store stock transfer services and improving the operations, the purpose of this paper is to analyse and enhance this service for the retail to reduce customer dissatisfaction by developing an integrated quality service improvement methodology and an optimisation tool to improve the product delivery services. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews inter-store stock transfer operations and the process capability of an international retail chain, and proposes improvements by integrating Six Sigma, factor analysis, and optimisation modelling. User experience and expectations are evaluated through an empirical survey. A novel principle component factored inter-store stock transfer model is developed to improve replenishment operations. A total of 11 factors affecting inter-store stock transfer delivery time are analysed. An extended model with principal component factors incorporated is developed for the simulation. Findings: The Cpk value of 0.51 shows significant difference between the experienced and expected waiting time. With the inter-store stock transfer optimisation model developed, the model assists traffic personnel on the vehicle route planning with multiple pick-up and drop-off locations. The system also ensures the best routing with a minimal travelling time planned, facilitating a reduction of the inter-store stock transfer time, thus improving the customer waiting time. Four significant factors affecting the delivery time are also identified from exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The results are analysed with an extended principal component factored inter-store stock transfer model. Practical implications: The developed inter-store stock transfer models minimise stock transfer time, increase customer satisfaction, and reduce loss of sales. An integrated service quality improvement methodology has been developed and applied in reviewing significant factors affecting inter-store stock transfer operations. Originality/value: This paper presents an analysis on inter-store stock transfer operations of an international retail and proposes enhancements on the operations by integrating Six Sigma, factor analysis, and optimisation modelling. A novel principal component factored inter-store stock transfer model is developed to improve the stock replenishment operations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Factor analysis; Inter-store stock transfer; Retail logistics; Vehicle routing",""
"Cross-cultural evaluation of consumer’s dynamic multisensory and emotional experience: A case of tea products","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056191426&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2017-0139&partnerID=40&md5=d936976dab78cb7ad8b73c406974adb9","Purpose: The acceleration of globalization is causing global trade transactions to become increasingly frequent, which leads to the internationalized design of consumer products. However, due to cultural differences, the user experience in different parts of the world with the same product may be different. In addition, the user experience is not static, but changes over the different usage stages for a product since the role of our senses may vary and different emotions may be elicited. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore how the interaction between the user and the product influences cross-cultural sensory modalities and emotional responses to products. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the fact that drinking tea can provide dynamic feedback of users’ sensory experiences including all five senses, two kinds of tea products from two considerably different cultures (China and the Netherlands) were chosen for the study. The experiment was conducted in five stages corresponding to different levels of interaction with two tea products. Measurements for both Chinese and Dutch participants were conducted by means of collecting subjective data for sensory modalities and emotions related to product experiences throughout the five stages. Findings: Results showed that tea experience tends to be dynamic between the two different countries over different usage periods, including sensory modalities and the emotional responses. Practical implications: The findings and design & market implications can be applied to optimize the design or market of international tea products or consumer products in other categories. They will be helpful for the international marketing of tea, especially for those who are interested in breaking into the Chinese tea market and those who are interested in promoting Chinese tea in new markets. In addition, the authors’ methods to evaluate the dynamics of the importance of sensory modalities and emotions could be used to test the user experience in the product lifecycle to help develop a successful international product. Originality/value: The findings and the linked design implications could be important not only for a theoretical understanding of cross-cultural sensory and emotional feedback from a product experience, but also for the optimization of product design for the international market. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer dynamic experience; Cross-cultural marketing; Emotion; Multisensory; Tea market",""

"Fuels sales through retail chains and their store traffics and revenue","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059866150&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-04-2017-0058&partnerID=40&md5=aeb4cb10f80c8a56c48ad9243e5c8313","Purpose: Using panel data on gasoline and grocery transactions in Korea, the purpose of this paper is to empirically explore the effect of a retail chain store’s establishment of on-site fuel sales. The empirical analyses present strong empirical evidence that the sale of fuel had statistically and economically significant effect on retail store traffic and revenue in the short run. However, the effect did not remain significant in the longer run. To explain the dramatic decrease in the effect of the fuel sale, the authors consider the enhanced competition in the local gasoline retail industry and examine cross-sectional price variations at the station level. The results suggest that the increased competition led to the reduction in the price dispersion across stations and thereby to an increase in consumer welfare. Design/methodology/approach: Using a linear specification that has traditionally been used to model retail chain data, the authors developed a series of difference-in-differences models. This technique is ideal for estimating the effect of a treatment in the presence of possible selection bias and has been widely employed in many social-science studies on policy intervention. Findings: In a certain environment, introducing fuel sales did not increase retail chain store traffic or revenue in the long run, despite having statistically and economically significant effects in the short run. The results document empirical evidence of myopic management in a common marketing practice, which often leads to a negative impact on the firm value in the long run. Research limitations/implications: The span of data and sample size were limited to meet the company’s data protection policy. Practical implications: Considering that many of developed countries are characterized by a gasoline retail environment similar to that which is investigated in this paper, the authors believe that the implications of the results are particularly valid for practitioners and policy makers. Social implications: The findings document empirical evidence of myopic management in a common marketing practice, which often leads to a negative impact on the firm value in the long run. Marketing researchers should make efforts in establishing metrics to help identify myopic management decision.

Design/methodology/approach: A research model was developed based on stimulus-organism-response model by integrating trust, argument quality, social presence and purchase intention. Using the data collected from 288 valid online questionnaires, the proposed model was empirically assessed by partial least square (PLS) SEM. Findings: The results show that trust toward social commerce site and trust toward site members are determinants of purchase intention, and the later one can be triggered by the argument quality of consumer-generated contents (perceived informativeness and perceived persuasiveness). Besides, consumers’ social presence has a moderating effect on the relationship between trust toward site members and purchase intention. Originality/value: This study indicates a new mechanism of trust based on the context of social commerce. The findings will contribute to social commerce literature by offering a well proven conceptual model that facilitates the understanding of consumers’ purchase decision-making processes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Argument quality; Purchase intention; S-O-R model; Social commerce site; Social presence; Trust",""

In particular, the authors are interested in understanding which video bloggers (vloggers) can better help marketers develop their brand image, which vlog viewers tend to evaluate vlogger-endorsed brands more positively, and how these effects occur. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted with a convenience sample online. A total of 401 valid responses were collected. Regression analyses and bootstrapping were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that vloggers’ physical and social attractiveness and the audience’s viewing motives (entertainment motive and relationship-building motive) and behavior (time spent on the media) increased the audience’s evaluations of the brands endorsed by the vloggers (perceived brand quality, brand affect and brand preference). The authors also found that these relationships were mediated by the parasocial interaction (PSI) between the vloggers and the audience. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that marketers can develop relationships with consumers and enhance their brand evaluations via vloggers. This strategy is more effective when brand managers use more attractive vloggers and target viewers who spend a lot of time on vlogs seeking entertainment or hoping to build relationships. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by showing that vlogging can affect brand evaluations through the development of PSI between vloggers and viewers. The authors extended the focus of vlog marketing research from consumers’ watching and sharing behaviors and their perception of vloggers to brand evaluations, from vloggers’ characteristics to viewers’ characteristics and from the Western to the Eastern context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand affect; Brand management; Brand preference; Branding strategies; Celebrity endoresement; Consumer behaviour; Parasocial interaction; Perceived brand quality; Promotions management; Vlog",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study integrated the TAM with TTF to understand individual perceptions of a technology’s value. In addition, the intrinsic motivational factors toward technology usage, including positive perceptions (perceived enjoyment, personal innovation and perceived uniqueness) and negative perceptions (perceived risk and performance gap), were considered in the model. Furthermore, the moderating effect of driving experience was examined. Findings: The perceived usefulness (PU) of telematics as well as perceived ease of use (PEOU) affected drivers’ adoption intentions. PEOU had a greater effect on adoption intentions than PU, and technology characteristics had a greater effect on TTF than task characteristics. Moreover, individuals’ perceptions of perceived enjoyment and uniqueness affected PU and PEOU. The negative perceptions of perceived risk and performance gap affected PU and PEOU, respectively. Furthermore, driving experience significantly weakened the relationship between PU and intentions. Originality/value: Telematics is a niche market due to the development of the Internet of Things, but users’ adoption intentions remain unknown.

"The effects of integrated information & service, institutional mechanism and need for cognition (NFC) on consumer omnichannel adoption behavior","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065747300&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2018-0209&partnerID=40&md5=148af64b105b24ef7018b8143b942100","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents of consumers’ omnichannel (OC) adoption intention and explore how consumers’ personality trait affects their OC adoption behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 227 Korean consumers were invited to participate in a survey study, and partial least squares–structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the measurement and structural models. Findings: The results show that three consumer groups by “Need for Cognition (NFC)” show different response to four identified OC attribute/benefits. Finally, the authors hypothesize and find that shed light on the possible ways to differentiate OC marketing for different target consumers and provide implications for practice and further research. Research limitations/implications: This study provides empirical evidence that OC is an expanded retail format of e-commerce, which is predominantly affected by how information on the cross-channel marketing mix/retail strategies is delivered to consumers. From communication perspective, findings suggest that retail communication strategy need more careful attention in dealing with individual difference of consumers. In addition, the significant role of NFC on consumers’ OC adoption process validates the importance of customization and differentiation in retailers’ message to different consumer groups. In order to do so, comprehensive analysis on consumer database may be necessary to develop personalized OC service. In-depth analysis of consumer profile may enable more specific methods for marketing and managing consumers in the OC context. Although the study provides additional empirical findings for consumers’ perception on selected characteristics of OC (i.e. delivery approach of information and service in OC and institutional mechanism of OC), there may be additional extrinsic motivation factors which affect consumers’ OC adoption behavior. Extrinsic factors such as web design, convenience, assortment, moving saving which trigger positive perception of OC, may be important determinants to consider. Furthermore, situational factor such as social media (Huseyinoglu et al., 2018) and behavioral factors such as platform use habit (Chen, 2018) may also be significant in assessing consumers’ OC adoption behavior. Finally, this study has been conducted on a particular culture setting, and the generalizability of study findings, particularly about the role of NFC may need to be improved by cross-culture evaluation. Practical implications: NFC-high and medium consumers are likely to use the four OC service options in future, while a larger proportion of the NFC-low consumers shows negative response to the OC service usage. This evidently shows that innovative features of OC service are not homogenously adopted by consumers, and subject to their experience and intrinsic difference, adoption rate was found to vary. This suggests that companies need to pay careful attention in implementing innovative OC service, and may approach communication of information strategically for different consumer groups. For high-NFC consumers with previous BOPIS experience, retailers may effectively engage them by enhancing and expanding the BOPIS service features, yet for low-NFC consumers, raising awareness and initiating interest among unexperienced consumers may be more imminent issue. Indirect communication using peripheral cues may be necessary to draw less motivated consumer group. Social implications: The OC retailers may need to set the scope and range of information into in-depth information and simplified/unified information, and address the different type of information to different consumer groups in order to facilitate consumers’ OC adoption. For consumers with medium and high NFC, it may be necessary to provide in-depth, detailed information relevant to product quality and promotional items consistently both in on/offline channels to gain their trust. Consumers with low NFC are found to prefer unified and simplified messages on information for price, delivery, inventory in on/offline channels. Originality/value: This study addresses the perceived value of unique and fundamental features and specificity of OC service by consumers with different personality trait. The authors develop consumers’ OC adoption model based on the theory of reasoned action, which depicts relationship between four extrinsic motivation factors and consumers’ intention for the OC usage, which is further differentiated by an intrinsic factor. We segment consumers based on individual difference of “NFC” and investigate how different consumer groups value different aspect of the selected OC attributes and benefits. Findings validate the importance of customization and differentiation in retailers’ message to different consumer groups and in facilitating consumers’ OC adoption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Information consistency; Integrated information and service; Need for cognition; Omnichannel; Omnichannel institutional mechanisms; Retail management; Service integration",""

Previous studies suggest companies operating within such industries cannot solely rely on hard marketing strategies “to maximize sales and profits as they do with soaps and shoes” (Davidson, 2003, p. 7). Instead, they must find soft strategies for improving company and industry image and legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach: This research relies on qualitative analysis of historical data and documents. Findings: Soft strategies deployed by Chinese pawnbrokers – such as interpretations, moral value advocacies and institutionalized arrangements – contributed substantially to improving pawnbroking’s image and business legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: Interconnections among ethical values, image, business legitimacy and select marketing strategies are clarified. The efficacy of historically analyzing previously implemented business strategies and their embedding contexts is discussed. Practical implications: Strategies Chinese pawnbrokers used to mitigate their previously negative image and boost their business legitimacy suggest strategies current socially disapproved companies can use to improve their image and business legitimacy.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 418 completed responses were obtained and provided the data to analyse and test the hypothesised research model. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modelling using PLS was employed. Findings: Findings reveal that customer awareness of the current CSR initiatives to different stakeholder groups significantly influences their perceptions of what social initiatives are actually undertaken by firms for their economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibility. In addition, customer views of what firms actually do in respect to social initiatives are significantly related to their level of CSR expectations. This indicates that the customers will always expect more from banks compared to what they actually do. Surprisingly, CSR perception is not directly related to customers’ loyalty, which contradicts the majority of previous studies indicating that CSR perception influences consumer behaviour. Originality/value: This study provides an original contribution to the CSR body of knowledge, especially for developing countries where the awareness level is low. It also provides a deep understanding of the influence of CSR into consumer behaviour, as it investigates the influence of the full construct of CSR into customer loyalty.

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a structural model to examine the relationship between user innovation behaviors toward UGC and three attitude factors: involvement, consumer knowledge and customer orientation. The empirical analysis is based on a consumer survey that examines the commonalities and differences between Japan and China. In each country, two social media services are chosen as representative cases of the UGC business model to measure user innovation behaviors toward the quality and quantity aspects.

Findings: The impact of COO fit on pre- and post-alliance changes in attitude toward the partner brand showed a nonlinear relationship from high-, to moderate-, to low-knowledge consumers. High COO fit significantly and positively affected pre- and post-alliance changes in attitude toward the partner brand more for high- and low-knowledge consumers than for moderate-knowledge consumers. In contrast, low COO fit significantly and positively affected pre- and post-alliance changes in attitude toward the partner brand more for moderate-knowledge consumers than for high- and low-knowledge consumers.

"Understanding consumer ethics in China’s demographic shift and social reforms","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062459867&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2017-0250&partnerID=40&md5=55960416f72d1d0a9a81149cb69de7ca","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore some specific, current social phenomena in China that may influence consumers’ ethical beliefs and practices, focusing on how some top-down, social and political changes could shape consumer behavior that needs to be understood in the Chinese context. Design/methodology/approach: Extensive literature was critically reviewed to explore recent macro-societal reforms in China and their impact on consumers’ (un)ethical practices. Findings: The authors lay out how China, a government-led society, underwent a series of political reforms resulting in demographic shifts that differentiate it from its western, industrialized counterparts. The authors connect these societal changes with Chinese characteristics to consumers’ ethical evaluations, forming a new angle to understand consumer ethics in China. The authors also draw on two empirical examples to illustrate the argument. Originality/value: While consumer ethics are often explained by either cultural factors or individual variations, the authors discuss how one’s ethical practice is shaped by one’s social position, which is a product of national-level public policy. The discussions have ramifications for the study of consumers’ social class and ethical practices because they take into account the elusive social positions and ambiguous social class consciousness of the Chinese population that have resulted from social mobility. The discussions may give practitioners a better understanding of the ethical rationale behind consumers’ changing lifestyles especially in the Chinese context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Consumer ethics; Public policy; Social stratification",""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper outlines and critically analyses the key trends based on 15 prime instances of customer experience innovation from the past ten years in Thailand across three industries: retail, fuel service and insurance. Findings: Customer experience in Thailand is still in its nascent stage. This is because firms are yet to realise their full potential as critical brand differentiators. Many Thai firms also miss collaboration opportunities with external partners when innovating customer experiences. This is despite the overwhelming contributions from local SMEs to breakthrough innovations and creativity. Consequently, many customer experience innovations in Thailand are yet to be truly memorable and unique. Originality/value: This is the first paper that critically examines the trends in customer experience across the retail, fuel service and insurance. It is also the only paper that outlines strategic implications of customer experience strategies and innovations to date for Thailand. Both future research topics and managerial implications for Thai professionals are discussed in the paper. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer experience innovation; Customer experience strategy; Thailand",""
"What drives consumers’ mobile shopping? 4Ps or shopping preferences?","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054909570&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2017-0167&partnerID=40&md5=afbdbcb8100f0f3964e3ee62d50bb74a","Purpose: Mobile shopping emerges, but the marketing factors driving consumers’ mobile shopping lack clarification. Literature gaps also exist to view mobile shopping from a consumer behavior’s perspective. The purpose of this paper therefore is to empirically explore the issue based on the lifestyle perspective, 4Ps marketing theory and the information system (IS) success model. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method was adopted. Data were gathered from consumers who had experience in mobile shopping. The collected data were analyzed with PLS to explore the issues. Findings: The results showed that platform use habit, price comparison preference, shopping independence preference and promotion marketing quality were significantly associated with consumers’ use of mobile shopping apps/websites. They also showed that promotion marketing quality, price marketing quality and product marketing quality were the important marketing factors driving consumers’ user satisfaction of mobile shopping apps/websites. Finally, the results also indicated the importance of both consumers’ use and user satisfaction of mobile shopping apps/websites in arousing their continuous use intention. Research limitations/implications: The results of the study bridge the gap between the 4Ps marketing theory and the IS success model. They provide a direction for further studies to bridge the marketing theories and the IS theories in exploring the development of mobile commerce. Practical implications: The results facilitate the management of mobile shopping apps/websites in building and keeping a long-term relationship with consumers through providing good marketing qualities in the core marketing mix. The results also indicate the importance of user satisfaction in branding management and relationship management of mobile shopping apps/websites. Originality/value: The results showed that price comparison preference and shopping independence preference were significantly associated with consumers’ use of mobile shopping apps/websites due to the convenient access empowered by mobility in shopping services. The results also suggest that with good design in 4Ps marketing qualities of mobile shopping apps/websites, including product, price and promotion, mobile shopping could be a suitable lifestyle satisfying consumers. However, the results also showed that factors driving consumers’ system use and user satisfaction of mobile shopping apps/websites were not the same. Finally, the results validated the significant impact of both system use and user satisfaction in activating consumers’ continuance intention of mobile shopping. They provided a positive link between consumers’ mobile shopping apps/websites use to their keeping the lifestyle of mobile shopping. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4Ps marketing qualities of mobile shopping apps/websites; Mobile shopping; Platform use habit; Shopping preferences; The IS success model; User satisfaction",""
"Role of logistics strategy, coordination and customer service commitment on Chinese manufacturing firm competitiveness","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056756724&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2017-0224&partnerID=40&md5=5f344387bb0d003b7ed083073f6e1c23","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the robustness of the three (Bowersox and Daugherty, 1987) dimensions (process, market and information strategies) of logistics strategy in a Chinese manufacturing environment. In addition, the impact of the three dimensions, coordination and customer service on the organizational competitiveness of Chinese manufacturers firms is explored. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an online survey hosted at Sojump.com and disseminated to members of a manufacturing trade association. A total of 513 completed responses were generated. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation model (SEM) were used to test the hypothesized relationships in the conceptual model. Findings: The findings suggest that the three dimensions of the Bowersox and Daugherty (1987) were relevant to the Chinese manufacturing environment. The authors also found that the overall logistics strategy measured by the three dimensions as well as coordination and customer service effectiveness positively influenced Chinese manufacturing firms’ competiveness. Research limitations/implications: Further research into logistics and supply chain management may benefit from expanding the understanding to include antecedents and moderating factors (e.g. competition, market turbulence and differences in business environment) into the model. Future studies on cross-cultural logistics/supply chain management logistics may benefit from the application of strategy-structure-process (SSP) approaches similar to those discussed in this manuscript. Practical implications: This study attempted to provide a robust conceptual framework to increase the understanding of the role of logistics/supply chain management strategy and provide insights to managers seeking to improve firm competitiveness. An essential implication of the conceptual model presented in this manuscript is the dynamics of logistics strategy as a competitive tool. Social implications: The findings provide an understanding of how business and manufacturing are operating in various locations in China with opportunities for employment and socio-economic gain among the population of these geographic locations. Having employment can provide a better quality of life and assist the community in developing its opportunities for other groups. Originality/value: As the current Chinese administration seeks to achieve its goal of generating higher value-added production through its “Made in China 2025” initiative, the results the authors represent are quite timely and insightful. Examining manufacturing firms’ logistics strategies (i.e., OLS), coordination and customer service could provide state planners (SOEs) and/or privately owned Chinese manufacturers insights on how to move closer towards their aforementioned goal and achieve global competitiveness. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration-coordination; Competitive strategy; Consumer behaviour; International logistics; Market orientation; Statistical methods",""
"Why are experienced users of WeChat likely to continue using the app?","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055865874&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2017-0246&partnerID=40&md5=d3a8d51e1574a8b83d0b542d7ab7ef49","Purpose: Mobile social apps permeate every facet of daily life through the pervasive use of smartphones. Customer retention with mobile social apps has become extremely important for app-related companies. The purpose of this paper is to explore why experienced users in mobile social apps (e.g. WeChat) are likely to continue using the app. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposed a conceptual model to identify key determinants of continuance intention of WeChat users and highlight the effects of individual experience. Data were collected from WeChat users, which is one of the most popular mobile social apps in China. The study employed partial least squares regression to test the research model based on a survey of 295 valid responses. Findings: Results showed that trust, which was driven by user satisfaction and perceived critical mass, played a critical role in influencing the continuance intention of WeChat users. Moreover, tie strength exerted a negative moderating effect on the relationship between trust and continuance intention. Specifically, tie strength and perceived critical mass had strong impacts on the continuance intention of low-experience users. In addition, the effect of frequency was closely associated with the continuance intention of high-experience users. Research limitations/implications: This study addressed the issue of mobile social app continuance intention by providing an innovative means to explore the key antecedents of user continuance intention from the experience perspective. The findings not only prove that trust plays a central role in influencing the continuance intention of experienced users but also reveal that the determinants of continuance intention vary among users with different experience. The results provide insights into the key antecedents of experienced WeChat user continuance intention and contribute to the literature on mobile social apps and individual differences. Practical implications: The results provide suggestions for mobile social app practitioners to effectively plan mobile social app retention practices and to set up appropriate incentive mechanisms for retaining users with different experiences. Originality/value: Although abundant studies have focused on the adoption of media users, few studies have investigated the post-adoption behavior of experienced users in the context of mobile social apps. This study revealed the key determinants of the continuance intention of WeChat users and pinpointed the different impacts of these antecedents on users with different levels of experience. It also provides useful guidelines for practitioners to effectively retain users with different levels of experience. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; Experienced users; Mobile social apps; Tie strength; Trust",""

Design/methodology/approach: Face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted with 430 street vendors in Bangkok; 415 usable surveys were analyzed. By applying K-means cluster analysis, two segments were found with 200 initial and 215 advanced adopters. A multi-group analysis was employed to investigate differences of relationships between the two groups. Findings: The findings reveal significant similarities and dissimilarities between the two groups of vendors. Both initial and advanced adopters emphasize trust of service providers. The first group relies more on perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment in motivating m-commerce adoption but depends less on perceived usefulness. On the contrary, for the latter group, the influence of perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment significantly decreases, but the effect of perceived usefulness significantly increases. Practical implications: This study sheds light on the managerial implications related to how service providers can tailor their marketing strategies to target vendors in disparate diffusion stages, and it encourages building trust between partners over time. Originality/value: Due to the lack of theoretical and managerial understanding of factors that drive m-commerce adoption for micro businesses, this study identifies distinct adoption stages and offers valuable insights into the similarities and differences among initial and advanced adopters. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mobile commerce; Perceived enjoyment; Stage of adoption; Street vendors; Technology acceptance model; Trust",""

Therefore, to fill this void in the literature and address the concerns of prior studies, the purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical perceptions of Chinese consumers as an example of effective and efficient management of company/brand strategies in an economy experiencing rapid socioeconomic growth. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines 328 Chinese consumers’ purchase intentions based on their ethical perceptions toward Apple and P&G through mediating (i.e. consumer–corporate identification (CCI) and brand trust) and moderating (i.e. consumer gender, age, education and residence) effects. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the constructs and overall model. Findings: The ethical perceptions of consumers translate into purchase intentions, both at the corporate and product brand levels. Similarly, a significant direct relationship between CCI and brand trust reveals that corporate-level ethical identification is a trivial matter to customers, although these perceptions do apply to product brands under a corporate umbrella. Furthermore, to identify target groups of Chinese consumers who are receptive to ethical appeals, moderating variables were found to be useful. Originality/value: The results confirm that the mediating role of CCI is more influential in the context of Chinese consumers’ ethical perceptions, followed by brand trust. In relation to demographics, ethical perceptions affect CCI and brand trust more positively in females and highly educated consumers in China. Similarly, the relationship between consumers’ ethical perception and their trust in brand is revealed more influential in urban residents than they do in rural. This broadens the applications and contexts of this research model. The results provide managerial guidance on enhancing potential ethical perceptions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand trust; Consumer ethical perception; Consumer–corporate identification; Moderating variable; Purchase intention",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of guerrilla marketing in social media on brand image. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed based on the information acceptance model (IACM). The research model was validated through structural equation modelling based on the surveys of 385 university students. Findings: The results support the proposed model and confirm that guerrilla marketing in social media has a positive effect on both functional and symbolic brand image. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted with university students. This sample was deemed appropriate since the study had to be conducted with people who use social media. However, although the age group of university students constitutes the majority of social media users, they may not fully represent the whole population. Also, this study showed four guerrilla marketing examples to participants before they commenced filling in the questionnaire. Although the authors selected the most generic guerrilla advertisements during the pilot tests and eliminated the ones which were difficult to understand, this can still be considered as limitations of the study. Practical implications: This study has both theoretical and managerial implications. First, most of the guerrilla marketing studies focus on consumers and neglect possible impacts on brands. In order to fulfil this gap in the literature, this study investigates the influence of guerrilla marketing in brand image. Besides, this study contributes to IACM by expanding its scope through testing its determinants on “brand image”. It proves that IACM is valid for use in different contexts. On the managerial side, this study provides marketers with a frame of reference to understand the information adoption process of guerrilla marketing on social media. Originality/value: Current studies regarding the influence of guerrilla marketing mostly focus on consumers, where the possible impacts on brands have been relatively neglected. This study attempts to fill this gap by focussing on the brand image. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Functional brand image; Guerrilla marketing; Information acceptance model (IACM); Social media; Symbolic brand image",""

Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical moderator regression analysis and simple slope analysis are used to test the postulated hypotheses, and 385 consumers in Taiwan are studied. Findings: The findings revealed that consumer ethnocentrism, perceived quality, perceived price and perceived brand image are significantly associated with the willingness to buy domestic products. Moreover, consumer ethnocentrism significantly moderates the relationships of the model. Research limitations/implications: Consumer ethnocentrism increases the positive effects of perceived quality and perceived brand image on the willingness to buy domestic products in developing countries, whereas it may increase the negative effect of perceived price on the willingness to buy domestic products. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that practitioners should not only improve the quality and brand image of domestic products but also avoid putting a high price on domestic products to increase the willingness to buy domestic products for consumers in developing countries.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between shopping and consumers’ subjective well-being (SWB), the mediation effect of interpersonal relationship satisfaction and the moderation effects of tradition-directedness and trust in strangers on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This research includes two studies. Study 1 tested hypotheses regarding the effects of general shopping behaviours based on data from the 2012 Survey of the Chinese General Social Survey (n=5,210). Study 2 tested hypotheses regarding the effects of mall shopping based on a questionnaire survey conducted in 2016 (n=251). Findings: Results showed that shopping promoted SWB and interpersonal relationship satisfaction mediated this correlation. Findings also revealed that both the direct effect of mall shopping on SWB and the indirect effect through interpersonal relationship satisfaction were contingent on the level of tradition-directedness; the direct effect was significant only at a low level of tradition-directedness. Trust in strangers moderated the effect of mall shopping on interpersonal relationship satisfaction. Originality/value: The economy and society in China are changing tremendously, affecting consumers’ values and behaviour. This study highlights one aspect of this change, provides a framework for the exploration of the relationship between shopping and SWB and extends a new understanding of how Chinese consumers’ behaviours and lifestyles are associated. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Interpersonal relationship satisfaction; Shopping; Subjective well-being; Tradition-directedness; Trust",""

Ethical beliefs and judgements have been predominantly investigated within this area. Recent research argues for consumer ethics to be measured in terms of behaviours rather than attitudinal judgements, due to a potential pitfall of attitudinal scales, which researchers often refer to as an attitude–behaviour gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the dimensions of ethically minded consumer behaviour (EMCB) in an Asian emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 316 Vietnamese consumers was conducted to investigate their ethically minded behaviours. Findings: The SEM analyses reveal a significant impact of long-term orientation on EMCB, whereas spirituality has no impact. Collectivism, attitude to ethically minded consumption and subjective norms are found to influence the dimensions of EMCB. Age, income and job levels have effects on EMCB dimensions, but gender, surprisingly, has no effect. Practical implications: The study can be beneficial to businesses and policy makers in Vietnam or any similar Asian markets, especially in encouraging people to engage with ethical consumption. Furthermore, it provides practitioners in Vietnam with a measurement instrument that can be used to profile and segment consumers. Originality/value: This is among the first studies utilising and examining EMCB, especially in Vietnam where research into consumer ethics is scant. It contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a greater understanding of the impact of personal characteristics and cultural environment on consumer ethics, being measured by the EMCB scale which has taken into account the consumption choices. Furthermore, this study adds further validation to the EMCB scale. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Collectivism; Consumer ethics; Emerging markets; Ethical consumption; Long-term orientation; Love of money; Spirituality; Subjective norms",""

This is especially true of China, a large developing country with many business investment opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between consumer ethical beliefs and the personality traits of consumer relationship proneness, religiousness, attitude toward business and love of money, which are seldom explored in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is collected by systematic sampling in China and a sample of 434 individuals is surveyed.

"Do consumers want mobile commerce? A closer look at M-shopping and technology adoption in Malaysia","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056123179&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2017-0093&partnerID=40&md5=0a7f971822d6ee37213a1ecdd5e5f73a","Purpose: Mobile shopping is expected to emerge as a new way of shopping as the Asia Pacific region moves towards the digital era. It is important to understand factors that influence consumers’ intentions to adopt this new shopping channel, especially in developing countries such as Malaysia where it has the fastest growing mobile penetration rate in the world. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and includes additional variables such as personal innovativeness (PI) and trust. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical data from 453 consumers were tested against a proposed model using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: Findings suggest that most of the constructs in the model (i.e. trust, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitudes, PI and perceived behavioural control) influence a shopper’s intentions towards adopting mobile shopping. For example, consumers’ attitudes towards M-shopping adoption is higher if a system is not complex and easy to use; if consumers can easily pull out their mobile devices from their pockets to browse or shop by using just one finger, without a complicated process, they tend to use M-shopping channels. In addition, when mobile technology is user-friendly and free from mental effort, it creates positive perceptions that the system is useful, developing stronger intentions for consumers to adopt this alternative. Originality/value: Since M-shopping is a personalised activity that involves money transactions, consumers are more cautious with adoption intentions, and do not follow social norms blindly. Thus, the empirical evidence from Malaysian consumers contributes to literature with insights into their specific m-shopping behaviour in this emerging market. In addition, from a theoretical perspective, the research model in this study integrates both TAM and TPB to provide a holistic view of consumers’ M-shopping adoption intentions in an emerging market, incorporating user-centric factors (i.e. trust and PI). An important finding which differs from other studies is that the relationship between subjective norms and behavioural intention to use M-shopping was not significant, which is contrary to the findings of previous studies. Moreover, attitude was found to mediate the effect of PEOU and PU on consumer’s intention towards mobile shopping adoption. The validated instrument would serve as a useful guideline for researchers during development and refinement of studies on M-shopping. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; M-shopping; Malaysia; Mobile commerce; Mobile shopping; Technology adoption",""

Findings: Perceived values explain consumer attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural intentions in the MC context. In particular, they help to increase the explained variance of the intention to adopt MC by about 9.58 per cent compared with the TPB. Finally, a cross-effect on consumer attitudes from subjective norms is also found. Research limitations/implications: Future studies would benefit from investigating other variables (e.g. innovativeness or trust) and using actual behaviour (e.g. online purchases). Practical implications: Business managers should pay attention to different forms of consumer values to understand how and why consumers adopt MC in a developing country. Originality/value: This study fills the gap in the literature by simultaneously investigating the role of utilitarian, hedonic and social value in a TPB model in the MC context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hedonic value; Intention to adopt; Mobile commerce; Social value; Utilitarian value; Vietnam",""
"Chinese perception and willingness to buy Taiwanese brands: The role of ethnocentrism and animosity","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055288829&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2017-0203&partnerID=40&md5=e76bb845fdc469ba3164d25abff0e45a","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine ethnocentrism and animosity in a special context of two societies that share cultural, historical, ethnic and geographical characteristics. In particular, it first investigates the relationships between Chinese ethnocentrism and animosity toward Taiwan, and then it examines the impact of these two factors on the Chinese perception of Taiwanese brand quality and their purchase intent. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 605 respondents from China, data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that although Chinese animosity toward Taiwan is moderate, it is significantly driven by ethnocentrism, which has a significant and negative effect on willingness to buy, but not on the perception of Taiwanese brand quality. The Chinese animosity toward Taiwan, however, has negative and significant effects on their perception of Taiwanese brand quality and their intention of purchasing Taiwanese brands. Research limitations/implications: The immense size of the country has impeded the representativeness of the authors’ sample and the generalizability of the results. Also, the study covers only one type of product. Practical implications: Forming partnerships with local Chinese businesses and developing strong ties with local communities could be considered as a solution to minimize or circumvent the effect of animosity and might help foreign companies appear more “local.” Originality/value: In contrast to past studies that investigated ethnocentrism and animosity in the context of countries presenting several differences (e.g. China vs USA), this study investigates the effect of ethnocentrism and animosity in the context of two countries (China and Taiwan) that share cultural, historical, ethnic and geographic characteristics. Despite the strong ties between the two countries, the Chinese have a certain animosity, though moderate, toward Taiwan and consequently are less inclined to buy Taiwanese brands. This implies that Chinese animosity toward a country may be toned down or pronounced, depending on whether they have strong or weak ties with that country. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Animosity; Brand’s perceived quality; China; Ethnocentrism; Taiwan; Willingness to buy",""

More particularly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of service quality (SQ), customer satisfaction, switching cost and consumer innovativeness (CI) on service switching intention (SWI); the mediating role of customer satisfaction; and the moderating role of service switching cost on the relationship between CI and SWI. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire survey that yielded 535 responses. Using structural equation modelling approach, the partial least square software, version 3 was utilised to test the study hypotheses. Findings: Results reveal that customer satisfaction, service switching cost and CI directly affect SWI. However, no significant relationship was found between SQ and SWI. Again, data supported the mediating effect of customer satisfaction as well as the moderating effect of service switching cost. Research limitations/implications: It is expected that the findings from this study will enable policymakers, managers and marketers to formulate better strategies and effectively implement loyalty programs, preventing their customers from switching. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by testing switching costs as the quasi moderator. Moreover, this is a pioneer study to consider CI as the antecedent of SWI. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer innovativeness; Customer satisfaction; Partial least square; Service quality; Service switching; Service switching costs",""
"What makes fashion consumers “click”? Generation of eWoM engagement in social media","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062829285&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2018-0115&partnerID=40&md5=9b0bb8dabf2ea9cfba2a289eddd3262a","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the perceived exposure of fashion consumers to different types of fashion brands’ social media marketing (SMM) actions in social media, and its relationship with the intention to engage in electronic word-of-mouth (eWoM) behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study uses a survey conducted on a stratified random sample of 241 Indonesian members of fashion social media brand communities (SMBCs). The research design includes 19 types of SMM actions and 3 types of eWoM engagement behaviors, and investigates their relationship using point-biserial correlation. Findings: Generation of intention to engage in “pass-on” and “endorsement” eWoM has different drivers and serves different purposes. The findings suggest that endorsement engagement is contingent on the consumer’s perceived exposure to marketing action stimuli, while pass-on engagement is driven by cognitive-inducing actions. Research limitations/implications: This study extends current theory on SMM strategy and its relationship with eWoM engagement with a theoretically grounded conceptualization of eWoM engagement behaviors through the use of one-click social plug-ins. Practical implications: The study offers guidelines for fashion brands to effectively design their SMM strategies by identifying specific drivers of consumers’ intention to engage in eWoM. Originality/value: This study identifies sources of generation of eWoM engagement behavioral intention from a fine-grained analysis of marketing actions across various fashion SMBCs. Besides, it extends the applicability of the “mere exposure” effect to the SMM context. The research pioneers the study on fashion consumers’ eWoM engagement behaviors in Indonesia, a country with one of the largest social media populations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand community; Electronic word-of-mouth engagement; Fashion; Indonesia; Perceived exposure; Social media marketing",""

It involves a collective set of actions and activities that are coherently steered to regenerate the engagement experience of the target market emanating from the brand strategy. Nevertheless, there are still lack of case studies demonstrating this in the B2B business sector. The purpose of this paper is to exhibit a brand transformation initiative taken by a B2B business, particularly the handling challenges leading to the initiative coupled with the framework and processes involved to make it a success. Design/methodology/approach: A case study method was applied with documentation of inputs captured from different stakeholders. Consulting practitioners from a brand consultancy involved in the brand transformation initiative documented interviews and audit findings which offered first-hand report regarding their involvement and experience of bringing the B2B business through the brand transformation journey. Findings: Brand transformation at Fagerdala warranted a radical re-orientation of the brand positioning that supports a clear business intent that was put forward. The initiative encompasses strong leadership, commitment and change management to drive transformational changes involving both internal and external stakeholders. An innovation oriented mind-set is critical to drive radical changes to support coherent efforts that could ultimately engender to distinct brand experience to targeted stakeholders. Practical implications: This paper provides brand managers, particularly the brand owners practical and realisable example on how to plan and execute brand transformation in a B2B business environment. More specifically, it highlights the indicators for embarking on this initiative, the approach to drive brand transformation based on established brand strategy frameworks and finally how to execute the strategy in a practical manner. Originality/value: This paper extends the concept of brand transformation that has recently been mentioned in literature from one of conceptual perspective to one of practice perspective. It emphasises and underscores some of the details of execution that is instrumental in the practice of brand transformation within a B2B industry sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B branding; Brand management; Brand transformation; Branding strategies; Innovation adoption",""

A new index, “Deviation from Leagility” (DFL), is introduced, aiming to optimise supply chain design and investigate the relationship between supply chain leagility and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The partial least squares (PLS) method was employed to analyse data collected from 299 Australian firms by administering a structured questionnaire. Findings: The results indicate that most companies adopt the leagile supply chain rather than the lean or pure agile design. Furthermore, better business performance is achievable when deviation from a balanced supply chain in which both aspects of leanness and agility are equally embedded is minimised. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to a number of constraints that measure leagility; further research is needed to incorporate different aspects of agility. Practical implications: The findings of this study could provide a guideline for supply chain executives to improve their company’s performance by designing a more balanced leagile supply chain. Originality/value: This study is unique in its in-depth empirical investigation of modelling of leagile supply chain using a new index, and also addressing: first, the current mismatch between the well-known mutually exclusive strategies (lean/agile); and second, what has later been found when the proposed models were quantitatively tested. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agile supply chain; Firm performance; Leagile supply chain; Lean supply chain; Supply chain design",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a mail questionnaire sent to Malaysian companies that export to Arab-speaking countries and achieved a response rate of 27.92 percent, resulting in a sample of 106 exporters. Findings: The results of the path analyses indicate a positive impact of relational variables (adaptation, cooperation and communication) on export performance. However, the authors found that the impact was mediated by trust and commitment, rather than being direct. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that the impact of relational variables on export performance is complex and indirect. Mediators and moderators play important roles in this relationship. Practical implications: Firms should invest in export relationships with the aim of building trust and commitment, which are the primary factors that affect export performance. Originality/value: The authors have shed light on the way relational variables affect export performance. Moreover, this study contributes to a better understanding of small emerging markets, which are poorly represented in studies in this field. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Export; Relationship marketing; Trust",""

Furthermore, the variance within the studied relationships is explored across the segments of the selected consumer sample. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares and finite mixture–partial least squares path modeling approaches are employed to examine the studied relationships and check for heterogeneity, respectively, among the sample of 406 Vietnamese consumers. Findings: The results indicate that individualistic values positively and negatively affect attitudes toward purchase consequences at the individual and environmental levels, respectively, while collectivistic values have only a positive impact on attitudes at the environment level. Compared to the individual level, attitudes toward environmental purchase consequences propagate a fuller commitment to green consumption. Collectivistic, but not individualistic, consumers are a suitable target segment for green business. Consumers within the selected sample exhibit different green behavioral patterns. Originality/value: This research provides valuable insights into the under-researched aspect of green consumption commitment based on an extended value–attitude–behavior model.

"The factors of consumer confidence recovery after scandals in food supply chain safety","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057169956&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2017-0232&partnerID=40&md5=d8c20c8deecd3591fb5a2b18e059a1c9","Purpose: Viewing consumer confidence as a set of static factors has informed previous research and underpinned strategies used in recovering from food safety quality failures, but this approach has not delivered reliable and quick recovery from large-scale food safety scandals. The purpose of this paper is to examine extant models and the factors they are composed of, and suggest an extended model that has a better potential for consumer confidence. The paper focuses on food products where supply chains are visible, and use these features to group the findings. Design/methodology/approach: In this study principal components and logit analyses are used to assess the role of 30 variables operating in a consumer confidence model constructed from several existing in the literature. This combined model considers emotional, cognitive, trust and sociodemographic factors. In total, 14 independent factors are identified. The authors examine the factors, and from these, the decision-making mechanisms before and after the Sanlu Infant Milk Formula (IMF) scandal of 2008. Findings: The authors find that the factors considered by consumers are different for different IMF supply chains, and different again before and after the scandal. The authors develop the argument for an extension to the existing models, incorporating a dynamic consumer confidence system. Research limitations/implications: The paper uses a single survey after the focus event to establish “before” and “after” decision-making factors. Since the IMF scandal is recent and of very high profile, this is likely valid even if it carries memory bias effects. The study is directly applicable to food safety scandals in a Chinese context. Deductive reasoning extends our assertions to a wider context. They are logically validated but have not been formally tested. Practical implications: Using this system as a framework a checklist for recovery from a similar food safety scandal is suggested. The authors also suggest more general use for use where supply chains features are visible to consumers. Originality/value: Models for food safety consumer confidence recovery have previously focused on identifying models and the static factors they consist of. These do represent a reflection of how this phenomenon operates, but using the principals of this model nevertheless does not result in good recovery from extreme food safety failures. This paper contributes by extending these models to one that can be applied for better recovery. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer confidence; Food safety quality failure; Marketing in China; Service recovery; Supply chain management; Trust",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the key elements that influence an individual’s intention of adopting credit cards in the transitional economy Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was developed based on the technology adoption literature. After data cleaning, 595 responses were deemed valid. Factor analysis (EFA and CFA) was utilized on split samples, and a structural equation model developed to identify the influential technology adoption factors. Findings: The analysis found strong support for the hypotheses theoretically developed. In the transitional economy of Vietnam, consumer’s intention to adopt credit cards was influenced by “Perceived usefulness (PU),” “Perceived ease of use (PEOU),” “subjective norm (SN),” “perceived self-efficacy (PSE)” and “Anxiety”. However, “perceived financial cost (PFC)” was not a significant factor. Research limitations/implications: The use of cross-sectional data does not enable the analysis of time sequence of the determinants of consumer intention. Practical implications: This research provides a body of knowledge on modern banking payment systems and credit card utilization factors in the transitional economy of Vietnam which has relevance for other transitional as well as developing economies of Southeast Asia, and is a good reference source for foreign investors, banks and card service companies. Originality/value: To date, there are no studies that explore the interaction between “PU,” “PEOU,” “PFC,” “SN,” “PSE,” “Anxiety” and “Behavioral Intention” in the context of the Vietnamese credit card market, nor other transitional markets in Southeast Asia. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer intention; Credit card adoption; Technology acceptance model; Theory of reasoned action; Transitional economies; Vietnam",""

Design/methodology/approach: This research employed a multiple case study method where the e-commerce strategies of two mature franchise organisations were investigated in depth. Franchising experts were interviewed to provide an additional dimension to this study. Findings: This research found that e-commerce must be integrated with the overall business strategy for optimal franchise performance. Since all parties to the franchising relationship are affected by the introduction of e-commerce, both the franchisees’ and the franchisor’s interests must be considered when the strategy is being developed. In addition, the consumer’s perspective is central to how e-commerce is structured, and franchisees are best placed to know their customers’ needs because they are directly involved in operating their business and interfacing with customers. Practical implications: A preliminary model for e-commerce structures in service and retail franchising has been developed that depends on the nature of the business, the distribution arrangements and the order fulfilment arrangements. The two main avenues in e-commerce structuring were centralisation and decentralisation.

Design/methodology/approach: This study begins with an ethnographic study to ascertain the determinant factors that motivate or hinder an individual from performing regular MCU. The study involved stakeholders in various health services providers, including patients and medical professionals. The quantitative part of this study focuses on “preventive” segment of consumers. A survey was conducted covering 303 respondents, consisting of two sub-segments of people labelled “healthy lifestyle” and “unhealthy lifestyle”. Findings: Consumer behaviour with regards to needs for MCU must be categorised not based on demographics, but their health status – preventive or curative. The “preventive” group was found to have differences in triggers and barriers between the healthy vs unhealthy lifestyle subgroups. For the “healthy lifestyle” subgroup, the determining factors for a regular MCU are the perceived benefit of action, social deviance, and cost perception. For the “unhealthy lifestyle” subgroup, the determining factors for a regular MCU are the social deviance, disease heritage, belief in traditional medicine, no urgency and cost perception. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative study part indicated the differences between two segments: preventive vs curative. The quantitative study part is only conducted in the preventive segment and not covering the curative segment. It would be interesting to see the differences between these two segments. Practical implications: Implication of study: to create contextual marketing communication in each stakeholders/segments – to reach the marketing objectives. Different segment has different issues to handle and need a different marketing communication programme. Originality/value: Previous studies have focused on analysing the differences in groups based on their demographics, which does not illustrate a homogenous need for an MCU. This study contributes by addressing that researchers must differentiate between “preventive” and “curative” groups. Additionally, the study of triggers and barriers has interestingly found that the determinant factors for healthy and unhealthy lifestyle are not the same. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers; Consumer intention; Consumer segmentation; Ethnography; Medical checkup; Triggers",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct four experiments to test the influences of coldness on consumers’ attitude. In the first two experiments, the researchers use real/virtual brand names to test the moderating effect of brand status and customer power; in Study 3, the researchers test the moderating effect of autonomy; while in the last experiment, the findings in the previous experiments are extended to explain similar effect of cold/warm brand logo designs. Findings: This research finds that coldness also brings benefit to brands under certain circumstances. More specifically, cold endorsers/brand logo designs are only beneficial for brands of high (vs low) status, and can only attract consumers who experience high power (vs low power). Such effects are mediated by consumers’ perceived brand autonomy. Research limitations/implications: This research urges the managers to analyze the characteristics of the brand and its target consumer. It also points out that the effectiveness of warm/cold representative derives from the customer perceived brand autonomy. Originality/value: The authors’ contributions to the literature are as follows.

Design/methodology/approach: This investigation proposes a theoretical model tested using structural equation modelling. A questionnaire survey was developed to explore the relationships among communication, reputation, trust, commitment, loyalty and word-of-mouth (WOM). For this study, 744 valid questionnaires were collected from a sample of Portuguese car insurance holders. Findings: The results show that communication directly influences reputation, trust and commitment. Communication also indirectly influences loyalty through reputation, trust, and commitment and communication indirectly influences WOM via trust and commitment. In turn, reputation influences trust and trust impact on relational commitment. Finally, loyalty influences WOM.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a between-subject factorial design with 9 treatments involving 161 subjects to collect data to test the hypotheses. Findings: The study showed that, when given a positive disconfirmation, subjects feel better and are more satisfied, but when given a negative disconfirmation, they feel more negative and dissatisfied. Also, the effect size of positive disconfirmation on satisfaction and feelings about the service provider were significantly less than that of negative disconfirmation of the same size. Hence, in the event of a delay, managers may have to announce the upper bound of the delay duration so that passengers might feel better and become more satisfied when the actual delay duration is shorter than what was initially expected. In addition, they must try their best not to create situations of negative disconfirmation in light of their disproportional impact on satisfaction. Practical implications: According to the results, airline managers should estimate as accurately as possible the duration of a delay when there is one. Originality/value: A major contribution of this study is that manipulating the way delay duration information is given to passengers can affect feelings about the delay and the level of satisfaction with the airline. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airlines; Delay; Expectancy disconfirmation",""

As past research in fake goods buying has done, future investigations relating to this situation in the domain of ethical reasoning should accumulate samples from other regions of China as well, as customer perception relating to profound morality and counterfeit Purchase Intention may change from region to region. Practical implications: A few customers hold the opinion that luxury brands are lucrative because of the excessive costs of their products and therefore feel vindicated in buying counterfeits (Penz and Stottinger, 2005). Combatting this conviction requires luxury brand managers to endorse effective moral ideals and social commitment messages to prevail upon purchasers. Social implications: A few customers trust that they are helping local people, such as the peddlers who offer the fakes or the producers who make these goods, suggesting in a way that a few individuals have positive attitudes towards these type of counterfeit goods sold locally. For such customers, there can be marketing messages that can show them the other side of the issue, such as the lost sales and loss caused to the organisations, which result in people becoming jobless because of their actions. Originality/value: The primary goal of the study is to explore the relationship between the moral measurements of consumers and their attitudes and purchase intentions in the Chinese market. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer decision making; Consumer ethics; Theory of ethical values; Theory of planned behaviour; Theory of reasoned action",""
"Path to effective mobile advertising in Asian markets: Credibility, entertainment and peer influence","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059835591&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2017-0112&partnerID=40&md5=0ead4a9e99391566380d91050588487d","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose and test an integrated model of mobile advertising taking into consideration the unique characteristics of Asian consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The survey research method has been used to collect data among young mobile users in China and South Korea. A structural equation model (SEM) technique is employed to analyze the data. Findings: The results show that Chinese and South Korean consumers share similar beliefs and attitudes toward mobile advertising. Perceived informational usefulness, perceived entertainment usefulness, perceived ease of ease and credibility emerge as significant belief factors positively influencing attitude in both countries. Irritation, on the other hand, negatively predicts attitude. Attitude toward mobile advertising and subjective norm emerge as the strong predictors of consumers’ intention to use mobile advertising in both countries. The effects of perceived social usefulness on attitude and incentive on intention to use demonstrate different patterns between the Chinese and South Korean samples. Practical implications: The findings are particularly relevant to international marketing managers. To effectively reach Asian consumers through mobile, increasing credibility and entertainment values are the keys. Meanwhile, providing relevant information in easy to use format is also an important issue. Originality/value: Based on the established advertising theories, this study proposes an integrated model to examine how beliefs, attitude and other influencing factors affect mobile advertising effectiveness among Chinese and South Korean consumers. This research provides insights into the uniqueness and effectiveness of the new mobile medium as opposed to traditional media. Furthermore, this study deepens the understanding of advertising hierarchy effects in an international setting by examining similarities and differences between China and South Korea. Most of existing cross-cultural studies choose cultures that are sharply contrast to gain significant findings and to support established cross-cultural theories. It is also very important for researchers to examine cultures that are relatively similar to gain a better understanding of the impact of culture. The study answers such a call. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; China; Culture; Incentive; Mobile advertising; South Korea",""
"Ranking of choice cues for smartphones using the Best–Worst scaling method","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060149738&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2018-0004&partnerID=40&md5=e5ec10d48e4811400650e120877e4774","Purpose: The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach: Best–Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings: Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important. Findings due to gender, income and age difference were also analyzed and discussed for orderly decision-making purposes. Practical implications: The ranking of factors showing what choice cues consumers consider most or least important in a particular market helps practitioners to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for the market. The comparison of findings for gender, income and age difference can further help practitioners to devise various alternative marketing strategies for different market segments and identify underserved segments, if any. Originality/value: The BW scaling method, however, appropriate in ranking order of importance, had never been used in ranking choice cues of smartphone purchase. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of studies about ranking of choice cues on smartphone purchases in the Chinese context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Best–Worst scaling method; Buying decision process; Chinese context; Product attributes; Ranking of importance; Smartphone",""

This framework can help companies resolve bargaining problems and facilitate cooperation and effective negotiation of strategic alliances to build successful business relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The study considers Taiwanese agents’ bargaining power during negotiations with suppliers, using decision analysis to identify the variables affecting judgment. It uses Delphi–AHP methods to evaluate and develop a multi-criteria model explaining the critical factors to increase agents’ bargaining power and collaborative capability in the negotiation process. Findings: Two significant differences between supply chain management practices and managerial specialty are found. Results suggest that better supply chain management practices of agents could assist suppliers in reducing their stock and processing delivery costs, and suppliers could offer more of their marketing planning and strategies to agents to increase confidence in each other’s products. Research limitations/implications: It is hoped that this study will encourage more academics in the supply chain management field to investigate the extent to which other bargaining considerations act as facilitating or constraining factors in other Asian and non-Asian economies and other industries. Practical implications: This study focuses on collaborative thinking and cooperation to develop and improve positive and relational outcomes in agent–supplier relationships. Originality/value: The study analyzed the bargaining power of agents and collaborative innovation in the semiconductor industry from three major perspectives: professional competence, managerial competence and channel efficiency. The study provides effective suggestions for enhancing profits in agency-based cooperation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agent; Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Bargaining power; Collaboration; Delphi method; Delphi–AHP; Intermediary; Semiconductor industry; Strategic alliance",""

The purpose of this paper is to rationally allocate the profits and determine the most stable allocation scheme for the urban JDA as well as provide a direction for cooperation between express enterprises and lead managers to pay more attention to the comprehensive performance. Design/methodology/approach: Cooperative game-based methodologies including the proportion method, the core theory, nucleolus and Shapley value have been employed. Four criteria consisting of enterprise operation, customer satisfaction, environmental sustainability and information technology have been incorporated into Shapley value for improvement. Findings: This paper reveals that express enterprises in logistics service market can achieve more benefit from JDA than those who operate separately. Among proposed profit allocation schemes, improved Shapley value scheme shows more rationality by considering partners’ asymmetric contribution. Besides, a stable alliance can be always ensured with partners’ lower propensity to disrupt and relatively balanced negotiation power under improved Shapley value scheme. Originality/value: This paper makes a few attempts to contribute to the literature on the improvement of Shapley value and applies the concept of “propensity to disrupt” into the field of logistics. Besides, this paper provides various profit allocation schemes and incorporates influencing factors into Shapley value for an improvement thus helping policy-makers make better-informed decisions on urban distribution. Additionally, a case study based on urban express enterprises in Southwest China has been conducted to verify the proposed profit allocation schemes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-marketing; Gaming research; Logistics operations and management; Physical distribution management",""
"Carbon footprint model for reverse logistics of waste disposal in interior design industry","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056102792&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2018-0035&partnerID=40&md5=a878be045d9f948b7c95b3bc6c65fb40","Purpose: Due to the increasing awareness of the need to protect the environment, reverse logistics (RL) is being promoted to improve the ecological sustainability of production. RL can lower the costs of waste disposal, increase market competitiveness, and maintain a good corporate image. Hence, modern companies are focusing on environmental protection to demonstrate social responsibility. According to the OECD report of 2003, buildings consume 32 percent of resources, 12 percent of water, and 40 percent of energy worldwide, and the building waste comprises almost 40 percent of the all waste in the world. Therefore, controlling waste from the interior design sector may help slow global warming. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This investigation models the current and new RL of disposing interior design waste in Taiwan. Modeling the carbon footprint (CF) of disposing interior design waste can help companies be aware of the environmental impact of disposing of waste, and how to improve it through RL. This investigation models the CFs of disposing interior design waste based on studies from Benjaafar et al. (2013), Pishvaee et al. (2009, 2010), and Tascione et al. (2014). Findings: Analytical results showed that the RL significantly decreases the environmental impact of wastes. Companies can control carbon emission through the findings of this study and find how to improve their recycling process through RL. Research limitations/implications: This study used the model proposed by Tascione et al. (2014) to develop an RL model for Taiwan. Whereas most studies in the literature analyze the carbon emissions from the comparison between cost and benefit, this study considered the logistics for the whole lifecycle of a product. The analytical results of this study reveal that that RL can reduce the environmental impact of wastes. This case study is the first to obtain results that can be extended to other countries. This study also reveals the importance of recycling plants that can process demolition waste for reuse. Originality/value: This is the first study to model the RL based on literatures. The findings of this study can be extended to other cases. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon footprint; Interior design; Reverse logistics; Waste management",""

Drawing on self-discrepancy theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of actual-ideal self-discrepancy on consumers’ attitudes towards counterfeit branded luxuries. It investigates how self-monitoring and perceived social risk moderate this effect. Furthermore, it explores cross-cultural differences in the impact of actual-ideal self-discrepancy. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot study provides preliminary evidence that highlights the importance of actual-ideal self-discrepancy in counterfeit consumption. Based upon a large-scale survey across Hong Kong, the USA and Australia, the principal study explores the moderating effect of self-monitoring and perceived social risk as well as cross-cultural differences. Findings: The results indicate that self-discrepancy increases consumers’ tendency to engage in symbolic consumption, and that consumption of counterfeit branded luxuries can serve the social function of self-expression to reduce the discomfort induced by self-discrepancy. Self-monitoring and perceived social risk have significant moderating effects, with the former strengthening and the latter attenuating this effect. Moreover, the effect of self-discrepancy is more pronounced amongst individualistic consumers than collectivistic consumers. Originality/value: This is the first study to highlight the significance of self-discrepancy in the consumption of counterfeit branded luxuries. It examines the important moderating effects of self-monitoring and perceived social risk. Consumers from collectivistic and individualistic cultures define their self-concept differently, thus the findings provide meaningful cross-cultural information on the impact of self-discrepancy in counterfeit consumption. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counterfeit branded luxuries; Cross-cultural differences; Perceived social risk; Self-discrepancy; Self-monitoring",""

Among the many high potential markets in Asia–Pacific, Vietnam has had a rapid economic development with an average GDP growth rate of 6.19 percent for the last two decades. To tap the growing online market of Vietnam, the purpose of this paper is to draw on adoption theory and the technology acceptance model to investigate the interrelationships among consumer perceptions of web design, reliability, privacy and customer service and their effects on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 221 consumers in Vietnam. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: Empirical findings show that consumer perception of web design is positively related to perceptions of reliability, privacy, customer service and purchase intention. Consumer perception of reliability is positively related to perception of customer service but not to purchase intention. Consumer perception of privacy is also positively related to perception of customer service but not to purchase intention.

The purpose of this paper is to hypothesize long-term orientation (LTO) and role-performance as joint drivers that positively influence dependence, satisfaction, and trust constructs for each manufacturer and distributor domain. Design/methodology/approach – A structural equation modelling-comparative model is developed, tested, and validated for the Indonesian manufacturing sector. The sample size is 140 pairs of medium-to-large-sized manufacturers and their connecting distributors. The respondent is individual who is responsible and knowledgeable in dealing with his/her company’s manufacturer or distributor. Findings – Both the manufacturer-distributor LTO and their role-performance jointly drive the outcomes of the shared marketing channel relationship, and both parties’ behaving similarly (except for the influence of their role-performance onto their partner’s satisfaction). Research limitations/implications – This study have not investigated possible two-way interactions between constructs across the channel. Combined, paired, manufacturer and distributor dataset questions can expose the connectivities relationships between the partners. The insignificant influence of role-performance on economic satisfaction within the manufacturer domain requires further research on the possible presence of mediating construct(s) between those constructs, and on the broadening of the definition of satisfaction. Past channel research revealed that trust interacts with satisfaction, yet this study does not find significant interactions between the outcomes constructs. Practical implications – In Indonesia each marketing channel’s manufacturer and distributor management team should jointly enhance both their shared long-term relationship, and their respective role-performance. This long-term view is implementable through long-term marketing channel contracts. Originality/value – This study contributes to marketing channel theory with the LTO and the role-performance of a channel partner jointly driving the other partner’s economic satisfaction, trust, and their dependence specifically within the Indonesian context. The benchmarking of a marketing channel’s performance within a trusting and satisfying channel relationship sets the framework for the development of future optimization studies (of at least the five connectivities constructs used herein). © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Channel relationships; Marketing channels; Marketing in developing countries; Structural equation modelling",""

Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of anxiety on the customer adoption of online shopping based on the UTAUT. Design/methodology/approach – The UTAUT’s framework was extended by proposing new casual pathways between anxiety and its existing constructs (e.g. effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE) and behavioural intentions (BI)) within the contingencies of age, gender and experience. The partial least squares technique was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of the proposed pathways by analysing 483 sets of self-administrated survey responses. Findings – The results indicate that anxiety simultaneously exerts negative direct influences on PE, EE and BI constructs. While the moderating effects of age, gender and experience on the anxiety-intention link were found to be significant, there was no evidence suggesting that they moderate anxiety-PE and anxiety-EE relationships. Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the current study are inherent in its design and methodology, providing some directions for future research. Originality/value – This study contributes to the theory by including anxiety in the UTAUT and applying it to the online shopping context. The evidence about the significance of anxiety, with contingencies regarding age, gender and experience, supplies practical implications for online marketing strategies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anxiety; Online shopping; PLS; UTAUT",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study employs a sequential exploratory mixed method design incorporating quantitative and qualitative elements. Data in Study 1 was obtained from 2,059 internet users using an online survey. The relationships between the constructs of the proposed conceptual model were tested using structural equation modelling and the bias corrected bootstrapping technique. Also, the moderating effect of internet usage was examined. Study 2 featured 30 in-depth interviews with internet users. Findings – The findings reveal that dominant service quality dimensions for ISPs were network quality, customer service, information quality and privacy. The contribution of these factors to overall service quality was moderated by the internet usage. Results of Study 2 indicate that most respondents with heavy usage found network quality indifferent among ISPs and demonstrated hesitation in direct contact with customer service, making information support the most significant dimension. Additionally, service quality directly influenced customers’ complaining and switching intention. It was clarified in Study 2 that intention to continue the contract also depended on factors such as switching barriers, value and promotional offers. Originality/value – This study is original in that it is among the first studies to attempt to investigate the dimensions of an ISP’s service quality, and its influence on ISP customers’ behaviours.

Through this it is intended to evaluate and refine the SPC model. Design/methodology/approach: The research involved two phases: a qualitative inductive process of interviews with bank customers to identify what they considered to be the most important aspects of service in their own customer satisfaction/engagement; second, a survey phase, which theoretically developed these aspects of service, and operationalized them as variables for testing in a refined SPC model. Findings: The key service features for customers in their satisfaction and engagement were found to be convenience, courtesy, competence and internal branding. All had positive relationships with customer satisfaction/customer engagement. Customer engagement/satisfaction were further found to correlate with customer retention and acquisition. Interestingly, whereas all four service variables correlated with customer engagement and satisfaction, two of the variables – courtesy and internal branding – had stronger relationships with customer engagement. Practical implications: The inductive modeling and refinement of the SPC approach can be employed in different companies and cultural contexts to identify which features of service are most important to customers in influencing their customer satisfaction/engagement.

Instructors’ expertise promotes bonding and serves as the most essential factor for intention to recommend. Sports centers must adequately introduce promotions related to rational consumption and specialized promotion. Centers that are managed too carelessly or frugally will have a highly negative impact on customer relationship and intention to recommend. Originality/value: This study aims to empirically analyze customer needs by comparing the results of in-depth interviews with customers based on the results of quantitative studies through mixed methods research. It determines the relationships between the aforementioned variables, providing practical implications through analysis of the customers’ subjective consciousness by focusing on sports facilities in order to secure competitive advantage, and thus, overcome financial difficulties. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment to relationship; Intention to recommend; Mixed methods research; Relationship marketing factors; Sports centre; Sports facility management",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies eight independent variables including two relatively new variables, i.e. perceived regulatory support (PRS) and perceived benefits, and proposes an integrated framework to understand mobile shopping behavior. A total of 304 mobile device users were surveyed using a comprehensive questionnaire. The collected data were utilized to analyze the hypothesized relationships through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicated that all the factors considered in the framework were significant in predicting mobile shopping behavioral intention (BI) except for PRS. Demographic variables such as age and gender moderate the effect of factors such as perceived critical mass, personal innovativeness and hedonic motivation on mobile shopping BI. Research limitations/implications: The small sample sizes and a possibility to include new variables other than consumer-centric factors are some of the limitations of this study. Practical implications: The findings of this paper are of significant use for mobile shopping app developers, mobile payment gateway providers and other institutions involved in facilitation and provision of such mobile shopping services to develop suitable strategies to encourage adoption of mobile devices as a medium of online shopping. Originality/value: The study is first of its kind in India and integrates variables from different areas of technology adoption along with two new variables, i.e PRS and perceived benefits to understand mobile shopping behavior. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption; Behaviour intention; India; Mobile shopping; Structural equation modeling",""
"A consumer satisfaction model based on the integration of EDT and TAM: Comparative study of Korean and US consumers","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035149959&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2016-0127&partnerID=40&md5=4bf8fbc37e020681c46b1f5912ab5647","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the process of consumer satisfaction formation for e-commerce. The study also predicts that the satisfaction formation model of e-commerce will differ between the US and Korean consumers due to differences in cultural background. Design/methodology/approach: The study integrates the expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The hypotheses are examined by analyzing a structural equation model for consumers in the USA and Korea. Findings: The results show that the model demonstrates good fit for both groups. For consumers in both countries, when purchasing fashion products on a new e-commerce site, the performance of the site’s usefulness was found to be a crucial variable in their satisfaction and intention to use the site. While there was no significant difference in the multiple group measurement model invariance test, the findings are meaningful because the slight differences in the standard coefficients of the two groups are considered. Originality/value: It is meaningful to apply EDT and the TAM to the daily deal site environment. The influence of related variables can be reconfirmed and new consumer behaviors can be better understood. The research provides fresh insights into consumer behavior that can benefit managers when they make decisions in the e-commerce field. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer satisfaction; E-commerce; EDT; TAM",""

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a self-administered survey from 431 students enrolled in a Sales Management unit in a large Australian university and its Asian campuses. Findings: The study reveals a four-factor solution with factors labeled as “exciting,” “deceptive,” “taxing,” and “challenging,” with “exciting” being the only factor to significantly predict likelihood of pursuing a sales career. Although no differences of perception were found between males and females, Asian students were found to perceive sales career as more exciting, innovative and fun than Australian students. Research limitations/implications: Although significant difference was noted between Australian and Asian students’ perceptions towards sales as an exciting career, it is prudent to interpret and generalize the finding with caution as Asia is the largest continent with different cultures, religions and races. Practical implications: The four factors that were found to influence students’ perception towards a sales career are novel, psychometrically sound, and are pertinent for businesses conducting graduate recruitment. This study indicates how sales education at university level assist in changing students’ views towards a sales career from negative to positive.

Design/methodology/approach: The research instrument included 48 psychographic activities, interests and opinions (AIO) statements, plus socio-demographic, product consumption and purchasing questions. A final sample of 376 South African wine consumers was utilised, whereon exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, combined with Hough’s Euclidean test, were applied to determine the existence of clusters (segments), assign descriptions to them, and link these to product consumption data. Findings: Five wine segments recurred when comparing wine market segmentation studies cross-culturally. This means that cross-culturally, similar types of people drink wine with similar AIOs towards wine. In the South African market, four of these segments were identified. Research limitations/implications: This study achieved a robust lifestyle-based market segmentation algorithm which can be used by researchers in different country environments for wine as a domain-specific product. Originality/value: The contribution of this research is threefold in that it tested the WRL instrument in a cross-cultural context which is the first time this has been done; in the process it interpreted the wine consumer segments in South Africa for the first time; using a WRL-based (AIO) approach.

However, there is a dearth of research that linked ethical aspects with such kind of product purchase intention. Considering this gap, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct as well as indirect effect of ethical aspects on the attitude of consumers’ counterfeit product purchase in the Malaysian market. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 737 questionnaires were distributed in China Town, Low Yat Plaza, as well as a few “pasar malam” (night markets), which yielded 400 completed usable responses. Partial Least Square Smart PLS software and SPSS were utilised in order to analyse the data. Findings: The results revealed that the ethical aspect in term of religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness directly and indirectly affect consumers’ behavioural intention to purchase counterfeit products. Practical implications: It is expected that the study findings will enhance the understanding of marketers as well as policymakers about consumers’ purchase intention of such fake products. Eventually, it will help them to come up with better marketing strategies to purchase counterfeit products and to encourage them to purchase the original product. Originality/value: This is relatively a pioneer study that examines the effect of ethical aspects of consumers in term of their religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness on their attitude towards buying counterfeit products. Additionally, this study examines the mediating role of consumer attitude to purchase counterfeit product between ethical aspects and behavioural intention, which is comparatively new to the existing body of knowledge. Last, but not the least, this research has examined these relationships in a new research context i.e., Malaysian market, which can advance the knowledge about consumer behaviour in the East Asian context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counterfeit product purchase; Ethical concern; Lawfulness; Malaysian consumers; Religiously",""

Design/methodology/approach – To address the research questions, a survey-based empirical study was carried out in a representative sample of 226 from different levels like managers, senior managers, presidents and vice presidents and general managers at the operational levels at reputed steel industries having annual turnover of 250,000 dollars. All 226 responses received and analyzed descriptively and the results presented. Findings – The result showed that 83 percent of the respondents perceived the importance of network mapping and the elements of logistics cost with reference to the total overall logistics cost on the context of Indian steel industry. At the same time, poor infrastructure and port inefficiency were the main barriers for increasing the logistics cost as perceived by the respondents. Research limitations/implications – The sample is restricted to the logistics networking and the elements of logistics cost in Indian steel industry only. So caution needs to be exercised in generalizing the results Practical implications – In order to achieve the cost level at other developed and developing nations, the government of India should give focus on infrastructure development, improvising the exiting road condition and sea port development so that bigger size vessels can call to Indian ports for direct delivery of goods without any transshipment. Further, government of Indian needs to promote the multi modal logistics providers for timely evacuation of material as per the demand of industry requirements. Social implications – In India, it is visualized that logistics company have an advantage of cheap availability of labor but on the other side have to manage high cost of logistics. Typically, the total cost on inbound logistics taken into consideration which is around 16-18 percent of the turnover whereas, the world average is around 7-8 percent.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops viable maritime logistics strategies based on the non-cooperative game theory which determines the optimal vessel size/type, shipping route, and shipping frequency, while taking into account multiple cost components and unpredictable shipping market dynamics. Findings: This study revealed that the container carrier’s optimal shipping strategy was insensitive to changes in freight rates, fuel prices, and loading/unloading fees at the destination ports. However, it tends to be more sensitive to an increase in the shipping volume than the aforementioned parameters. In other words, aggressive pricing schemes and drastic cost-cutting measures alone cannot enhance carrier competitiveness in today’s shipping markets characterized by overcapacity and weak demand. Originality/value: This paper is one of a few attempts to identify a host of factors influencing the container carrier’s competitiveness using the game theory and develop an optimal shipping strategy in the presence of conflicting interests of multiple stakeholders (e.g. carriers, shippers, and port authorities). To validate the rigor and usefulness of the proposed game-theoretic model, the authors also experiment it with an actual case study of container carriers serving the Northeast Asian shipping market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asian-Pacific container shipping market; Maritime transportation; Non-cooperative game theory",""

The purpose of this paper is to uncover the meaning and conceptual dimensions of disengagement and negative engagement in conjunction with positive engagement. It explores how three valences of engagement manifest towards dual objects: the service community and the focal service organisation. This exploration is based within a new and novel social service context. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach using (four) focus groups is used. Findings: A conceptual model of customer engagement is derived from the groups that include strongly held and positive customer engagement; passive, yet negatively orientated customer disengagement; and active and destructive negative customer engagement. Positive customer engagement is found to be directed at the service community object, whereas customer disengagement and negative engagement are directed at the focal service organisation object. A spillover effect is also revealed whereby negative engagement with the focal service organisation detracts from customers’ positive engagement within their service community. This suggests that engagement within a social service is multifaceted: several engagement valences may exist within one service relationship. It also suggests that these engagement valences are interrelated. Originality/value: This is the first paper to apply three valences of engagement within the one focal relationship and examine how they manifest towards two objects, providing a unique perspective of how different interactions within the service ecosystem can influence engagement. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer engagement; Disengagement; Engagement objects; Engagement valences; Social services",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a self-administered survey of 400 Indian mall shoppers to examine Indian shoppers’ behaviour with respect to visiting and buying behaviour. Descriptive analyses and χ2 tests were conducted to identify patterns and capture the significant relationships in shopping behaviour across different demographic segments. Findings: The results show that shoppers of different age cohorts and from different household sizes behave differently from one another in a significant manner. In terms of gender, however, men and women tend to behave in a similar manner in terms of visit frequency, time and money spent per visit.

The research model was tested using the “Partial least squares method” which follows a variance-based structural equation modelling approach. Findings: The results of the study indicate that “touching and feeling the product” and “sales staff assistance” motivated customers to visit the physical store before buying online. “Better online service quality” and “lower prices online” induced customers to later purchase online. Price conscious customers and those with the ability to use multiple channels were more likely to engage in showrooming behaviour. Research limitations/implications: The generalization of the findings may be limited because the data were collected from a small sample size. The subject calls for more extensive research for drawing generalizations due to lack of the substantive literature on the core area of study. Practical implications: The model proposed will help retailers in understanding the showrooming phenomenon which recent researchers have considered as a threat to retail. The study provides basis for devising strategies to defend showrooming customers. Originality/value: This paper adds to the body of knowledge in retailing by proposing a model on showrooming which is an emerging area of research in the present retail landscape. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Multichannel self-efficacy; Multichannel shopping; Purchase benefits; Search benefits",""
"Importance of acquiring knowledge through feedback in an emerging industry","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016249195&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2016-0128&partnerID=40&md5=7875247639d6d1e277d5152690e39417","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of feedback in developing and operationalising knowledge from the perspective of craft brewing operators. The study contributes to various literature streams, including marketing and craft brewing entrepreneurship. An additional contribution is made through the adoption of the knowledge-based theory of the firm, and the SECI process to facilitate understanding of the significance of knowledge in the craft brewing industry. Design/methodology/approach: An online questionnaire was designed to gather data from mainly micro and small craft brewery operators. Of the 110 craft breweries identified across Australia, 57 (51.8 per cent) participated. The predominantly qualitative data were analysed using content analysis and word association. Findings: The importance of knowledge acquisition for craft brewery firms was revealed in various ways. For example, respondents most favoured new knowledge to learn about quality issues and perceptions of quality among buyers/consumers. Further, acquired knowledge through feedback was a determinant factor in participants’ decision to produce particular styles of beers. Several alignments with the adopted theoretical frameworks were revealed, including the role of socialisation (SECI process) illustrated through the transformation of explicit into tacit knowledge. Originality/value: The study examines the dimension of knowledge in the craft brewing industry, which, although considerably developing, continues to be underresearched. Furthermore, the study’s findings underline various important implications for the craft brewing industry, suppliers, and for end consumers. The study also proposes a refinement of both the RBTF and the SECI process based on the findings. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Craft brewery operators; Feedback; Knowledge; Knowledge-based theory of the firm; SECI process",""
"Nonlinear antecedents of customer satisfaction and loyalty in third-party logistics services (3PL)","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035151765&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2016-0173&partnerID=40&md5=5839446a0d2aca29e441983baf7bcfc2","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the nonlinear impact of quality dimensions of third-party logistics (3PL) services on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: By interviewing 167 small-size companies, and using penalty and reward contrast analysis, the paper explores the nonlinear impact of seven dimensions of 3PL services (safety, fault’s recovery, reliability, speed, flexibility, communication, and friendliness) on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Findings: The results confirm the existence of the dimensions’ nonlinear impact on customer satisfaction. It also shows that some quality dimensions have a direct and nonlinear impact on loyalty. The dimension “friendliness” has a direct impact on loyalty if the company has a below market average performance, which may lead customers to switch service providers. “Flexibility on collection and delivery” has a direct impact if the company has a higher performance, contributing to customers’ intention to continue using the service. Another finding is that, if the company delivers good service recovery after the customer found faults in the service, and if customers trust the company service, they say they intend to continue to work with the company. Research limitations/implications: The present research focused only on small companies in one country (Brazil). Further studies should be carried out to explore different countries, with different realities, and different size of companies. Practical implications: 3PL companies should not only deal with customers’ satisfaction, but also with other quality aspects that directly affect customer intention to continue doing business with the 3PL service provider. These are friendliness, flexibility regarding time and frequency of collection and delivery and faults’ recovery. Originality/value: The present research confirms that the personal relationship is a crucial aspect to be managed in order to keep customers in the long term. In addition, as opposed to most research looking for the antecedents of satisfaction and loyalty of 3PL customers, the present research shows that there is a direct nonlinear impact of the dimensions’ performance on customers’ loyalty, what should be taken in consideration by 3PL managers. It also shows how penalty-reward contrast analysis may reveal nonlinear antecedents that could be used for better understandings companies’ success in the long term. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","3PL services; Customer defection; Customer dissatisfaction; Failed service quality; Kano model; Service quality",""

The study focused on the consumers exposed to both local and foreign fashion advertising. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample consisted of 161 young female (18-30 years old) university students from the State of Qatar. A research questionnaire was designed to assess the perceptions of young Qatari females toward the facial features of a cluster of international fashion models representing a variety of looks. Due to the cultural sensitivity of the research topic, data were collected online using SurveyMonkey. Apart from the key demographics, the research questionnaire captured the respondent’s own self-assessed facial profile, an ideal facial profile, and the facial profile of the most preferred model from a set of choices. The authors analyze the similarities and differences between the three profiles collected from each respondent: self, ideal and choice. Findings: The findings indicated that a mix of facial features (a blend of classical Arabic looks and contemporary Western looks) is preferred by most respondents. This matches the expectation of consumers exposed to local as well as international fashion advertising. Practical implications: In developing markets (such as Qatar), preference for fashion models is shaped by a combination of local and foreign advertising influences. Hence, it is likely that hybrid models (i.e. representing a combination of Eastern and Western looks) appeal to young female consumers within these markets. Retailers of fashion clothing and accessories can use this information to select models who maximize the appeal of their brands. Originality/value: The research sheds light on how judgments about the attractiveness of female models are made by triangulation among the self, the ideal and the selection of models available to choose from. The research provides a window into how young women make judgments of physical attractiveness based on facial features. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Facial features; Fashion models; Ideal model profile; Self-profile",""

Design/methodology/approach: A case study of three large mining companies representing multinational, state-owned, and privately owned mining companies in Indonesia was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 37 key informants (three top executives and 34 members of PR units). Findings: The Indonesian private mining company and the multinational corporation actively engaged in their environment during the post-Suharto era. They perceived the local community to be more powerful than ever before as a result of the socio-cultural and political changes in the country. They changed their organization designs to gain organizational legitimacy by establishing independent PR divisions at the mining sites and assigning field officers who had the same cultural background as the community. These companies enacted the role of PR as relationship agents and cultural interpreters. Unlike these two companies, the state-owned mining company did not actively search for information from its environment. It relied on the government support for its organizational legitimacy and ignored the environmental changes. Originality/value: This study is one of the first few studies examining the enactment of PR functions in Indonesia, an emerging country that is under-represented in the marketing and PR literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Enactment theory; Indonesia; Mining industry; Organization interpretation model; Public relations",""

Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data from 272 South Korean respondents, path analysis is used to evaluate the hypotheses. Findings: Only the sense of community dimension of brand tribalism affects brand pride (PRIDE), which in turn leads to a sequential process of brand attitude, purchase intention, and need for achievement (NACHIEVE). Research limitations/implications: South Korean data may confine generalizability. As effect sizes in this context are understood, researchers have an additional benchmark for future brand tribalism and PRIDE research. Practical implications: The psychological underpinning and, the presence of brand tribes in society cannot be overlooked by strategists. Such tribal-laden following is also evident within smartphone communities. By further understanding brand tribalism outcomes, marketers and brand leaders are in an improved position to develop strategies that appeal to targeted customers, ultimately growing and strengthening their brand tribes. Originality/value: Supported by the anthropological view of brand tribalism, this research contributes to the branding literature by examining the indirect effects of brand tribalism on the NACHIEVE through brand-related attitudes and behavioral intentions. Where previous research using westerners indicates the explanatory power of defense of the tribe on brand-related factors, no effect in this regard is found here using eastern smartphone consumers. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand attitude; Brand pride; Brand tribalism; Need for achievement; Purchase intention",""
"Designing a demand chain management framework under dynamic uncertainty: An exploratory study of the Chinese fashion apparel industry","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041749975&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-03-2017-0042&partnerID=40&md5=ffc6722fadcad2398f7cce7c9580e12a","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to put forward a demand chain management (DCM) framework underpinned by the alignment theory and applies it to investigate the fashion apparel (FA) industry in China under the impacts of the latest economic transition. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory multiple case study methodology involving five Chinese FA firms, each with a different business model and ownership type, was employed. Semi-structured interviews, onsite observations and review of company documents were conducted to collect information for analysis. Findings: Using a conceptual DCM framework as a guide for analysis, the study finds that companies with a higher level of alignment with the external market situation and among the three internal DCM dimensions, namely, market management, supply chain management (SCM), and organization management, appear to perform better under the rapidly changing economic conditions in China. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to knowledge by reviewing thoroughly the literature on SCM evolution and develops a DCM framework based on alignment theory that represents the state of the art in this area. By extending the administration-integration-production-development (A-I-P-D) logic set adopted in the alignment theory, this study has also equipped the proposed framework with an empirical tool to measure alignment. Practical implications: By applying the framework to examine the Chinese apparel industry under the impacts of the latest economic transition, this study provides practitioners in the industry with a framework to help formulate strategies and a tool to measure alignment. The findings of the case study also offer insights to the industry to thrive in the rapidly changing businesses environment with dynamic uncertainties. Originality/value: This study extends the application of the A-I-P-D logic set under the alignment theory to the SCM field. This endeavor successfully transforms the proposed DCM framework from a theoretical concept to a practical tool to help evaluate empirically the alignment and strategic fit of a firm and potential relationship with firm performance. As the Chinese FA market has increasingly evolved under the impact of the globalization, the findings of this study not only assist the local FA companies in coping with the dynamic uncertainties but also shed light on the future developments of the global FA industry. Besides, the alignment measurement tool embedded in the proposed DCM framework can help enhance the chances of business success during implementation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Demand chain management; Dynamic process alignment; Fashion apparel industry; Strategic fit of the alignment; Supply chain management",""

Modernization is driven by the currents of pluralism and rationalism. The authors highlight the inherent contradiction of these two pillars and how this contradiction results in an inverted-U pattern in the relationship between level of modernization and consumer attitudes toward sex appeals. Consumers’ sexual permissiveness and their perceived insufficiency of regulatory control over sexual content in the mass media are the individual-level mediators of the two pillars. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from three Chinese cities at different levels of modernization. A total of 811 college students from the three cities participated in the study. Findings: The relationship between level of modernization and attitude favorability followed an inverted-U pattern. Female participants in the most modernized city possessed significantly less favorable attitudes to the ads than their male counterparts. Female and male participants were similar in their attitudes in the less modern cities. Sexual permissiveness mediated the relationship between modernization and male participants’ attitudes, but not with female participants’ attitudes. Perceived sufficiency of regulatory control over sexual content mediated the relationship between modernization and their attitudes among both male and female participants. Originality/value: The paper makes an empirical contribution by testing the hypotheses regarding consumers responses to sex-appeal advertising with data collected from three Chinese cities at different levels of modernization. Additionally, it offers an institutional perspective on social attitude changes. Social attitude change is of great interest to researchers, but a systematic theoretical analysis is currently lacking. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; China; Modernization; Nudity; Sexual ads",""

Using a sample of 300 adolescents (15-18 years) in India and the structural equation modelling technique, the findings reveal that self-esteem mediates the relationship between parent-adolescent relationship and adolescent compulsive buying behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – The present study is the first to experimentally manipulate important parent-adolescent relationship and measures its impact on compulsive buying among a sample of 15-18-year old adolescents. Next, the authors investigate the mediating role of self-esteem for the above relationship. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling have been used in the study. Findings – The study also establishes that familial conflict and cohesion acts as major sources of adolescent compulsivity. The authors have also examined the mediating role of self-esteem on the above relationships and found that adolescents’ compulsivity varies with the level of self-esteem (i.e. higher level of self-esteem leads to lower levels of adolescents’ compulsivity). The practical and theoretical implications are discussed within the context of adolescents’ compulsivity. Originality/value – The study makes some inimitable and significant contributions to the literature. It portrays one of few studies to investigate compulsive buying during adolescence period – a hard to reach population. Here authors experimentally manipulate parent-adolescent relationship to investigate its impact on compulsive buying. The study’s findings in regard to mediating effect of self-esteem on the parent-adolescent relationship and adolescents’ compulsive buying behaviour suggest that compulsive buying begins during adolescence period and is a common coping strategy for both boys and girls. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Satisfaction",""

Design/methodology/approach – In total, 364 university students were given a hypothetical service failure situation and their response was collected through a standardized questionnaire. Multiple regression and Preacher and Hayes (2004) mediation analysis tests were conducted to analyze data. Findings – The findings reveal that service failure severity has a direct positive impact on switchover intention and it also has an indirect impact on switchover intention through consumer forgiveness which it tends to weaken. On the other side, agreeableness has a direct negative impact on switchover intention, and it inhibits switchover intention indirectly too by stimulating forgiveness. Research limitations/implications – A cross-sectional study involving convenience sampling has been conducted through self-report measures. Generalization of the research findings shall therefore be done with caution. Practical implications – Severity of failure hampers forgiveness and therefore service managers should check factors that may challenge the tolerance level of consumers. While gauging satisfaction in post failure scenario, it is equally important to gauge consumer forgiveness. Originality/value – This study is among the initial endeavors to explore forgiveness in service failures context. Also it is the first validation of a direct positive relationship between agreeableness and forgiveness in a South Asian country. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agreeableness; Consumer forgiveness; Service failure severity; Services industry; Switchover intention",""

While the relevant literature is predominantly focused on the context of well-known products from traditionally leading exporters, the purpose of this paper is to examine the two levels of halo effect (i.e. country image as halo and a well-known product category as halo) on a less-known product category from a recently developed country. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of study was carried out by using a quantitative approach. Survey responses were collected from 253 US consumers who are aged between 18 and 67 years. This study only examined South Korea and used the two selected product categories (i.e. cell phones and apparel) as samples for the study. Findings: The results of a series of regression analyses confirmed that the positive images of South Korea and Korean cell phones served as halo, thereby enhancing the respondents’ beliefs toward Korean apparel, which is a less-known product category that they have not yet experienced. Further, the respondents’ positive beliefs toward both cell phones and apparel increased their purchase intentions of those two products. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study imply that the general country image and the country’s well-known product images are critical in introducing the country’s less-known product to foreign markets. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its unique focus on relatively less-known product category of a recently developed country (i.e. Korean apparel), which received limited attention in the past research.

Design/methodology/approach: This research follows a hypothetic-deductive approach. A unique conceptual model examines the role of consumers’ altruistic values in relation to their environmentally responsible purchase behaviour. Structured questionnaires were administered to randomly selected Vietnamese consumers who visited busy electronics and appliance specialist stores, which yielded 682 usable responses. Findings: Structural equation modelling revealed that consumers’ altruistic values tend to positively influence their personal norms, environmental attitudes, subjective norms and mitigate their perceived barriers in relation to the purchase of energy efficient appliances. Practical implications: Marketers, policymakers and sustainability campaigners should develop relevant communication and education programmes that emphasise the importance of purchasing energy efficient appliances for the environment and society, arousing consumers’ sense of moral obligation and societal responsibility to purchase such products. They should also provide a convenient and easily accessible shopping environment for consumers. Originality/value: This research makes an important contribution by presenting and testing a new altruistic-values-based model that seeks to understand consumers’ environmentally responsible purchase behaviour.

Form design refers to appearance and can be categorized as typical or non-typical. Function design relates to product features and can be the basis of whether a new product is perceived as a radically new product (RNP) vs an incrementally new product (INP). An interaction between form (typical vs non-typical) and function (RNP vs INP) was hypothesized and examined based on consumers’ knowledge of a product category and level of technological innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: Two between subject experiments were conducted in which two factors were manipulated (2×2 ANOVA): the degree of technological innovation (RNP vs INP) and form (more typical vs less typical). Findings: Findings reveal that form design has a minimal impact on consumers’ evaluations of INPs, but less typical form design is preferred over typical form design for RNPs. Moreover, form design matters more to consumers who are technologically more innovative (vs less innovative) and more knowledgeable (vs less knowledgeable). Practical implications: The managerial implications are multiple. Depending on the degree of the technological innovation, new design form can be strategically aligned to the function of a new product to increase perceived value – an effect observed among South Korean consumers that we anticipate will extend upon other cultures high in uncertainty avoidance. Originality/value: This research will shed some light on an area of marketing that has been previously under-researched: form-based design in global innovation diffusion focusing on Asian countries and provide a more systematic approach to the empirical studies of form design issues in global marketing. This research extends the current design and innovation literature by examining the two dimensional types of design (visceral form and functionality) and potential moderators: degree of product innovation (RNP vs INP), consumer innovativeness, and consumer knowledge. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation diffusion; International marketing; New product development",""

Design/methodology/approach – Survey research was employed to test the study hypotheses. The regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between an independent variable (corporate brand symbolism) and dependent variables (consumer satisfaction and loyalty). Findings – Support was found for all hypotheses formulated in this study. Regression results reveal consistent favourable and significant effects of corporate brand symbolism on both consumer satisfaction and loyalty. Research limitations/implications – Although this paper makes contributions in international marketing, the cross-sectional nature of the data collection method limits the information gained to the single point in time. This research studied the impact of corporate brand symbolism on consumers of one original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Having a larger number of participating car manufacturers/OEMs would have provided a wider insight. However, time and resources limitation did not allow to study a larger sample. In the future, practitioners are recommended to further understand the relationship between self and social aspects of brand symbolism in order to formulate more targeted communication strategies. Practical implications – The findings of this study point to the strategic role of the brand in generating both satisfaction and loyalty. In the light of increasing advertising costs and decreasing consumer loyalty, strengthening corporate brand symbolism makes a lot of economic sense. The findings suggest that managers need to take into account consumer need for identity expression and consider this in their branding strategies. Social implications – Humans are social beings by nature. However, international brand research has paid relatively little attention to how products are used by consumers in everyday life, including their social life. Consumer behaviours increasingly depend on social meanings they imbue brands with beyond products’ functional utility. It is argued the focus of symbolic consumption needs to be broadened and integrated more with social science concepts. Originality/value – This study captures a construct of corporate brand symbolism by including self and social aspects of symbolism. The current study also comprehensively measures consumer loyalty, including cognitive, affective and behavioural types of loyalty. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Brand management; Brand symbolism; Car brands; Consumer loyalty; Consumer satisfaction",""
"Critical success factors of recording studio in Indonesia","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019912426&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2016-0123&partnerID=40&md5=d145ea6efc90267a75f13504bddf2ed2","Purpose: This viewpoint paper is based on consultancy project in developing strategic marketing plan for building a professional recording studio in Bandung, Indonesia. Nonetheless, previous studies that scrutinize the key success factors in music recording studio industry are noticeably lacking, whereas music artists still rely heavily on recording studio providers to record their music and distribute it to the market. Hence, finding out the critical success factors (CSF) can help recording studio to craft strategic marketing plan within effective and efficient budget. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Methods carried out in this study are based on triangulation which comprises of primary observation, interviews to experts in the respective field, and literature reviews regarding CSF, service quality and service excellence. Five years of primary observations took place in five studios on two major cities in Indonesia which are Bandung and Jakarta of which many prominent musicians were originated. The interviews were conducted to six respondents who have more than ten years of experience in music industry, and have produced at least two albums through professional music recording processes in music studios including recording, mixing, and mastering. Findings: It is found that by exploiting the conceptual theories of service quality and service excellence as the foundations, there are primarily three critical factors in music recording studio industry in Indonesia which are human resources development in primarily technical aspects, communication skills, and servicescapes which involve the recording facilities and also the studio surroundings. Research limitations/implications: This study only took samples from five studios, two major cities in Indonesia and limited experts opinion. Nevertheless, confirmatory study is expected in the future in order to gain deeper insights or other additional point of view in determining CSF in the recording studio industry. This paper, however, has contributed to the existing literature of service quality, service excellence, and CSF in a narrow scope of industry which is music recording studio. Practical implications: Managers who wish to start a recording studio business must look deeply into these three critical factors to address the budget effectively and efficiently in initial investment of the studio. Through this study it can be observed that music studio as a service firm can still focus on creating critical values to strive even though the music industry landscape has been deteriorated due to piracy and the development of technology. It is expected that through this study, by understanding the CSF, managers in music recording studio can focus on creating value effectively and efficiently in recording studio business. Originality/value: This study contributes to fill the gap of empirical discussion in determining CSF in the music recording studio business in Indonesia in the context of service quality and service excellence, which has not been examined by previous scholars. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical success factors; Indonesia; Key success factors; Music studio; Recording studio; Service excellence",""

Specifically, it studies the effect of RAs/no RAs on decision quality, decision confidence and decision satisfaction taking into account subjective knowledge (SK) and involvement. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employed two between-subjects factorial experimental designs with subjects searching for digital cameras in a simulated online digital camera store. The experiment was conducted with graduate students in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mysore in India. Findings: Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers. When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better. Originality/value: The effect of RA vs no RA in conjunction with relevant consumer characteristics influencing decision quality of the consumer is demonstrated in this study.

It aims to analyze how factors of network and value added tasks have an impact on firm’s performance in the context of agri-food sector Design/methodology/approach – This research employs a quantitative method. Based on an illustrative empirical case, the research tests a simple variance-based reflective structural equation model with main effects based on a sample of 200 firms within AFVC in Jordan. Findings – The results identify the high-order factors of business networks and demonstrate the role of network perspective on firm’s performance, acting as the main strategy to improve long-term business in AFVC. The results show that firm’s performance is mostly driven by the three key factors of network (actors, resources and activities), as well as by the four levels of value added tasks (form, time, place and possession). Research limitations/implications – This research has important implications for different level managers at firms. By understanding the various factors that are most important between partners at the firm level and between firms in a network, managers can focus their efforts on these factors in order to foster successful long-term businesses and their performances. The author further provide some managerial recommendations for more effective management of AFVC in terms of leveraging firm’s performance. Originality/value – This is one of few studies that investigate factors of network in value chain firms. The results show that the network perspective can link both the key factors of network and the levels of value added tasks for better firm’s performance in AFVC. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agri-food value chain; Firm performance; Network perspective; Value added tasks",""

"Influence of consumer personality, brand personality, and corporate personality on brand preference: An empirical investigation of interaction effect","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962181784&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2015-0073&partnerID=40&md5=29ceefaa32ffe31c875ee8c132d34e77","Purpose – The relationship between brand personality and consumer personality has become a researched issue in recent years. It is viewed that marketers start the dialogue with consumers through personality route by building brand personality in line with consumers’ own personality traits. Moreover, in the midst of stiff competition, role of corporate personality, as a component of corporate identity, has been considered instrumental behind the success of the organization. As a result, there might be a possibility that other than his/her own personality traits, a consumer’s brand preference may be influenced by both brand personality and corporate personality of the said brand marketer. So, the predictive roles of individual personality, brand personality, and corporate personality on consumer-brand preference formation need to be empirically investigated so that the same may be addressed strategically. However, as per knowledge of the researcher, no empirical study has been made to investigate the predictive role of consumer personality, brand personality, and corporate personality on brand preference. In this back drop, to the best of the knowledge, the purpose of this paper is to fill this research gap by investigating first, the direct effects of individual personality of consumer, brand personality, and corporate personality on consumer-brand preference and second the impact of interaction effects of those variables on brand preference in the context of the emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach – This study includes Indian four-wheeler passenger car market as the focal point of the study. As the product category is predominantly linked with symbolic benefits to the consumers, this target segment may be motivated to express their personality through the brands they prefer. As a result it may be an appropriate sector to study the influence of individual, brand, and corporate personality behind brand preference. In this study, the authors have used an anonymous self-administered structured questionnaire. Part A captured respondent’s brand preference. Part B used The Big Five Model personality scale. Part C used the “Brand Personality Scale” proposed by Aaker (1997) as a measure of brand personality. Part D comprised “Corporate Personality Scale” developed by Davies et al. (2001b). Part E recorded demographic data, including age, income, educational qualification, and occupation. For Parts B, C, and D, respondents were asked to rate each of the dimensions, using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 5=most descriptive to 1=least descriptive. The validity of the theoretical model is tested through confirmatory factor analysis. In the first stage, main effects of the proposed model are tested. In the next stage, the authors have tested interaction effects of constructs on band preference. To test the hypotheses multiple regression method has been used. Findings – The result of main effects shows that individual and brand personality has significant impact on brand preference for the considered brand by the consumers. This implies that at the time of brand preference, consumers give due importance to individual personality and personality of the considered brand of sports utility vehicle. A strong and clear brand personality indicates a favorable view about the brand. Further, the result shows at the time of buying decision, personalities of both product and corporate brand are influencing their preferences. Here, consumers might be making strong association between corporate and brand personalities. In addition, interaction effects among individual, brand, and corporate personality are also significant. One may view from the result that consumers do not encourage compartmentalize thinking at the time of brand choice. In place of considering his/her own personality and brand and corporate personality as a standalone entity, they think in totality and interaction effects have significant influence on their brand preference. Research limitations/implications – The paper has mentioned limitations: the restriction on selecting industry, company, and brand, the restraint of sampling coverage and lack of generalization of the study findings. The implications should be interpreted with care. In this study the authors have not compared different brands from same industry or brands from different industries; there is a scope to do so. Moreover, this study considers results from one national context and, consequently, cross-national study may be conducted to extend the validity of the findings. Practical implications – The findings from this study may enlighten brand marketers about the degree of influence of brand personality, corporate personality, and consumer personality on brand preference. This study advocates interaction effects of individual, brand, and corporate on consumer-brand preference. From this study perspective, the authors may say, brand personality and corporate personality provide significant opportunity for creation of uniqueness and have the potential to significantly influence brand preference. Originality/value – This paper makes two contributions to the brand management literature. First, it provides new empirical evidence of the positive main effect of individual and brand personality on brand preference. Second, this paper first investigates interaction effects of individual personality, brand personality, and corporate personality on brand preference. This is a very unique contribution of the paper. The results provide new insights for academic and practitioners into the relationship among individual personality, brand personality, and corporate personality. This study is the first attempt to fill this research gap by investigating the impact of consumer personality, brand personality, and corporate personality on brand preference. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand personality and extension; Branding strategies; Consumer behaviour; Consumer decision making; Interaction effect",""

Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a content analysis of 700 TV advertisements aired between January-December 2013 from top five Indian TV channels based on their rank according to Gross Viewership in Thousands. Findings: Humour/happiness was the most commonly used emotional appeal and nostalgic ads constituted 12 per cent of the emotional ads in Indian television. “References to past family experiences” was the most commonly used nostalgic element. As hypothesised, nostalgic ads use low information disclosure strategy (vis-à-vis high/medium information disclosure strategy) and are more commonly used for low involvement products (vis-à-vis high involvement products), experience products (vis-à-vis search products), and non-durables (vis-à-vis durables). Also, nostalgic appeals are more commonly used at maturity stage of PLC (vis-à-vis introduction stage). Originality/value: This is the first research to analyse the content and execution of nostalgic advertising in India. This study is also one of the first to provide a comprehensive framework on nostalgic advertising.

A sample of 834 Pakistani consumers in the supermarkets and banking industries was studied employing store-intercept survey design. Findings: Consumer behavior is driven by emotions in both the supermarkets and banking context. Thus, in order to better predict customer loyalty intentions, the emotional component is crucial and should be included along with other cognitive components. Practical implications: Since customers’ emotional responses throughout service delivery are strongly linked to loyalty, therefore supermarkets and bank service managers need to make sure that the customers experience with their services as pleasurable as possible and for this purpose, customer service employees need to be trained in order to better understand the customers’ emotional responses during the course of service delivery process.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors of this study hired a professional market research firm based in Chennai, a large metropolitan city in Southern India, to manage data collection. The authors used a competing models approach to test the relationship between constructs. Findings: CO among frontline employees operating in one of the largest emerging economies is best treated as a psychological construct that is both directly and indirectly related to performance via its ability to reduce stress and improve engagement. This finding strengthens the view of CO as a universal human work value and, more broadly, that such values operating across different cultural setting do exist. In addition, external customer mindset appears to offer a superior means to measure CO than does the widely used CO component of the SOCO scale. This conclusion is based not only upon the fact that it conceptually corresponds with the psychological nature of CO, but also that in this initial examination it exhibits a greater ability to explain employee job performance. Originality/value: Managers who are able to screen and hire employees with greater CO work values should experience improved performance outcomes and also less customer ambiguity and greater satisfaction among their frontline employees. Since CO proscribes the proper way to deal with customers, greater levels of CO beliefs would counteract customer ambiguity among frontline employees operating in any environment. Accordingly, when filling frontline positions, managers should actively seek out employees who earnestly embrace the role of taking care of customers. Managers are advised to not only emphasize on salespeople whose foremost role is to take care of their customers but also to find ways to familiarize them with their products and to provide them with information regarding customer characteristics such as their background, the relationship history (especially past service and product failures), and unique preferences. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer orientation; Customer-oriented attitude; External customer mindset; Frontline employees; Indian salespeople; Job satisfaction",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore why these attributes are motivational factors by focussing on the attributes of RTD tea beverage products that motivate consumers to purchase RTD tea. Design/methodology/approach – The attribute-consequence-value model of the means-end chain approach was employed to investigate consumer motivations for purchasing RTD tea beverages. Data were collected through a qualitative face-to-face survey of 153 RTD tea beverage consumers in Taiwan. Findings – The results indicate that consumers purchase RTD tea beverages because the taste, flavor, packaging, and ingredients (attributes) satisfy their desire to drink RTD tea and fulfill the benefits of being delicious to drink, possessing thirst-quenching properties, and possessing health-promoting properties (perceived consequences), thereby fulfilling their ideal goal of experiencing enjoyment (perceived product value). Originality/value – The findings may serve as a reference for producers of RTD tea beverages regarding product development and marketing. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumption motivation; Means-end chain (MEC); Product attributes; Ready-to-drink (RTD); Tea beverages",""
"Cosmopolitanism and ethnocentrism among young consumers in emerging Asia: Chinese vs Koreans towards Japanese brands","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016258716&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2016-0113&partnerID=40&md5=4a0bb2e5684fd926a5672de0b88980fd","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how consumer cosmopolitanism (COS) and consumer ethnocentrism (CET) may affect young populations in China (an emerging country) and Korea (an advanced emerging country) on their evaluations of Japanese brands. Design/methodology/approach: The author hypothesize that the levels and the effects of COS and CET will differ between China and Korea because of their differing levels of economic development and globalization. Surveys were conducted with 311 Chinese and Korean young individuals with comparable sample characteristics. Findings: The research reveals a few interesting findings. First, the findings show that Chinese young consumers may be more ethnocentric and moderately less cosmopolitan than their Korean counterparts. Additionally, COS was found to have greater effects on evaluations of Japanese brands in China than in Korea. On the other hand, CET played a subdued role in brand evaluations for both countries. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that COS and CET may have reduced influences on future consumers in emerging Asia and other emerging countries as they experience increasing globalization.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine this issue by using conjoint analysis to estimate the trade-offs using a sample of Australian consumers. The authors use cluster analysis to form market segments in the three product categories examined. Findings: The segments demonstrate that there are groups of customers who are quite willing to trade-off price with waiting time. The results have significant implications for Australian manufacturers who are contemplating moving into mass customisation. Originality/value: Many researchers have investigated the issue of a customer’s readiness to buy a customised product. In particular, they have examined whether customers are willing to pay extra for a mass-customised product, whether they would spend some time to design it, as well as wait to receive it. There has been no study that has examined all three factors simultaneously.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a self-administered survey data of 207 Vietnamese consumers, a structural equation modeling approach for moderator analysis with latent constructs is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: OE and power have both direct and interactive positive influences on the choice of luxury product attributes. In particular, the effect of OE is weakened by the negative moderator effect of SN, but the effect of power is strengthened by the positive moderator effect of perceived resources. The inclusion of interactions increases the explained variance of the choice of luxury product attributes from 24.8 to 35.8 percent. Research limitations/implications: Future studies would benefit to investigate other personality traits (e.g. extroversion or agreeableness), personal values (e.g. achievement), SN (e.g. descriptive norms) and resources (e.g. time). Practical implications: The study findings suggest that brand managers should attend the how individual and social factors interacts in explaining the choice of luxury product attributes.

"How consumer mindsets in ethnic Chinese societies affect the intention to buy Fair Trade products: The mediating and moderating roles of moral identity","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019922956&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-06-2016-0107&partnerID=40&md5=68bc2e264a3c5a78433b633e6e5c09e8","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how psychological antecedents (i.e. consumer mindsets) and individual difference characteristics (i.e. moral identity) affect the intention to purchase Fair Trade products based on the triadic reciprocal causation model in social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986). The primary factors that influence ethical consumption decisions in ethnic Chinese societies were explored by integrating the unique cultural environment of the Chinese. Design/methodology/approach: The study effective sample comprised university students and professors. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses and indirect effects. Results showed that moral identity internalization had a mediating effect on the relationship between a collectivistic mindset and the intention to purchase Fair Trade products. Findings: A high moral identity symbolization had a moderating effect on the relationship between a collectivistic mindset and the intention to purchase Fair Trade products. This demonstrated that the two dimensions of moral identity, internalization and symbolization, play different roles and have different functions in regards to the intention to purchase Fair Trade products. Research limitations/implications: Future studies are urged to examine this issue at a cultural level by performing a cross-cultural comparison and to integrate consumer heterogeneity for a deeper examination of the interaction between demographic factors and psychological traits on consumer behaviours regarding Fair Trade products. Originality/value: This study indicates that moral identity internalization is the primary factor that influences ethical consumption decisions in Chinese societies. In terms of the moderating effect of moral identity symbolization, results showed that the higher an individual’s moral identity symbolization, the stronger the relationship between a collectivistic mindset and the intention to purchase Fair Trade products is.

Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was sent to 4,417 apparel manufacturers in Japan of which a total of 1,211 were deemed usable (response rate of 27.47 percent). Logit regression analysis was then employed to identify factors affecting the own brand strategies adopted by Japanese apparel manufacturers. Findings: The main findings are as follows: apparel manufacturers having access to external designers, and who collect information relating to consumer needs for production planning tend to have their own brands; apparel manufacturers located in Tokyo have added benefits associated with launching their own brands than those located in other cities; the size of the company behind the brand development is insignificant; and therefore, SME apparel manufacturers have equal opportunities in developing their own brands, which could flourish in the future. Research limitations/implications: The present study is limited in that it focuses solely on exogenous factors. Strategic decision-making processes, typical of the distribution structures of apparel industries, influence the apparel relationship between retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers. Thus, the distribution structure and the relationships require further investigation studies. Originality/value: Because of a lack of published data, no empirical studies investigating the effectiveness of own brand strategies developed by Japanese apparel manufacturers currently exist. The present study aims to address this by conducting questionnaire surveys with all Japanese apparel manufacturers and then using logit regression analysis, identify the primary factors influencing own brand strategy. This study clarifies the situation regarding the survival of SMEs in the apparel market, considering only those apparel manufacturers who intend to launch their own brands. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apparel manufacturer; Logit regression analysis; Own brand strategy",""

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 400 students from four IBCs in Malaysia was administered in a questionnaire. Data were analysed using SPSS and partial least squares 3.0. Findings: This research demonstrates that students’ self-esteem and social bonds have positive direct effects on customer citizenship behaviour (CCB). Moreover, self-esteem has an indirect effect on CCB via intervening of attachment, commitment and involvement of social bonds. Research limitations/implications: CCB of IBC students can be explained by self-consistency theory via mediation of social bonds from social bonding theory. Practical implications: To encourage CCB in IBCs, university management should target students who have high self-esteem, closely tied to parents and lecturers, committed to university, highly involved in co-curricular activities and comply with university regulations.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors design a product line which consists of two substitutable products and use a traditional market segmentation research framework to analyze the pricing and product design strategies. Findings: It is concluded that profit tends to rise in a centralized supply chain at the expense of market share of the integral product. In a decentralized supply chain, one product will reduce its market share so as to enhance the degree of modularity. Although enhancing the extent of integration of a product will bring in more flexibility during the design of the product line, this will do so at the expense of the market share of the other product. Originality/value: The authors find that the two products form a product line and share a common module belonging to the platform, so any changes in the modules (changes in product architecture) not only affect the product in question but also the other one in the product line. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Marketing theory; Pricing; Product management",""

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic random sampling yielded 811 surveys of wine consumers collected at households across Australia’s three main consumption metropoles. A hierarchical multiple regression model is used to test the predictive ability of the socio-demographical variables, gender and age, on personal wine consumption. Findings: Specific differences exist in the consumption behaviour and wine type preferences of males and females, and between generational cohorts, specifically Millennial and older consumers. There are gender significant differences in wine type consumption, which in turn is moderated by not only the “classical” socio-demographic variables, but also the retail outlet types preferred for product purchase. Younger Millennial females place more importance on external choice cues in making their buying decision than males. The gender and age generation socio-demographic variables are not strong predictors of personal wine consumption. Practical implications: Opportunities exist for niche-marketed brands targeted at specific segments such as young females and this study highlighted their specific needs and consumer behaviour dynamics. Originality/value: This study illustrates through carefully executed wine consumer behaviour research, directed by questioning from the extant literature, how information derived from a behaviourism perspective can intelligently inform marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper has adopted an empirical approach. A survey was developed and distributed among rail stakeholders in Australia. Accordingly, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to evaluate the key impeding areas. Findings: This paper found four areas that are impeding rail development, these being infrastructure management, shortage of freight data and poor information sharing, service delivery and organisational and commercial interactions. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical approach of this thesis can be applied to any freight market where competition exists between different transport modes. However, the specific strategies provided in this research in terms of transportation management, infrastructure planning and policy were made according to the specific market condition, infrastructure quality and regulation that exist in Australia. Practical implications: The findings provide important implications for both industry and government in terms of making transport planning and policy decisions, but also useful insights by identifying the weak parts of the rail sector and directions to target them. Originality/value: The notion of the rail stakeholder does not appear to have been previously defined in the literature.

Respondents were tasked with choosing the best and worst from 16-brand attribute statements representing website communications and aesthetics, a more effective understanding of consumer segmentation is revealed between the offline facility to the online retail experience. Design/methodology/approach: A research design utilising BWS was deployed to provide an alternate perspective of consumer choice in an omni-channel retail environment. Findings: Findings indicate a bifurcated audience with one-half reliant on communication and the other half on aesthetics is most important in the online environment when generating a positive relationship towards the retail brand. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted within a single retail format category (sportswear and apparel) so future studies need to estimate cross-category implications. The authors also suggest online experimental designs for consumers to compare traditional retail brand images. Finally as this study utilised Australian responses only the authors suggest cross-cultural comparisons to better understand the universal nature of website functionality and its link with traditional retail formats. Practical implications: Retail executives will find the results from this study useful in two ways. To ensure consistency of brand image across channels managers must communicate efficiently and effectively. Brand managers must mediate between customer segments with some preferring clear concise website communications and others well established aesthetics.

The study specifically conceptualizes the effect of consumers’ price unfairness perceptions of past purchase (PUPoPP) on customer-based brand equity (CBBE) with a moderating effects of elapsed time since purchase (ETSP) and magnitude of price reduction (MPR) in situations where consumers were aware of the reduction in price of the product that they had purchased earlier. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among consumers who were aware of the reduction in the price of the computer laptop which they had purchased earlier. A sample size of 214 respondents was utilized for the study. The hypotheses were tested by using partial least squares-structural equations modeling. Findings: The results of the study show that there is a significant negative impact of PUPoPP on CBBE and the ETSP was found to enhance CBBE and also weaken the negative effect of PUPoPP on CBBE. Furthermore, the MPR was found to strengthen the negative effect of PUPoPP on CBBE.

Design/methodology/approach – Empirical research on retailers’ new product acceptance either takes survey design or modeling approach. This study uses grounded theory approach to systematically collect and analyze data to generate a model for the small retailers’ new product acceptance in an emerging market, India. In depth interviews with ten small retailers, five situated in small market town and five in a metro were conducted. Findings – Retail margin on offer is the first and foremost criteria considered while accepting a new product along with product and market-related factors. The small retailers spelt out the tradeoff decision on retail margins while accepting a new product. The tradeoff criteria that emerged during the analysis are trade and promotional support, sales potential of the product, salesperson relationship with the retailer, aspects of fairness in the relationship, corporate reputation, relevant product information, and availability of the product with other retail competitors. Practical implications – The study suggests that marketers have to maintain healthy relationship with the channel partners especially the retailers who are in direct contact with the final consumer.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on the empirical data collected from 419 fast fashion consumers in the USA, the study investigated the inter-relationships among the various brand equity dimensions by structural equation modeling. Findings – The findings reveal that brand awareness has a significant and positive direct impact on brand personality and perceived value; brand personality has a significant and positive direct effect on perceived quality and perceived value; and brand awareness, perceived quality and perceived value have a significant and positive direct effect on brand loyalty, respectively. Originality/value – Applying the brand equity model in the fast fashion industry and surveying actual consumers, the research provides in-depth empirical evidence of the interactions among the brand equity dimensions. Since fast fashion has become a key feature of the global fashion industry over the last decade, understanding the elements of brand equity and the inter-relationships among them provides important insights to marketing practitioners to develop strategies which encourage the growth of brand equity. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Consumers; Fast fashion",""

However, consumers also strongly favor local and global brands which reinforce their desired self-images. The purpose of this paper is to examine how self-image congruence (SIC) mediates the effect of consumer ethnocentrism (CE) on local brand preference (LBP). Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically tested the proposed mediation model across three countries (Taiwan, South Korea and Japan) using ten brands from two very different product categories (beer and personal computers). Research subjects were randomly selected and placed into one of four groups for each of these countries. Subjects in these groups were asked to compare well-known domestic and global brands which were either culturally similar or culturally dissimilar. Findings: CE significantly impacted LBP among Taiwan, South Korea and Japan college-aged consumers but this impact was limited. SIC, however, had a powerful influence on LBP for these consumers. The cultural similarity and relative necessity of brand choices had almost no effect on the results. Research limitations/implications: Researchers and practitioners need to more fully understand the contingencies Asian consumers use in selecting local brands. Under some scenarios, CE may not be a reliable predictor of local brands preference. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to demonstrate the influential role of SIC among consumers from collectivistic cultures. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asian consumers; Ethnocentrism; Local brand preference; Self-image congruence",""

The research focusses on the financial, functional, individual, and social dimensions of luxury value perception and whether ethnicity influences these dimensions. Design/methodology/approach – The research measures luxury value perception among millennials of the three main ethnic groups in Singapore (Chinese, Indians, and Malays) via more than 200 questionnaires. Data were analyzed through Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA and cluster analysis. Findings – Luxury value perception does not vary across ethnicity, with the exception of the financial value dimension. Four market segments of young luxury consumers in Singapore are identified and profiled. These segments do not differ in terms of ethnicity. Research limitations/implications – Millennials are an evolving and moving population segment, and thus longitudinal analyses would be useful to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this segment. Practical implications – Ethnicity does not affect luxury value perception. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that luxury companies should address the millennials as a global target sharing the same luxury value perception. At the same time, luxury companies can emphasize some different aspects (i.e. the financial dimension) of their value offer. Originality/value – The research studies the most interesting market for luxury brands – millennials – in a fast-growing luxury market. It adds knowledge to the previous literature on luxury value perception. This research can guide managers to devise suitable marketing strategies addressing the millennials segment as a global market that has the same set of luxury values worldwide. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Ethnic groups; Generation Y; Luxury consumption; Luxury value perception; Singapore",""
"Why do good people do bad things? The effect of ethical ideology, guilt proneness, and self-control on consumer ethics","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035113523&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2016-0218&partnerID=40&md5=6eb0bd1d7cd2c277cffe58474a40fa4a","Purpose: Various studies showed that unethical behaviours committed by consumers occur more frequently than may be expected. People have stolen from a shop at some time in their life and remained silent, people walk out of a grocery store have stolen something from the store and employees have stolen from their workplace. Why seemingly good people do bad things and vice versa? What factors contribute to this discrepancy? Hence, the purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to examine the impact of ethical ideology on self-control and guilt proneness; second, to examine the roles of self-control and guilt proneness in consumer ethical decision making; and finally, to explore the mediating effects of self-control and guilt proneness on the relationship between consumer ideology and ethical decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected a non-probability sample using a cross-sectional online survey of adult consumers across Australia wide. The sampling frame was from a pre-recruited online panel company Permissioncorp. Consumers were introduced to the study in relation to their beliefs in general consumer ethics behaviours. The response rate for the survey invite was 17.9 per cent, with a final sample size of 311 consumers out of 3,246 that were invited to participate based on the these screening criteria, i.e. their country of birth (Australia only), gender, age group, and state in which they reside to ensure representation across these groups. Findings: The results showed that idealism was a positive determinant of guilt proneness and self-control, whereas relativistic individuals were less prone to guilt and less able to control their behaviour. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between self-control and unethical consumer behaviour. Finally, both self-control and guilt proneness had an indirect mediating effect on the relationship between ethical ideology and consumer behaviour.

Design/methodology/approach: The mixed methods research in the form of qualitative approach, using a phenomenological method and quantitative approach, using three experimental studies of factorial design types and a structural equation modeling method, have been used in this research. Findings: The fit of plans to achieve the brand attachment is similar in both product categories. The financial gift, with the ability of liquidity and variety of shopping, fits with the advertisement messages at a high construal level and high argument strength. However, the financial gift, with the ability of purchase from particular stores, fits with the advertisement messages at the low construal level and high argument strength. Moreover, in both product categories, the brand attachment leads to the emotional and cognitive consequences.

The purpose of this paper is to address this oversight by exploring how four different categories of motives distinguished attendees from non-attendees for an Australian Rules football game played in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach: A stadium-intercept method at a St Kilda home game was used for the purposes of data collection. In total, 2,000 survey invitations had been distributed. Of these, 381 usable online surveys were received. The resulting data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings: This study found that the lower fans’ expectations of their team winning, the less likely they were to travel internationally to watch their team play. Furthermore, it also support that sport tourism is influenced not only by the event itself but also non-event attractions offered by the host destination image. Research limitations/implications: The limitation applies to the research context in which the respondents were selected from one of the two competing teams. Practical implications: This study confirms the importance of “special occasion” and highlights that an Australian Football League game played in New Zealand on ANZAC Day should continue to serve as a special occasion due to the historical significance of that day. Originality/value: The results from this study confirm the importance of adding a fourth category of motives – contextual factors – to the existing list of push, pull and sports motives.

Design/methodology/approach: Online and paper questionnaires were used to collect data from Canada and China. Based on the prior research, 14 hypotheses were developed, and SPSS statistical analyses were used for this study. Findings: According to the findings, Canadian and Chinese participants used price as an indicator of product quality and/or monetary sacrifice. Overall, the consumers from both countries were more concerned about the garment fit and style than brand name and country of origin. It is imperative for fashion practitioners to prioritise their resources and focus more on product research/design and prototype development. Fit, comfort and fabric were strongly correlated except in the “fit and comfort” of the Canadian sample. In addition, durability, ease of care and wardrobe coordination play a relatively less significant clothing evaluative role than many other product cues.

The purpose of this paper is to consider a twofold perspective to understand and analyse the reverse supply chain design of mobile phone in Delhi NCR: first, motivation and intentions of consumer selling their mobile phones and second, the returns management process through the organised and informal channels. Design/methodology/approach: It first utilises a survey methodology and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model to understand and analyse the consumers’ intentions to recycle and then employs an in-depth interview methodology to derive qualitative insights needed to plot the reverse supply chain design. Findings: In an extended TPB model, attitude, mediated by a “sense of duty” and perceived control, has a strong influence on the recycling behaviour than subjective norms and benefits. The qualitative insights draw attention to the design, configuration and management of informal and organised recycling channels that differ significantly, but remain relevant and coexist, especially in the context of emerging economies. Research limitations/implications: It proposes an extended TPB model to understand consumer selling behaviour that can help the companies to plan and handle their demand-supply mechanisms in the reverse supply chain.

The purpose of this paper is to explore consumer perspectives on the ethics of these initiatives. It also seeks to identify underlying dimensions within the technology-based strategic environment with the intent of generating advances for both academicians and practitioners alike. Design/methodology/approach: The enquiry is based on a survey featuring a cross-section of 20 technology-based initiatives. A sample of 967 adult residents of the USA provided their views of the extent to which each initiative/scenario conformed to their perception of society’s norms regarding ethical acceptability. Findings: In total, 13 of the 20 initiatives were deemed unacceptable with the greatest disdain exhibited for a company posting bogus online reviews. Most acceptable were self-service checkouts. Three sub-dimensions of the ethicality construct as it relates to technology-based marketing initiatives were identified and validated as measurement scales for use in future research: involvement, communication, and privacy. Research limitations/implications: The generalization of findings may be limited because younger and older segments of the population were slightly under- and over-represented, respectively. Practical implications: Marketers should recognize that consumers are much more accepting of any initiative from which they will derive some benefit. They should also recognize that within this arena, ethical acceptability is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, necessitating that they strategize accordingly. Originality/value: Although previous research has garnered insights with respect to a particular technology-based marketing initiative, none have explored the relativities of consumer perceived ethicality across an array of different initiatives or examined any latent sub-dimensions of the construct in this arena.

One such tool is permission e-mail marketing (PEM). Operating within the framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of PEM on the perceived value derived from internet shopping. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through an online survey in Melbourne, Australia. Utilising a sample of 338 consumers, the resulting data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings – The results of the study indicate that PEM positively influences the perceived usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment derived from shopping online. Furthermore, it also serves to reduce the perceived risk. PEM serves as an important extension of the TAM, with the findings from this study highlighting not only what the sources of online shopping value are, but also how they can be influenced. Research limitations/implications – The limitation applies to the research context in which the study was carried out – fashion shopping. Practical implications – The study confirms the importance of PEM and highlights to retailers that they have another important tool at their disposal. Originality/value – This study highlights the importance of PEM and support the proposition that its key source of value lies in providing information that the consumer wants. Such relevance is the key of distinction between PEM and SPAM. Despite the rapid growth of internet shopping in Australia, very few online shopping studies have been conducted in an Australian context.

In particular, this paper aims to examine the moderating effect of relationship quality (RQ) on the associations between power bases and relationship success. In turn, RQ and relationship success can impact the operational performance of the suppliers. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 284 Australian suppliers (growers of organic fruits and vegetables) was conducted to elucidate the associations among power, RQ, relationship success and operational performance. Findings: RQ was found to only moderate the positive relationship between non-coercive power and relationship success. Moreover, RQ and relationship success were positively related to the suppliers’ operational performance. The findings conform those of previous research in which coercive power is negatively related to the supplier’s perception of relationship success while non-coercive power is positively related to the supplier’s perception of relationship success. Relationship success was found to mediate the relationships between the power bases and operational performance. Research limitations: This study only collected data from one-side of the dyad (the suppliers). Another potential limitation is the existence of respondent bias, which can arise when a single respondent is asked to assess both the nature of the relationship and the performance outcomes of the relationship. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance for managers to understand the dynamic shaping relationships when they want to signal their influence and RQ in inter-firm relationships associated with the SCs. Originality/value: This study applies signaling theory as an alternative theoretical lens that looks into the moderating role of RQ on the associations between power bases and relationship success in the SC. This study argues that when the buyer increasingly develops RQ, the effect of non-coercive power on relationship success diminishes. Both RQ and relationship success positively influence the supplier’s operational performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Relationship marketing; Supply chain management",""

As the original consumer racism scale was developed based on a western context and environment, most of its items may be unsuitable for use in certain non-western countries. The purpose of this paper is to modify the existing consumer racism scale to include the elements of inter-ethnic relationships, historical occurrences and political situations, which are crucial in shaping and influencing racism in a multi-religion and multi-racial context. Design/methodology/approach: After generating new items and retaining or removing others for a modified consumer racism scale, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is performed based on 145 respondents followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on 176 respondents. The modified scale, including two other related constructs (consumer ethnocentrism and consumer animosity), is then tested through structural equation modeling (SEM) using WarpPLS 5.0 and data from 495 respondents. Findings: EFA and CFA results suggest that the modified eight-item consumer racism scale is applicable in a multi-ethnic scenario. However, SEM findings contradict previous studies; thus, discussion of the possible effects of consumer racism is based on two different approaches. Research limitations/implications: Future research could be expanded into other ethnic groups and countries, and/or to different products, categories and brands.

Structural equation modeling was employed to investigate the hypothesized relationships. Findings: Hedonic benefits and a new utilitarian benefits variable (self-enhancement (SE)) influenced Taiwanese consumers’ attitude toward pop-up retail, and attitude affected patronage intentions. Consumer innovativeness and materialism affected desired benefits. Interdependent self-construal moderated the relationship between materialism and the perceived utilitarian benefit of SE. Research limitations/implications: Respondents from one narrow, but appropriate, demographic group in one non-western society were examined. Comparison across demographic groups and non-western and western societies would reveal the prevalence of SE associated with pop-up retail acceptance. Practical implications: Pop-up shop design that emphasizes hedonic experience and social status of consumers could lead to successful experiential marketing in Taiwan and perhaps other Chinese societies. Originality/value: This appears to be the first empirical study in English examining consumer acceptance of pop-up retail in a non-western society. It verifies the importance of the perceived utilitarian benefit (self-enhancement), absent in previous pop-up retail studies, and the impact of individual differences and cultural values on Taiwanese consumer behavior. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer experience management; Consumption values; Cultural values; International consumer behaviour",""

Design/methodology/approach: Employing the theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, the qualitative interview data identified ten key attitudes, four reference groups and four perceived difficulties as potential motivators of students deciding to enrol in PHMS. Findings: This paper identified reputation of school and industry placement opportunities as key attitudinal items shaping students’ decision-making process. With regards to important social groups, education agents and family were key reference groups. In relation to perceived difficulties, students reported tuition and living costs, and far distance from home as key barriers in their decision to study at PHMS. Research limitations/implications: The sample draws upon students from a single state, New South Wales, Australia and this limits the generalisability of the authors’ findings. This study also excluded students from Australian public universities who may hold different perceptions towards studying at a PHMS. Practical implications: The findings have important implications for hotel schools to improve their curriculum designs and embed practical hands on the learning experience of their students. Marketing agencies can also use these motivational attributes in developing effective marketing campaigns to increase enrolment figures. Originality/value: This framework has proven to be useful in helping marketers understand various underlying motivational factors to attract prospective students to enrol in private hotel management schools. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hospitality and tourism; Motivational factors; Private hotel management schools; Theory of planned behaviour",""

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is examined by considering car as a product brand stimulus. Using a self-structured questionnaire, 263 usable responses are considered for data analysis by applying the structural equation modelling method. Findings: The findings indicate that all hypotheses on the relationships between brand personality, functional congruity, and stages of brand loyalty are supported except for the relationship between brand personality and conative loyalty, whereby brand personality indirectly have impacts on conative brand loyalty via functional congruity. The outcome of the multi-group analysis shows that the impact of brand personality and functional congruity on cognitive, affective, and conative brand loyalty varies across gender groups. Practical implications: The results indicate that if marketing managers are willing to create cognitive, affective as well as conative brand loyalty among consumers, they ought to tally their consumers’ purchasing and evaluation criteria with the functional and symbolic attributes. If the target consumers were motivated to purchase the product based on the symbolic attributes (as preferred by females in the present study), more attention should be focussed on communicating and delivering the symbolic attributes during their marketing campaign; on the other hand, if the consumers were inclined to buy product based on the utilitarian functions (as preferred by males in the current study), more emphasis should be placed on the functional values and attributes. Originality/value: This study is the first to utilise self-congruity and the elaboration likelihood model to explain the influence of brand personality and functional congruity on each component of brand loyalty within the automobile industry’s context. This study on the moderating role of gender shows that the effect of brand personality and functional congruity is different across gender groups.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative research design to collect the data. Focus group discussions were used. The participants were selected from Thai and Australian females, 25-45 years old in Melbourne representing the most frequent users of anti-aging products. Findings: The results indicated variations among participants in their motivation to seek a better appearance. The motivation ranged from a combination of striving to achieve an ideal self and a high level of social acceptability through maintaining youthful appearance and improving on the perceived declining youthful appearance. Using anti-aging products turned out to be a means for taking care of oneself, achieving better social acceptability and improving self-image. These key motivations are inspired by the individual’s social condition and from the reactions they receive from others. These motivations are shared by all participants, but within different cultural perspectives. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is in relation to the true expression of attitudes by respondents, particularly in regard to the discussion of privately held beliefs about self-image, social acceptability and personal appearance. Additionally, the variations between cultural perceptions are only indicative of real differences between collectivist and individualistic cultures. Practical implications: Managers can adopt a cultural framework for understanding their consumers’ motivations to enhance their appearance, formulate more accurately their marketing strategy and activate and satisfy their consumers’ demand and better inform their new product developments. Originality/value: The analysis explains and compares the differences and similarities in female consumers’ motivations for anti-aging product consumption of two fundamentally different cultural value systems. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-ageing products; Appearance enhancing; Cultural values; Culture; Self-image; Social acceptability",""

"The mediating role of new ecological paradigm between value orientations and pro-environmental personal norm in the agricultural context","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962141605&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2015-0138&partnerID=40&md5=f8ba89dc57f1ed677e183082ccd6abbb","Purpose – Environmental awareness became a crucial agenda for both academicians and practitioners. Effect of the individual’s value, belief and norm on their environmentally significant behaviour is vital on subsequent purchase decision of the consumers. Considering this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships among value orientations, new ecological paradigm (NEP) and pro-environmental personal norm (PPN). Moreover, this research intends to investigate the mediating role of NEP between value orientations and PPN. Design/methodology/approach – This study has utilized questionnaire survey among 277 paddy farmers at the Muda Agricultural Development Authority area in Malaysia. Data were analysed using partial least squares technique in order to test study hypotheses. Partial least square technique was utilized to analyse the data to test the study hypotheses. Findings – Results reveal that biospheric value, altruistic value and egoistic value positively and significantly affect NEP. It is also found that NEP positively and significantly affect PPN. Data also supports the links between altruistic value and PPN. However, the relationship between other two value orientations (biospheric value and egoistic value) and PPN is not supported by the data. Additionally, NEP mediates the relationship between biospheric value and PPN as well as between egoistic value and PPN. Contrary to this, NEP does not mediate the relationship between altruistic value and PPN. Practical implications – The findings of this study will guide the agrochemical industry to understand how to enhance consumers’ behavioural aspect towards the environmental welfare. As handling of agrochemical is hazardous to health and environment, the knowledge on the effect of value orientation, belief and norm holds the key to inculcate good agricultural practice. Originality/value – The present study is among the pioneers to consider NEP as the mediator between three types of value orientation and personal norm. Additionally, this study examined the relationship between NEP and PPN as well as between value orientations and PPN which are comparatively new to the existing body of literature. Nevertheless, this study considers NEP as a multidimensional constructs which is relatively new.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 60 interviews were performed with buyers of sporty and compact cars. The qualitative laddering technique guided data collection and analysis, resulting in two cognitive value maps (HVM). The results were interpreted based on three theoretical approaches: Schwartz (1994), Allen (2000) and Gutman (1982). Findings: The dominant chains from the two models indicate connection between “design and hedonism,” “internal finishing and hedonism” and “security items and safety as a value.” Therefore, these customers are predominantly characterized by individualistic values: by the pursuit of personal pleasure and concern for personal safety. Research limitations/implications: Due to qualitative techniques having been used, future research could validate some presented results through surveys based on the connections between the set of attributes and values presented in this research. Practical implications: Results from this study can help to develop segmentation and advertising strategies, as well as marketing aftermarket actions based on the psychographic profile provided by the HVMs. They may also assist integration between the initial and final phases of new vehicles’ development which have concepts similar to those studied here.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the interrelationship among social stratification, materialism, post-materialism, and consumption values contributing uniquely to understanding Chinese consumers in the context of drastic economic and social changes. Design/methodology/approach: Survey method was used to test the proposed model and answer the research questions. The data were collected in Shanghai, the largest city on the eastern coast of China. A multi-stage random sampling strategy was employed to acquire a representative sample of the population in the city. A total of 2,910 completed questionnaires were used for data analysis. Findings: The results show that objective social status has a negative effect on post-materialism, whereas subjective social status has a positive effect. Social status does not seem to have a significant effect on materialism. Post-materialism also has a strong positive effect on the consumption orientations of emotional value and social value. Practical implications: China was chosen as the research context in this study. As a booming emerging market, China provides an intriguing platform to examine social stratification and materialism. At the macro level, China is developing a new social structure due to the drastic social and economic changes. At the individual consumer level, as China moves further into a market-oriented economy, traditional Chinese values have changed rapidly. Western consumption values and phenomena such as overspending and conspicuous consumption have begun to take hold in China, especially among young people. It is critical for business managers to understand the shift of consumption values among Chinese in order to successfully capture this market. Originality/value: A cursory review of past literature reveals that researchers have examined materialism primarily along two avenues: one puts materialism within a macro framework involving political interest or civic engagement (e.g. Davis et al., 1999; Inglehart, 1990); the other one takes a micro perspective exploring the impact of materialism on consumer attitudes and behavior (e.g. Park and Rabolt, 2009; Xiao and Kim, 2009). However, little research has been conducted linking the two approaches. The present study intends to examine the interrelationship among social stratification, materialism, post-materialism, and consumption values. Hopefully, it will shed some light on the connection between macro environment and micro consumer behavior. Furthermore, the current research provides evidences for the emerging transformation to a post-materialistic marketplace. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumption values; Marketing in China; Materialism; Post-materialism",""

The study also tries to explain the relationship between intentions to trust (IT) and online purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through well-structured instrument, distributed to 226 students of Masters of Business Administration and Masters of Computer Applications departments of a north Indian University. Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling were used to analyse the data and to test the formulated hypotheses. Findings – The results of the study highlight that 90 per cent of the respondents are aware about online shopping sites but only 38 per cent are online buyers of various products. Major reasons for not shopping are lack of security, absence of physical examination and testing of products, lack of product’s complete information, unattractive visual displays and layouts, etc. However, it is observed that nearly 79 per cent respondents have positive intentions to buy products online in near future. Research limitations/implications – There is a need to study actual online buying behaviour. Also, models like Technology Acceptance Model and Diffusion of Innovation have not been studied. As the study was confined to students only, it can be replicated to other age group consumer segments and extended to other emerging economies as well. There is a need to take into consideration some other important dimensions in the future studies, namely, predictability, familiarity, third party certification, attitude, ease of use, perceived risk, etc., for the better analysis of behaviour. Practical implications – E-vendors must properly implement money back guarantee schemes when there is non-delivery of ordered goods, provide dispute resolution system, instil confidence in customers, highlight security, privacy policy, display contacts details, etc., to increase customers’ IT and purchase products online. Originality/value – The paper identifies the factors that obstruct customer to purchase products online. More particularly, in Indian context the present study makes valuable contribution as the Indians have been reported to be techno phobic and uncertainty avoidant. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Firm’s image; Intentions to trust; Propensity to trust; Purchase intentions; Uncertainty avoidance",""

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative approach was taken, gathering 352 responses from young adults via an online survey. Findings – Perceptions of interactivity and sincerity on musicians’ SNS are found to lead to stronger ties, enhancing the fan’s feeling of closeness to the musician, the fan’s inclination to spread positive word-of-mouth, and the time a fan spends on the site. Pathways are found between the fan activity, sense of closeness and time spent on the SNS. In terms of acquisition, the tie strength indicator of time spent on the SNS holds a positive relationship with purchase intent. While a sense of closeness holds a negative relationship to illegal downloading activity, the fan’s activity recommending the musician has a positive influence on illegal downloading. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of this study include a limited amount of information on the musician and extent of fandom, suggesting future research to tease out the effects of SNS on fans with varying levels of existing commitment to musicians.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate youth’s intentions of seeking microcredit in the post-war era that are an integral part of BOP market. Design/methodology/approach – The sample comprised 1,250 youth aged 18 and above from Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Surveys were administered for data collection. After testing measurement model, a structural model was run to test hypotheses. Findings – Positive affect, subjective norms and entrepreneurial desire enhanced intentions of seeking microcredit, whereas perceived deterrents negatively influenced those intentions. Perceived benefits, perceived behavioural control and knowledge of microcredit did not have significant effects on these intentions. Research limitations/implications – This study was conducted in one war-affected country, Sri Lanka. Also, data were cross-sectional. Hence the model needs replication amongst youth in other post-conflict contexts and with longitudinal data. Practical implications – Findings of this study would be of use to market microcredit to youth in post-conflict era and other segments of BOP. Originality/value – A unique purchase behavioural model is suggested to enhance youths’ intentions of seeking microcredit in the post-war era, a segment within the BOP market. This study can contribute to purchase behaviour literature in identified contexts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer perception; Financial services marketing; Market segmentation; Marketing in developing countries",""
"Traceability systems in the Western Australia halal food supply chain","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931038102&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2014-0082&partnerID=40&md5=bdffc073a3e14502dea8efb952d43c13","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the emergence and implementation of traceability systems in the Western Australian (WA) Halal food industry. In particular, to understand how individuals in facilitating organizations perceive the Halal idea logic and the benefits that a traceability system can provide to the Halal food processing industry. Design/methodology/approach – An empirical qualitative approach was employed to examine these issues utilizing in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out using Leximancer software. Findings – Findings suggest that individual’s perception of Halal idea logic is aligned to the roles they perform. These perceptions were impacted by the specific objectives or business interests of each organization. Facilitating organizations also perceive that traceability systems are a strategic tool in the Halal food processing industry. Practical implications – The research provides insights into how to improve existing understanding of the Halal idea logic within Halal food business networks and the benefits of implementing traceability systems in Halal food production. Joint activity between firms creates a network effect, where the value created is greater than that which the firms alone can create. Originality/value – Though traceability systems have become increasingly popular in the food industry, little research has been undertaken to understand how individuals in facilitating organizations perceive these systems, particularly in the growing Halal food industry. Hence, the study contributes to the literature of traceability studies and the area of change and process adaptation in business relationships in the context of halal food production. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business networks; Facilitating organizations; Halal food supply chain; Leximancer; Traceability system",""

Design/methodology/approach – Using a case study approach, evaluations and critical analysis of the DIY industry was being formulated by drawing on real life brands and examples. An analysis of various DIY retail strategies and DIY decking companies was synthesised to provide insights into the DIY industry. Findings – The insights into the industry outlines the changing consumer attitudes and motivations towards DIY and decking tasks. The findings on an evolving DIY industry, in particular the decking market demonstrate useful implications for academics, policy makers and brand practitioners. Originality/value – There have been little industry studies that delve into specifically decking products. Considering the vast increase in homeware, renovations, and gardening, the study provides insights from various case studies into the strategies undertaken by Australian and global companies. In addition, the majority of studies undertaken have also been concerned with the intrinsic motivations of consumers and not necessarily the extrinsic effect that brands and retailers advertently and inadvertently communicate and signal to consumers of DIY products. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Branding; Consumer behaviour; Decking; DIY; International marketing; Retail",""
"Animosity within borders: The mediating roles of regional identification and perceived discrimination on regional media preference","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944896717&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2015-0010&partnerID=40&md5=ccd93af0465ce49e7cfc943ecd7343dc","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify and examine the antecedents and consequence of regional animosity and their impacts on regional media preference. Design/methodology/approach – Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with randomly selected adult residents in Northern (206) and Southern (201) Taiwan. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling in LISERAL and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings – The findings reveal that perceived economic threat, economic hardship and dissatisfaction with government economic policy increase home region identification and perceived discrimination, which in turn lead to heightened animosity toward the opposite foreign region. This increasing animosity then affects consumer choice over home region media compared to media originated from the other region. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that military and political tensions alone cannot explain why consumers would harbor animosity between one region and another within the same country due to social and economic reasons. The constructs chosen in this research should be seen only as a snapshot but other variables such as a region’s natural environment and its human factors are not taken into account. Future studies would benefit from inclusion of these variables and a wider geographical scope. Practical implications – Several implications are extracted to help marketing and branding personnel better shape their marketing, communication and media strategies, as well as to help government policy makers and political parties revise existing policy to reduce the animosity. Originality/value – By investigating animosity within borders, this study provides fresh insights to help explain how economic factors contribute to increased regional animosity through the mediating effect of regional identification and perceived discrimination. The findings broaden existing understanding about the concept of animosity and its impact on consumer behavior. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic hardship; Economic policy; Economic threat; Perceived discrimination; Regional animosity; Regional identification",""

Design/methodology/approach – The research incorporates a descriptive research design. In total, 564 questionnaires were completed by active and relapsed members of churches in Australia. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between constructs. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence that perceived spiritual and social benefits have a positive and significant relationship with church participation in both regular and ICG sample group. Perceived purpose-in-life (PIL) benefits are not related to church participation in both sample groups. Practical implications – The findings may guide leaders of religious organisations to understand the importance of spiritual and social benefits in attracting prospective church members. The marketing message of religious organisation should therefore focus on spiritual and social appeals. Originality/value – Past researchers have not looked into the dynamic relationships between perceived benefits and church participation among regular and irregular church members, particularly in Australia, hence research is to be called for in this area.

Design/methodology/approach – The research is descriptive in nature, using an online survey to collect quantitative data on wine consumer behaviour. A total of 407 responses were obtained. Data analysis included descriptive analysis (frequency distributions) and cluster analysis. Findings – The research identifies three clusters of wine consumers: “the extrinsic attribute-seeking customers”, “the intrinsic attribute-seeking customers” and “the alcohol level attribute-seeking customers”. These groups of consumerswere categorised using a behavioural (benefit) segmentation base. Research limitations/implications – The use of an internet survey and convenience sample limits generalisation of the findings. The adoption of a behavioural basis in conducting the segmentation is a limitation. The use of more complex segmentation bases, such as psychographics, may yield a richer understanding of the Chinese wine consumer in future studies. Practical implications – The customer profiles provide Australian wine marketers with an insight into Chinese wine consumer behaviour. Brand positioning can be improved by ensuring that the brand emphasises certain product attributes which the segments value when choosing wine. Originality/value – Little previous research on market segmentation has been conducted in mainland China. For Australian wine marketers, this study provides a baseline study into market segmentation and may assist with targeting and brand positioning decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Chinese wine market; Consumer behaviour; Market segmentation; Product/brand positioning",""
"Impact of religion on the effectiveness of the promotional aspect of product packages in muslim countries","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946408211&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-11-2013-0137&partnerID=40&md5=2f17d3061f6553ecf08a5a50942c4d62","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of religion on the effectiveness of product packages in attracting customers’ attention, and forming their attitudes, preferences, and buying decisions. In other words, the study aims at finding out how do Muslims respond to product packages including elements believed to disagree with the Islamic values, in this study referred to as “contentious packages.” Design/methodology/approach – To test the five hypotheses, the study recruited 300 young Muslims in Bahrain, chosen from the population of 14,000 students of the University of Bahrain aged between 20 and 25, 26 percent male and 74 percent female. The primary data were collected through personal interviews with the selected sample, using a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire included ten questions covering two personal questions for age and gender and eight other questions attempting to find out Muslims’ responses to contentious packages in terms of attention, attitudes, buying intention, company image, and word-of-mouth. Findings – Findings indicate that use of contentious packaging runs a high risk of tarnishing a company’s reputation and appeal. Muslims who live by Shari’a and the dictates of the Kuran will consider such companies to be promoters of fornication, and will therefore boycott such companies in order to prevent them from corrupting the purity and piety of the community. If advertising firms continue to fail in recognizing the profundity of these beliefs within Muslim communities, both their fiscal success and reputation run the risk of suffering substantial damage. Practical implications – The findings of this study send six important messages to multinational companies doing business in Islamic countries. First, Islam governs all aspects of Muslim life, including consumer behavior. Second, to prosper in Islamic countries, choose packaging that does not contradict or offend the principles and values of Islam. Third, recognize that much packaging that has proven to be effective in Western countries will not be successful in Islamic countries due to vastly different cultural environments. Fourth, a contentious package may result in a steep drop in the sales. Fifth, using contentious packages may damage the reputation. Sixth, you can attract more Muslims by using non-contentious packages. Originality/value – This paper is of great value to companies who wish to expand their practice in Muslim countries. Its findings promise to improve advertising standards and to increase both company profits and customer satisfaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertisements and promotions to Muslims; Advertising; Consumer ethics; Contentious packaging; Cross-cultural marketing; Customer satisfaction; Environmental management; Halal markets; Immodest packaging; Islamic marketing",""

In this endeavour, the study illustrates the unique context of luxury consumption, to highlight several developments in extant literature, and to advocate for the advancement of the consumer-centric paradigm of luxury branding. Design/methodology/approach – The study reviews the emergence of a global luxury brand industry, discusses macro-environmental trends that have influenced luxury brand consumption, critically evaluates the existing literature on luxury brands, and offers directions for future research. Findings – The study highlights that luxury brands have emerged as a special form of branding that conveys the unique sociocultural and individual meanings to their adherents. Moreover, it was found that these meanings have been shaped by a number of important cultural, social, and external trends, which call researchers and practitioners to consider the consumer-centric paradigm of luxury branding. Originality/value – The study calls for a shift in the focus from the characteristics of luxury brands per se, and towards phenomenological experiences and socio-cultural influences, in the pursuits to understand what brand luxury conveys in the broader context of post-modern consumer culture.

However, previous studies have indicated that consumers have limited knowledge and ability to recognize national origin of brands. The purpose of this paper is to assess brand origin recognition accuracy (BORA) and its relationships with brand evaluation and purchase intention in the Indonesian laptop market. Design/methodology/approach: A convenient sample of 195 people in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta participated in the survey. They were given a list of 18 laptop brands (four local and 14 foreign brands) and were asked to identify their actual national origins. Findings: The study found that consumers are more likely to misidentify than correctly recognize a true BO. This limited ability also has contributed to the low BORA scores for both local and foreign brands. Brand evaluation was found to be positively correlated with purchase intention. However, the current study could only find partial supports for the relationship between BORA scores and brand evaluation as well as purchase intention. Practical implications: Many Indonesian consumers are unaware of the laptops’ BO, whether it is foreign or local. Companies need to inform, educate, and/or remind consumers of their brand’s true origin and avoid being associated with a weaker country image. Furthermore, despite all four Indonesian laptop brand names seem to use non-Indonesian names, only one brand gains a slightly better brand evaluation from favorable misclassification. It may suggest that the effectiveness of foreign branding strategy in the Indonesian laptop market is debatable. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies examining BORA in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and the largest laptop market in Southeast Asia. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand origin; Brand origin recognition accuracy; Foreign brands; Indonesia; Laptop; Local brands",""

Design/methodology/approach: Across two studies, participants were asked to listen to several musical stimuli with different tempi (i.e. slow or fast). Then, they were asked to evaluate and choose one drink (i.e. iced tea or hot tea). Findings: Results suggest that consumers who listen to fast (slow) tempo music are more likely to choose iced (hot) tea. This effect is robust across different musical modes (i.e. major or minor) (Study 1). However, this musical tempo effect is attenuated when the participants are aware that the music they listened to can influence their judgments (Study 2).

Although the benefits of using cultural heritage in brand strategies have been noted by past literature, the efficacies of how Asian brands can use brand logo designs to positively influence their brand success have not been studied. To fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to examine how Chinese brands can increase willingness to try among US consumers by establishing brand uniqueness via culturally authentic brand logo designs. Design/methodology/approach: The data from 289 respondents via online between-subjects factorial experimental research surveys were collected using a national US population as the sample frame. The Chinese brand logos communicating Asian heritage were created by manipulating the cultural authenticity of the brand logo mark and the language of the logotype. Findings: The results suggested that the Asian-themed brand logo is an important tool in exuding a Chinese brand’s sense of cultural authenticity to US consumers. In turn, the perception of cultural authenticity for the Chinese brand positively influenced the US consumers’ perceptions of the brand’s uniqueness, which led to greater willingness to try the brand. Originality/value: The research provides empirical insights into how “Asian-ness” can be manifested via brand logos to convey cultural authenticity as well as to build perceived brand uniqueness and the willingness to try among US consumers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asian brand; Brand logo; Brand uniqueness; Chinese brand; Cultural authenticity; Willingness to try",""

Design/methodology/approach – A lab experiment with a 2 (existing vs plain packaging format) × 2 (familiar vs unfamiliar brand) factorial design was conducted with Chinese subjects in Macau. Findings – The plain packaging format in cigarette labeling reduces both smoking intent and brand likability in familiar brand condition but not unfamiliar brand condition. Social implications – When many governments are currently deliberating about whether to follow the plain packaging initiative, this study constitutes a timely investigation of the effects of it on smoking intent and brand likability among Chinese young non-smokers. The positive effect of the plain packaging in familiar brand condition provides the justification of adopting it by the governments. Originality/value – Studies of plain packaging have not been taking brand familiarity into consideration (the only exceptional study used the top three familiar brands and thus failed to examine the familiarity effect) but the study focussed on it. In the data analysis, if brand familiarity is not considered, wrong conclusion will be drawn. Therefore, by having brand familiarity as moderator, the authors are able to correctly conclude that plain packaging format is worth adopting. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand familiarity; Brand likability; Cigarette labeling; Lab experiment; Plain packaging; Smoking intent",""

Moreover, what changes to wine bottle characteristics and standard wine composition appealed and could affect their purchasing decision. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through an online survey of 910 wine consumers who resided in Metropolitan Philadelphia and New York City. Findings – Based on conjoint analysis, averaged importance for food-wine-pairing information on wine bottle back labels was greater than both how to contact and connect with the winery and winery background information. Within the pairing information factor, description of food-wine-pairings and symbols of food-wine-pairings received positive utility values, indicating consumers preferred these options more than having no pairing information present. Consumers who purchased wine at least once a week were more positively impacted by the alternatives presented, with influence decreasing as purchasing frequency declined. Wine purchasing frequency is related to the number of wine drinkers living in a household and wine consumption within a household is most often a shared consumption activity. More females drink wine but the consumption frequency of males is higher. Practical implications – Producers considering changing either the wine composition or a bottle characteristic should note that, based on frequency of wine purchasing, changes that may invoke a positive response are: decreased calorie content, wine made from “sustainably farmed” or “naturally farmed” grapes, and producing USDA Certified Organic wine. Originality/value – This study is the first to investigate what changes to extrinsic cues in the form of wine bottle and back label characteristics and to the wine composition (taste) intrinsic cue appeal to consumers in the US market and might influence their purchase decisions. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Extrinsic cues; Packaging; USA; Wine bottle; Wine label",""

The model focuses on an important, yet often neglected customer-oriented construct, i.e., user “control”, which is embedded in consumer behaviour when accessing the internet. The study examines the relationship between control, online dependency, online encounter satisfaction and overall satisfaction. It explains the strategic implications surrounding customer control and online dependency as means for enhancing customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was developed drawing on a combination of existing and new measurement items for the constructs in question. The instrument was later pilot tested on two consecutive occasions ahead of the main survey. A random sample of Hong Kong banking consumers was approached and interviews were undertaken via telephone. The data were analysed via confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses relating to the model. Findings: The findings reveal positive relationships between control and online dependency, and control and online encounter satisfaction. Meanwhile control, online dependency and online encounter satisfaction lead to overall satisfaction. Originality/value: This study proposes a counterintuitive argument that while online service customers gain control of the online service process, they become more dependent on it, and their control and dependency also lead to their satisfaction, at both the online service encounter level and corporate level. Drawing on the pertinent literature, this is the first study to examine the importance of two information system constructs, i.e., control and online dependency, as predictors of consumer psychological fulfilment, i.e., satisfaction. The findings confirm that control as an initiator and driver of customer satisfaction in an online context, and online encounter satisfaction, further contributes to overall satisfaction at the corporate level. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Control; Customer satisfaction; Dependency; Encounter satisfaction; Online service",""

The authors also investigate whether segments exist which differ in demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – The authors survey 484 Australian online panel volunteers using a adapted version of the 30 item of the volunteer function inventory (VFI) scale developed by Clary et al. (1998). Data were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and cluster analysis, as well as ANOVA and χ2 test comparisons of demographics between clusters. Findings – CFA verifies that the VFI scale is suitable instrument to gauge online participants’ motivations. Cluster analysis produced a five-cluster solution, where respondents with low motivations overall comprised the largest grouping. Segments are interpreted by assessing the difference between the total sample average and the segment profile. The examination also identifies that the only demographic factor that varies across the five clusters is “respondents” employment status”. Research limitations/implications – Future research could explore if differences in segments result in differences in online participation. The high number or respondents with low motivations may explain the relatively high levels of churn that take place within online panels and as a result panel operators would need to continually attract new members. Further research could also investigate whether the levels of motivation change over time and if so what effect such variation would produce on respondents’ retention. Originality/value – Research on online panel respondents’ motivation is still limited and investigating online panellists’ motivation as volunteers is very important as it unveils, as in the study herein reported, that alternative types of respondents may be driven by different factors when joining an online panel (or completing a given survey). Recruitment strategies could, therefore, be shaped to suit the motivation of the different segments. By refining the matching between volunteers’ profiles and their motivation, managers could improve how volunteers are recruited, managed and retained. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Online panels; Respondents’ motivations; Volunteering",""

Further, a model was established on SM with the organizational variables of enacting organizational environment (EOE), organizational infrastructure (OI), project complexity (PC) and creation of collective mind (CCM). Design/methodology/approach – This research was based on structured survey questionnaire data of 415 managers from private and public sector firms in India. The data analysis was carried out with SPSS 20 and AMOS 18 for structural equation modeling. Findings – Research results indicated that the exogenous factors were EOE and OI. PC and CCM were the intervening variables and SM was the endogenous variables. The result indicated that there was significant positive relationship between EOE and PC, EOE and CCM. There was also a significant positive relationship between the variables EOE with PC, OI with PC and CCM with PC.

However, the fathers’ perspective on children food advertising in societies that score high on masculinity is important but absent from literature. The purpose of this paper is to present opinions of respondents as fathers, concerning the impact of TV food advertisements on children buying and consumption habits. Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative data through semi-structured interviews has been collected from 32 males having at least one child between the ages of seven and 14 years. The respondents were purposefully selected from a private sector university located in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The collected data have been analysed through thematic analysis. Findings – Thematic analysis revealed six themes; quantity of ads, negative impact of TV food ads, changing buying patterns, positive/productive impact on children, father’s perceptions of TV advertising, and advertising changes to be incorporated. The findings have some social, cultural, and managerial implications for core advertising stakeholders. Practical implications – This study is useful for marketing managers whose job is to persuade children and their families into buying their products. They can benefit from the findings of this study to customize the brand communication strategies as per the expectations of respondents as fathers. Furthermore, the study proposes useful insights that will help in devising consumer-led advertising policies in Pakistan. Originality/value – The gender role of males while influencing family decision making with regards to food products marketing has been a new area of research.

"Franchise system investment disclosure: signaling value to prospective franchisees","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946407296&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2013-0124&partnerID=40&md5=49eba8211101bf1b50578296973bca96","Purpose – The divergent interests of franchisor and franchisee give rise to significant ex-post conflict following the purchase of a franchise. Australian regulators have sought to assist transparency in franchising decision making by legislating for disclosure documents that expose key variables that theoretically determine choice on the part of prospective franchisees. The purpose of this paper is to explore the value proposition of the disclosure document and tests its normative effectiveness using a signal-theoretic perspective. Design/methodology/approach – Potential investors were asked to consider selected attributes through a choice-based survey, consistent with consumer theory, and focussing on an attribute-based determination of value. However, complex decision making in general and choice modeling can place severe cognitive burdens on respondents and induce satisficing rather than maximizing behavioral patterns. Best-worst scaling (BWS) provided a means for potential purchasers to respond coherently. Findings – Findings indicate limited capacity for potential investors to rationalize the simplistic choices presented, suggesting that franchise choice is determined to a large degree by non-rational factors. Research limitations/implications – This research is embryonic (exploratory) in nature with the findings providing an imperative for further investigation into workable attributes of franchise systems. Analysis is limited to prospective franchisees’ perceptions and needs to be triangulated with franchisor and policy-makers perspectives. Practical implications – Both franchisors and policy makers can utilize this research to improve transparency in the disclosure document. Prospective franchisees should then be able to make more effective decisions about the franchise systems of choice. Social implications – A reduction in conflict within the franchising sector (no matter how trivial) will improve the business operations, franchisee and employee welfare throughout the sector. Progress on this topic will improve the sustainability and overall attractiveness of the sector. Originality/value – Conjoint analysis has not been used previously in franchising research. The use of BWS on prospective franchisee perceptions is innovative providing a basis for much research to be done in this field of research. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Best-worst scaling; Channel relationships; Conjoint methods; Disclosure documents; Franchising",""

"The relationships between collective-oriented values and materialism, product status signaling and product satisfaction: A two-city study","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997018134&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2016-0009&partnerID=40&md5=5881a05a3ec99b07eb19f8b3a302eb5b","Purpose: Prior research has found that consumers’ purchasing behavior varies amongst consumers of different cultures. The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavior of consumers of luxury products by investigating the relationships between their collective-oriented values (pertaining to religion, family, and community), and their materialism or materialistic orientation, resulting in them using such products to signal their social status to others, and whether they are getting satisfaction from using such products, in an effort to understand how the behaviors vary between Malaysian and Saudi Arabian consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected by a questionnaire survey where 1,388 self-administered questionnaires were collected from Baby boomers, Generations X and Y respondents in two major cities: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The authors also assessed the structure and reliability of the constructs developed for this research as well as tested some hypotheses regarding their interrelationships, across the two different cities/cultures. Findings: Findings demonstrate the complexity of cultures and lifestyles of consumers and societies. For Saudi consumers, their materialistic tendency is significantly influenced by their religious, family values (inverse relationship), and community values, whereas for the Malaysian consumers, this tendency was only significantly influenced by their family values. For the Saudis, there were strong positive relationships between materialistic values and product status signaling and between product status signaling and product satisfaction, whereas for the Malaysians, both relationships were also positive but only moderate in strength. Overall, the results show that the Malaysians were more materialistic than the Saudis. But, since the Saudis have higher income, they are in a better position to fulfill their materialistic desire than their Malaysian counterparts. Research limitations/implications: The convenience sampling used for the study is the main limitation. Another limitation of this study is that it was done in only one major city in each of the two countries. Practical implications: Consumers from the two cultures/cities do use luxury products to signal their status in the society, despite their different cultures and country income levels and that the consumption of those products gave both of them satisfaction. Hence, as a practical implication, international marketers of luxury products and services could and should continue to market their products and services in these two countries. However, they need to understand that the factors that influence the consumers’ materialism are different between the two cultures/cities and hence their marketing strategies need to take this into consideration. Originality/value: All the issues discussed in this study have not been previously empirically investigated and compared in two different developing countries – Saudi Arabia, a mono-cultural and high-income country) and Malaysia (a multi-cultural and upper middle income country) despite their rapid growth rates and economic importance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collective-oriented values; Malaysia; Materialism; Product satisfaction; Product status signaling; Saudi Arabia",""

Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative data analysis was employed to attain the above objective. In order to explore the existence of difference between clothing preferences between two religious classes analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed. It was employed to analyse the difference between group means. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized paths. SEM was used separately for both the religious classes to explore the possibility of difference between both of them. Before testing the measurement model confirmatory factor analysis was run to test the cleanliness of the measurement items. Data were analysed in two parts A and B. In part A SEM was employed to test the hypotheses developed and in part B ANOVA was used to test the difference between group means. Findings – It was found that both the religious classes were significantly different from each other in their apparel preference. It was also found that the Indians were not collectivist as often labelled in a stereotypical way. Practical implications – The findings of this study would provide useful in-depth knowledge on Indian religious groups for both international and national marketers. The study confirmed that ignoring the diversity of an emerging market and adopting a standardized marketing strategy could prove fatal. It provides better understanding about the cultural diversity and its impact on buying imported products. Such insight should enable marketers, policy makers, and social planners to act more effectively by designing their positioning strategies accordingly. Originality/value – Some unexpected differences was found in individualism and collectivism dimensions and it was also found that the inter-cultural differences between Hindus and Muslims have changed since the original Hofstede data were collected on Hindu and Muslim dominating countries. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Cultural values; Ethnocentrism",""

The mediating effect of brand preference on the relationship between CSR initiatives and turnover intention has also been studied. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted and questionnaires were distributed to a sample in Macau in 2012. Out of these, 138 valid samples were collected among casinos’ mid- and senior-level employees having managerial positions (hereafter “managers”). Regression tests were performed in order to validate the hypotheses. Findings – Managers’ preference for the casino brand of their employer can be enhanced by perceptions associated with CSR initiatives. Two CSR initiatives (CSR to stakeholders and to society) significantly decrease managers’ turnover intentions, with the impact of CSR directed at stakeholders exerting a stronger influence. Brand preference is a significant mediator of perceptions associated with CSR initiatives and turnover intention. Originality/value – The current study tries to not only investigate how perceptions associated with CSR initiatives influence an internal customer’s turnover intention but is also aimed at understanding how brand preference as a mediator influences turnover intention.

Design/methodology/approach – A customized factorial design was employed to measure main effects of brand familiarity, country trustworthiness and country favourability and interaction effects. Findings – Although Indonesia and Malaysia are Muslim countries, they are not perceived as trustworthy as others such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for the consumer product under study. The perception of trustworthiness of halal certification of origin explains the highest proportion of the variance in the preference for a product, followed by the interaction of country favourability and brand name country of origin (COO). Research limitations/implications – Managers of international companies should be aware that not all halal country certifications are equally perceived as trustworthy therefore, they should seek alliances, with institutions in markets where they seek to penetrate. Practical implications – The procedure for certification considers the whole value chain rather than just simple ritual of slaughtering. Managers have a big responsibility to produce their products according to the expected standards (and this goes beyond the simple slaughtering ritual) and make sure that all employees understands the importance of such adherence. Social implications – Muslim consumers’ preferences vary according to the COO of halal products, even within Muslim countries therefore, halal certification country-of-origin is a sensitive social concern.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors employ hierarchical multiple regression based on the data obtained from Bangladesh, a south Asian developing country and a leading exporter of apparel products worldwide. The authors used a sample of 224 early internationalizing apparel firms to test the hypotheses. Findings – Research describes the relationship between export assistance and performance as direct. Recently, some researchers have suggested moderators between them. The authors argue that the relationship between the two is contingent on the level of export commitment. The authors find that neither informational nor experiential marketing assistance is directly related to export performance. The relationship between informational assistance and export performance is significantly, but (unexpectedly) negatively, moderated by export commitment. The effect of experiential assistance is positively, but only marginally, moderated by export commitment.

The purpose of this paper is to encourage the discussion about spokes-characters’ functions in marketing and branding, particularly in the Asian market. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through a survey among university students in Taiwan. The survey questionnaire was based on the literature on spokes-characters and on the available scales of consumer-based brand equity. Data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling. Findings – The results in this study show that the spokes-character perception is properly reflected by likability, relevance and expertise and likability is the most salient attribute. The spokes-character perception influences brand awareness/association and perceived quality, which in turn influence brand loyalty. Research limitations/implications – This study suggests that likability, relevance and expertise are proper constructs connoting the spokes-character perception and verifies the influence of the spokes-character, as a source of secondary association, on brand equity antecedents, i.e. brand awareness/association, perceived quality and brand loyalty. This study also finds that the spokescharacter serves as a cue of perceived quality. Practical implications – The suggested scale provides marketers with an instrument for measuring consumers’ perception of a potential spokes-character. Besides, when the advertiser or the marketer designs a spokes-character, the character should not only be likable, but also be relevant and show expertise relating to the endorsed brand. Originality/value – This study hopes to encourage more discussions about the utilization of the spokes-character in the Asian market because the discussion about how the spokes-character works in this market is still scant. This study also provides empirical evidence for the influence of a secondary association, i.e. the spokes-character, on brand equity antecedents. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Brand management; Consumer behaviour; Marketing communications; Marketing in China; Retail management",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates offering mobile coupons as an incentive and word-of-mouth (WOM) tool. An empirical study compares achievable effects on WOM behavior in an Eastern cultural context, which an Indonesian sample represents, and in a Western cultural context, which a German sample of incentivized WOM represents. Findings: Providing senders and receivers’ with differing incentives leads to German consumers having an unfavorable attitude toward such incentives, but not for Indonesian consumers. Furthermore, Indonesian consumers base their decision to redeem mobile coupons more on their personal judgment and their overall deal proneness, while German consumers rely on their personal judgment and on others’ opinion. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to explore more countries to enrich the Western and Eastern cultural perspectives. Practical implications: Western firms should consider providing senders and receivers with the same incentives. Alternatively, a non-transparent strategy might be a solution. For firms located in Indonesia, or in other Eastern societies, the transparency of the provided incentives is not a main concern, because inequality is not a big issue in an Eastern society, while senders’ or receivers’ deal proneness character strongly influences their intention to redeem a coupon.

Based on the institutional theory suggesting the influence of environmental factors of companies’ country-of-origins on their marketing practices, the purpose of this paper is to explore and compare the CSR communication practices of apparel firms from different countries. Design/methodology/approach – As a case study approach, this study investigates six apparel firms’ CSR communication disclosures on the official websites using a content analysis method and the Global Reporting Initiative’s categorial CSR reporting guidelines. Findings – Findings revealed that the six firms’ CSR communication adoption levels and focusses varied; the USA firms largely focussed on labor issues, while the European firms focussed on environmental issues and the Asian firms centered on social issues. Research limitations/implications – Although this study has limitations that pertain to case studies in general, this study provides academic contributions to the literature and managerial implications about different CSR focusses and communication activities across countries. Originality/value – CSR is especially important for the apparel business that highly involves social issues such as labor-intensive production. However, limited research showed how apparel firms are actually communicating CSR.

Findings –While all three types of trust have significant impact on satisfaction, only competence and goodwill trust positively influenced rapport. Results also demonstrate that competence and goodwill trust had complementary mediation impacts in the rapport-satisfaction context; however, mediation influence of contractual trust was not significant. Finally, influence of rapport was found to be positive towards satisfaction. Practical implications – Management should focus on building goodwill and competence trust with bank customers. Bank managers should hire and train employees who are friendly in terms of customer care and are able to develop rapport with customers to increase the latter’s satisfaction.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the mediation effect of physician perceived value (PPV) on the relationship between marketing mix strategy (MMS) and PHS in the pharmaceutical industry in Yemen. Design/methodology/approach: A non-probability purposive sample of 500 physicians was surveyed by using a self-administered questionnaire. Out of the 500 questionnaires, only 192 surveys were returned. Consequently, only 170 questionnaires were usable for the final analysis, with a 34 percent usable response rate. Several statistical techniques were performed including reliability, factor analysis, multiple regressions analysis, and hierarchical regressions to examine the mediation effect of the PPV. Findings: The results showed that MMS elements, namely, product, price, promotion, and place, significantly contributed to PHS. The results also indicated that MMS elements, namely, price, place, and promotion, significantly contributed to PPV, whereas product showed an insignificant contribution. The PPV significantly contributed to PHS. Hierarchical regression results indicated that PPV partially mediated the relationship among MMS elements, namely, price, place, promotion, and PHS. Product variable was excluded in hierarchical analyses because the variable was insignificant to PPV.

The specific purpose is an analysis of activities that might be attempted by companies in emerging markets in order to increase the strength of their brands. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the determinants of the development of brand value. An analysis has also been made of activities connected with the development of the brand based on the experience of the best brands in the world. Considerations are based on secondary sources, from national and international journals, books, magazines and specialist reports, as well as were supported by research results of the most valuable brands in the world. Findings: The paper provides the insight of marketing activities, that may favor building brand value in the time of recession. It was suggested that recession may be a good time for some companies to invest in the brand. However, today’s competition conditions are forcing companies to used more modern marketing techniques in order to build a positive brand image. In addition, customers increasingly expect to be able to engage in brand and wish to influence its image.

Design/methodology/approach – The study obtains its exploratory purpose through quantitative method by asking Gen Y participants about their perceptions of 20 guerrilla advertisements in the questionnaires. Those advertisements and the advertising scales are selectively chosen from previous literature so that the results truthfully reflect the effects of guerrilla marketing under consumer perspective. Findings – The results show that, creativity, as a combination of novelty and relevance, has the strongest direct and indirect effect on WOM intention. Similarly, surprise factor, the claimed root philosophy of guerrilla marketing, is confirmed when it also impacts directly and indirectly consumer behaviour. Message credibility plays a meaningful mediation role, and through this, message clarity manifests its indirect influence on WOM. Originality/value – The study supports the belief that guerrilla marketing is suitable for any business because of its effectiveness and efficiency. More significantly, the awareness of Gen Y consumers of the advertisements, with or without knowing that these ads belong to guerrilla advertising, strengthens the expectation that guerrilla marketing in general and guerrilla advertising in particular are recommended choices when they reflect what common marketing and advertising should be. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Guerrilla advertising; Guerrilla marketing; Message credibility; Word of mouth",""

Design/methodology/approach: Using a convenience sampling approach, researchers hand delivered 400 questionnaires to undergraduate students at one large private university and one major public university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Findings: The results showed that consumers’ intention to pirate digital products was strongly influenced by consumers’ attitude towards digital piracy. Interestingly, fear of legal consequences and perceived likelihood of punishment were not significant predictors of consumers’ attitude towards digital piracy. This suggests that the principles of deterrence theory have a limited impact on consumers’ attitudes in Indonesia.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors focus on automobiles as the target product category and conduct consumer surveys in three Asian countries – China, Japan, and South Korea – and the USA. Since these four countries are the major global production bases and consumption markets, the authors can examine the reciprocal effects of COO across countries. The authors propose a hierarchical conjoint analysis and estimate parameters. For the attributes of conjoint analysis, the authors incorporate both the COO of products and other functional aspects such as price and fuel consumption to compare their effects on consumer evaluation. Findings – The authors find different tendencies in each country’s COO effect. Further, the authors discuss the factors affecting consumer evaluation in each country based on the country’s culture and general product images. Originality/value – The authors’ contributions to the literature are as follows. First, in the research design, the authors incorporate COO information as an attribute of automobiles. This enables us to compare the COO effect with the effects of other functional aspects. The authors find that the COO effect is substantially the same as the effect of other functional attributes. Second, the authors assume a hierarchical structure in the conjoint analysis and discuss the different preferences in each country. This hierarchical structure enables to extract the reciprocal effects of COO across countries. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer perception; Country image; Country of origin; New product development",""

Design/methodology/approach: In measuring the PSS, the prominent preferred supplier enablers (PSEs) were identified and were broadly categorized under manufacturer’s interest component, common interest component and supplier’s characteristic component. These PSEs were further analyzed by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, Euclidean distance measurement and grey relation analysis methods. In order to demonstrate the application and utility of the proposed approach, a case study conducted in an Indian automotive component manufacturing company has been presented. Findings: By applying the proposed methodology in a case company, the PSSs of five of its key suppliers were measured and then the suppliers’ characteristic scores were determined. Based on these scores, a preferential status plot of the suppliers was developed. Through the status plot, the manufacturer was suggested with whom the proposed initiatives can be productive and with whom the manufacturer has to appeal for improvement strategies. Research limitations/implications: Since the methodology was tried in the Indian manufacturing environment, the emphasis laid on the PSEs and in turn the measurement of PSS may not address the concern at large. Practical implications: Measuring PSS would not only earn competitive advantages for the manufacturers but also facilitate the evolution of competitive suppliers. Originality/value: Measuring PSS along the time would assist a manufacturer to effectively manage the preferences given to its suppliers and thereby enhance the supply base contribution in the value addition process. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Logistics operations and management; Procurement and purchasing management; Supplier selection; Supply chain management",""

Design/methodology/approach – The system dynamics (SD) model shows the business results of a Myanmar mobile operator under two different scenarios, one in which the focus is on time-to-market, and the other in which the focus is on coopetition. Findings – An operator motivated by time-to-market advantage expects better margins by capturing market share ahead of competition. However, when every operator follows this individual agenda, its time-to-market benefit depends on whether it is actually faster than competition. In contrast, coopetition eliminates costs by design and provides assured margin improvements. Practical implications – The paper establishes that coopetition has a clear economic rationale. Adopting coopetition improves the business case of the mobile operator and helps it to contribute to the socio-economic development of Myanmar. Originality/value – The paper applies SD modelling, which is under-represented in marketing, to a study on coopetition in the mobile industry, in the context of Myanmar, a market which is rarely studied in marketing research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperation; Coopetition; Mobile diffusion; Myanmar; New markets",""

Design/methodology/approach: Broadly 13 critical success factors (CSFs) were identified and they were classified into four significant categories (SCs). Featuring these SCs and CSFs under each SC, GTA was proposed for evaluating the implementation performance of SD programs. The analysis was further extended to evaluate the performance of a SD program along the timeline to capture the other influences (if any), eventually compare the results with different performance situations and accordingly set the future targets. Findings: In order to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach it was applied to an Indian manufacturing company. The results obtained shown that there has been a significant growth achieved in the implementation performance of a SD program over a period of three years (i.e. 12 quarters) along the chosen SCs and CSFs under each SC.

Design/methodology/approach – Hierarchical cluster analysis was used on the sample of 156 firms on the basis of their mix of customer-, entrepreneurial-, and IT- orientation. Then, analysis of variance was used to compare the groups’ NPD capability (NPDCAP), NPD process efficiency (NPDPROC), new product effectiveness (NPEFF), and new product financial performance (NPPERF). Findings – Of the seven strategy configurations posited, four emerge and two unexpected configurations are revealed. Overall, firms simultaneously pursuing multiple strategic orientations have higher NPDCAP, NPEFF, and NPPERF. Interestingly, all six strategy groups have equally low levels of NPDPROC. Practical implications – To enhance NPDCAP and NPD performance, managers should consider more complex strategy configurations that act in complementary ways, in particular, customer-orientation complemented by either entrepreneurial- and/or IT-orientation. Moreover, more attention is needed to improving NPDPROC, as achieving gains in this area would contribute positively to firm performance. Originality/value – This study presents initial evidence that, at least for firms in Thailand, resources must be configured by pursuing several strategic orientations simultaneously to enhance their dynamic capabilities in NPD, a strategic issue that has not been given much attention in previous literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dynamic capabilities; Emerging market; New product development capability; Strategic orientation; Thailand",""

Therefore, the particular side of a dyadic relationship that researchers choose to study matters in an unbalanced dependence relationship. Practical implications – Managers, depending on their side, should pay close attention to perceptual differences and their consequences and deliberately employ different strategies to ensure effective channel management. Originality/value – Do differences in parties’ perceptions of dependence influence channel performance? If they do, how do these perceived differences exert direct and indirect impacts? By answering these questions, the authors contribute not only to an understanding of the unique nature of dyadic channel relationships but also to methodological notions about whether to study one side in a dyad. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","B2B marketing; Channel relationships; Marketing in China",""

In addition to offering innovative services, hypermarket managers must also pay attention to customer shopping patterns and behaviors in order to gain market share. The purpose of this paper is to posit that there will be significant differences between male and female hypermarket customers in terms of both shopping time and categories of goods purchased. Design/methodology/approach: To investigate actual shopping behaviors, this study observed customers in hypermarkets and recorded how long they spent shopping and what they purchased. Findings: The results of this study implied that gender is a key factor that affects both shopping time and the goods purchased in Taiwanese hypermarkets. The empirical findings also indicated that customers favor certain goods categories. Practical implications: The results of this study provide details of the differences between male and female hypermarket customers, with which managers can use to develop better marketing strategies. Originality/value: The purpose of this study is to show hypermarket retailers how gender differences affect customer behavior in this context. It also presents a consumer product categories list for hypermarkets, and this can be used as a reference for follow-up studies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gender; Hypermarket; Marketing planning; Retail; Shopping behaviour; Shopping time",""

Design/methodology/approach – From survey data drawn from 206 South Korean and 218 US respondents, structural equation modeling is used to test the posited hypotheses. Findings – To extrinsic superstitious beliefs, both the South Korean and US models support the subjective happiness through self-esteem path and the anthropomorphism path; from these beliefs, both models support the horoscope importance path and the behavioral superstitious beliefs path. Only the US model supports the path from self-esteem to extrinsic superstitious beliefs, and only the South Korean model supports the path from intrinsic religiosity to extrinsic superstitious beliefs. Research limitations/implications – South Korean and US student data may limit generalizability. As effect sizes in this context are established, researchers have a benchmark for future quantitative superstition research. Practical implications – By further understanding antecedents and consequences of superstitious beliefs, marketers are in a better position to appeal to targeted customers. Anthropomorphism and intrinsic religiosity, not fully studied by marketing scholars, show promise as segmentation variables related to consumers’ attitudes and behaviors. Social implications – To avoid unethical practice, marketers must limit themselves to innocuous superstition cues.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey involving 107 SMEs was conducted to examine the research model and hypotheses. Findings – First, cloud service trust is found to have a significant positive effect on the SMEs’ cloud service transformation intention. The second finding is about significant influences of technological drivers (reliability and information security), environmental drivers (institutional pressure, structure assurance, and vendor scarcity) and entrepreneurship on SMEs’ cloud service trust. Further, the authors found mediating effects of trust on relationships between external drivers and cloud service transformation. Practical implications – For vendors, it suggests building cloud service trust by distinguishing advantages of their cloud service and by establishing strategic alliances with existing users in marketing to attract potential clients. Vendors should target entrepreneurial organizations as initial customers and then expand to other types of organizations. For users, the study implies the need of cultivating entrepreneurship, if they have innovative IT initiatives and need to speed up the IT innovation absorption. Market regulators can provide adequate structural assurances and survival-of-the-fittest market mechanism to stimulate cloud service market. Originality/value – This study is on the leading edge of systematically investigating drivers for SMEs’ cloud service transformation and further reveals a mediating process, in which technological and environmental aspects have primary effects on cloud service trust that sequentially influences cloud service transformation.

"Service quality and customers’ behavioural intentions: Class and mass banking and implications for the consumer and society","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944878816&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2015-0025&partnerID=40&md5=c234a9f59b6f60d338b1dc9c1e95fa2a","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how the different dimensions of service quality influence customers’ behavioural intentions in the private and public sector banks, that is, in class and mass banking, respectively, and the implications for the service provider, consumer, society and consumer policy. Design/methodology/approach – A contextually modified SERVQUAL instrument was used to capture customers’ perceptions of service quality followed by exploratory factor analysis to study the dimensionality of service quality in retail banking. Multiple regression was used to probe the influence of the dimensions of service quality on customers’ behavioural intentions. Findings – The study revealed four dimensions of service quality in retail banking, namely, customer-orientedness, reliability, tangibles and convenience and showed that the service quality factor customer-orientedness comprising of the responsiveness and attitude of employees is most important in influencing customers’ behavioural intentions in the case of private sector banks and reliability of the service is most influential in the case of public sector banks. Research limitations/implications – Future research can focus on “service excellence” being extended beyond assessment of the quality of services, towards evaluation of the quality of life outcomes, to which public organizations contribute, appraisal of the quality of public governance processes and quality of performance in meeting social objectives. Practical implications – Retail bank managers must realize the importance of employees providing competent, reliable service in the case of public sector banks and their responsiveness and behaviour towards customers in the case of private sector banks, as the keys to foster a culture of service excellence. Social implications – High-quality financial consumer policy must not only be able to increase customer satisfaction with financial services but also build security and trust in public administration through transparent processes and accountability. In this context, with public agencies being regarded as service providers and citizens as customers, the concept of quality must also visualize public agencies as catalysts of a responsible and active civic society. Originality/value – This study explores the relationship between service quality and customers’ behavioural intentions in the private and public sector banks by linking both constructs at their dimensional level. It highlights major implications for the service provider, society, consumer and public policy based on the different needs, characteristics and requirements of customers of class and mass banking, that is, private and public sector banks. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intentions; Consumer and policy implications; Private sector banks; Public sector banks; Service quality; Society",""
"Strategic marketing in times of recession versus growth: New Zealand manufacturers","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942034272&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2014-0155&partnerID=40&md5=a2ff2d0d524c328af1cca88168520333","Purpose – On the basis of lessons gleaned from previous research into successful strategic marketing practices in times of both recession and growth, and in the face of an ongoing post-global financial crisis “hangover” characterised by unpredictable trading conditions both worldwide and in the Asia-Pacific region, the purpose of this paper is to provide insights and advice for marketing strategists within New Zealand’s manufacturing sector. Design/methodology/approach – The inquiry is based on two point-in-time mail surveys, one during recessionary conditions and the other during favourable economic conditions, with similar samples of 427 and 272 New Zealand manufacturers, respectively. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS and sought to compare and contrast successful strategic marketing decision making between the two time-points. Findings – The results confirm that, irrespective of prevailing economic circumstances, basic strategic marketing plays a pivotal role in facilitating the competitive success of New Zealand manufacturers. However, with the notable exception of three “evergreen” practices – targeting selected market segments, competing on the basis of value-to-the-customer, and finding new ways to do business – the results also suggest that different economic conditions otherwise necessitate quite different priorities for success at each stage of the strategic marketing decision-making process. Research limitations/implications – Due to relatively low-response rates, the extent to which the study samples are representative of the population under scrutiny remains unknown. Also, since an identical questionnaire was administered at two time-points ten years apart, differences in the respondents’ interpretation of certain questions and some of the marketing vocabulary and terminology used cannot be ruled out. Practical implications – The research highlights the important contribution that strategic marketing makes to the achievement of competitive success in New Zealand’s manufacturing sector. It also identifies some of the underlying “key drivers” that best predict successful strategic marketing decision making in times of recession compared with growth, thereby indicating a number of key lessons for marketing strategists. Originality/value – This study addresses a number of gaps in the empirical marketing literature. Although many previous studies have shown various strategic marketing activities to be critical to competitive success, few have examined it as a multi-step decision-making process and none have done so in the context of New Zealand manufacturing. Nor have previous studies sought to compare and contrast effective strategic marketing decision-making set against the background of contrasting economic circumstances. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive success; Manufacturing firms; Recession; Strategic marketing",""

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Practitioners from banking and gambling industries offered their cutting-edged analysis and viewpoints with scholars’ observation. Findings – Macroeconomic and political factors in China are the principal direct cause of Macau’s gambling revenue decline in 2014, implicating the vulnerability and unsustainability associated with the VIP business model of gambling industry. Although Macau continues to face challenges since late 2014, the prospect of Macau gambling industry is still optimistic in the long term, as there are emerging positive catalysts which will boost demand.

For this purpose, the study empirically examines whether global Japanese brands (e.g. Toyota) are perceived as global or Japanese by consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys were conducted with Korean consumers for their evaluations of Japanese automobile brands with varying degrees of globalness. As for brands, the study divides Japanese brands into two groups – those with high brand globalness and those with low brand globalness – and to examine if Japanese-origin effects differ between these two groups. Findings: In contrast to the hypothesis, global brands were found to be more subject to country-of-origin effects. Research limitations/implications: The findings contribute to research on consumer choices and brand globalness by showing country-of-origin effects for global brands. Practical implications: The findings suggest that even when Asian firms emphasize the globalness of their brands, they may still need to attend to country-of-origin effects.

Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review was adapted to identify the impediments and challenge themes from 1,081 studies available on the Australian rail industry. To select the studies relevant to the research question, a tollgate criterion was then deployed. Impediments were identified by a structured data synthesis process and a heuristic algorithm was developed to explore the possible relationships between the impediments and challenges. Findings – Four major themes are apparent, each of which presents the rail industry with challenges in the non-bulk freight market. “Infrastructural inefficiencies and the need for further integration” was ranked as the main rail industry challenge, while “environmental concerns and the associated costs of externalities” was the least. In addition, across the four themes data synthesis identified 43 impediments from purely policy related to technical and operational aspects. Research limitations/implications – The major implication of this review is the identification of impediments that have no linkage to the four industry challenges as revealed by stakeholders in the literature. That means that the rail industry has been dealing with a number of issues that have not been explored and studied in depth either by practitioners or academics. The underlying elements of impediments in this group are perceived as managerial, organisational and leadership factors. The rail industry has failed to manage its organisational ties across the system, both horizontally and vertically. This issue has been intensified as the result of complex interactions between different transport modes and operators associated with the non-bulk freight sector. Originality/value – For the first time in the Australian context, this study provides an en masse and summarised picture of impediments to the competitiveness of the rail industry in the non-bulk freight market by systematically reviewing the reports generated by different stakeholders in the last ten years. The outcomes will assist the rail industry and government to understand impediments impacting on the quality of rail freight services that may lead to collaboration on decision-making and investment strategies. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Logistics management policy; Transport economics",""
"Corporate rebranding and brand preference: Brand name attitude and product expertise as moderators","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946404706&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-10-2013-0120&partnerID=40&md5=6d19e6f5dddfa5c5db8f23e9360c30c7","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating roles of brand name attitude and product expertise on the impact of different corporate rebranding strategies on consumer brand preference. Rebranding strategies include evolutionary and revolutionary rebranding strategies, while brand name attitude is consumer attitude towards a firm’s original brand name and consumer product expertise refers to the consumer knowledge related to the brand’s product or service. Design/methodology/approach – A 2×2 factorial experimental design is used to examine the proposed hypotheses. In total, 220 undergraduates from a public university in Taipei of Taiwan participate in the experiment. Findings – The findings indicate that given brand repositioning is preferable, the use of evolutionary rebranding strategies is superior in enhancing consumer brand preference in the case of pleasant original brand name attitude, while the use of revolutionary strategies is superior when consumers hold less pleasant attitude. In addition, expert consumers show similar responses towards the two rebranding strategies, whereas evolutionary strategies seem to be more effective than revolutionary ones in enhancing consumer brand preferences in the case of novice consumers. Research limitations/implications – A convenient sampling method was employed and undergraduate students were the research subjects. Besides, a fictitious brand was used in the experiment design. As a result, the generalisability and applicability of the current research findings should be considered and carried out with cautions. Practical implications – The findings of the research provide empirical understanding on the use of rebranding strategies to generate higher levels of brand preference under contingencies, thus helping brand managers apply a more appropriate type of rebranding strategies when necessary. Originality/value – The current study is the preliminary causal-oriented work to provide guidance with appropriate rebranding strategies under the contingencies of consumers’ original brand name attitude and product expertise. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand attitude; Brand preference; Corporate rebranding; Product expertise; Repositioning",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore the xenocentric behavior in the consumer sphere to explain why some consumers have a bias for foreign products even when domestic ones are qualitatively similar or better. As the Chinese economy has experienced more than three decades of near double-digit growth and increased openness to foreign products, it is important to examine phenomena related to the formation of Chinese attitudes toward foreign products with the rising tensions between the seemingly irreversible globalization and Chinese re-awakening nationalism. Design/methodology/approach – This study is based on a review of the extant literature and focus groups in three cities in China. Findings – This study has found that consumer xenocentrism (CX) is prevalent in China, especially among the new emerging wealthy classes, younger consumers, and the local elite. It appears that Chinese consumers are psychologically or sociologically orientated or predisposed toward foreign (Western) goods. The findings from this study suggest that both consumer ethnocentrism and CX are possible or even expected. The short review of Chinese history presented here has shown that these phenomena can be explained by traditional in-group/out-group theories. Specifically, when there are too many xenocentrics, national esteem is threatened and this prompts many individuals to become more ethnocentric. Research limitations/implications – This study is based on the literature and focus groups data, hence, the findings are not intended to be generalizable. Practical implications – The findings from this study should be of interest to business practitioners and policy makers. Social implications – The historical and cultural perspectives taken in this study indicate that understanding consumers’ xenocentric behavior entails knowledge and deep understanding of how cultural values and contemporary social-political forces interplay within consumers’ formation and change of attitudes toward the choice of domestic and foreign products. Originality/value – This study shows that the ability of foreign products to meet the individual’s need or enhance his/her self-esteem more so than domestic products is indicative of something more than simply an international, cosmopolitan, or modern orientation. The fact that consumer foreign bias is found with both mundane and widely available products, expensive and inexpensive products, and conspicuous and non-conspicuous goods challenges the assumption that this phenomenon is simply traditional prestige-consumption behavior. Future research needs to be directed at measuring the CX construct and examine potential antecedents of such a behavior. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China market; Consumer culture; Consumer xenocentrism; Ethnocentrism; National identity; Political psychology",""
"How rural-urban identification influences consumption patterns?

This study proposes a theoretical model for consumer utility function (a combination of economic utility and social utility) which takes into account the choice of social identification. Design/methodology/approach – This study focusses on the influence of rural and urban identification on consumption patterns of Chinese migrant workers. These assumptions were verified based on a survey with 650 samples in Shanghai, one of the most developed cities in China. Findings – Results indicate that affirmative social identification has a significantly positive effect on the level of consumption for migrant workers. High level of rural identification has a more significant impact than urban identification on survival consumption including food, medicine and family support. On the other hand, high level of urban identification has a more significant impact than rural identification on development consumption including education for children, training and recreation. Besides, there are significant interaction effects between income and identity on consumption, which confirms the identity effect on classical economic model and is in line with identity economics’ arguments. Originality/value – This study outlines the importance of social identity in both economics and marketing domains and proposes a theoretical model which advances understanding of a model on similar lines proposed by Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000) and Benjamin et al. (2010). Empirical tests with Chinese migrant workers’ data present that their consumption patterns are influenced by their level of social identifications. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Social marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach: The authors derive a model containing the relationships between customer satisfaction (CS), brand image (BI), and CL through mediating effects of SC. Data collected from 200 subscribers of China Mobile was analysed using structural equation modelling technique. Findings: The authors find that SC does not mediate the relationship between CS and CL, nor that between BI and CL. While both CS and BI have a direct and positive relationship with CL, only CS is positively associated with the SC. SC in itself has no direct relationship with CL, necessitating further understanding of its role. Research limitations/implications: Prior findings have suggested the mediating role of SC, this study, however, show that SC does not have any mediating role in influencing CL. In fact, the direct role of SC is also questioned, as the authors do not find any direct relationship between SC and CL. Practical implications: While managers should retain a balanced strategy for implementing SC, developing a strong BI and achieving CS is more important, and could help avoid any negative implications that may ensue from the implementation of SC. Originality/value: This paper offers empirical evidence of the importance of SC – or rather lack of it – in enhancing CL. It also helps explain how SC interacts with CS and BI. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand loyalty; Consumer loyalty; Consumer switching costs; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Marketing in China",""

Design/methodology/approach: The research is conducted in the context of the transition economy of Vietnam, using a combination of methods. Qualitative interviews are followed by a survey of 199 small firms in Hanoi, Vietnam. Since competitor concentration is count data, Poisson regression is used to test the relationship between networking, customer acceptance, and competitor concentration. Findings: The results show that locating in a competitor concentration area improves customer acceptance of the firm’s offerings and increases networking with competitors, while decreasing networking with government officials. Competitor concentration does not help improve firm performance. Research limitations/implications: A sample of 199 businesses in the food, furniture, and jewelry sectors in Hanoi may not be representative of all private businesses in Vietnam. The use of cross-sectional data could not establish causational relationships among variables. Practical implications: Small firms in transition economies should be aware of the trade-offs between initial customer acceptance and negative consequences of being in a competitor concentrated area. Thus, once the firm’s offerings are generally accepted by customers, the firm may consider moving out of competitor concentration areas to expand and differentiate. Originality/value: This paper points out that in the absence of effective market institutions, businesses want to be located near a concentration of similar firms as a means of gaining initial customer acceptance. This initial acceptance does not necessarily help firms improve business performance beyond the firm’s survival. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitor concentration; Customer acceptance; Networking with competitors; Networking with government officials; Vietnam",""

A set of performance indicators of Thailand’s transportation infrastructure is proposed and gathered. The relationship between existing transportation infrastructure performance and Thailand’s economy is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The framework for determining Transportation Infrastructure Performance Index (TPI), proposed by the US Chamber of Commerce, is adapted for assessing the efficiency of Thailand’s transportation infrastructure. The analytical hierarchy process is employed in the process of constructing Thailand TPI. The relationship between TPI and Thailand’s economic growth is examined using multiple regression analysis. Findings: The performance of Thailand’s transportation infrastructure had been continuously increased from 19.69 in 2005 to 61.52 in 2010. Great emphasis on improvement of the transportation infrastructure system should be placed as an increase in one unit of TPI results in the improvement by Baht449.420 of Thailand’s GDP per capita. Research limitations/implications: The most critical issue arisen in the data collection process is the unavailability of data for some indicators in the TPI framework. Consequently, some indicators that contain insufficient data were excluded. Practical implications: The proposed set of indicators is practical and instrumental in assessing the transportation infrastructure performance of Thailand, and investigating its relationship with the economy. Originality/value: This research proposes a framework for quantifying the performance of transportation infrastructure, and develops the first national composite index to account for the overall performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Logistics management policy; Performance evaluation and measurement",""

"Managing shopping experience through mall attractiveness dimensions: An experience of Indian metro cities","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988372494&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-08-2015-0127&partnerID=40&md5=1281a64fa9a32c9240dc900da5833c88","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand the dimensions of mall attractiveness for Indian shoppers from the metro cities of New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai; and subsequently investigate the effect of these dimensions on shoppers’ mall experience. Design/methodology/approach: A shopper intercept survey was conducted in the aforementioned cities and 400 responses were obtained which were analysed with exploratory factor analysis and stepwise regression. Findings: The results indicate that tenant management, facilities management, atmospherics and entertainment potential are the factors which attract shoppers to malls. Tenant management, facilities management and atmospherics also emerge as significant predictors of mall shopping experience. Research limitations/implications: Due to limited resources, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the derived factors and hypothesized relationships further. Practical implications: Contemporary retail settings have transited to offer holistic experiences, generated out of tenant mix, facilities and atmospherics. Managers of shopping malls can enhance their mall attractiveness by identifying an optimal mix of factors such as crowd management, tenant variety, parking, etc. as seen in the results of this study. Entertainment emerges as a mall attractiveness dimension but not as a significant predictor of shopping experience which shows that Indian shoppers’ inclination towards hedonism is still in elementary stages and economic pursuit continues to be a dominant motivator for visiting a mall. Originality/value: This paper attempts to provide a holistic overview of mall attractiveness dimensions in India and its implications for shopping experiences. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","India; Mall attractiveness; Mall shopping experience; Organized retail; Shopping behaviour; Stepwise regression",""

The authors examine the role of distributor satisfaction in mediating the association between market orientation in distribution and return on assets. Design/methodology/approach – Market orientation in distribution was measured by distributor orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination. Findings – Results showed that the positive relationship between market orientation in distribution and distributor satisfaction was strongly supported. While distributor orientation and competitor orientation were both positively related to distributor satisfaction and return on assets, interfunctional coordination was not related to either distributor satisfaction or return on assets. However, interfunctional coordination lessened the positive relationship between distributor orientation and distributor satisfaction.

"Consumer susceptibility to credit card misuse and indebtedness","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946407931&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2013-0110&partnerID=40&md5=b17c9262fe0dfd6d994cf4c3405545c6","Purpose – Prior research suggests that payment mechanisms are imbued with cues that affect purchase evaluation and future spending behavior. Credit cards are distinguished from other payment mechanisms as they elicit greater willingness to spend, prompt weaker recollections of past credit expenses and overvaluation of available funds – a phenomena the authors call as “credit card effect.” Little is known about the individuals’ differential exposure to the credit card effect. The purpose of this paper is to present a new concept and measure of susceptibility to the credit card misuse and indebtedness (SCCMI). Design/methodology/approach – The study focussed on young credit card users (aged 18-25) from Malaysia, Singapore, and the UK as they represent varying levels of credit card issuance and consumer protection regulations. The authors conducted confirmatory factor analysis and invariance tests to assess the validity, reliability and parsimony of the proposed scale in the three countries. Further, the authors examined the prediction power of SCCMI on consumer tendency to become a revolving credit card debtor. Findings – Results show that the SCCMI scale is valid, reliable and parsimonious across the multi-country context. The paper provided additional validity support through known-group comparison among various payers of credit card bills. Research limitations/implications – The convenience sampling used for the study is the main limitation. The findings bear important implications for more socially responsible marketing practice and better public policies in credit carder regulation for protecting young credit card users. Practical implications – The new concept and measurement scale can be used for identifying the vulnerable individuals in credit card use, assisting consumer knowledge training, improving policies for credit card regulation, and helping credit card providers in socially responsible marketing practice. Social implications – The cross-country validity of the SCCMI scale provides a unique contribution for monitoring and auditing consumer vulnerability in credit card misuse in Asian and European market conditions. Originality/value – SCCMI offers an original concept that is distinct from previous research in that SCCMI focusses solely on the state of likelihood to commit credit card abuse rather than the behavioral manifestations of credit card misuse. SCCMI provides a new tool for marketers and public policy makers for ethically responsible credit card marketing and regulation to protect youths’ benefits. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer vulnerability; Credit card; Debt; Measurement scale; Susceptibility",""

Design/methodology/approach – An experimental method and a partial least square approach were adopted. Hypotheses were tested on data collected across 665 Chinese consumers. Findings – Results demonstrate that TOO exerts a positive impact on perceived product authenticity, which in turn leads to stronger consumers’ self-brand connections. In addition, compared with country of origin (COO) information, TOO has a unique positive impact on perceived authenticity and a direct positive effect on consumers’ self-brand connections. Also, the positive impact of TOO on perceived authenticity is enhanced through consumers’ familiarity with the TOO and through congruence between the product category and the TOO. Research limitations/implications – One possible outcome of TOO (perceived authenticity) and one product category (lavender soap) were considered in this study. Originality/value – Given the diminishing relevance of COO associations, this study demonstrates that TOO is an appealing alternative strategy for strengthening brand equity. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Congruence; Familiarity; Perceived authenticity; Self-brand connection; Territory of origin",""
"Export barriers and business confidence: A quasi-longitudinal examination","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931043718&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2014-0032&partnerID=40&md5=e0aaeec728d62be02b234f8efc44cbd9","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of export barriers at two different points in time, 1995 (t0) and 2010 (t1), respectively. Using “confidence” as a surrogate for affect, the study proposes an inverse relationship between affect and export barrier intensity with the influence of export barriers increasing as exporter confidence subsides. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws two random probabilistic samples (1995/2010) of New Zealand’s SME exporters, from the same working population, using an identical survey instrument. Preliminary analysis combines exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The research proposition is tested using binary logistic regression. Findings – The results found that the influence of export barriers changes substantially across time. There was support for the proposition in that the 2010 sample of exporters were two to nine times more likely to consider export barriers influential than the 1995 group. Such evidence was particularly strong in the context of logistics and distribution factors, internal resource constraints, trade-related barriers, home market factors and currency and payments obstacles. Practical implications – This research suggests managerial evaluation of the prevailing business atmosphere, as captured by exporter’s confidence, can influence perception of export barriers. Specifically, barriers tend to be evaluated as influential when there is a sense of pessimism within the export sector. Thus over time export barrier influence can be traced to the manager’s evaluation of export prospects as opposed to the frequently researched organizational and internationalization variables. Originality/value – This is the first study to use theory to predict and empirically test the change in export barrier influence across time. While the majority of export barrier research adopts the cognitive or “objective-verifiable” view, the study supports the contention that export barrier influence can also be understood in the context of the emotive or “subjective-moot” perspective. Additionally, export managers should adopt long-term orientation towards exports while policymakers are encouraged (contrary to mainstream research) to move from targeted export support programs to inclusive or mass market approaches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Export marketing; International business; International marketing; Internationalization; SME marketing",""
"Matching volatile demand with transportation services in Vietnam: A case study with Gemadept","2016","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950335989&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-05-2015-0079&partnerID=40&md5=a16461ab02b0433a7ce64728b68d88dc","Purpose – Demand for retail transportation is typically volatile, and it is driven by the end of period (month) spiky deliveries. This is especially the case in emerging markets. The purpose of this paper is to examine situation in one of the leading Vietnamese logistics service company with numerous customers within the area of Ho Chi Minh City. Design/methodology/approach – Research work is based on a case study within a company called Gemadept, who is providing logistics services in Vietnam. Researchers were given access to the company data on distribution system, and the authors had collected daily data from transportation operations. Findings – Considerable truck utilization can be achieved even with volatile retail demand environment if optimization is applied to allocate trucks and drivers on certain routes and customer demand points. Relaxing service level of customers shall improve situation further, but not significantly. However, from logistics service point of view, it would be best to use numerous shifts per day (night shift option) to distribute products – this would enable high utilization of distribution fleet while overcoming spiky demand. Research limitations/implications – Analyses are dependent on a single case study of one logistics service provider in Vietnam. While this may limit the findings to some extent, but with rich case data and observations within the company distribution system, it provides the required depth to build an optimized model for the company. Practical implications – In volatile demand environment, it is important to allocate trucks and drivers as well as work schedule in a systematic order, and not based on trial-and-error human intervened timetable. System perspective also enables evaluation of different strategies and their implications on performance. Originality/value – Research work represents one of the seminal studies of Vietnamese retail logistics sector, and verifies that demand uncertainty is high in such environment in addition to exhibiting the end of period demand spikes (hockey stick effect). © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Distribution; Retailer; Transportation; Vietnam",""

Design/methodology/approach – The proposed model comprises two parts. The first part identifies suitable criteria for evaluating international express supplier by reviewing studies from 1989 to 2009, after which the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to determine the relative weights of the criteria. The second part adopts grey relational analysis to extract five priority managing strategies from which 16 strategies are developed based on three concern factors derived from the first part. Findings – The results show customers’ top three concerns when selecting international express companies. In addition, the results show the five priority strategic suggestions to international express suppliers. Research limitations/implications – The research has two major limitations. First, this study was conducted using a sample of companies operating in Taiwan. Thus, other countries such as Japan and South Korea should be examined in future research. Second, this study focuses on the application of fuzzy AHP techniques to identify key selection criteria and service strategies of international express suppliers. Other important aspects, such as performance evaluation and performance prediction in the selection of international express suppliers, were not involved in this study because of the limited research scope.

Design/methodology/approach – To do this, the author classified console game series into four categories on the basis of their sales, identified a singular case that corresponds to each category, and presented a performance calculation model that approximates variation in sales for the first and second titles of each series. Findings – Coupled with the results generated by the performance models a comparison of each game series showed that although word-of-mouth and backward serialization may influence sales performance for the first title in a console game series, sales of the second title in the series were most heavily influenced by forward serialization and advertising. The author further found that word-of-mouth via social networks was unlikely to affect the sales performance of a series’ second title. Research limitations/implications – The sales of first title video game console series permit the forecasting and evaluation of the sales’ second title performance through the performance calculation model incorporating the advertising, word-of-mouth, and serialization effect and vice versa. Originality/value – Taken together, these results demonstrate that the affordances of social networking can be used to improve sales performance for the first title in a series, and the use of backward serialization for subsequent titles could incite the purchase of over a million copies of the game(s). © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bass model; System dynamics",""

The paper also assesses the influence of religiosity on support intention (SI). The impact of customers’ perceptual reaction to the credibility of social enterprises’ advertising is also measured to assess its influence on SI. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 214 completed questionnaires from online and offline surveys were analysed using several statistical analyses, including structural equation modelling, to assess the effects of the independent variables on SI. Findings - The study found that customers’ socioeconomic status and religiosity have no significant influence on their intention to channel their donations via Islamic social enterprises. It is the social enterprises’ advertising which significantly influences their SI. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on an Islamic research context of social entrepreneurship. Thus, the results cannot be generalised directly to the non-Islamic social entrepreneurship context. Practical implications - Findings of the study suggest that organisations should develop effective communication strategies through advertising to highlight organisational credibility as it plays an important role in shaping customers’ attitudes and intentions. Originality/value - The study investigates the effects of marketing on customers’ SI.

Design/methodology/approach – The study surveyed continuing manufacturing exporters from New Zealand (n=118) using an electronic method. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationships among the groups of predictors and three types of measures. Findings – The results found that strategic factors (encapsulating RC) were strong predictors of both export intensity (EI) and export intensity growth, followed by export barriers (representing PV). Conversely, firm factors (representing an amalgamation of SCP and RBV variables) generated lower explanatory power in predicting export performance. Regarding measures of export performance, EI carried the highest efficacy. Practical implications – This research suggests export performance depends primarily on deliberate strategic initiatives (RC) (regarding, products, markets and approaches to order generation), and implicitly challenges the resource and natural selection based advantages inherent in firm factors.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 220 valid questionnaires were collected from employees in the Malaysian media industry to examine the goodness of model fit, sign indeterminacy, measurement model, and structural relationships between constructs. Using partial least squares (PLS) path modelling, this study introduces a full-fledged structural equation modelling approach by applying ADANCO 1.1 advanced composite modelling and SmartPLS 3.2.3. PLS-multi-group analysis is applied to examine the heterogeneity of data and test the hypotheses on moderating variables. Findings: Payment, promotion, supervision, operating conditions, co-workers, and nature of the work were found to be conducive to employees’ job performance, among which co-workers generated the highest path coefficient followed by operating conditions, payment, and promotion. Hypotheses on the relationships between fringe benefits, contingent rewards, communication, and job performance were rejected. Age, gender, and level of education were found as moderators to the relationship between facets of job satisfaction and employees’ job performance. Practical implications: The results of importance-performance map analysis can help managers and decision makers to prioritize their actions. The findings show that co-workers and operating conditions have the highest importance and payment and contingent rewards have the highest performance on job performance in the media industry.

Specifically, the research purpose is to determine the effects of new product success factors on the measures of company export performance, namely export sales, export growth and export profitability. Design/methodology/approach – The study examines the new product success factors, discriminating successful new products from unsuccessful ones in international markets. A pre-tested structured questionnaire is employed for collecting data from the companies. The population frame consists of exporting manufacturing companies and was determined from the records of the Export Promotion Centre of Turkey (IGEME). Of the 250 questionnaires sent out, 116 were completed and returned yielding a response rate of 46.4 percent. The study analysed data from 202 new product projects. Findings – The research determined that various new product success factors have different levels of effect on company performance in international markets, mainly measured in terms of sales, market share and profitability. Specifically, it identified that pre-development and development activities, a large and fast-growing foreign market with huge demand, order of entry and large and well-executed advertising activities differentiate successful new products from unsuccessful ones. Product characteristics are, on the other hand, not found to be a strong factor differentiating successful new products from unsuccessful ones in international markets.

Design/methodology/approach – A modified SERVQUAL instrument was used to capture customers’ perceptions of service quality with a sample size of 1,152 customers. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to holistically evaluate the performance of the HEIs. Findings – The current research develops a scale for measuring service quality in the area of business management education and reinforces the fact that service quality is a multidimensional construct. It suggests that customers distinguish four dimensions of service quality in the case of the higher education industry in business management. TOPSIS analysis provides an effective framework for ranking competing HEIs holistically in terms of their overall performance with respect to multiple service quality factors. Research limitations/implications – Continued refinement of the scale for measuring service quality in higher education, proposed in this study, is certainly possible based on further research and trends in higher education. Practical implications – HEIs are finding themselves in an increasingly integrated competitive market. Consequently they are facing challenges due to the evaluation of the results of the services of education and training that they offer. In competitive environments, student perceptions of quality and their satisfaction level have become very important in order to attract and retain them. Identifying the underlying dimensions of service quality is the first step in the definition and provision of quality service and instilling of a customer-service culture. Having access to how consumers evaluate service quality in the higher educational sector in business management and evaluating the positions of the players in the market on service quality parameters, can help the organization to carry out its mission with more efficiency, aid in strategic planning and contend the initiatives that HEIs managers can take to enhance employees’ skills and attitudes and instill a culture of service excellence.

To address the research gaps, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of institutional pressures upon market orientation implementation in mainland China. Design/methodology/approach – Based on multiple case studies of four large B2B manufacturing firms, this paper presents a conceptual framework incorporating three kinds of institutional antecedents of market orientation. Then the developed framework is empirically tested and the impacts of antecedent factors are compared by a fully structured questionnaire survey of 235 Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings – The research findings indicate that during the market-oriented organizational change, normative and mimetic institutional pressures are important driving forces. In addition, the significant institutional antecedent factors are pressures arising from strategic partnership, system certification requirements, industry benchmarking, management consultation and intensive competition. Originality/value – This research is first of its kind as it probes into institutional antecedents of market orientation among Chinese firms by combining cross-case study and large-scale survey. It contributes greatly to the literature of market orientation and institutional theory, and also provides relevant managerial implications for firms as to how to improve market-orientation degree. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Institutional pressures; Institutional theory; Market orientation",""

Design/methodology/approach – A stratified, two-stage, cluster sampling procedure was applied to a list of high schools obtained from the Ministry of Education in Taiwan. A return rate of 80 per cent yielded 723 usable questionnaires, the data from which were analysed by the LISREL structural equation modelling software. Findings – The results suggest that both social worship and personal worship have a significant and positive impact on the intention to purchase music. However, personal worship has a negative impact on the intention to pirate music while social worship appears to strengthen it. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that idol worship is more complex than previously understood. The constructs chosen in this research should be seen only as a snapshot but other variables such as vanity trait, autonomy, romanticism or involvement are not taken into account. Future studies would benefit from inclusion of these variables and a wider geographical scope. Practical implications – The findings contain many implications to help marketing executives and planners better revise their existing marketing and communication strategies to increase their revenue. Originality/value – Existing research has tended to examine the impact of idol worship as a whole on the reduction of music piracy, but overlook the two-dimensional aspects of idol worship, hence ignoring the fact that many music firms have not properly utilised idol worship to deal with the challenges associated with music piracy. The findings broaden existing understanding about the causes of two different dimensions of idol worship and their different impacts on the intention to music piracy. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Music purchase and piracy; Parental norms; Peer norms; Personal worship; Social worship",""

Findings: Using the metaphor of kingdom to parallel the phenomenon of fandom, the research also explicates the importance of initial brand position, and the construction and expansion from the core castle – the core positioning of the human brand – to become a kingdom where devoted fans swear to be loyal to the human brand and cross-buy the derivative products of the latter. Five fan’s subgroup and a theoretical framework are obtained. Originality/value: The theoretical framework derived in this study explicates how consumers’ initial perceptions of the human brand are formed and reinforced and how they become different kinds of fans which in turn influence the strategies they take in the face of the expansion or withdraw of the human brand. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fandom; Human brand; Identification; Loyalty",""

This term focuses the analysis on how the elements of a practice are held together, rather than on what elements are involved in a practice. Design/methodology/approach – Inspired by grounded theory, an empirical research study on craftswomen and their practical creativity (between the hand and the head) was designed. Storytelling was used in order to elicit the verbalization of the craftswomen’s ways of knowing/doing, and the episodic interview was the technique employed to access and present the data. Findings – Formativeness can be described and interpreted as the effect of the following dimensions: the emergence of the object, the golden rule of realization, forming by hybridization, experimentation, playfulness, attachment to matter, and proper realization. Originality/value – The study’s contribution may be evaluated in relation to how a vocabulary for describing and interpreting knowing-in-practice is constructed.

Several researchers suggest using a theoretical approach to develop a much deeper insight into key marketing constructs such as service quality, customer perceived value, customer satisfaction, perceived switching costs, corporate image, and customer loyalty is of vital importance to the mobile communications market. This study aims to develop and test a comprehensive hierarchical model of these six important constructs. The model also incorporates the retailing function of a major mobile communication provider. Design/methodology/approach – The research sample of 516 was drawn from customers of one of the largest mobile communications service providers in China. The data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings – The results of the study support using a hierarchical and multidimensional approach for conceptualising and measuring customers’ perceptions of service quality in the mobile communications market. In addition, the findings illustrate that service quality is an important determinant of customer perceived value, customer satisfaction, corporate image, and perceived switching costs. Customer perceived value is also an antecedent of customer satisfaction. Corporate image, customer satisfaction, and perceived switching costs are three key drivers of customer loyalty. However, the findings also indicate that corporate image is not an important determinant of customer satisfaction and that customer perceived value is not a key driver of customer loyalty.

Effect of price discounts, gifts, coupons, and rebates offered by mall retailers to attract store traffic were examined. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through mall intercept technique in six cities across India. Convenience sampling method was used to target metropolitan and non-metropolitan cities for data collection. Findings – Results suggest that consumers’ attitude towards mall retailers’ promotional strategies is influenced by shopping values and price consciousness, deal proneness, and coupon proneness. Age, education, and income influence consumers’ attitude towards promotions. Research limitations/implications – Only three constructs of price perception scale were used for the research. Future research can include all the items of price perception scale to understand its applicability on Indian sample. Promotions offered by branded and non-branded retailers in malls were not examined. Practical implications – The findings can be useful to mall retailers for designing promotions to increase footfalls and sales. Promotions can be used by retailers to convey value and attract price conscious consumers. Retailers need to match their promotional offers according to price sensitivity and shopping motives of consumers. Originality/value – There is limited research to examine role of promotions used by mall retailers in attracting footfalls in Indian malls.

Games of limited-amount version are much more expensive. However, the value of games cannot be actually validated, while buyers purchase the intangible goods. This study, therefore, aims to empirically clarify the impact of product scarcity and uniqueness in buyers’ purchase of games of limited-amount version. Design/methodology/approach – Based on literature review, the survey method was conducted. Data of 204 respondents who recently bought games of limited-amount version were gathered and analyzed with partial least square. Findings – The results showed that perceived quality and perceived uniqueness, significantly increased by product scarcity, was shown of significant positive impact on perceived value which significantly enhanced purchase intention. Research limitations/implications – The results indicated the importance of high quality and the reflection of uniqueness in buyers’ purchase of games of limited-amount version. The results also validated the effect of scarcity on intangible goods. Practically, the results facilitated strategic operation and marketing of game producers and suppliers in designing and marketing game software. The results also facilitated further theoretical development of goods scarcity. Originality/value – Nowadays, product scarcity has been an important operation and marketing strategy to enterprises. Games are an industry of growing importance. However, the impact of scarcity in buyers’ purchase of games of limited-amount version was still limited.

This circumstance is coined as “multi-brand loyalty” (MBL). The present research tries to shade light on consumers’ motivation to become a multi-brand loyal by answering the research question: “why consumers become multi-brand loyal within a particular service category?” The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Four focus group discussions and 13 in-depth interviews were carried out to gain deeper insights regarding the drivers of MBL. Findings – The findings of this study suggest that “financial benefits”, “need for privacy”, “competitor’s attractive promotional campaign”, “public self-consciousness” and “availability of cheap handset and SIM card” are the most frequently cited reasons that can make mobile phone service users multi-brand loyal. In addition, the study reveals heterogeneity among consumers, i.e. along with “multi-brand loyals”, “sole-brand loyals”, “switchers” and “cross-buyers” also exist in the Malaysian mobile phone service market. Practical implications – These insights put forth the importance for managers of mobile phone service industry to be more cautious in formulating their retention strategies. Moreover, they will be aware of the complicated loyalty pattern of their consumers which will eventually guide them to consider different strategic moves for each different loyalty segments. Originality/value – Although the existence of MBL has been proven empirically, little attention is given to understand consumers’ motive to become a multi-brand loyal, particularly in the context of services.

Design/methodology/approach – Focus groups provided qualitative data from 509 counterfeit purchases incidents by 95 informants. Findings – The most frequently mentioned motivation was the utility (35 percent) received from the good over the genuine article. The second, but negative, motivation was the perceived risk involved in the purchase (22 percent), whether it is physical or social risk. Social norms, confusion, and ethical concerns each represented about 10 percent of the motivations toward the purchase of counterfeit items. The least mentioned motivations to purchase, at less than 4 percent each, were culture, habit, and desire to explore. These factors were evident across a variety of 15 product categories, headed by electronics, such as DVDs and computer software. Practical implications – Through targeting negative motivations, such as perceived physical and social risks, businesses can devise strategies from a demand side perspective to overcome the problem of counterfeit consumption. Originality/value – Qualitative responses, over many product categories, provide a unique overview to the perception of counterfeit consumption. The finding that consumer ethics may depend on whether the activity benefits the society as a whole is worthy of additional discussion. The authors learn that when consumers thought their counterfeit consumption caused little or no harm, they do not see much ethical concern in their actions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural psychology; Brand confusion; Consumer ethics; Counterfeit; Cultural influences; Perceived risk",""

Design/methodology/approach – In order to achieve the research objectives, a model is proposed. The literature review and formulation of hypotheses related to each construct are then discussed. Findings – The findings reveal that service quality is influenced by network quality, customer service, information support, privacy and security. Service quality in turn also impacts customer loyalty attributes, including satisfaction, value, trust and commitment. Satisfaction is a determinant of customer trust, whereas the direct relationship between value and customer commitment is not supported. Research limitations/implications – The model in this study was tested in the Thai ISP context which may be different in other service industries as well as in other countries. Practical implications – By enhancing service quality, firms can influence customers’ satisfaction, value, trust and commitment, which are critical for an ISP’s success and long-term sustainability.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects of firm-level (i.e. entry mode and firm size), country-level (i.e. market potential, country risk and openness) and cultural distance on successful market entry strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in a smaller emerging country (Thailand). Design/methodology/approach: Using archival data from 1996-2008 and a survey of 139 firms, the results reveal significant influence of both market potential and cultural distance on successful market entry. Findings: Overall, the findings demonstrate a cautionary approach when generalizing the results of studies focusing on large emerging markets to smaller emerging markets. Smaller emerging markets such as Thailand offer very different market-space than large emerging markets and therefore the overall determinants of success may differ substantially. Practical implications: Market potential appears to be the most significant variable in entering the Thai market. The findings also suggest a negative and significant relationship between cultural distance and market success in Thailand. This reveals that foreign firms that enter small emerging markets which are culturally close to their home countries can enjoy a greater possibility of success. Originality/value: This study is a first step towards sensitizing corporations and policy makers in understanding the differences in market entry success factors between larger and smaller emerging markets and strategizing accordingly. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Country risk; Cultural distance; Emerging markets; Market entry; Market potential; Multinational companies; Thailand",""

The purpose of this research is to identify the factors affecting mobile SNS users’ continuance intention. Design/methodology/approach – Data from an online survey administered to 228 mobile SNS users are used to test the research model through the use of structural equation modelling. Findings – The results show that flow, perceived usefulness and satisfaction determine continuance intention of mobile SNS. Moreover, the authors found that referent network size and perceived complementarity are the main factors affecting flow, whereas information quality is the main factor affecting perceived usefulness. Only system quality significantly affects satisfaction. Practical implications – The results imply that mobile service providers need to take the functional characteristics of the mobile SNS (e.g. system quality and information quality), network externalities (referent network size and perceived complementarity) and flow experience into consideration when encouraging users’ continuance intention towards mobile SNS. Originality/value – Extant research has focused on initial adoption and usage of mobile SNS and has seldom considered post-adoption usage, which is critical to mobile service providers’ success. This research tries to fill the gap by examining continuance intention to use mobile SNS. The theory embedded within the IS success model, network externalities and flow theory articulated that these three research domains can be integrated to better understand the factors that influence mobile SNS users’ continuance intention. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer retention; Information systems; Mobile communications",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected in a field experiment in Hong Kong using a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. Variables manipulated were topic sensitivity, use of FA, and response options. The dependent variables were eight specific motives which were obtained from responses to the survey participation inventory (SPI). Findings – Topic sensitivity has a significant influence on seven of the eight motives. The use of FA does not appear to affect motives. In contrast, the use of the response option “PNA” has a significant effect on all motives except “obligation”. The SPI appears to be a viable measure to the use with Hong Kong online panellists, and perhaps with other Asian and non-Western cultures/countries as well. Research limitations/implications – The present study tested only two specific topics, each with a specific level of sensitivity. Further research should apply the SPI to topics of varying levels of sensitivity. The present study used a sample of panel members. Future research could examine motivation for survey participation for use with off-line samples. Practical implications – There are differences in motivation for survey participation among panellists. The authors relate panellists’ motivation to topic sensitivity and confirm that panellists who answered questions about a sensitive topic were less motivated to participate in every motivational aspect, except for incentives. The authors find that the survey design feature of FA is largely unrelated to panellists’ motivation. Originality/value – This is one of the few studies that show the impact of topic sensitivity, FA, and response options on motives for responding.

This challenge is compounded by a range of additional factors including fluctuating, international economic conditions, an increasingly globalised, competitive environment, widespread provision of online qualifications, and high student drop-out rates. There is a pressing need therefore to understand the factors which contribute to positive perceptions of institutional services and the way in which these drive student retention, especially within the first year experience. This research aims to explore the role of affective commitment in students' perceived satisfaction within the student-university relationship and the effect of this on retention in an Australian tertiary context. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach was adopted using four focus groups and eight in-depth interviews with first year undergraduate students enrolled at a large metropolitan Australian university. In addition, an online expert forum was used to obtain qualitative verbatim from 22 internationally-based faculty educators. Findings – The results of this study suggest that the development of deeply entrenched emotional bonds with students is important in facilitating high levels of satisfaction during the first year experience. In addition, a sense of belonging was perceived by faculty as being the primary mechanism for ensuring the retention of students beyond the first year of enrolment. Practical implications – From a managerial perspective, uncovering the nature of student-institution relationships and the importance of affective forms of commitment will enable higher education institutions to develop more targeted relationship marketing programs to increase student retention. Originality/value – In a unique contribution, this research examines this issue from the perspective of first year students, as well as from an international faculty perspective, enabling a multi-dimensional comparison to be drawn between the perceptions of the student, and the service provider. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Affective commitment; Bonding; Engagement; First year experience; Higher education; Student retention; Student-faculty relationship; Student-university relationship",""

To examine the effect of acceptance of the online channel and travel cost on profits of two channels. Design/methodology/approachThe Hotelling model is employed to depict consumers' channel choice behavior, where the consumer surplus captures travel cost, spatial distance and consumer heterogeneity in acceptance of the online channel. A game-theoretical framework is developed to determine the optimal encroachment form and market structure for both manufacturer-owned and traditional retail channels. FindingsThis paper finds that, in either form of encroachment, Stackelberg market structure always outperforms Bertrand market structure, and channel choice significantly relies on parameters, i.e. consumer acceptance of the online channel and travel cost. Moreover, a Pareto zone is proposed in which both channels consider the strategy that the manufacturer opens bricks-and-mortar channel under Stackelberg market structure as the optimal strategy.

The impact of bargaining goal on bargaining outcomes is also discussed. Design/methodology/approachTo increase realism and external validity, actual transactions in the shopping malls of two cities of China were observed unobtrusively, followed by a matched survey with the consumer to collect data on variables that could not be observed. FindingsProduct knowledge, presence of purchase plan and shopping companion, posited to reflect consumer's bargaining power, are found to influence the bargaining goal set by the consumer. Satisfaction toward the transaction outcome depends on the extent of goal achievement rather than the ultimate concession obtained or the perceived fair price of the product, and such satisfaction affects future patronage likelihood. Originality/valueA different research methodology is used to study retail price negotiation. Instead of only using student subjects to understand how consumers negotiate price in a hypothetical setting, the current study collected data from actual transactions.

"Conducting “Dirty Research” with extreme groups: Understanding academia as a dirty work site","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931096577&doi=10.1108%2fQROM-01-2013-1131&partnerID=40&md5=c660149541229f126528beca4b65e5fe","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore dirty work sites within an academic context. Working with particular “unloved” groups (Fielding, 1993) can present a number of challenges to researchers, and if professional boundaries are not carefully maintained, researchers can be seen as “dirty workers” within an academic context. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws a qualitative research project that explores women’s involvement with nationalist movements in the UK. Findings – Researching “unloved” groups, and in particular racist organizations, presents a number of potential emotional and professional, and can render researchers “dirty workers” if clear professional boundaries are not maintained. Originality/value – Examining academia and some academic research as a dirty work site adds to existing literature (Kreiner et al., 2006) that suggests any occupation can have a “dirty work” element that must be negotiated. This paper presents new challenges for managing spoiled “dirty” identities, and suggests that identity management is context-specific. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dirty work; Extremism; Far-right; Identity work; Racism; Risk",""
"Regional and country ethnocentrism: broadening ASEAN origin perspectives","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977614683&doi=10.1108%2f13555851311314077&partnerID=40&md5=26cdcdadb2dcfb4633dab19597bc5266","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to report an application of the CETSCALE measuring consumer ethnocentrism for high-value consumer goods in the emerging markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The study examines how regional markings can be thought of as variants of national markings and then goes on to establish a regio-centric scale, thereby taking up calls for ethnocentrism studies to be conducted across multiple countries that actively trade with one another. Design/methodology/approachThis research is based on an empirical investigation of consumer ethnocentrism (CE) that includes simultaneous manipulation of country-of-assembly and region-based country-of-components. The study surveys a sample of 720 car owners equally divided between the three largest automotive markets of ASEAN: Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. FindingsStatistical analysis of this study's empirical results confirms that for the three-country sample of 720 respondents, this newly derived regional ethnocentrism construct is as relevant as the classic country-based construct. The research concludes that regional use of campaigns with a (potentially collaborative) Made-in-ASEAN theme may reach the target group of regio-centric consumers. Originality/valueThe study is original in providing a new perspective on the ethnocentrism debate by adding and testing for a regional dimension reflecting realities in the marketplace for a major product category. The study is also one of the few to focus upon the ASEAN region rather than the more commonly studied regions such as Europe or North America. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","ASEAN; Branding; Consumer behaviour; Consumer ethnocentrism; Country of origin; Emerging markets; Ethnocentrism; Indonesia; Malaysia; Regional marking; South East Asia; Thailand",""
"Marketing to different Asian communities: The importance of culture for framing advertising messages, and for purchase intent","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977618407&doi=10.1108%2f13555851311290911&partnerID=40&md5=31a23df86081192133381d6ccbae5605","The purpose of this paper is to show that culture has differential effects on purchase intent, using respondents from four very different cultural groups within Indonesia, and two different advertisements (one ethical, another unethical). The study uses survey methods and a highly structured questionnaire to collect data from respondents in four cultural groups. In total, 100 responses were received from each of these groups within Indonesia (Bali, Batak, Java, and Minang). Data were analyzed using partial least squares. The results suggest that when advertising to culturally conservative groups, caution is required. Such groups have lower purchase intent when they do not like the advertisement. Moreover, other variables such as attitude towards the advertiser may become salient drivers of purchase intent for such groups if the advertisement is perceived to be unethical. Importantly, neither of these factors are salient for more permissive cultures, regardless of whether the advertisement is perceived to be ethical or unethical. In addition the authors identify a set of “universal paths” by which advertisement-related factors, and company-related factors indirectly influence purchase intent for both permissive and conservative cultures, regardless of the perceived ethicality of the advertisement. The research uses four samples, with 100 respondents per group. Future research could verify these results using larger samples. In addition, the study only uses low involvement consumer products, hence future research could test the model on higher involvement products. Managers should test their advertising messages on target audiences to assess whether they are likeable, as advertisement likeability can influence purchase intent. In addition, whilst factors such as ethicality (and likeability, and attitude towards the advertiser) tend to not affect purchase intent directly except in specific circumstances, these antecedent variables do have strong effects on each other via the universal paths. This is the first study which has examined the effects of ethical/unethical advertisements across four different cultures in Indonesia. The results also reveal an important set of relationships between the model variables, which the authors refer to as the “universal paths.” These paths have important implications for advertisers and their clients in their attempts to build brand equity and increase purchase intent. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising; Conservative/permissive cultures; Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural advertising; Ethical advertising; Ethics; Indonesia; Marketing strategy",""

An online survey of purchases of Thai gemstones was used to collect the data. Partial Least Squares was used to test the conceptual model of the study. The results of this study suggest that the type of internet marketing strategy used by the seller (the place strategy) and the buyer's privacy and security practices influence a buyer's perceived risk to purchase gemstones online. Furthermore, the study showed that perceived risk reduces trust and perceived risk reduces online purchases. The implications of these results are that privacy and security concerns of online buyers must be addressed in order to reduce perceived risk and thereby increase trust which is fundamental to the amount purchased online. Online marketers of highly risky products need to consider that policies that promote trust and reduce risk are important means of increasing purchases. In particular, the use of multichannels will reduce perceived risk. This is a rare study which examines purchases of expensive, complex, high risk and credence products such as gemstones. It is also a study which examines the behaviour of organisational buyers. Also actual reported online purchases are investigated rather than just intent. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Internet marketing; Internet retail; Organizational buying behaviour; Perceived risk; PLS; Trust; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approachA group of experts from industries and academics was consulted and ISM is used to develop the contextual relationship among various SCMEs for each dimension of SCM implementation. The results of ISM are used as an input to fuzzy MICMAC analysis, to identify the driving and dependence power of SCMEs. FindingsThis paper has identified 24 key SCMEs and developed an integrated model using ISM and the fuzzy MICMAC approach, which is helpful to identify and classify the important SCMEs and reveal the direct and indirect effects of each SCME on the SCM implementation. The integrated approach is developed, since the ISM model provides only binary relationship among SCMEs, while fuzzy MICMAC analysis provides precise analysis related to driving and dependence power of SCMEs. Research limitations/implicationsThe weightage for ISM model development and fuzzy MICMAC are obtained through the judgment of academicians and a few industry experts. It is only subjective judgment and any biasing by the person who is judging the SCMEs might influence the final result. A questionnaire survey can be conducted to catch the insight on these SCMEs from more organizations. Practical implicationsThis study has strong practical implications, for both practitioners as well as academicians. The practitioners need to concentrate on identified SCMEs more cautiously during SCM implementation in their organizations and the top management could formulate strategy for implementing these enablers obtained through ISM and fuzzy MICMAC analysis.

"Testing and validation of a hierarchical values-attitudes model in the context of green food in China","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905388134&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-09-2013-0106&partnerID=40&md5=a79e15bf1ce81c5000e494b853f325b8","Purpose – Values-attitudes hierarchical models are quite frequent in the consumer behaviour literature. In attitudinal models specific to food produced in an environmentally friendly way (i.e. “green” food), past research evidence mainly originating inWestern cultures posits that the strongest path of the model can be found among collectivistic consumer values, general environmental attitudes, and attitudes specific to green food. On the other hand, in non-Western cultures (i.e. China), green food (e.g. organic) is perceived by consumers as safer to consume. With this as point of departure, the present paper aims to examine whether attitudes towards green food in a values-attitudes model in China are determined as postulated in past Western research. Design/methodology/approach – A “typical” (i.e. Western research evidence-based) values-attitudes hierarchical model was developed and a questionnaire comprising 34 items reflecting the conceptual model was designed. Data collection was focused on six major Chinese cities, as this is where the current changes in eating habits are predominantly taking place. Data were collected by personal interviews conducted by local researchers between January and March 2009 through a mall-intercept method. A total number of 479 respondents were recruited, equally distributed among the six cities. Findings – Collectivistic values and environmental attitudes were still found to be strong determinants of Chinese consumers’ attitudes towards green foods; contrary to relevant Western findings, however, collectivism also influenced technological attitudes; which, in turn, influenced attitudes towards green food jointly with environmental attitudes. These findings point to the conclusion that Chinese consumers, possibly guided by altruistic predispositions, see technology as a positive determinant of both food safety and environmental friendliness in food production. Empirical findings like these highlight the need for adaptation of well-substantiated models to completely customised research approaches within new globally rising environments. Originality/value – It is still not quite clear how green food products are perceived in South-East Asian consumer cultures, as well as in other non-Western contexts. This scarcity makes the empirical examination of well-established values-attitudes hierarchies in such contexts valuable from an academic and practitioner’s point of view. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Food safety; Green food; Values-attitudes hierarchy",""

The objective is to measure benefits of third party logistics service providers for cooperative dairies. A standard scale development research procedure recommended by experts was followed. First, the literature review of studies to measure benefits of third party logistics was undertaken. Later, Delphi method was used. Interviews were conducted of experts and customers for understanding and generating items for measuring benefits of third party logistics service providers for cooperative dairies. A survey was then undertaken first for development of the scale and later for validation purpose. A reliable and valid scale is developed to measure the five dimensions of benefits of using 3PLSPs for cooperative dairies: responsiveness, accuracy, customization of service, inventory handling and order processing and information sharing. This scale is developed to outsource logistics functions at operational levels in the context of cooperative dairies in India. So, this scale can be tested for cooperative dairies of countries other than India. The scale can also be tested where outsourcing of logistics activities is done at operational level, other than cooperative dairies. The proposed scale can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify important benefits to consider in outsourcing operational function of logistics management to 3PLSPs in cooperative dairies. Most relevant studies about benefits of third party logistics service providers do not have stable factor structure, especially for cooperative dairies. The new scale fills the gap of the absence of a validated scale to measure benefits of 3PLSPs for cooperative dairies at operational level. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cooperative dairies; Distribution management; India; Management strategy; Outsourcing; Third party logistics service providers",""

Design/methodology/approach: The research design adopted a case-study approach, with two general cases (the New Singaporean and Malaysian supermarket retail industries), made up of two embedded cases each (retailers and manufacturers operating within each country). Findings: The overall finding is that despite prior assumptions that suitability is reliant on product type or country choice, there are a number of sales promotion techniques that are inherently suited to the supermarket industry as a whole. The majority of these “inherently suitable” techniques are price-based and the conclusion is then that these techniques can be used globally. Value-added techniques, on the other hand, should be localised to fit with the market in which they are being applied. Practical implications: Tools best suited to the grocery product sales environment appear to be price-based or linked to price reductions (i.e. price discounting and discount-linked point-of-purchase (P-O-P) or end-of-aisle (E-O-A) displays combination and volume offers), suggesting that those tools which are inherently suitable to the industry are likely to meet retailers' shorter-term objectives rather than manufacturers' longer-term ones. The difficulty faced by manufacturers, then, is aligning their sales promotion objectives with the tools that are best able to achieve results in the supermarket environment. Originality/value: Globalisation of the supermarket industry has also meant that marketers continue to need a better understanding of cross-cultural issues and their effect and national culture frameworks can be used to develop marketing theories which are suited to a particular region. The current research identifies preferences for different sales promotion techniques in the two nationally similar, yet ethnically diverse, countries under study, as well as examining application of these techniques in the retail environment. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Channel relationships; Consumer behaviour; Malaysia; Singapore; Supermarkets",""

Extension naming strategies include direct and indirect naming, while categorical fit is the similarity between an extended product and its parent brand's cognitive category. Further, the interaction effect and the relative effectiveness of various combinations of the two predictors when determining brand personality transfer are also explored. A 2×2 factorial between-subject experimental design with one covariate is used to test the proposed hypotheses. The experiment involves 242 participants from a university in Taiwan. The findings show that consumers perceive higher brand personality transfer when a direct naming strategy is applied or when the parent brand extends to a high perceived fit product. The former is the dominant predictor of brand personality transfer. There also exists an interaction effect between extension naming strategies and categorical fit. Specifically, consumers perceive the highest brand personality transfer when a direct naming strategy is applied for a high fit extended product. Moreover, the use of a direct naming strategy for an extended product with a low categorical fit still leads to a higher degree of parent brand personality than both the other cases in which an indirect naming strategy is applied for either high or low fit extended products. Furthermore, irrespective of the degree of categorical fit, the transfer of brand personality is low when an indirect naming strategy is applied. The current research is pioneer work in identifying the determinants of brand personality transfer.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors employ rhetorical analysis to explore how newspaper editorials and an online blog portray investment banking as tainted between April 2008 and October 2009. Findings – These media sources construct the values and behaviours of investment bankers, rather than the tasks of their occupation, as morally tainted.

The effects of investigated contingency factors on perceived values are empirically determined. Design/methodology/approachCPV was measured by four dimensions: price, quality, social and emotional values. The investigated contingency factors included gender, age, race, income level, and retailer type. The primary data were gathered by a nation-wide survey of US consumers and the applied statistical techniques were exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis. FindingsThe statistical analysis of 4,949 eligible survey responses shows that four value dimensions accounted for 77 percent of CPV variance. For the effects of contingency factors, race did not significantly affect the formation of any perceived values. In contrast, gender, income level, and retailer type significantly affected perceived price and emotional values, while perceived quality value was significantly affected by all contingency factors except race, and perceived social value was only significantly affected by age and income level. Practical implicationsIncorporation of gender, income level, and retailer type information in developing marketing strategies can help companies more effectively convey price and emotional values to consumers. In contrast, information relating to gender, age, income level, and retailer type should be considered in marketing quality value to consumers, while age and income level information is more critical for properly marketing social value to consumers.

Both hedonic as well as utilitarian shopping value measurement scales were tested for their reliability and validity. Further, a series of hypotheses was developed to test the differences in the shopping values across the market segments based on demographic characteristics of the consumers. Finally, the discriminant analysis was used to determine the relative importance of each variable measuring shopping value in discriminating between the groups of interest. Design/methodology/approachThe scale developed by Babin et al. for measuring shopping values has been put on test with modifications on selected questions to fit the local content. A convenient sampling technique was used to obtain information on hedonic and utilitarian values on a seven-point Likert scale from a sample of 200 consumers from major shopping centres in Klang Valley, the most developed region in Malaysia. Statistical tools such as Cronbach's Alpha test, confirmatory factor analysis and discriminant analysis were used to analyze the data. FindingsThe findings reveal that hedonic shopping value measurement scale is a reliable and valid scale to be used for Malaysian consumers. However, the same could not be ascertained on the utilitarian shopping value measurement scale. The results further reveal that there are significant differences in the shopping values across the groups of interest.

"Organizational anonymity and the negotiation of research access","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931070097&doi=10.1108%2fQROM-10-2012-1104&partnerID=40&md5=38e4aadac2e63011e4d7fc6d4b04be40","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the part of the organizational research process, access negotiation, through reflexive analysis of the participation in a recent data collection process. The paper aims is to question two emergent norms in this area: first, that organizational anonymity be granted in exchange for organizational access; and second, that access negotiation be seen as a bounded activity at the start of data collection. Design/methodology/approach – Through the reflexive account and with reference to published accounts of practice in other research projects, the authors explore the reasons why researchers offer organizational anonymity, and note the unintended consequences of this practice. The authors locate the discussion in relation to increased expectations on social researchers to contribute to public debate about managing and organizing. Findings – The author suggests that the negotiation of access without promising anonymity may generate more situated accounts of organization, and greater participation in political or ethical debates surrounding work, organization, and management. By facilitating a clearer line of impact stemming from qualitative research, this would also aid researchers in demonstrating the value of their work in informing public debate. Social implications – The authors conclude by reiterating the potential for organizational researchers to achieve greater social and ethical impact, especially if the authors frame access negotiation as a continuous process rather simply as than a moment at the start of a project. Originality/value – The authors argue that the paper raises a key, but neglected, issue in conducting empirical organizational research, that has political and ethical implications as well as a methodological significance. Through the analysis, the authors encourage themselves and the research community to be clearer about the potential value of scholarship in debates happening outside the academy, and to see access negotiation as more complex than simply a transaction in which organizational anonymity is promised in return for data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Access; Anonymity; Case study; Confidentiality; Impact; Organizations",""

By using data envelopment analysis models, the authors propose to maximize the sale allocating efficiency scores to satisfy the hypothesis that the shampoo market is efficient, and then, the sales functions, linear and exponential, can be determined and specified. It is found that an exponential sales function is more suitable to characterize the Chinese shampoo industry, and the price factor is a major influence on creating sales. The paper proposes a method, from an original perspective, to analyze the sales function among the influence factors and to determine which one is more important.

It also sets out to clarify the contribution that shadowing methods can make to the study of organizations. Design/methodology/approach – This is done by briefly outlining the ways in which shadowing methods have developed in parallel within a number of disciplines. In order to tackle the question of why this has happened, a grounded approach is taken which centres on data excerpts generated by a shadowing method and three of its closest methodological neighbours: interviews, observation and participant observation. The paper further develops this analysis through the presentation of a set of illustrative analogies which use the idea of the researcher’s gaze as a beam of light. Findings – Similarities and differences between shadowing, interviews, observation and participant observation are identified, which support the articulation of shadowing as a family of followingmethods. Research limitations/implications – Taken together, the contributions from the invited commentaries and research papers, suggest a number of ways in which the debate surrounding shadowing research in organizations needs to be developed going forward. Originality/value – The reflexive, comparative methodological approach taken here provides for the first time a systematic comparison of shadowing in relation to other common qualitative data elicitation methods. Further, the development of a critique of the extant literature on shadowing provides a basis on which to progress the field, both in terms of shadowing practices themselves and writing about them within disciplines and across the research methods literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capturing movement; Following methods; Methods comparison; Shadowing; Time and space",""

The purpose of this paper is to model the impact of brand-extensions on parent brand-equity within the Asian (specifically Indian) context. Additionally, parent brand trust is examined as a new antecedent of brand-extension feedback. Design/methodology/approachScenario of an Indian product brand hypothetically entering the service sector is chosen as stimulus in the study. A cross-sectional survey of 327 Generation-Y respondents is conducted. Structural equation modeling is used for testing the conceptual model. FindingsThe model of brand-extension feedback fits the data adequately, and five of the six hypotheses are supported. Brand-extension attitude significantly impacts change in brand-equity, which is consistent with the extant Western literature. Parent brand trust has a strong impact on change in brand-equity of a parent brand. Practical implicationsThe role and impact of parent brand trust is particularly important in the Asian context. Thus, prior to embarking on a brand-extension decision, an audit of parent brand trust is recommended. Further, this research opens up newer brand-extension possibilities for brand managers contemplating brand-extensions. Originality/valueThis research is a first-of-its-kind from the Asian region (specifically, India) to measure brand-extension feedback effects on change in brand-equity of a parent brand.

Whether and in which ways product involvement and familiarity have some moderating effects on this relationship was also explored. Using experimental design, hypotheses were tested in two product groups. Results show that subjects not provided brand origin information perceived the competence dimension of BP significantly lower than subjects who were provided brand information. Also, product involvement positively moderates brand origin effect while product familiarity negatively moderates it. However, two-way interactions of brand origin and product involvement are more meaningful than all other interactions and main effects. The findings were based on data collected in an experimental setting from a convenience sample that was somewhat homogeneous. Also only one dimension of BP (competence) has been used in this study. Supporting the importance of brand origin on BP perceptions, these results show that the general characteristics of countries can translate into personalities of their brands from the product categories that have a good reputation on international markets. As the most significant implication for practitioners, the maximum effectiveness of marketing communication strategies can be achieved through the effect of brand origin on BP perceptions only if proper segmentation can be made with regard to involvement and familiarity. This is the first study that has empirically demonstrated the role of image transfer on building BP perceptions through brand origin information. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand identity; Brand origin; Brand personality; Brands; County of origin; Product familiarity; Product involvement; Turkey",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study included two experiments that used US and Chinese college students as participants to test the effect of model race on model likeability, ad attitude, and brand attitude. Findings – The experiments confirmed that model race affected the effectiveness of advertising, though the nature and extent of its effects were mediated by factors such as country and product category. The effects of model race were much more pronounced for the Chinese data than for the US data, and for computer than for beer. Practical implicationsThe findings illustrate the inadequacy of the center-periphery approach to global advertising planning, expose the limitations of the social identity theory in predicting racial attitudes in international settings, and outline the ethical challenge for global advertisers to develop effective multicultural advertising. Originality/value – To date, most studies on racial cues in advertising have focused on the USA, and very few have explored the topic in the context of other markets. As an initial cross-country comparative investigation, this study suggests that multicultural advertising does not have the same effect in international markets. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; China; Experiment; Model race; United States of America",""

A survey of 300 Indian consumers was conducted and the data were analysed using descriptive and simple regression techniques. The study found that brand purchase in India varies across product categories. At present, consumer knowledge and use of foreign brands is low, and Indian consumers are pricesensitive. Indian consumers are experimenting with brands and would like more foreign brands to enter the Indian market. Due to the small sample size, advanced econometrics techniques could not be used to analyse the dataset.

Drawing upon signalling theory, this work decomposes reputational beliefs into: an ability belief, as represented by web site investment, and a truthfulness belief, as signalled by a statement about the existence of a physical store, and investigates their differential effects on online purchase intentions. This work aims to further investigate the moderating effects of searchers’ personality type on the relationships between reputational beliefs and online purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach – Three experiments using various samples (students versus non-students) and products (cell phone versus camera) were conducted. Findings – The results reveal that two significant market signals, web site investment and a statement about physical store existence, influence reputation beliefs, and, thus online purchase intentions. Moreover, aggressive searchers’ online purchase intentions depend on their ability belief rather than their truthfulness belief, whereas non-aggressive searchers’ intentions rely on their truthfulness belief rather than their ability belief. Originality/value – This work provides new theoretical insights into factors influencing consumers’ online purchase decision making by decomposing reputational beliefs and incorporating the moderating effect of personality type.

A multi-level modeling approach is used to examine the relationships between these higher order constructs. In addition, service quality consists of three primary dimensions and 13 sub-dimensions. Finally, this study compares students' perceptions of the dimensions of service quality, overall perceived service quality, university image, perceived value, satisfaction and favorable behavioral intentions based on the demographic characteristics of the sample (gender, age, year of study, and major). Design/methodology/approach – The data used in this study were based on a sample of 350 students studying at a public university in China. Data was analyzed using factor analysis, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Findings – The findings support using a multi-level model consisting of three primary dimensions and 13 sub-dimensions to conceptualize and measure perceived service quality. Service quality is the main determinant of satisfaction and has a significant influence on university image and perceived value. Perceived value has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between service quality and satisfaction. Satisfaction significantly influences recommending the university and future attendance. The results of this study also indicate that students' demographic characteristics (gender, age, year of study, and major) influence their perceptions of several of the constructs.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 200 respondents. In total, 100 families have been chosen from each of these countries. The data were collected by the snowball sampling method across 11 different products and four decision-making stages. Findings: The results of this research show that cultural assimilation does have an influence on parental perceptions of teen's influence on family decision making.

Moreover, the secondary aim of this research is to examine the moderating role of product involvement. To accomplish this, a conceptual framework was designed and relationships between its constructs (COB image, COM image, brand equity dimensions, overall brand equity) were hypothesized. Data were collected from Iranian students who were the owners of selected brands of laptops and mobile phones. All hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) in LISREL. As a result of exploratory factor analysis, three factors, namely brand loyalty, perceived quality and brand association/awareness were introduced for the brand equity dimensions. Results indicated that unlike COM, COB has a direct and significant effect on brand loyalty and COB positively influences perceived quality and brand awareness or association. Brand loyalty has a positive and direct effect on the overall brand equity. The results also indicate the moderating effect of product involvement on relationships between COB and brand equity dimensions. This study only investigates in the country of origin of the product.

This paper provides recommendations for multinational companies (MNCs) in dealing with problems among team members from different cultures. Data were collected through 24 indepth interviews with local middlelevel managers (e.g. R&D, marketing managers) and expatriates working on NPD projects in MNC subsidiaries located in Thailand. A qualitative method was employed to explore and attain insightful information about the acculturation of local NPD members when working with expatriates. Results show that local NPD team members may acculturate themselves to foreign work culture when they have regular contact with expatriates during the product development process. The acculturation may also affect the team performance and the relationship among team members. Cultural training programs for local NPD team members are recommended. Since this qualitative pilot research has a rather small sample size of cases, it limits the ability to generalize the findings. The findings from MNCs subsidiaries may not represent all other cultures of MNCs operating in Thailand. The findings of this study significantly contribute to MNCs from North America and Asia that develop new products in Thailand. Cultural training programs and frequent and twoway communications are suggested to increase the familiarity of local employees with the foreign work culture, to develop mutual objectives, and to promote shared interests among multicultural NPD team members. This study extends the application of acculturation of local NPD team members within a multicultural setting, which has been rarely explored. Theoretically, the findings provide an indepth understanding of the local managers' acculturation pattern found in NPD teams. Also, it provides recommendations on how to support the local NPD team members more effectively in adopting critical values of the parent firm's culture so as to achieve NPD tasks facing less miscommunication and improving project performance. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Acculturation; Multinational companies; New product development; Performance management; Thailand",""

Constructs elicited from the literature were overall perception of education quality, available information, country characteristics and accrual of potential benefits. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a literature review, from which the authors identified four constructs: quality of available information; overseas country characteristics; potential benefits; and perceptions of overall education quality. The data required for this research were collected by means of a consumer-type survey. A questionnaire was developed with 40 items adapted from previously validated scales. A non-probabilistic sampling procedure, i.e. convenience sampling, was adopted owing to the unavailability of a satisfactory sampling frame. Final-year undergraduate students from four universities in Taiwan were targeted. There was upfront a screening question which eliminated students who were not knowledgeable about overseas postgraduate education from continuing the survey. A total of 312 survey questionnaires were administered by trained interviewers, during a two-week period, and 301 completed questionnaires were collected. Findings: The research findings revealed that the overall perception of education quality in host country influences the choice of the destination country. Path analysis has shown the catalytic need for intermediation by potential benefits accrued. Postgraduate Taiwanese students, having a better appreciation of western acculturation and potential migration and job prospects, together with the constructs of quality of information and country characteristics, have a better overall perception of education quality of destination country. Research limitations/implications: Universities targeting Taiwanese postgraduate students need to highlight aspects of potential benefits in their marketing literature and promotional materials. The results of this study will certainly benefit overseas educational institutions and their marketing departments. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies which uses partial least squares to address a complex situation associated with the hierarchy of determinants in the selection of a foreign university. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Destination choice; Marketing strategy; Partial least squares; Perception; Postgraduate education; Postgraduates; Potential benefits; Quality; Taiwan; Universities",""

Drawing on the sociological debate on insider-outsider categories in research, this paper describes how these types of “dirty work/er researchers” understand and negotiate their occupational subjectivity and the methodological and epistemological resources they bring to their research practice. Design/methodology/approach – Two biographical narratives from different types of “dirty work/ er researchers” are analysed using a feminist epistemology of corporeality, social difference and power. Findings – Ambivalence is an underlying dynamic of the narratives which indicate that the stigma attached to certain types of dirty work histories act to both facilitate and constrain research practice. Ambivalence disrupts strict binary categories often relied on in research such as insiders and outsiders, empowered and powerless and researcher and Other. Research limitations/implications – The experiences of “dirty work/er researchers” indicate a need to reconsider ethical, methodological, epistemological issues within social research.

Design/methodology/approach – The research draws on a two and a half year ethnography of the US Border Patrol in which the first author engaged in participant observation, shadowing, and interviews. Based upon the iterative data analysis and narrative writing techniques using verbatim quotations and field data, the essay provides a series of vignettes that explore the multi-faceted feelings of dirty work.

A table listing the emotions that emerged in these stories supplements the narrative text. The analysis shows how communication about emotions provides a sense-making tool that, in turn, elucidates both the challenges and the potential highlights of doing dirty work. In particular, findings suggest that emotional ambiguity the “moral emotions” of guilt and shame may serve as sense-making tools that can help in ethical decision making and a re-framing of challenging situations. Originality/value – A field immersion alongside dirty workers, coupled with a creative writing approach, provides access to the fleeting, embodied, and fragmented nature of tacit knowledge – answering the questions of what dirty work feels like. The essay provides a behind the scenes exploration of US Border Patrol agents – a profession that is alternately stigmatized or hidden from public view. Finally, the piece provides a self-reflexive account of the messy realities of conducting “dirty research” in a way that is open ended and embodied. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Border patrol; Dirty work; Emotion; Messy text; Sensemaking; Tacit knowledge",""

The key mediating variables model (KMV) proposed by Morgan and Hunt is applied to construct the research structure, hypotheses, and questionnaire. The research hypotheses are validated through structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis. Research results show that for two parties of an exchange relationship, higher levels of trust can lead to better interactions and trust is an important factor affecting their supply chain partnerships. It helps increase interests of both parties, facilitate constant cooperation and communication, and reduce uncertainties. Higher levels of commitment can also help increase value benefits, reduce a partner's propensity to leave, and enhance supply chain cooperation efficiency. Empirical results indicate that relationship marketing is a strategy that promotes trust and commitment of partners in hightech industries. While information sharing and communication can increase partners' intention of longterm cooperation, functional conflicts can facilitate positive interactions and reduce uncertainties. Through relationship marketing, hightech companies can create winwin strategic alliances to develop their competitive advantages in the market. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Commitmenttrust theory; Hightech companies; Key mediating variables model; Partnership; Relationship marketing; Supply chain management; Supply chain relationships; Taiwan",""

For a growing sector with unique market structure and category characteristics, it examines how competitive factors affect the attractiveness of a product category for private label entry by an organic food retailer and how the manufacturer brand assortment that the retailer stocks affects private label share. This study analyses store level crosscategory data from an independent organic retailer and field data on retail competition. The findings show that organic private label stockkeeping units are more likely to be present in categories with supermarket competition. They also show that concentration of shares amongst manufacturer brands (as measured by the Herfindahl index) negatively affect the probability that the retailer will enter a category with a private label stockkeeping unit (SKU) but positively affects the share of that private label SKU. Although the results arise from a fairly small sample of around 30 categories, the focal retailer offers a unique opportunity to examine several private label decisions at the store level. Future work could examine in greater depth the competitive interaction between supermarkets and organic retailers and the effects of such competition on their assortment decisions. By extending private label research beyond the conventional supermarket industry, this study conducts a pioneering test of the effects of competition between retail formats on the likelihood of private label entry. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Entry probability; Interformat competition; Intracategory; Organic foods; Organic retailing; Private label; Retailing",""

Design/methodology/approachUsing a multiple regression method and an Australian sample of 235 consumers, this paper tests a relationship between consumer-perceived corporate brand and consumer satisfaction. FindingsThe results demonstrate that a corporate brand acts as a critical predictor of consumer satisfaction thus providing support for the research proposition. The three components of consumer value (functional, emotional and symbolic) were found to be critical and consistent predictors of consumer satisfaction. Corporate associations and core organizational values were also found to be the drivers of consumer satisfaction.

First, the proposed model adopts the modified Delphi method to identify suitable criteria for evaluating a brand name. Next, the model applies the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the relative weights of evaluation criteria, then ranks the alternatives and selects the brand name. Finally, the model adopts sensitivity analysis to examine how other evaluative criteria would change with any changes in the weightings of the evaluation criteria. The analytical results indicated that enterprises rank criteria in terms of importance as follows: emotional appeal, linguistics appeal, marketing appeal and legal appeal. In addition, the example of a renowned Taiwanese beverage company is used to demonstrate the process of brand name selection based on this model. The proposed model helps enterprises effectively select a brand name, making it highly applicable in academia and commerce. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Analytic hierarchy process; Brand names; Decision making; Decision model; Delphi method; Modelling; Modified Delphi method; Taiwan",""

Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes the attention/salience hypothesis. A total of 931 people were questioned in five Asian cities (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Jakarta, Bangkok and Mumbai) using telephone interviews. Findings: The results revealed 931 dislike attributes that were reduced to seven: style, meaningless, character, exaggeration, irresponsive, violent and hard-sell. There also appears to be a close relationship between the disliking of advertisements and purchase intention and purchase frequency. Practical implications: Findings indicate a strong relationship of the dislikeability variables with culture and religion in the five Asian cities and this must be taken seriously by advertisers. International advertisers need to pay attention to the local values and tradition and use the advertising communication message appropriately.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper reflects upon (empirical) studies of managers and managerial work, research and bodies of knowledge, and puts available insights into perspective. Findings – Shadowing managers enables researchers to cope with the paradoxical situation that arises when managerial work is studied. Managerial work must be understood in as unbiased a way as possible; managers themselves are unable to understand their own work and the texts they use to capture their work and behavior are either superficial or “manipulative.” At the same time, managerial work cannot be understood without (theoretical) bias; researchers need a priori assumptions when they study real-life work, especially about the institutional settings in which work streams are embedded. The paper concludes that “theoretical shadowing” is relevant. Originality/value – The paper brings together different bodies of knowledge that have evolved over time and shows that observing managers can never be done openly, despite remarks made by earlier students of managerial work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Managerial behaviour; Managerial texts; Public managers; Shadowing",""

The paper identifies whether and how long-term orientation (LO), an inherent value of Confucianism, is an antecedent of important factors of channel relationships, rather than a relationship outcome and whether and how market orientation mediates relations among LO and other relational factors. – Data were collected from retail buyers at department stores in South Korea, a country that is representative of Confucian culture. One hundred and fourteen valid cases were analysed using path analysis to assess the proposed model. – LO plays significant anteceding roles in market orientation, trust, and economic dependence, both directly and indirectly. In addition, market orientation mediates the impact of LO on trust and economic dependence. – Testing the proposed model with both retailers' and suppliers' data will add robustness to the research findings. This research advances the understanding of cultural influence on channel relationship regarding the role of LO and market orientation. Strategic practical implications include that marketers who deal with business partners in Confucian culture need to understand the embeddedness of LO and its impact on business relationship management. – The current study scrutinizes unique aspects of cultural influence on the anteceding roles of LO and the direct relationship between LO and market orientation in Confucian culture.

Further, the paper reveals the mediating role of marketing capability between strategic orientations and firm performance. Mail and email surveys were received from 198 Korean executives among the nation's Top 500 firms (across various industries). Generally, multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the various hypotheses. Data confirm that each strategic orientation has distinct paths through marketing capability (single or multiple, and mediating) that significantly impact firm performance. Fostering marketing capability, including marketing planning and implementation ability, will have a direct positive impact on firm performance. In addition, companies should understand how differently their cultural resources and orientations affect firm performance.

Understanding salespeople's ethical intentions and behaviour is important as consumers in developing countries are more at risk of ethical abuse arising from higher information asymmetry, their lower levels of financial literacy and less effective services regulation relating to ethical sales practices. Developing countries also have fewer governmental social support mechanisms, making the purchase of insurance more important for protecting consumers' financial well-being. Design/methodology/approachThe paper examines 205 Bangladeshi financial salespeople's ethical selling intentions and behaviour using the TPB. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the constructs and overall model. FindingsThe findings identify that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behaviour control (PBC) affect ethical selling intentions which, in turn, predict salespeople's ethical sales behaviour. However, PBC does not directly relate to ethical sales behaviour. Research limitations/implicationsUnderstanding of the determinants of financial salespeople's ethical selling intentions and behaviour is important for firms in developing countries and identifies that they need to develop effective management systems and foster organisational cultures that engender ethical behaviour. This is important in developing countries where ethical abuses and lapses will result in harm to consumers who have limited financial resources. Originality/valueThe results identify that the TPB applies to the selling of financial services in developing countries and, thus, broadens the applications and contexts of the TPB model.

Drawing upon the stakeholder theory, this study employs a path analytic framework to understand the effects of business relationships on retail operations strategy and performance for a sample of retail companies in China. The findings indicate that good relationships with customer and supplier could enable retailers to be more efficient in developing quality and flexible strategies, and that low cost and flexible strategies, in turn, influence business performance. However, the results suggest that the vital role that the Chinese government played in economic activities in the 1980s and 1990s has diminished gradually. It is appropriate to treat the good relationship with government bodies as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for retail success in China.

Design/methodology/approach – Scholars have proposed a range of approaches to the study of identity. However, studies have typically relied on interviews or surveys with little exploration of the dynamic narrating of self-in-situ inherent to identity and identity work. The paper reviews the aforementioned methods, builds on the power of visual approaches, and proposes a method involving figurative character image-elicitation (FCI). FCI uses personal, contextual cartoon-style images to mobilize and encourage the narration of identity. The paper details the development of the approach, drawing on a pilot study, and reports its use in an exploratory study of employee identity. Findings – The results suggest that the use of FCI provides a situated focus for the narration of identity with the signifying – self-insitu – nature of the images providing room for participants to position themselves as subject. These features are also suggested to provide a safe distance for a more in-depth and expressive discussion which transcends impression management. Originality/value – The use of FCI has highlighted the power of visual methods in the exploration of identity and identity work.

It is interesting to add on the works reviewed in this study and to re-conduct the analysis. The objective is not to doubt the consistency of SEM image research but to provide writers and readers with tools that enable them to produce better quality SEM research. Moreover, the quantitative analysis could be larger. Future research can consider computing other statistics. Finally, in the standards of most of marketing journals, this paper is a bit long. But as suggested by Babin et al., journal editors should allow more space to SEM-based reviews as the nature of the discussion requires lengthening. Practical implications – Mastering the statistical tool in marketing research is as important as mastering the conceptual tool. Statistical learning and/or cooperation with statisticians is recommended. Originality/value – A multi-criteria review of works from one specific field in marketing research and across a recent period of time allowing for the test of possible positive return from previous reviews of SEM use on the quality of the current publications of SEM papers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Branding models; Country image; Modeling",""
"National identity and the perceived values of foreign products with local brands: The case of local wine in Vietnam","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977661194&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-01-2013-0017&partnerID=40&md5=a3c0c9ea5d04de0d6f29450f163d99fa","Purpose – Based on the intra-national diversity view, this research aims to employ the concept of national identity to explain the consumer's evaluation of foreign product with local brand and the extent of consumer ethnocentrism. It then investigates how product evaluation and consumer ethnocentrism are capable of explaining consumer's perceived value of the product. Finally, it tests the impact of consumer perceived value on consumer willingness to buy. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 251 consumers of local wine in Vietnam was analysed using structural equation modelling technique. Findings – National identity has positive impacts on product evaluation and consumer ethnocentrism. These two factors together can explain 58 percent variance of consumer's perceived value, which is the key predictor of willingness to buy. Additionally, emotional and social values are found to be important motivators of local wine consumption in Vietnam. Research limitations/implications – The three reflective first-order components of national identity might be alternatively modelled as formative ones. Moderating effect of consumption occasions, consumer knowledge and other social demographics should be investigated. Finally, to compare Vietnamese consumers towards local wine vs foreign wine. Originality/value – Among very few empirical studies about the effects of national identity on consumer's value of foreign product with local brand under a mixed effects of the perceived inferior quality of locally made product and status-oriented consumption behavior, via the full mediation of product evaluation and consumer ethnocentrism. This study also suggests a conceptual distinction between ethnocentrism and consumer ethnocentrism in studies of national identity. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer ethnocentrism; Consumer perceived value; Local product consumption; National identity; Vietnam; Willingness to buy",""
"Cultural and sub-cultural differences in reliability: An empirical study in Japan and Malaysia","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977675745&doi=10.1108%2f13555851311290920&partnerID=40&md5=bb0a92657bbbc50762944bb184b229b1","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on testing hypotheses derived from theories presented by leading scholars regarding possible sources of differences in reliability coefficients, using cross-sectional data from Japan and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted in Malaysia and Japan, both of them characterized as having collectivist values. Convenience sampling and the same method of survey administration, personal interviews by trained interviewers, was used in both countries. Findings: The tests of the hypotheses regarding cultural, subcultural, and aging effects provide some results in line with the hypotheses, but they raise additional concerns about the possible sources of measurement differences and the applicability of theories and measures developed in one country to other countries and subcultures within countries. The major findings include the alpha reliability coefficient of the self-esteem scale (SSE) which is hypothesised to be lower than the alpha for the material value scale (MVS) and satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) in the Malaysian and Japanese samples, but this difference only occurs for the Japanese sample. Research limitations/implications: The study findings highlight the challenges that researchers confront when conducting cross-cultural studies. Originality/value: The present study systematically tests the reliability of measures developed in the West and employed in different countries (especially Asian countries). Although several assumptions and speculations have been made regarding the sources of potential bias in measures used when studying cultural and subcultural differences, little empirical work supports these views.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 400 users of mobile hand sets, using convenience sampling technique. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling procedure to test the proposed relationships in the model. Findings: The results indicate that the data were a good fit to the proposed model. All the paths in the model remained statistically significant.

As technology evolves, related costs, applications, interoperability and purposes evolve – as do the students. The purpose of this paper is to propose two contrasting ideologies of technologymediated education, LMS teaching and Community Learning, to question the inexorable march towards the former. The approach used is a literature review and case study. Most traditional universities would embrace a Community Learning ideology, yet many of these same universities practice LMS teaching. This paper draws on the literature to contrast these two technologymediated learning ideologies, and argue for Community Learning. These contrary ideologies help administrators and academics reflect upon, and then align institutional ideologies with their educational pedagogy and technology. The paper includes a short case study to illustrate aspects of Community Learning, a few simple ideas for shifting towards Community Learning and future research avenues. This paper answers calls for critical discourse of effective educational technology use, particularly LMS technology, and adds to a nascent research field that uses ideologies to help explain technology consumption.

Design/methodology/approach – Two hundred and fifty-eight questionnaires were completed by undergraduate students of a particular university in Australia. Structural equation modeling was employed in this study to examine the associations between the constructs. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence that PBO has a positive and significant relationship with all dependent variables. The research reveals that students' perception of a university's brand orientation is significantly related to satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The findings may guide the key decision makers in higher education institutions to understand the importance of brand orientation in their corporate strategy to enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and positive WOM, which can be used to differentiate themselves from other institutions in the highly competitive education market. Originality/value – Past researchers have not looked into the dynamic relationships between PBO, satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour, and hence research is to be called for in this area.

Items were validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, through both parametric and non parametric approaches to estimation. Scale validity and reliability was established in the Indian context. A sample of 152 final year students enrolled in professional courses, conforming to the characteristics of urbanized young Indians, was used. Consumers' goal orientation may now be successfully measured in the Indian context. Marketers may use the questionnaire to measure consumers' goal orientation and design products and advertisements catering specifically to promotion and prevention oriented customers. According to Cesario, Grant, and Hissing and Avnet and Higgins, this is important as message persuasiveness and product evaluation is dependent on consumer's goal orientation. Given the aspirational and goal directed nature of the dominant consumer segment of young Indians in India, it is essential that regulatory focus is measured well. This study establishes the validity of the scale for young Indians whose chronic regulatory focus can now be measured effectively. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Goal orientation; India; Lifestyle consumption; Prevention orientation; Promotion orientation; Regulatory focus; Urbanized young Indian; Yulic",""

Design/methodology/approach – In order to examine and compare the effect of brand personality and consumer ethnocentrism on the evaluation of product quality and purchase intention toward domestic and foreign brands, COB (the country with which the brand or firm is associated) and COM (the country in which final production takes place) cues were used in this study. Chinese college students represented the sample of 385 respondents. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the causal relationships among brand personality, consumer ethnocentrism, perceived quality, and purchase intention. Findings – Results revealed that brand personality has a significant effect on Chinese consumers' product quality perceptions and purchase intentions toward both domestic and foreign brands. Furthermore, it is found that Chinese consumers' ethnocentric tendencies have no significant impact on their intentions to buy either domestic or foreign sportswear brands. However, ethnocentric Chinese consumers do positively evaluate the quality of domestic brands when domestic brands are also made domestically and negatively evaluate the quality of foreign brands when foreign brands are also manufactured non-domestically. Originality/value – The study contributes theoretically and empirically to research on the effects of brand image and consumer ethnocentrism in emerging markets. The findings from this study will help domestic and international marketers have a better understanding of the role of brand personality and consumer ethnocentric tendencies in influencing young Chinese consumers' product evaluation and purchase intentions.

(Ante)stories include proper stories with chronology and plot as well as antestories which are fragmented and incomplete. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a concrete research project exploring collective identity as narratively constructed in negotiation between organizational insiders and outsiders, emphasis is placed on elements related to the production and analysis of (ante)stories. Challenges of the applied (ante)narrative methodology are addressed focusing on three central questions: where do (ante)stories come from? Whose (ante)stories are told? And whose storied constructions of collective identity are explored? Findings – The (ante)narrative methodology allows for a broad approach to producing and analysing (ante)stories. Consequently, it provides a rich understanding of the narrative practice of constructing collective identity. However, it also raises questions relating to the role of the researcher in the analytic process. Research limitations/implications – Implications include the necessity of developing analytic methods that take the fragmented, incoherent and dynamic nature of storytelling into account as well as reflect the researcher as a co-teller.

While studies show that many factors, including culture, influence CCB, the NoneAction mode in particular has been largely overlooked by researchers. The purpose of this paper is to examine Chinese student's CCB. The study employed a qualitative exploratory focus group design examining Chinese students' CCB. Data were analyzed in two stages. First, data were coded into various CCB modes. Next, data relating to the specific mode of NoneAction were thematically analyzed. Five key themes for NoneAction were revealed: Futility, Inadequate Information, Fear of Consequences, Complexity, and Internalization. This exploratory research found a high level of NoneAction responses. It was apparent that culture was highly influential in participants' CCB responses and that these NoneAction responses had an affective dimension. Understanding NoneAction responses to dissatisfaction among international students in higher education is critical if universities are to avoid adverse funding consequences. There are cultural and personal implications for students and strategic implications for higher education institutions in understanding Chinese students' NonAction. The exploratory nature of the research means that it is designed to stimulate thought and debate on how to expand the body of knowledge on this mode of CCB.

Phenomenological: the researcher uses a focus group to enable the essence of teachers' experience in the utilisation of Facebook as a teaching and learning tool within the syllabus of their taught subjects in a shared hospitality curriculum to emerge. The experiences divulged in the focus group reveal the use of Facebook as an “effective” medium for reflective purposes in relation to experiential teaching and learning activities and as a mechanism for reflective and extrapolative cognition on experiential or practical classes. This lies in the focus on actual Facebook use within the syllabi of a Faculty “community of practice”. It also lies in the focus of the paper on applications within a Hospitality curriculum.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper reflects on the shadowing experiences of three researchers – in a hospital emergency department, nuclear power plants, and entrepreneur workspaces – to generate recommendations by identifying and synthesizing solutions that emerged during the encounters with the challenges and opportunities in shadowing. Findings – Considering shadowing as an ongoing and emergent research process can be helpful to prepare for particular aspects of shadowing fieldwork. Shadowing presents research challenges that may emerge in the practice of fieldwork, including how to negotiate awkward conversations with participants, what to bring and wear, and how to take notes. Practical implications – Though the recommendations for shadowing are based on particular experiences and may not generalize to all shadowing engagements, they offer concrete, practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate and situational character of shadowing, and offer strategies for coping with the distinctive requirements of shadowing.

An online questionnaire was completed by male (N=116) and female (N=126) university students from various cultural backgrounds. To evaluate the proposed relationships, multiple regression analysis was used. The findings suggest that attractiveness is related to attitudes to academic achievement and success through its association with social appeal and acceptance. Ethnic identity is also related to both academic achievement and post university success. Personality is not positively related to academic achievement. Finally, social acceptance is positively related to academic achievement for males and to success for females. Whilst the survey targeted students from various cultural backgrounds studying in Australia, it did not look at university students from other countries.

"Word-of-mouth: The use of source expertise in the evaluation of familiar and unfamiliar brands","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931056973&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-02-2013-0027&partnerID=40&md5=3fbe6ecffd2295fa1b8a0e262ba246a9","Purpose – This research was designed to expand the understanding of how brand familiarity may affect the motivation to process word-of-mouth (WOM) information in brand evaluation. The pre-WOM brand attitude certainty is expected to explain the moderation effect. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Two experiments were conducted. The study participants were undergraduate students from a major university in Singapore. The main statistical analysis was done using a two-way analysis of covariance. Findings – The results of Experiments 1 and 2 support the prediction that consumers are more likely to use the perceived expertise of the WOM sender to evaluate an unfamiliar brand vs a familiar brand. Experiment 2 also provides some preliminary evidence that this interaction effect may be due to the difference in certainty of the study respondents in regards to the pre-WOM evaluation of unfamiliar and familiar brand. Research limitations/implications – This manipulation method of presenting WOM in a printed format may understate the impact of WOM. A more vivid manipulation of WOM that allows for a feedback loop may be considered for future research. Practical implications – The results highlight the importance of considering the strength dimensions of brand attitudes (e.g. attitude certainty) in the marketplace. For marketers of unfamiliar brands, source factors (e.g. expertise of WOM sender) are important to consider for effective use of WOM to market their products. For familiar brands, source factors are less relevant. Originality/value – This paper highlights the importance of considering attitude certainty and the subsequent malleability of attitude toward new information about the brand in the marketplace. Hence, marketers and researchers who are interested in changing brand attitude should take meta-attitude factors into consideration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Word of mouth marketing",""

The current research aims to develop and test an integrative model of factors determining consumers’ acceptance of IoT technology. Design/methodology/approach – Based on technology acceptance model (TAM), the authors proposed an IoT acceptance model that consists of three technology factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and trust); one social context factor (social influence); and two individual user characteristics (perceived enjoyment and perceived behavioral control). Data from 368 Chinese consumers were used to test the research model through the use of structural equation modeling. Findings – The results showed particularly strong support for the effects of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived enjoyment, and perceived behavioral control. However, trust played an insignificant role in predicting the intention. In addition, perceived ease of use and trust were found to affect perceived usefulness. Compared with the individual TAM model, the integrated model provides more explanation on user behavioral intention toward IoT usage. Originality/value – The integrated model explores the driving factors of individuals’ willingness to use IoT technology from the perspectives of the technology itself, social context and individual user characteristic. It links the constructs of social influence, enjoyment, and perceived behavioral control to the TAM and successfully extends TAM in the IoT technology context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hybrid intelligent business systems; Information systems; Innovation adoption behaviour; Innovation diffusion; RFID application to logistic",""

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between consumer innate innovativeness, vicarious innovativeness, domain specific innovativeness, the desire for unique consumer products, and the adoption of consumer electronic products across three countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, China, and Taiwan. Design/methodology/approachData were collected through a survey in Melbourne, Australia, Shanghai, China and Taipei, Taiwan. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling. FindingsThis study finds that domain specific innovativeness primarily influences the adoption of such products across the three countries. The study further suggests that vicarious innovativeness affects Australians' new product adoption behavior. In contrast, the desire for unique consumer products is a predictor of new product adoption for customers with a Chinese cultural background. Surprisingly, the authors find that consumer innate innovativeness has a negative effect on vicarious innovativeness. Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides further insights into relationships between consumer innovativeness measures. Practical implicationsThis study enhances marketers' capabilities to develop various launching strategies in different countries and providing further insights into relationships between consumer innovativeness measures.

Design/methodology/approachThe authors use survey data of 487 Vietnamese consumers in a food context. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach for moderator analysis with latent constructs is used to test the hypotheses. FindingsCSS has a positive effect on CRL, while VS has a negative effect on CRL. CSS is found to have a positive moderator effect on the category satisfaction-category repurchase loyalty relationship. More interestingly, CSS still interacts with VS to positively influence this relationship. Research limitations/implicationsThe object and setting of this study is limited to one product category in one market. The nature of causality is problematic due to the use of survey design. Practical implicationsThose findings imply that a product category extension with alternatives providing complementary benefits will have a higher chance of success with satisfied consumers, especially those with high VS, than with less satisfied consumers. Social implicationsThe study recommends that people should vary their diet to achieve different kinds of vitamins, minerals and tastes for their health. Similarly, the tourism industry should satisfy tourists' variety-seeking needs by exploring new categories. Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by discussing and highlighting positive moderator effects of CSS and VS on the satisfaction-loyalty relationship at a product category level.

Design/methodology/approach – Ethical issues that arose during a 12-week shadowing study that examined the work activities and practices of Canadian healthcare CEOs are discussed. Findings – Dividing the ethics process into two phases – those addressed by ethics committees (procedural ethics) and those that revealed themselves in the field (ethics in practice) – issues and relating to sampling, informed consent, researcher roles, objectivity, participant discomforts, the impact of research on participants, confidentiality, and anonymity are investigated. This paper illustrates that while useful, procedural ethics committees are unable to establish ethical practice in and of themselves. In response, it suggests that the concept of reflexivity be applied to ethics to help researchers consider the implications of using the shadowing method, and develop a contingency for possible challenges, before they enter the field. Practical implications – This paper provides researchers considering using the shadowing method with critical insights into some of the ethical issues associated with the method. A number of questions are posed and a number of suggestions offered as to how ethical practice can be attained in the field. Given practice-based similarities between shadowing and other qualitative methodologies such as participant observation and ethnography, many of the lessons derived from this case study are also pertinent to researchers using other techniques to examine organizational and management phenomenon.

The experimental study was based on a 4×2 betweensubjects design, with four levels of message types (personalization, interactivity, general, and no message control) and two levels of permission (with and without permission). Structural equation modeling was utilized to test the hypotheses. SMS marketing is found to have a significant positive impact on brand awareness and perceived quality. Personalized, interactive, and general messages are effective for building brand awareness, and general and personalized messages positively influence perceived quality. With the right choice of message, explicit permission enhances the effects of SMS marketing on brand association. The experiment was conducted over a period of one month, with three SMS ads sent to each subject. Future research could extend the trial period and increase the number and variation of ads to confirm validity of the results. As text message ads have a strong impact on brand awareness, marketers should focus on using text messages as reminders or updates rather than for complete marketing campaigns. They should also focus on offering permissionbased customers personalized information. This is among the first mobile marketing experiments in a reallife setting.

Design/methodology/approach – Data was collected in a specialty wine store in Adelaide, Australia using a self-administered questionnaire. A 22-item Perceived Risk Scale (PRS) was developed and operationalised in this study returning a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.717. FindingsThe highest perceived risk dimension, namely financial risk, did not differ between risk segments, while the high perceived risk segment observed more social risk than the low perceived risk segment. The high-perceived risk segment also observed more psychological risk. Information seeking was the most important RRS used across seven different wine consumption occasions. The decreasing order of importance in consumption occasions had an inverse relationship to the closeness of the relationship the wine consumers had with those with whom they may consume the wine they had purchased. Research limitations/implications – Marketers and managers have the opportunity to target consumers mindful of their specific perceived risks, and help reduce these uncertainties through the use of individualised RRS management focused on consumers' occasion-based wine purchases.

While several scholars have reflected on this technique, comparatively few researchers have explicated the specific practices that constitute this method and discussed their implications for research on processes of organizing. The purpose of this article is to address these issues by offering a conceptual toolbox that defines shadowing in terms of a set of framing practices and provides in-depth insight into the methodological choices and challenges that organizational shadowers may encounter. Design/methodology/approach– In this article, the authors explicate the specific framing practices in which researchers engage when taking an intersubjective approach to organizational shadowing. To demonstrate the value of viewing shadowing as framing, the paper grounds the theoretical discussion in actual fieldwork experiences, taken from three different ethnographic studies. Findings– Based on a systematic and critical analysis of fieldwork experiences, the paper argues that organizational shadowing is constituted by three interrelated framing practices: delineating the object of study; punctuating the process/flow of a given organizing process; and reflecting on the relationship between researcher and the object(s) or person(s) being observed. These analytical constructs highlight specific activities with which shadowers are confronted in the field, namely foregrounding and backgrounding particular aspects in defining a given object of study, trying to keep this object in focus as the fieldwork unfolds, and making decisions about the degree to which the relationship with shadowees should be taken into account in understanding this object. Originality/value– This article provides an in-depth reflection on the subtle practices that constitute organizational shadowing. It offers a useful conceptual toolbox for researchers who want to use this method and demonstrates its operational value to help them understand how knowledge construction is the outcome of a coconstructive process that depends on a series of decisions negotiated in ongoing interactions with the actors under study. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complicity; Framing; Intersubjectivity; Organizational shadowing; Organizational theory; Organizing; Reflexivity; Research; Sensemaking",""

It aims at increasing the understanding of these complexities from an emic perspective of employees with a Christian background, thereby providing in-depth information on the topic. These new insights provide fresh ideas for further research on this topic in the Tanzanian context. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative data were selected from a more comprehensive case study carried out in multiple governmental, educational, ecclesiastical and economic organizations in Tanzania. The case study was based on phenomenological and interpretative paradigms and hermeneutical interpretations using qualitative methodology including in-depth interviews and observation during field stays, as well as documentary and secondary analysis. Findings – The findings show that senior management staff of ecclesiastical organizations function as mediators for conflicting parties to regain harmony and peace through third-party intervention and spiritual self-development. Mediation in ecclesiastical organizations is mainly used in relationship conflicts, employment conflicts and church re-structuring processes. It supports the resolution of value conflicts between the conflict parties and the environment and at the same time re-constructs religious and Christian values and concepts, such as the concept of “Shalom” and “creating lobe” and thereby re-enforces spiritual integrity and the reality of the church. Research limitations/implications – The findings are not generalizable and are limited to this specific research context. Findings should be verified by follow-up studies which expand the content, the context and the methodological approach of this study. These findings should be viewed as exploratory research findings and as highly contextual and sample-bound.

Design/methodology/approach– Anchored in cognitive approaches, the methods relied on a generally applicable conceptual framework, on cognitive mapping for an intellectualized conception, and on in-depth interviews for an experiential conception on different participants’ judgments of managerial courage within the same context. Findings– The mixed methods approach allowed the study first, to uncover two kinds of managerial courage. Second, while the intellectualized conceptions led to the enumeration of a greater number of positive consequences for third parties, the conceptions resulting from recollections of experiences focused more on the consequences for the protagonist. Third, the conceptual framework allowed the authors to distinguish between the results obtained from the two distinct data collection methods: the moral dimension, present in the more intellectualized cognitive maps, was largely absent from the consequences identified by participants in the conception of managerial courage resulting from experience. Originality/value– This approach has provided two original methodological contributions. The first is the development of a widely applicable conceptual framework useful for studying polysemic concepts and for treating data generated by both approaches.

Design/methodology/approach – The relative importance of automated service factors to customer delight, trust, and commitment was examined. The paper then proposed a conceptual model of the relationship between automated factors, customer delight, trust, and commitment within the UAE banking context. A survey was designed and data collected through the mall intercept method. AMOS 6 was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings – Most of the automated factors have no direct relationship with customer commitment, but an indirect one through customer trust and delight. Automated factors have a direct and positive influence on customer delight, which in turn has a direct influence on both customer trust and customer commitment. Customer trust is also related positively and directly to customer commitment. Research limitations/implications – This research has been applied to the financial institutions in the UAE.

The research examines the impact of “lifestyle” variables (convenience, use patterns, and status) on credit card use. Data were collected through mall intercept technique in six metropolitan cities of India. A selfadministered questionnaire was distributed to customers visiting the malls. Use and convenience emerged as the major determinants of credit card use among Indian customers. Use, convenience, and status attributes were moderated by “sense of belonging” and “sense of fulfilment” dimensions of MILOV. Young customers were likely to use credit cards. The study does not examine the influence of customer income, occupation, and education on credit card use, as many customers were not willing to disclose the information. These demographic factors can influence customers' perception towards credit card ownership and use. The findings can be of immense use to international and Indian banks in marketing of credit cards.

This study attempts to empirically examine some important elements (e.g. relationship quality, loyalty, and cooperation) that might promote a successful long-term franchising relationship between franchisors and franchisees of convenience stores in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 500 surveys were mailed to a random sample of convenience stores’ franchisees among the four main franchisors in Taiwan. This research first used correlation analysis to explore the associations between the constructs and then used a regression analysis to further explore patterns of associations. Findings – The results show that relationship quality is positively correlated with the cooperation between franchisors and franchisees, as well as with franchisee loyalty. Additionally, the cooperative behavior between franchisees and franchisors is significantly correlated with franchisees’ loyalty. Research limitations/implications – Data were only collected through four key convenience stores’ franchise chain systems in Taiwan. To develop a more global perspective, further replications of this study are necessary to examine the stability of our results in other contexts. Practical implications – This research has highlighted that small business owners operating in a franchise system should pay attention to the importance of relationship quality, loyalty, and cooperation in stabilizing franchising relationships and enhancing competitive advantage. Originality/value – The majority of studies on franchising relationships are conducted in a Western context.

Anchored in a process ontology, this paper starts from the idea that doing research implies a performance in which the researcher is fully immersed, and explores the implications of the processual nature of doing research. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes use of vignettes; short stories of research in action, told by different researchers that are analyzed to reveal the richness of the situation in question. These vignettes illustrate how performing qualitative research is an emotional, embodied and deeply personal experience. Findings – The authors show that when grounding qualitative research in a process ontology, research is the fruit of the researcher’s performance: doing research is performing it, and performing it cannot happen without feeling a wide range of emotions, without appealing to who we are or without questioning what we are doing. Thus, this exploration reveals that doing research is a rich, complex and multi-level experience that mobilizes the whole person conducting this inquiry – that is, that doing research takes the form of a thick performance. Originality/value – The value of the paper lies in its roots in a process ontology to understand the doing of qualitative research, which makes it possible to fully acknowledge the importance of subjectivity in all the steps that make up the research endeavor, from the fieldwork to writing – thus offering not only a richer image of what research is about, but an image that is also closer to the experience of doing it. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Doing research; Emotions; Performance; Process ontology; Qualitative research; Research methods; Vignettes",""

"The influences of electronic word-of-mouth message appeal and message source credibility on brand attitude","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870451221&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111165020&partnerID=40&md5=76aef878e80f6d6f5db7d0aa8c2d0f3e","Purpose – Based on message source theory, the purpose of this paper is to use positive electronic wordofmouth (eWOM) settings to examine the influence of message source credibility on brand attitude (brand trust, brand affection, and purchase intention). The current study also uses the elaboration likelihood model to examine the moderating effect of product involvement on the relationships between message appeals (rational vs emotional) and brand attitude, as well as between message source credibility and brand attitude. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected via internet questionnaires. Based on the internet investigation and pretest, this study chose the stimuli for research products, virtual brands, eWOM, and message source credibility. Via a 2 (notebooks vs shampoo) ∗2 (appeal: rational vs emotional) experimental design, 211 effective samples were collected to verify the hypotheses of this study. Findings – The results, for both notebooks and shampoo, are: the positive eWOM message with higher message source credibility indicates a better brand attitude than the eWOM message with lower message source credibility, and this effect is not moderated by the degree of product involvement, indicating its robustness. Second, with a high degree of product involvement, the rational appeal indicates a better brand attitude than the emotional appeal; no significant difference is found when product involvement drops to a low level. Originality/value – Previous research investigating the moderating effect of involvement on the effects of messageappeal types and the message source credibility of eWOM is rare. The main contribution of this study is to fill this gap. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand attitude; Brand trust; Brands; Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM);; Internet; Message appeal; Message source credibility; Product involvement",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how value changes in Cambodian society affect development of the tourism industry and to evaluate the events having potential impact on tourism market development. The Delphi qualitative forecasting technique has been utilized in a variety of settings as a powerful market research tool. In this empirical study, the Delphi method is utilized to predict the future tourism and hospitality scenarios for Cambodia from 2005 through 2020, as well as their marketing policy implications at regional and national levels. A representative sample of diverse groups of Cambodia tourism and hospitality industry experts were pooled for data collection. The study results indicate that experts predict more structural changes will be taking place in the tourism and hospitality industry. An interesting study finding is that most of the tourism and hospitality events will take place in the medium and longterm horizon. It is predicted that there will not be much change in value orientations of Cambodians, except for significant change in high value of materialism and interactive learning and cultural exchanges. The research offers implications for tourism researchers, the Cambodian government tourism ministry, as well as tourism industry actors.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper focuses on the above objectives and aims at shedding light on them by testing some hypotheses. A structured questionnaire was applied to 144 Turkish companies and 71 Lebanese companies through the mail. The response rate was 20 percent for the Turkish sample and 23 percent for the Lebanese. Findings – Some differences were identified between high and lowperforming Turkish and Lebanese manufacturing companies regarding the perception of export problems. The differences were grouped and discussed under internal and external export problems. Highlighted effects of such internal export problems were insufficient production capacity, packaging, and exporting being difficult and costly; and external problems were the imposition of hightariff/nontariff barriers by foreign countries. Originality/value – Whilst some of the literature has focused on company export barriers, there is a lack of studies investigating the effects of those problems on export performance, especially in developing countries.

Strong price satisfaction enhances and sustains high quality business relationships, leading to improved profits for chain participants. The purpose of this paper is to explore the dimensions of price satisfaction in the context of the Malaysian dairy industry. The aim is to determine which dimensions of price satisfaction affect relationship performance between Malaysian dairy producers and the dairy processers who purchase their milk. In total, eight hypotheses are tested using partial least square methods on survey results from 133 dairy producers in Malaysia. The study results suggest that relative price, pricequality ratio and price fairness influence producers' loyalty and improved business relationship performance. To achieve longterm, sustainable business relationships involving consistent high quality supplies, milk buyers need to understand and capture the price satisfaction dimensions.

Findings – It was found that the two samples converge in their views on free commercial speech, selfregulation, and regulation by market forces. Yet, the Chinese are more likely than their US counterparts to support government regulation, endorse legal ban on strong sexual and indecent content, and favor rigorous advertising regulation. The females of both countries are more enthusiastic than their male counterparts about regulating strong sexual images in advertising and requiring advertising to promote positive values. Both countries witness considerable generational gaps, as the older respondents are more conservative in their views and more likely to support rigorous regulation of advertising.

This perspective is proposed as a complementary perspective to the cultural perspective that dominates as an explanation of cooperation problems. The focus of the research is multiprofessional teamwork in contemporary Swedish health care. Design/methodology/approach – Four cases studies, in which the cooperation in daily work is described, are used to test the two perspectives. The cases concern the cooperative methods health care professionals use when work conditions depend upon an internal norm of mutual cooperation. Although the research is not designed to evaluate the two perspectives, it permits the rational explanations of cooperation problems to be compared with possibly cultural explanations. Findings – The investigation concludes that health care cooperation problems may be primarily explained by the rational perspective, and only secondarily by the cultural perspective. The actors can be seen as underinstitutionalised in the sense they have not yet developed the intra-organisational norms of cooperation needed for the provision of customised health care. Originality/value – The paper provides a complementary explanatory framework of cooperation problems based on actors’ perceptions of their self-interests as producers. The examples of uncooperative behaviour reflect two forms of the free rider problem that Ostrom describes as a Common Pool Resource Problem. Management has to prove that cooperation is beneficial to the team members and has to promote a cooperative team spirit by instilling a common understanding of the concept of cooperation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Health care; Organizational culture; Sweden; Team working",""

More specifically, the authors examine the impact of rebranding awareness and attitude towards rebranding on the members' perceived value of their memberships, their satisfaction and, subsequently, their commitment to the organisation. Design/methodology/approach – The research employed indepth interviews followed by a quantitative survey. Data were collected online from 264 current members of Dogs SA and data analysis employed SEM principles. Findings – Findings demonstrate that the members' awareness of a rebranding attempt can significantly enhance perceived membership value, leading to increased levels of satisfaction. With both perceived value and satisfaction antecedents of membership commitment, the importance of such improvements cannot be underestimated. Research limitations/implications – Despite a high response rate of 88 per cent, only ten per cent of the membership base was included in the initial sample. Limitations relate to the single context, a canine association, and single rebranding attempt examined in this paper. Only three outcome measures were included, namely membership value, satisfaction and commitment. Practical implications – While nonprofit memberowned organisations play an increasingly important role in our economic and social environment, participation rates are dropping in many such organisations. If they are to remain viable, the commitment of existing members must be improved. The study provides managers with important insight into a potentially powerful strategy to increase underpin membership dedication by means of satisfaction and enhanced perceived value. Originality/value – This paper successfully integrates relationship marketing and rebranding literature domains, producing significant implications for nonprofit membership organisations. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Brands; Non-profit organizations; Relationship marketing",""

Although SNA has roots in anthropological and ethnographic research, recent emphasis has been on the mathematical properties of social networks utilising graph theory and statistical analysis. While such studies may present interesting data on the structure of ties, this paper argues that they sidestep other important elements of patterns of social relationships; their meaning and their implications for network members. The paper identifies how SNA survey can be employed alongside ethnographic data within a qualitative framework. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports on a study that investigated how knowledge sharing in social networks can contribute to patient safety in surgical care involving a social network survey, qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations.

A matched sample of young consumers from four Asian cities was asked to nominate ads that they both liked and disliked. They also provided reasons as to why they were liked and disliked and the effect this had on their purchase intentions. The results were analysed using multiple and logistic regression. Findings show that ad likeability increases if people feel that advertising provides something to talk about. Conversely, people who find advertising annoying have higher ratings of ad dislikeability. Results also show that a close relationship exists between liking (disliking) television ads and buying more (less) of the advertised products. However, differences exist between Asian cities. The results suggest that adherence to a standardised regional advertising strategy based on assumptions that close geography and a seemingly sufficiently close culture within the Asian region is appropriate, could lead to disappointing results. The only commonality is that disliked ads reduce intention to purchase. Previous research does not consider the unique influences of ad likeability and dislikeability in the decision of whether to standardize or adapt advertising within the Asian region. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertisements; China; Consumer behaviour; India; Indonesia; Television; Young consumers",""

This paper aims to investigate this relatively “new” construct and its impact on product evaluation and subsequent willingness to buy crossethnic products amongst Australian consumers. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a quasiexperiment method. Data were collected from an intercept sample of 212 Australian consumers via personal interviews. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics, and hypotheses were tested using regression analysis and twoway between groups ANOVA. Findings – The results provide evidence that higher levels of CR translate into more negative evaluations of product quality which, in turn, decrease willingness to buy products perceived as originating from the ethnic minority. Further, regardless of the importance of product outcome, CR has a consistent negative effect on product evaluation and willingness to buy amongst Australian consumers. Research limitations/implications – Future research could be expanded into other ethnic groups and other countries, and could include other moderators such as level of interaction. CR construct can also be examined in service contexts.

Design/methodology/approach – The argument proposed in the paper is based on a critical literature review conducted on the Psychinfo, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science databases. Findings – Recent years have seen cultural changes in the values and goals of healthcare interventions that are deeply reconfiguring HCO&S. These changes are reframing HCO&S action and are highlighting the importance of understanding and managing not only the “expert context” but also the “lay contexts” of healthcare interventions. In an attempt to deal with these emergent changes (and challenges), HCO&S are taking advantage of new insights matured in the post-modern turn of organizational analysis. In this frame, qualitative research proves suitable for connecting HCO&S needs and priorities with the new post-modern paradigm of knowledge- and practice-sharing in organizations.

In largeformat retail situations, customers maintain a nonpersonal association with the store and personal relationships with salespersons. By contrast, many customers in developing countries such as India build and maintain longterm relationships directly with the smallscale retailers, who happen to be the owners as well as the salespersons of the store. The purpose of this paper is to focus on customer dependence on the retailer, a rare phenomenon which is evident in rural areas of India even today. The paper is based on an empirical study of a buyerseller relationship between a farmer and a chemical fertilizer retailer, which is a common interpersonal business constellation in India. The paper identifies the determinants of customer dependence as customer perceived market uncertainty, product importance and product familiarity.

This paper aims to present the enlivenment of branding in Chinese within the cross-strait markets of Taiwan and Mainland China, which underlies various ideologies. Design/methodology/approach – This study primarily reviews literatures of brand and brand name translation, defines the essentiality of brand naming, and outlines the branding strategies for entering cross-strait markets. Furthermore, this study validates the using of substantially interpreted brands that support the authors' four developed propositions. Findings – This study compares substantially interpreted brands in cross-strait markets with a reference to commonly used translation methods.

It aims is to investigate how ethnic and national cultures might interact to influence the attitude towards skin beauty and hence the willingness to buy skin care products. Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 370 Chinese Singaporean women was conducted to test the proposed links. The study adopts an empirical approach using structural equation modelling. Findings – Both traditional Chinese and national Singaporean cultural values impact the attitude of Chinese Singaporean women towards skin beauty and their willingness to buy skin care cosmetics. The components of the traditional Chinese values (Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism) and national Singaporean values were found to have differing impact on the attitude towards skin beauty and the purchase intention of skin care cosmetics among Singaporean women. Confucianism was found to have a very strong impact on skin fairness and whitening, national Singaporeans' values were found to have a strong impact on skin antiageing, and Buddhist values were found to have moderate impact on attitude towards skin smoothness and skin fairness and on the willingness to buy skin smoothening and skin whitening cosmetics. Research limitations/implications – Even though the sample can be considered large, given the number of variables in the model, it would be wise to rely on a larger sample. In addition, the research was about specific cosmetics products, namely those related to skin care. It is judicious to extend the analysis to other categories and types of products. For expatriate ethnic groups, it is recommended that marketers think about the interaction between their traditional values and the values of the host country, as these have dual effects on their attitudes and hence on their buying intention. The interaction between these values is not static across products. It varies in size and combination across types of attitudes and products. Practical implications – Traditional ethnic and national cultural values have differing impact in terms of significance and size on the attitude towards face beauty. Hence, marketing actions such as positioning and advertising should be customized accordingly, to target at these values in an attempt to influence attitude, and hence purchase behavior. Attitude plays a mediating role between cultural values and purchase intention. Influencing consumers' willingness to buy involves influencing their attitudes. Originality/value – Few works have surveyed the dual influence of national and ethnic values on a specific ethnic subgroup in Asia. To the authors' knowledge, there no previous research has been conducted for Singapore.

Findings – The paper presents the advantages and drawbacks of tools to articulate practices and to develop hypotheses for change. It emphasizes the approach’s innovative value and potential in contributing to knowledge sharing in organizations, and the implications for researchers and participants. Practical implications – The paper furnishes concrete suggestions on how practitioners and researchers/consultants can be induced to pay particular attention to aspects of the operational knowledge that should accompany change processes. This appears even more strategic in healthcare organizations, characterized by the constant need to update the operational system in response to the introduction of new technologies, procedures, and protocols. Originality/value – The paper discusses how research dimensions and results can be linked with action practices, while at the same time reducing the divide between researcher and practitioner.

"The effect of perceived quality on brand equity: an empirical study on generic drugs","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865369069&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111183057&partnerID=40&md5=82ce2d8aa3f742cbd9a97e3164db004e","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to find out the relationship between the qualities of generic drugs perceived by the physicians and brand equity of the branded generics and to examine the physicians' perceptions of prescribing generic drugs for selective medical conditions in India. Design/methodology/approach – The study was carried out across six major cities in Eastern India with 392 physicians. Here components of perceived quality, i.e. intrinsic cues and extrinsic cues are hypothesized to influence perceived quality of branded generics which in turn influence brand equity. It is also hypothesized that respondents' quality experience is assimilated towards their quality expectations, independent of small variations in objective quality of the drug. Findings – Results showed that perceived quality of branded generics significantly, but indirectly, affected brand equity through the mediating variables, intrinsic cues and extrinsic cues. The results also showed that physicians' quality experience leads to quality expectations, independent of small variations in drug quality on five common yet serious diseases in India. Practical implications – Current research finds that for prescriptionbased branded generic drugs, perceived quality mainly depends on intrinsic cues; therefore, managers should be interested in intrinsic cues that increase brand equity and necessary marketing actions should be implemented accordingly. Originality/value – No other scholarly article has been developed, so far, analyzing the effect of perceived quality on brand equity in the Indian branded generic drug segment. Besides providing evidence from the Indian pharmaceutical context about the impact of quality cues, the paper also presents evidence on physicians' quality observation of branded generics on five common yet serious diseases in India. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand equity; Doctors; Drugs; Extrinsic cues; Generics; India; Intrinsic cues; Perceived quality; Perception; Quality",""
"Online exchanges among cancer patients and caregivers: Constructing and sharing health knowledge about time","2012","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931024747&doi=10.1108%2f17465641211279789&partnerID=40&md5=1d7d9599eb40a672aa23b85f85a898a0","Purpose – The meanings attributed to the quality of a person’s illness experience result from important processes of co-construction not only between healthcare professionals and patients but also among patients and caregivers. In the case of advanced cancer, new treatments extend patients’ lives but they raise the problem of the quality of this “renewed time”. Lay contexts of exchanges appear crucial for orienting the attribution of meaning to the time with cancer and for sharing practices to manage it. Furthermore, the internet is becoming an important space in which cancer patients meet and construct knowledge regarding their illness. The aim of this paper is to study knowledge- and practice-construction among advanced cancer patients and caregivers, and to explore the suitability of online forums for analysis of these processes. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses the results of a qualitative study based on one online forum for long-term cancer patients (second relapse) and one for caregivers. The discussions explored show how patients and caregivers attribute meanings to their time with cancer. Verbatim transcripts of the discussions were analyzed according to the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) procedure. Findings – The findings suggest the system of medical representations regarding health and illness should take greater account of other (lay) systems of representations and that the internet could be a valuable resource to support the development of spontaneous networks of patient and caregivers through which to organize health interventions and to involve patients and caregivers more closely in the care and cure process. Research limitations/implications – The study examines the experiences of a particular subset of patients/caregivers who were internet-literate and might be considered more “active” in their coping with the disease over a fairly limited time span. These potential limitations are being remedied in continuing research projects. Practical implications – The authors’ experience with this research design suggests qualitative research may be particularly valuable in casting light on emergent phenomena such as spontaneous social networks on the internet, and in encouraging more participative forms of research engagement. Originality/value – These findings may orient therapeutic interventions to be more closely attuned to the needs of long-term cancer patients and their caregivers. Online forums enable participants to disclose experiences, share knowledge, and co-construct “good practices” for illness management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cancer; Health care; Knowledge management; Patients; Social networks",""

However, comparatively very few qualitative studies opt for this means of data collection. The purpose of this paper is to argue in favour of a medium that has generally been second-rated in qualitative research. It aims at establishing telephone interviews as an equally viable option to other established methods of qualitative data collection. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is informed by the authors’ experience of using this method, as well as the limited number of previous research articles presented on the topic. It discusses its specific strengths and limitations, drawing on a conducted longitudinal study to illustrate key points. Its application to particular qualitative analysis methods, in view of the acknowledged requirements for each of these approaches, is also presented. Findings – Telephone conversations naturally follow an agenda-driven format that is initiated by the caller, similar to semi-structured interviews. The authors propose that the telephone medium and interview modality are complementary. Also, the interview transcripts provide rich textual data that can subsequently be analysed using a range of qualitative data analysis methods. Originality/value – Focus is placed on the methodological strengths of using telephone interviews in qualitative research, rather than convenience factors which have been the most featured element in previous literature. The paper aims at informing researchers who want to consider using the telephone medium for qualitative data collection and analysis. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data collection; Interviews; Qualitative research; Research methods; Telephones",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 100 university students in Pakistan belonging to the age group 1928 years old. The research was concentrated in the mobile phone service sector. Data analysis was conducted using statistical analysis software SPSS. Findings – The results indicate that stated preference set and actual choice behavior are dissimilar. The generation Y adults sub group contraindicates loyalty characteristics as high in a developing market context against the established wisdom of low loyalty found in developed countries. The perceptual maps of brands indicate no distinct personality characteristics necessitating marketers to rethink their strategies in this service industry. Finally, this research reconciles the gap between loyalty, stated preference and distinctiveness of brand personalities.

Design/methodology/approach – The study targeted the population of 1,300 professional members of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Australia, employing the triangulation of both mail survey and indepth interview techniques. A total of 147 usable questionnaires were returned and seven interviews conducted. Data were analysed using the SPSS 13.0 software and thematic analysis technique. Findings – It is found that all proposed business, logistics and managementrelated skills and knowledge are important for logistics professionals. Logisticsrelated skill and knowledge set was found to be the area that educational and training institution in Australia should particularly aim at to further equip local logistics workforce with substantial skills and knowledge to perform their job successfully. In addition, universities and other training institutions should focus on developing and providing specific courses, especially professional development courses, to prepare logistics professionals with a broader skill set for the future. Research limitations/implications – The major limitation of this research is that the revised BLM framework has just been tested only in Australia. Future research direction is desired, e.g. conducting the study using the same instruments in other countries to increase the reliability and validity of the proposed revised framework. Originality/value – Although this study was designed on the BLM framework, it has gone further to elaborate the framework and incorporated a number of additional skills and knowledge which are considered to be critical in the contemporary business environment, and thus it helps to enrich the contemporary literature on logistics knowledge and skill set for logistics professionals. This study is also of benefit to managers in logistics firms as they can identify important skills and knowledge to improve on, while policy makers and educational and training bodies can also use the findings from this research to design and implement courses which are necessary to facilitate skill and knowledge development for logistics workforce. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; BLM framework; Distribution management; Knowledge development; Logistics professionals; Skill requirements; Skills facilitation",""

Further, the paper evaluates whether the proposed model can enhance understanding of the study of employee identification in a specific organizational situation and context. Design/methodology/approach– The identification model extends a multidimensional model for media reception originally proposed by Schrøder in the field of media reception studies. The proposed model includes the following reception dimensions: comprehension, discrimination, implementation, motivation, and position. Findings– This paper illustrates how employees from a Danish windmill company receive a value statement. A systematic application of the multidimensional model makes it possible to gain detailed insight into the active and complex process of employee identifications with organizational texts and how they may fluctuate in a specific context. Research limitations/implications– This analysis only focuses on the reception of a value statement. Future research could include the analysis of employee readings of other types of organizational texts.

Design/methodology/approach – SPI was utilised to develop a “narrative” of the author’s own “action-oriented” research experience within a multisector collaborative venture established by 13 partner organisations representing the academic, pharmaceutical industry and government sectors. The “confessional” stance that the study assumes describes some of the perceived tensions enacted during field work. The SPI approach is theoretical and reflective, as well as descriptive and analytical, in reporting the antecedents, actions, and outcomes in action-oriented research. Findings – Because the focus of the paper is subjective, personal, and introspective, it does not illustrate “findings” about multisector collaboration, but rather reflections and insights about the way the research was conducted. Practical implications – The paper widens the forum for incorporating SPI beyond the consumer behaviour context to the context in which action-oriented researchers incorporate introspection in their study of organisations. Originality/value – The paper goes some way to bridging the gap between SPI and reflexivity (if there is indeed a gap) and it causes qualitative, action-oriented organisational researchers to contemplate a number of questions: what is the role of the researcher; what is the source of their authority to narrate and what are they authorised to recount; and what are the consequences of this? © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Action research; Individual psychology; Qualitative methods; Reflection",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered from students and the general public with selfcompleted surveys using measures for materialism and culture. Findings – In the first stage of analysis, levels of materialism were examined across countries. Overall, materialism was higher for the Chinese than the Canadians on all Richins and Dawson's dimensions except acquisition centrality. To investigate these unexpected results, levels of Hofstede's cultural dimensions were compared across country, age, and gender and it was seen that the Chinese outscored Canadians on all dimensions except uncertainty avoidance. Finally, the association between the components of materialism and dimensions of culture was examined and a cultural explanation for at least part of the difference in level of materialism between the two countries found. Research limitations/implications – Data were collected in specific regions of the countries. Owing to the characteristics of the two regions, a more general approach to data sampling would likely produce even more pronounced differences than those noted here. Practical implications – A better understanding of the nature of materialism and how it varies across cultures should enable marketers, policy makers, and social planners to act more effectively. Originality/value – This paper finds some unexpected differences in materialism and goes on to find that the cultural differences between Canada and China have changed since the original Hofstede data were collected. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Canada; China; Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural marketing; Cultural values; Materialism",""

Data are collected through the use of a selfadministered highly structured questionnaire in both metropolitan and rural areas of Adelaide in South Australia. The sample consists of consumers who had at least one time BYOB of wine experience. A response rate of 73 percent was achieved resulting in 101 useable surveys. During the operationalization process a scale was designed for measuring consumers' wine involvement level. Consumers' involvement level with wine as a product has a direct effect on consumers' BYOB of wine behaviour. Highinvolved wine consumers have a higher tendency to BYOB than lowinvolved wine consumers. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of financial motivations for BYOB, highinvolved wine consumers are more concerned about functional reasons, while lowinvolved wine consumers are more concerned about social and time reasons. There is a positive relationship between consumers' wine involvement level and their attitudes towards having to pay corkage fees for BYOB. The restaurant and wine industries could enter into mutually beneficial arrangements to cope with the increasingly popular BYOB practice. For example, wineries can partner with restaurants to have permission for consumers to BYOB of their wine to the partnered restaurant without paying any corkage fees. In return, the wineries can provide a “corkage fee subsidy” to the partnered restaurants. Although tentative due to the exploratory nature of this study, these findings may provide useful information to the restaurant and wine industry and would benefit further from investigation on a larger scale. This study is of value to academic researchers, the restaurant industry and the wine industry alike. It is unique in that it examines the relationship between consumer involvement with wine as a product and how this impacts upon their onpremise behaviour, with a specific focus on their BYOB behaviour. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Bringyourownbottle; BYOB; Consumer behaviour; Involvement; Onpremise; Restaurant; Riskreduction, Wines",""

Principally a conceptual paper, this study focuses upon how a more complete understanding of consumer roles can be leveraged to create sustainable loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – This study comprised an examination of the tribe's social behaviour, membership roles and influence on individual consumption. The research was approached interpretively with a case study design investigating a tribe of vinyl record collectors in a New Zealand context. Findings – Key findings include the confirmation of Kozinets' antecedents of tribal membership and the four roles of tribal members previously conceptualised by Cova and Cova. The tribe was found to have a core set of values that moderated any individual differences. A hierarchy, managed through the distribution of “cultural capital”, was found to exist amongst the group. In an extension of Cova's modelling a fifth role of “Chief” was identified, whereby the Chief was found to act as an opinion leader and organiser amongst the group. Research limitations/implications – Owing to constraints of both time and research funding, only one tribe was examined in this case study, hence the results are very specific to the group studied. Future research should apply the managerial implications from this study to other case contexts to test and expand understanding of consumer tribe dynamics and the creation of consumer loyalty.

"Globalization does lead to change in consumer behavior: An empirical evidence of impact of globalization on changing materialistic values in Indian consumers and its aftereffects","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871080361&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111143204&partnerID=40&md5=b9175af0679c3ebee4aad5731ba6fb6e","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to empirically substantiate if the forces of globalization are impacting consumer culture and behavioral traits in a developing country (India). Design/methodology/approach – Five hypotheses had been constructed to address the gaps in the literature with respect to the influence of globalization on prevalent consumer culture of a developing nation. Predisposition towards foreign brand among Indian consumers was taken as a proxy for global flows and its influence was studied on the existing materialistic values among the Indian consumers. The study covered a sample size of 557 respondents from five major cities in India. The raw data were collected with the help of structured questionnaire and analysis was done by using various relevant statistical techniques. Findings – The results showed that predisposition towards foreign brands had a significant impact on materialistic values among the Indian consumers. The younger Indian consumers had significantly higher materialistic values than the older age groups. Lower income groups have showed significantly greater materialistic values than the higher income groups. Significant positive relationships were shown between materialistic values and the buyer behavior traits studied. Practical implications – The managers should concentrate on the younger consumers, as they are the ones who are showing a definitive change in their buying behavior and increasing materialistic values. Alternatively, managers could modify their products to suit the requirements of older consumers. Originality/value – The study empirically showed that Indian consumers' predisposition towards foreign brands and their materialistic values had significant positive correlation among them. Also, predisposition towards foreign brands along with demographical variables like age and gender significantly impact the materialistic values prevalent among Indian consumers. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Buyer behaviour traits; Consumer behaviour; Globalization; Indian consumers; Materialistic values",""
"From “being there” to “being […] where?”: relocating ethnography","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931036756&doi=10.1108%2f17465641111188402&partnerID=40&md5=45e1122041b61e3987753c0628dab303","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to expand recent discussions of research practice in organizational ethnography by engaging in a reflexive examination of the ethnographer’s situated identity work across different research spaces: academic, personal and the research site itself. Design/methodology/approach – Examines concerns with the traditional notion of “being there” as it applies to ethnography in contemporary organization studies and, through a confessional account exploring the author’s own experiences as a PhD student conducting ethnography, considers “being [y] where?” using the analytic framework of situated identity work. Findings – Identifies both opportunities and challenges for organizational ethnographers facing the question of “being [y] where?” through highlighting the situated nature of researchers’ identity work in, across and between different (material and virtual) research spaces. Practical implications – The paper provides researchers with prompts to examine their own situated identity work, which may prove particularly useful for novice researchers and their supervisors, while also identifying the potential for incorporating these ideas within organizational ethnography more broadly. Originality/value – The paper offers situated identity work as a means to provide renewed analytic vigour to the confessional genre whilst highlighting new opportunities for reflexive and critical ethnographic research practice. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Confessional genre; Ethnography; Identity work; Organizations; Place; Reflexivity; Space",""

This both enriches psychoanalytic theories of the visual previously brought to bear on this topic and adds a valuable psychoanalytical perspective to visual organization studies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper extends Burkard Sievers’ concept of the “social photo matrix” (SPM) through an interdisciplinary review of literature in psychoanalysis, audiencing, media studies and social theory. Findings – A socially nuanced variant of the SPM is put forward as a way to explore organizational members’ experiences of work and employment, as part of a nascent “visual methodological approach” to studying organization(s). Research limitations/implications – The ideas within this conceptual paper would benefit from empirical investigation. This would be a fruitful and interesting possibility for future research. Practical implications – The paper concludes with a discussion of the contemporary utility of the SPM as a psychoanalytically-motivated method through which to understand visually-mediated effects of organizational action, as collectively experienced by their members and stakeholders.

"Assessing trade friendliness of logistics services in ASEAN","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885405392&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111183444&partnerID=40&md5=668e6d2570aceadc050851f53f8c7411","Purpose – Free trade agreements have been employed, either unilaterally or as a bloc, as an instrument to overcome the inefficiencies in trade brought about by the prevailing barriers and regulatory measures. During the tenth summit the leaders of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed to integrate their priority sectors with a vision to developing an ASEAN economic community whereby there would be a free flow of goods, services, investment and a freer flow of capital, equitable economic development, and reduced poverty and socioeconomic disparities. This market would have no price discrimination for commodities and against foreign goods, services, capital and labor. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current state of the crossborder trade in logistics services among ASEAN. The extent of the ease of crossborder trade is measured in terms of trade friendliness. The trade friendliness is a measure of the openness of ASEAN towards conducting free crossborder trade. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a series of semistructured interviews with 35 logistics and related firms operating in ASEAN. Findings – It was found that the unwieldy customs procedures and inspections, lack of coordination, and arbitrary rulings are some barriers to freer crossborder trade within ASEAN. Practical implications – In this paper, the authors have identified several barriers that influence logistics services across ASEAN. ASEAN must address these barriers before any further attempt of freer trade can be made. Originality/value – Studies have been conducted for the USA and Europe but not for the AsiaPacific. The AsiaPacific is a growing region for global trade and therefore assessing the trade openness or friendliness in the logistics sector is useful for taking further policy initiatives for developing an ASEAN economic community. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","ASEAN; Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Logistics; Logistics services; South East Asia; Trade; Trade barriers; Trade facilitation",""

Design/methodology/approach – Using the authors’ “e-research” pilot as a reflexive case study, key methodological issues are critically reviewed. This review is set in a broader context of the qualitative methods literature in which piloting appears largely as an implicit practice. Using a new and emerging approach (“e-research”) provides a prompt to review “autopilot” tendencies and offers a new lens for analysing research practice. Findings – The authors find that despite an initial focus on “practical” aspects of data collection within their “e-research”, the pilot opened up a range of areas for further consideration. The authors review research ethics, collaborative research practices and data management issues specifically for e-research but also reflect more broadly on potential implications for piloting within other research designs. Practical implications – The authors aim to offer both practical and methodological insights for qualitative researchers, whatever their methodological orientation, so that they might develop approaches for piloting that are appropriate to their own research endeavours. More specifically, the authors offer tentative guidance to those venturing into the emerging area of “e-research”.

However, few researchers have addressed multisensory interaction of visual and tactile evaluation for products salient in single sensory modality. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap and investigate how multisensory evaluation influences overall attitude and purchase intentions. Further, the role of individual personality variable in influencing the interrelationship between sensory evaluation and behavioral outcomes are examined. Design/methodology/approach – The data for this study were collected from 126 students who responded to attitude towards the product and purchase intentions after evaluating three experimental tasks. Repeated measures analysis of variance was carried out to test the multisensory interaction hypotheses. Findings – The multisensory interaction of tactile and visual information was found to significantly increase the consumer attitudes for products dominant on single sensory modality of touch. Further, the multisensory evaluation led to greater purchase intentions than visual or tactile evaluation. Originality/value – The paper is perhaps first to investigate multisensory interaction of tactile and visual sensory information in evaluation of products that are salient in touch properties.

"Understanding the role of prior product knowledge to information search:An application of process theory to the Indian market","2012","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899438273&doi=10.1108%2f13555851211218057&partnerID=40&md5=4474ceb75f0348b5a9ce639f31eb7300","Existing literature offers conflicting evidence on how prior product knowledge influences amount of information search. A majority of these studies are based on variants of cost benefit frameworks where consumers engage in search until the benefits from information search exceed search costs. The purpose of this paper is to develop an expectancy theorybased framework to model consumers' information search and its antecedents, including motivation to search as an intervening construct. The framework is tested using data from real consumers engaged in their actual purchase decisions, in an emerging market context, using longitudinal survey research design. The data are analysed using structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized model. The model shows an acceptable fit with X2 (271, 487)=640.252, p < 0.00 and 0.95 CFI. Results indicate that the relationship between prior product knowledge to information search is mediated by motivation to search. Prior product knowledge influences motivation to search through its influence on the consumer's perceived ability to search and his/her perceived value of additional information. Furthermore, perceived ability to search is the strongest predictor of motivation to search. The parsimony of the proposed framework in providing a simpler account of factors influencing the search process along with its managerial implications is discussed. The findings suggest that perceived ability to search and perceived value of additional information are two important levers that managers could use for achieving desired results. Furthermore, perceived ability to search is an important mediator, which completely mediates the relationship between prior product knowledge and motivation to search. These findings also provide strong indications about the need to simplify the search process for consumers, especially in the context when novelty is predominantly marketed. The paper introduces a motivational measure of search in the literature and shows that the motivational measure is indeed the proximal measure to other antecedent constructs compared to a behavioral measure of search. Perceived ability to search and perceived value of additional information are shown as important mediators between prior product knowledge and motivation to search. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Emerging markets; Expectancy theory; India; Information searches; Motivation to search; Prior product knowledge; Value of information",""

Findings – The results show that a global brand is generally preferred in terms of all the dimensions of consumerbased brand equity over a local brand. However, a significant interaction emerged between the type of brand and high versus low statusseeking motivation consumers. A global brand is strongly favoured in terms of awareness, perceived quality and overall brand equity by high status seekers while a local brand seems to enjoy loyalty and overall brand equity among low status seekers.

The above questions were answered in the context of an emerging economy using 174 responses obtained from executives of businesstobusiness firms in Vietnam. The findings show that among key components of RMO, trust, bonding, shared value, and reciprocity have positive influence on customer satisfaction, while communication and empathy have not. Interestingly, trust and bonding are better than shared value and reciprocity in satisfying customers. The use of crosssectional data does not allow the interpretation of the time sequence of the relationships among RMO components and customer satisfaction. Managers in developing economies do not jeopardise relationship marketing orientation by mistakenly focusing on relatively less important individual components. In particular, managers may not pay much attention to communication and empathy but importantly, they should place more emphasis on trust and bonding compared to shared value and reciprocity. This paper provides insights on the relative importance of RMO components in contributing to customer satisfaction in the context of Vietnam, a developing economy. These insights will help Vietnamese companies enhance their effectiveness in satisfying customers, growing with them, and reducing risks in doing business when entering a global market. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer relationship management; Customer satisfaction; Marketing strategy; Relationship marketing; Relationship marketing orientation; Vietnam",""

"What prevents senior executives from commenting upon miscommunication in top management team meetings?","2012","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931034218&doi=10.1108%2f17465641211253093&partnerID=40&md5=ea737220108bdae297ce46a2ffb8b9d5","Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to explore why executives participating in a top management team meeting avoid speaking up when they experience the goal as unclear or the discussion as wandering off track. Design/methodology/approach– A total of 21 executives (CEOs and level 2 managers) from seven top management teams were interviewed, and the interviews analyzed according to the principles of Grounded Theory. Findings– The executives’ silence was primarily governed by a core belief that to speak up about miscommunication is a negative act, which will probably elicit undesirable consequences. This assumption was reinforced by how the executives perceived themselves, other persons and relationships in the group, group norms, and the issue discussed in the meeting. In addition, three other basic beliefs prevented the level 2 managers from speaking up: “We have no tradition for speaking up in this group”, “It’s futile to speak up”, and “It’s not part of my role to speak up in this group”. Research limitations/implications– The data were collected from executives representing only seven top management teams from the public sector in Norway, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Future research should increase the number and types of top management teams from which informants are drawn. Practical implications– Executives should be aware of how their beliefs and perceptions prevent them from voicing their concerns when experiencing miscommunication during the TMT meeting, and how remaining silent in these matters represents an important barrier to team effectiveness in the meetings. Originality/value– The study shows that even among executives at the top of the organizational hierarchy, people refrain from speaking up when experiencing miscommunication, and that there are more reasons for not voicing concerns than fear of consequences and feelings of futility. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Grounded theory; Learning; Norway; Organizational learning; Silence; Top management team; Voice",""

Comparisons in publishing performance across these three types of journals are examined for academics around the globe, as well as for those in the AsiaPacific region. Design/methodology/approach – The study involves a content analysis of the authors' details from those who published in eight journals between 1998 and 2007. Correlation analysis is then used to identify pairwise relationships in publishing across the three sets of journals, which is also supported by regression analysis. Findings – The findings suggest that there is a positive publishing performance relationship for A and B journals when compared on a global basis as well as within AsiaPacific. There is also a positive relationship between publishing in the A∗ and A journals, but only for the global sample and not for academics within AsiaPacific. Globally, a regression analysis identified that A∗ are positively impacted by A publications, but negatively affected by B journals, with a positive interaction for A and B publications. The interaction suggests that for universities with low levels of A's, there is a significant difference in regard to B publications' impact on A∗. The regression focusing on universities within the AsiaPacific was insignificant in terms of how A and B publications impact on A∗ output. Originality/value – The research is valuable in understanding that there are some synergies in publishing between research areas, although they are less extensive within the AsiaPacific.

This study uses a 2×2 factorial design with 120 participants and a combination of methods to test hypotheses. The respondents of lowrisk as well as highknowledge groups report a higher purchase intention. Interestingly, the movement from satisfaction to purchase intention is higher among respondents with higher certainty, and among respondents in lowrisk as well as highknowledge groups. In particular, this study finds a positive interaction effect between manipulated knowledge and manipulated risk on the satisfactionpurchase intention relationship. As with most experiments, this study has low external validity. Thus, future studies should use different products/brands tested among a wider range of consumers and in more realistic user situations. Both product risk and consumer knowledge are multidimensional constructs, thus, it will be interesting for future studies to manipulate different facets of those constructs (e.g. financial risk, procedural knowledge). The authors' findings suggest that managers should be aware of satisfaction strength (e.g. confidence and knowledge) and risk in their estimations of purchase intention based on satisfaction measurement. Marketing strategies that reduce consumers' risks, consolidate their confidence and educate them with relevant knowledge may be effective strategies to increase their purchase intentions, especially towards new products. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously examining the roles of perceived certainty, manipulated risk and knowledge within a satisfactionpurchase intention relationship. It also contributes by providing empirical evidence supporting an interaction between knowledge and risk affecting the satisfactionpurchase intention relationship.

The first study tested the six levels of puffery, identified by Preston, with two products, cane sugar and bottled spring water. The second study employed four products to test the interaction effects of product type and the “best” puff claim. It was found that puffery had very limited effects on the participants' brand attitude and purchase intent, and the Chinese consistently reported higher purchase intent than the Americans. The studies had two primary limitations. First, all the participants were college students. Future studies may want to sample the general population and further examine how factors such as age, education, social class, and product experience influence the perception of puffery. Second, to strive for crosscultural equivalence, the ad stimuli used consisted of very simple designs and focused solely on puff claims without much context.

"The impact of globalization on consumer acculturation:A study of urban, educated, middle class Indian consumers","2012","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931049155&doi=10.1108%2f13555851211192696&partnerID=40&md5=f5e166f39ee1c98df464ae4a76055d9b","This paper seeks to explore whether predisposition towards foreign brands and consumer acculturation would differ across demographic segments in an emerging market (India). Further, the paper aims to investigate if predisposition towards foreign brands (acting as a proxy for forces of globalization) would lead to consumer acculturation among consumers in India. Instruments to measure predisposition towards foreign brands and consumer acculturation were developed on the basis of extensive literature review. The data comprised of urban, educated, middleclass Indian consumers. The data were collected using structured questionnaire. ANOVA and Ttest results were used to determine if extent of predisposition towards foreign brands and consumer acculturation would differ across demographic segments. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the impact of predisposition towards foreign brands on consumer acculturation. The findings indicate that significant difference exists among various demographic segments with respect to predisposition towards foreign brands and consumer acculturation. Also, predisposition towards foreign brands does impact consumer acculturation among Indian consumers. Various demographic factors such as age, income and educational qualification level significantly affect this causal relationship. This paper provides interesting insights about the buying behavior of Indian consumers. These insights would enable corporate managers to develop more focused strategies catering to the Indian consumers. The paper empirically demonstrates that Indian consumers, when segregated into various demographic segments, do show significant differences in their predisposition towards foreign brands and consumer acculturation. It also ascertains that predisposition towards foreign brands does lead to consumer acculturation. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Acculturation; Brands; Consumer acculturation; Consumer behaviour; Globalization; India; Indian consumers; Predisposition towards foreign brands",""

One of the ways is to build quality relationship via interpersonal relationship with customers. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate two ways of building interpersonal relationship with customers – respect and rapport, and their impact on overall customer perceived relationship quality, as well as the role of context/environment. Design/methodology/approach – This preliminary study reports on empirical results from a survey of customers of dental clinics in Malaysia. Data from a questionnaire survey of 563 respondents were analysed using factor analysis, Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The authors estimated the direct effect of respect and rapport on relationship quality as well as the moderating effect of context (cosmopolitan vs traditional milieu). Findings – The results show that both rapport and respect are important in building quality relationship with customers. Environment/context has a direct effect on relationship quality. Context moderates the relationship between rapport and relationship quality but does not moderate the relationship between respect and relationship quality. Practical implications – This research is of practical use to service companies (especially healthcare service providers) interested in developing effective strategies for building quality relationship with customers. Building good rapport and respecting customers are useful relational strategies to pursue. Originality/value – The effect of rapport and respect on relationship quality in the Asian context has not been studied before.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight how offline factors trigger online continual usage by customers’ of airline e-ticket booking services. Design/methodology/approach – The paper proposes a conceptual model of the relationship between offline factors and customers’ online continual usage behaviour. A convenient sample consisting mainly of undergraduate students was selected. The primary data were collected through a pencil-and-paper survey, and AMOS 18 was used to test for the hypothesised relationships. Findings – The results revealed that employee-based service quality has a positive and direct relationship with pre-existing offline trust and image, and no direct relationship with online continual usage. Surprisingly, and contrary to current literature, pre-existing offline trust had no direct relationship with online continual usage. However, both pre-existing offline image and subjective norms confirmed the literature and had a direct significant relationship with online continual usage. Research limitations/implications – This study used a sample of mainly university students to test the proposed conceptual model. Thus, it might not be possible to generalise the application of the outcomes of this study to different populations. Practical implications – The results of this study confirm the importance of offline factors as a vital tool that support organisations’ attempts to encourage their customers to continue using online channels, which are both efficient and convenient. The paper also offers decision makers general guidelines on managing offline factors to stimulate customers’ online continual usage behaviour. Originality/value – The key contribution of this paper is a conceptualisation of predictors of customers’ usage of online booking services, that takes into account the most researched offline factors cited in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer services quality; Image; Internet; Offline factors; Online access; Online booking services; Quality; Trust; United Arab Emirates",""

Findings– Workers try to increase the proportion of positive cues extracted from work to make their work more meaningful. The three main tactics for increasing the proportion of positive cues are cognitively emphasizing the positive qualities of work, developing competencies to be better able to produce positive outcomes and positive reactions from others, and influencing the work content. Research limitations/implications– This model provides a preliminary understanding of meaningfulness-making, based on cross-sectional interview data. Future research should use alternative methods, and verify and elaborate the findings.

The purpose of this paper is to extend the idiosyncratic dynamics of the franchisorfranchisee relationship and the influence of such constructs from a distance perspective. Seminal work on relationship marketing (Morgan and Hunt) forms the foundation in the development of the franchising relational dynamics model posed within this paper. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a qualitative, casebased approach of four Australian retail franchises with holdings in New Zealand. Indepth interviews were conducted with 20 franchisees to derive perceptions on trust and commitment currently experienced within the franchise relationship to inform the resultant findings. Findings – Key findings suggest trust and commitment are limited or nonexistent within franchise systems if the provision of consistent, transparent communication is absent or minimal, increasing the propensity for dysfunctional agentbased behaviour. Three major antecedents for success of a franchise system exist: goal congruence, organisational culture, and communication. Minimal levels of commitment and trust exist where distance affects the stated antecedents. Research limitations/implications – This research is exploratory with the findings providing an imperative for further investigation in the management of human factors within franchise systems as opposed to transactionalbased foci in many current studies. Theoretical development adopting a relationship marketing focus from a distance perspective rather than the transactionbased approach of a single country adds to existing research. This paper is limited to analysis of franchisees' perceptions. Future research should look at both franchisor and franchisee perspectives. Originality/value – Research of perceptions of individual franchisees, trust and commitment within the franchise relationship is limited within the AsiaPacific region.

Design/methodology/approach – The publication patterns of men and women in four prominent management journals over two decades were analyzed in three North American journals – Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, and Organization Science – and one European journal – Journal of Management Studies. The authors coded the research methodology– qualitative or non-qualitative – and author gender for each article from 1986 through 2008, other than Organization Science which began in 1990. The authors also coded the stage of career for the journals whose author bios provided this level of detail and conducted chi-square tests of the gender authorship between qualitative and non-qualitative journals. Findings – It was observed that women are over-represented and men are under-represented in published qualitative studies as compared to non-qualitative authors. This trend remained steady across the study period. As well for each journal, this relationship was significant. Quantitative findings about trends in authorship of qualitative research were connected to three theoretical perspectives that help explain these findings – information processing theory, separate vs connected ways of knowing, and social identity theory. Originality/value – Management scholars work in a profession that rarely speaks of itself in terms of gender. One may control for gender or explore gender implications in studies of organizational behavior, but gender is not spoken of as a factor that influences the tools used to study organizations. In this study, the authors use quantitative methods to address trends in gender and type of methodology in published papers across two decades and four academic journals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic staff; Gender; Qualitative research; Research methods; Serials",""
"The effects of country and gender differences on consumer innovativeness and decision processes in a highly globalized high-tech product market","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986149674&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111183101&partnerID=40&md5=14ff8052041bafce35337d4d5795f8cc","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to focus on two objectives. First, to investigate how two consumer innovativeness measures (domainspecific innovativeness (DSI) and general innovativeness (GI)) in a highly globalized product market (i.e. laptop computer) are related to two widely used demographics, country and gender. Second, to examine how innovativeness affects a series of consumer decisions such as information search, opinion dependency, and store choice. Design/methodology/approach – The authors build a conceptual model linking two important demographics (i.e. country and gender) and consumer innovativeness (both DSI and GI), and test it using binomial logistic regression, with a sample of 614 respondents from Korea, China, and the USA. Findings – Results are generally consistent with the authors' hypotheses. The two consumer innovativeness measures are significantly influenced by the two demographic factors, and productspecific innovativeness shows more plausible results than GI. Furthermore, consumers' decision processes were found to have idiosyncratic patterns regarding consumer innovativeness and the two demographic moderators. Research limitations/implications – The study may have demographical bias for two reasons: use of only limited metropolitan samples and a somewhat unbalanced sample in gender and occupation. Practical implications – In the early stage of new product launch, DSI will be dominantly useful in market segmentation and targeting rather than GI. However, management should not overlook variability of countries and genders since consumers show idiosyncratic patterns in their decision processes. Originality/value – The paper explores the field of consumer innovativeness studies using comparison of the two dimensions of consumer innovativeness measurements. Also, the study reconfirms the importance of demographics on consumers' decisions in the early stage of highly globalized product markets. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Consumer behaviour; Consumer innovativeness; Cross-country comparison; Decision making; Gender; Highly globalized product; International marketing; Korea; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study used the method of critical incident technique (CIT). In total, 371 critical service encounters were investigated. Actual service experience, with any one of the eight prominent interpersonal services, was collected from adult service consumers living in the national capital region of India. Findings – Dominant worker behaviours and setting facets contributing to satisfaction/dissatisfaction in critical service encounters are identified. Analysis of behaviours confirms behavioural categories suggested by previous research, i.e. recovery, adaptability, spontaneity, courteous, information sharing, connecting and identified one additional category, namely professional behaviour. Service setting facets are ambient condition, interior, exterior and other tangibles.

The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast consumers in two Asian countries, Thailand and Turkey. Since global and local brands coexist in many regions of the world today, this study, by examining two Asian cultures, examines the impact of personality traits and values on individuals' intentions to purchase global versus local brands. The authors also investigate the role of priming (local versus global cues) in the relationship between these individual traits and purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach – The study involves a series of pretests and an experiment conducted among 240 participants from Thailand and 142 participants from Turkey. Though exploratory in nature, content analysis also suggests interesting avenues for future research. Findings – The findings suggest that although both societies are perceived as traditional and collective, consumers from both Thai and Turkish cultures exhibit some striking differences. There were differences in the ways in which individual traits and values impacted global vs local brand purchase intentions. For instance, while it was discovered that traditionalism and susceptibility were important among Thai individuals, ethnocentrism and materialism were at similar levels in both samples. Traditionalism had an important effect on intentions to purchase local brands in Thailand, while it did not have a very meaningful impact among Turks. Similarly, in Thailand, susceptibility affected global brand purchase intentions. However, a similar pattern was not seen among Turks. Originality/value – The research is valuable in understanding that two seemingly similar Asian cultures (Thailand and Turkey) are – in effect – dissimilar on key variables such as traditionalism and ethnocentrism and that impacts how these two cultures perceive global and local brands. As marketers aim to satisfy consumer's needs by offering goods and services, it is extremely important to understand consumers' evaluations of these brands and how these perceptions are formed in the first place. Such an understanding will help marketers in their positioning strategies as well as marketing communications design. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brands; Consumer behaviour; Consumer values; Cross cultural studies; Global brands; Globalization; Local brands; Thailand; Turkey",""

In this regard, the paper is divided into Study 1 and Study 2. Study 1 uses Kano's twodimensional quality model to determine the characteristics of eshopping malls, whereas Study 2 analyzes the relationship among eshopping malls' characteristics, customer satisfaction, flow experience, and trust. According to the results of Study 1, communication quality and marketing activity reflected onedimensional quality attributes. In addition, brand recognition was an attractive quality attribute, whereas interface quality, system security, and information quality were mustbe quality attributes. According to the results of Study 2, communicationrelated attributes of eshopping malls did not have significant effects on customer satisfaction, whereas other attributes such as brand recognition, marketing activity, interface quality, system security, and information quality directly influenced customer satisfaction. The results also have important implications for researchers. First, the quality dimensions of eshopping malls can be identified through an empirical analysis based on Kano's model. This indicates that the quality attributes of eshopping malls can be better examined by using a twodimensional quality model than by using a onedimensional quality model. Second, the authors not only extracted the quality dimensions based on Kano's model but also examined customer satisfaction, flow experience and trust to verify their relationships, providing a better understanding of the effective quality management of eshopping malls. Previous studies considering various types of eshopping malls have focused on the design and functions of eshopping mall web sites; the elements that vitalize ecommerce and the key factors influencing the success of ecommerce; and the factors influencing customer satisfaction and purchase intentions. Most of the literature on eshopping malls have typically approached this topic by using a onedimensional method relying on whether the physical/technological attributes of eshopping malls are fulfilled. This paper expands the horizon by incorporating a systematic approach to web service qualities using Kano model, which is a multidimensional model. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Eshopping mall quality; Flow experience; Internet; Kano model; Republic of Korea; South Korea; Trust; Web sites",""

The authors are interested in how students engaged with the visual as a practice of inquiry and how this contributed to their development of a critical approach to the concept of ethics in business organisations. Design/methodology/approach – Students visited an exhibition shown as part of the 100 days countdown to the COP15 UN climate change conference, and constructed visual representation of questions and dilemmas related to ethical business practice. The analysis focuses on student presentations, and the discussions that these provoked on the relationship between “business” and “ethical practice”. Findings – Doing co-inquiry with visual images enabled many students to engage more proactively with ethical dilemmas; to attend to deeply felt values that they were not accustomed to bring into the rule bound environment of the classroom; to develop critical readings of the visual as a discourse about business organisations and their claims to ethical practice; and to create their own visual representations of ethical dilemmas within business practice. Originality/value – The research methodology brings together inquiry-based learning and visual inquiry in the context of undergraduate learning in a business school. The paper considers the significance of the methodology and findings as a contribution to visual inquiry methodology and practice, and as a medium for enabling students in a business school to develop their ethical sensibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business schools; Business studies; Change; Ethical practice; Ethics; Management education; Students; United Kingdom; Visual inquiry",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study surveyed consumers from Australia (n=345) and the USA (n=340) who were sourced through national online panels. The analysis looks at differences between knowledge and behaviors, both across the samples as well as whether there are differences between consumers with high and low levels of environmental and carbon offset knowledge, and whether demographics impact on knowledge levels. Findings – The results found that consumers had higher levels of general knowledge than carbon offset knowledge and the two types of knowledge were not related. ANOVA results considering country differences and demographic factors found that general knowledge was affected by education, age and gender, with carbon knowledge being affected by education. Environmental behavior was affected by age and gender as well, and no demographic factors influenced carbonrelated behavior. Respondent's location (i.e. USA or Australia) did not influence knowledge or behaviors, but interacted with education in regard to carbon knowledge and behavior. Social implications – This research suggests that consumers are not acting on their carbon knowledge, which may be due to the debate surrounding carbon issues and/or because the information is based on complex scientific foundations, which the average consumer may have difficulty grasping, regardless of country. Originality/value – This is one of the first pieces of academic research to explore consumers' understanding of carbonrelated information and how this knowledge impacts behavior. It also proposes a measure for evaluating carbon offset knowledge, which could be used to broaden environmental knowledge assessments. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Carbon offsets; Consumer behaviour; Demographics; Environment; Environmental behaviour; Environmental knowledge; Green marketing; Information; Knowledge levels; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approach – A rigorous supply chain diagnostics methodology called the Quick Scan is used to assess the integration maturity of 72 value streams located in New Zealand, Thailand and the UK. Findings – The majority of the organisations studied are struggling to turn the SCI concept into reality. Supply chains on average are poorly integrated. However, there exist a handful of exemplar cases that provide guidance; levels of integration maturity appear not to differ internationally. Research limitations/implications – Only three nations are compared, hence the sample is not fully representative of all countries and industries. There is a significant gap between supply chain rhetoric and practice; clear guidance on how to enable effective integration is required. National settings do not appear to affect the extent of application of supply chain management concepts. Practical implications – SCI is a very difficult undertaking. Indifferent practice is the norm. If organisations can attain even the middle ground of internal integration they will outperform many of their competitors.

A model of studentfaculty and studentstudent interactions using interactive Web 2.0 technologies in elearning is offered and explained using literature from servicedominant logic research. This perspective fundamentally alters the mindset of higher education institutions that have traditionally devised strategies to deliver value through its products and services. The new focus provided by servicedominant logic is for higher education institutions to acknowledge that they can only facilitate the value creation process by fostering interactions, constructing learning activities that enable enriching learning experiences and creating structures to support these experiences. Key challenges for higher education institutions are discussed that include implications for exclusion marketing, perceived value for money, and policy issues. This paper provides a fresh perspective, and a new line of thinking with regard to how value is cocreated by both faculty and students through a set of experiences within studentfaculty and studentstudent interactions. It therefore potentially directs a new path of research in the area. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","elearning; Higher education; Learning methods; Marketing education; Online learning; Servicedominant logic; Value creation; Web 2.0; Web 2.0 technology",""

The main purpose of this paper is to understand consumers' attitude and spending behavior using credit cards. Design/methodology/approach – This study is based on a questionnaire survey conducted in Malaysia. Based on an extensive review of literature, a model is developed to identify the psychographic factors that influence the consumer attitudes toward using credit cards. Findings – The paper found support for some of the theoretical expectations and lends support to some of the earlier deviations reported in the literature. Practical implications – The findings are likely to be important to banks and financial institutions issuing credit cards, as they help managers to have a better understanding of cardholders in Malaysia and their attitude and behavior toward usage of credit cards. Originality/value – This paper makes a valuable contribution given the fact that there is a dearth of empirical studies of this nature focusing on Malaysia. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Credit cards; Debts; Developing countries; Malaysia; Psychographics",""

These seem to be the two most important aspects of instore marketing, though other dimensions such as retail personal service are also worthy of study. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 287 New Zealand clothing and shoe retailers was studied. Survey questions included the perceived importance of instore promotions and price markdowns. The aim was to explain these perceptions in terms of marketing strategies, threat of competition and environmental uncertainty. Findings – The results indicate that a discount marketing strategy, environmental uncertainty and emphasis on pricepromotions are key to explaining retailers' perceptions and use of specific instore marketing activities. In addition, seven key marketing activities were found to distinguish high and lowperformance retailers with respect to instore promotions. Practical implications – The study has highlighted strategic aspects of instore marketing, by focusing on two key components of instore marketing, namely instore promotion and price markdowns. The findings should provide much needed advice to retailers on the use of sales promotion tools in different environmental settings. Originality/value – This paper should prove valuable to academic researchers and retailing managers (particularly to those in smaller countries), owneroperated retail outlets, and chain stores. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Marketing strategy; New Zealand; Prices; Retailers; Stores and supermarkets",""

Design/methodology/approach – Expanded selection and additional detailed information are chosen to illustrate researchsupporting shopping aids, and personalized product recommendations and product ratings are used as examples of solutionoriented shopping aids. This conceptual paper proposes that usage of shopping aids has an effect on the purchase likelihood and decision satisfaction and focuses on studying the moderating role of consumer product knowledge and time pressure. The thesis is that congruence between the type of a shopping aid and consumer characteristics, such as product knowledge, or situational characteristics, such as time pressure, should enhance the effectiveness of shopping aids. Findings – The research propositions in this paper delineate how the use of retail shopping aids should affect the consumer's purchase likelihood, decision satisfaction, decision confidence, and evaluation costs, under the moderating influence of product knowledge and time pressure. Overall, knowledgeable consumers and less timepressed consumers should benefit from researchsupporting shopping aids (i.e. expanded selection and additional product information), whereas novice consumers and timepressed consumers should benefit from solutionoriented shopping aids (i.e. personalized product recommendation and product ratings). Originality/value – Retail shopping aids are designed to offer sales assistance for consumers to handle the obstacles to purchase completion. However, past efforts to install retail shopping aids have seen mixed results. This conceptual paper advocates that consideration of consumer characteristics and situational factors is necessary to understand the effects of shopping aid usage. This paper thus contributes to the understanding of solutions to purchase decision deferral and the determinants of decision satisfaction, and has practical implications for retailers regarding providing retail shopping aids to facilitate purchase completion and shopping experiences. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Decision satisfaction; Product information; Purchase deferral; Retail technology; Shopping; Shopping aids",""
"Analyzing key determinants of online repurchase intentions","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931090989&doi=10.1108%2f13555851111120498&partnerID=40&md5=620f84f25dac559d86a313a0a90d1c37","Purpose – The rapid changing internet environment has created a competitive business landscape, which provides opportunities and challenges for a variety of businesses. One of these opportunities includes conducting businesses online. Online transaction systems enable users to buy and make payment for products and services using the internet platform. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that may affect consumers' intentions to repurchase products and services online. Design/methodology/approach – The research framework is grounded in extended technology acceptance model (TAM). The authors used survey questionnaire to collect 102 valid responses from participants in Malaysia who must have made, at least, one previous online purchase. The snowball approach was used to select the participants, to ensure that participants had previously purchased online. Findings – Data collected were analysed using regression model to determine the significance of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The emerging results provide significant evidence in support of the eight hypotheses proposed. Research limitations/implications – One of the limitations of this research is the relatively small sample size. Future research may use larger responses, as well as applying other relevant information system (IS) models/theories. Nonetheless, the paper provides a synthesis of extant literature relevant to the subject area, which is critical in addressing theoretical development in onlinerelated purchase research. In addition, the empirical results corroborate some of the existing literature, as well as contribute to the advancement of the frontier of knowledge in the field. Practical implications – This paper provides useful information for managing online businesses, especially in developing key responses to consumers' needs and in building critical capabilities to enhance competitive position in the online marketplace. Originality/value – This is one of the few studies on online repurchase intentions in Malaysia that uses data from Malaysian consumers as well as an extended IS model. The extension of the wellestablished TAM model by integrating additional variables provides researchers with a fuller model, and more theoretical options in developing frameworks, which are relevant to the specific context of the study – Malaysia. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Internet marketing; Malaysia",""

Design/methodology/approach – To undertake this examination, a model was developed and then tested to validate its applicability in the context of both developed and developing economies. The paper includes partial least squares. Findings – The findings demonstrate that being marketingoriented and innovationoriented appears to be important in creating customers, keeping them, and increasing addon selling to them and rewards the firm with greater brand performance in the marketplace. Importantly, these relationships are universally held across developed and developing business environments. Interestingly, marketing orientation was found to contribute more to the creation of customercentric value than innovation orientation in developing business environment, whereas the opposite was found in the context of developed business environment. Research limitations/implications – The data incorporate only the subjective measures of customercentric value. Future studies can use financial measures to complement the selfreporting approach used in this paper. This dualapproach to measuring the value of customers to the firm (customer equity) and brand performance would provide additional insights into the customercentric marketing literature. Practical implications – The findings suggest that managers should strive to develop a high level of marketing orientation and innovation orientation as two efficient ways to achieve higher levels of customer equity. They are also advised that if their firms are more effective in acquiring potential customers, retaining current customers, and enhancing addon selling, they see their brands perform better. Importantly, the findings also provide guidance for managers on how to allocate their resources to key business activities (e.g. marketing and innovation) in the context of international business (developing versus developed business environments). Originality/value – This study contributes to customercentric marketing theory by enhancing understanding of the contribution of marketing and innovation to the creation of customercentric value in different business environments. This study also contributes to the business orientation literature by demonstrating the utility of a culturalbehavioral approach in measuring marketing orientation and innovation orientation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Cross cultural studies; Customer relations; Innovation; Manufacturing industries; Market orientation; Marketing; Vietnam",""

Data from a field survey were analyzed through a 2×2×3 factorial design and the influence of a particular factor over the others in specific scenarios was observed. This study suggests that if low purchase involvement apparel with high brand equity is sourced from a countryoforigin of low perceived competence, the superior reputation of the brand encourages consumer partiality to the apparel's quality and purchase inclination. However, this study has evidenced that a brand of modest equity sourced from the underdeveloped economy is capable of getting greater consumer support for its higher end fashion products than for its standard apparel. That consumers are comfortable with the quality of highend fashion items sourced from lesser developed countries suggests that low equity brands ought not to feel discouraged to enter the high end of the fashion market particularly if they can offer a price advantage and promise of guaranteed quality. A more expansive paper would allow for analysis of interaction effects of additional combinations of country's competence, brand equity and purchase involvement on consumers' evaluation and purchase preference.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Chinese retail buying system, focusing on the buying committee, which is defined as a group of individuals from different positions that have the authority to make final judgments and decisions regarding such matters as adding or eliminating new products. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a survey administered to retail buyers. Findings – Results of independent ttests support the hypothesis that the influence of guanxi will be greater in the retail firms without a buying committee. Stateowned enterprises are more likely to use a buying committee than nonstateowned enterprises. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample represents buyers from many regions in China it is not a random sample; this limits the generalizing of results.

Whilst the theoretical efficiency benefits from the SOE reform have interested many, this study seeks to add empirical insights to this debate using Williamson’s transaction cost economics (TCE). Design/methodology/approach – Organizational integration and transaction costs – two dimensions of firm efficiency – were compared between SOEs and non-SOEs using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA). The analysis was conducted in the context of the within-firm logistics processes of international multimodal transport (IMT) in Vietnam. Findings – SOEs were as efficient as non-SOEs along organizational integration and transaction costs dimensions. Research limitations/implications – Results of the study contribute to the ongoing research on SOEs reform in Vietnam. They add tentative support to the reform process, although the study also highlights the need for further research incorporating the wider motivation for the SOE reform and/or the broader influence of competition and private ownership.

Design/methodology/approach – Auto-ethnographic vignettes from the author’s own ethnographic research are used to establish five levels of reflexivity for writing organizational ethnography. Findings – The author argues that the audience needs to be able to judge a researcher’s claims to reflexivity through his/her writing. Yet, due to the participation mode of reflexivity while doing ethnographic research, the researcher is not in control over his/her own reflexive writing. Therefore, processes between three groups of stakeholders, namely researcher, field and audience, and their power relations need to be considered in reflexive writing. The author calls this process ethnographic triangulating and derives a five-tiered model of reflexive writing from it. Research limitations/implications – The paper offers a perspective on how to write organizational ethnography. Others will have to put this perspective into practice. Originality/value – The paper moves the participation mode of reflexivity to the level of writing, thereby offering a fully conceived view on reflexivity that acknowledges the influence of field and audience on ethnographic writing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auto-ethnography; Ethnography; Organizational culture; Reflexivity; Research methods; Writing culture",""

Design methodology/approach – This research is based on an ethnographic field study addressing why, despite being exposed to the same institutional demands, organizational actors respond by developing diverging institutional orders of appropriate organizational conduct. This research examines how middle managers and frontline staff in two similar Danish social care organizations respond to demands to adopt a New Public Management (NPM)-based logic of individualized service delivery. Findings – The study shows how institutional diversity may underlie apparently similar organizational structures and responses. NPM-style modernization efforts partly converged with diverse professional motives and rationales around, on the surface, similar organizational changes. The findings illustrate how differential institutional orders are maintained by middle managers and frontline staff despite exposure to the same demands. Research limitations/implications – There are different limitations to this ethnographic field study due to the character of the methodology, the limited number of organizations, informants and time span covered. Attending to micro-level processes within organizations provides a rich understanding of how particular forms of organization and action emerge in response to institutional demands. This calls for more ethnographic research on how actors within organizations cope and work institutional change.

Such failures can lead to model misspecification and inaccurate parameter estimates. The purpose of this paper is to apply a post hoc test called confirmatory vanishing tetrad analysis (CTA hereafter) to a single construct called mass media consumption information exposure, which antecedent studies conceptually posited to be a formative (causative) representation. Design/methodology/approach – This paper analyses a consumer sample of 585 US respondents and applies the CTA test to a single construct by its inclusion in various matrices within a statistical analysis systemmacro that takes into account nonnormal data characteristics. The matrices are derived from Mplus 5 through the estimation of a singlefactor congeneric model. The CTA test calculates a test statistic similar to an asymptotic χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of nonredundant tetrads tested. Findings – The preliminary data analyses reveal that the data characteristics are nonnormal which is not uncommon in social research. The CTA results reveal that the reflective (emergent) item orientation cannot be fully ruled out as being the correct model representation. This is in contrast to prior theoretical conceptual work which would strongly support this construct being a formative representation. Originality/value – Insofar as the authors are aware, there is no paper with a particular focus on how the CTA might not provide sound results with a demonstrated example. The paper makes a valuable contribution by discussing modelling philosophy and a procedure for directionality testing. The authors advocate the implementation of pre and post hoc tests as a key component of standard research practice. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Mass media; Modelling; Multivariate analysis",""

The purpose of this paper is to examine two different informal interactions between 100 remote employees and their central office peers to determine the kinds of messages used in informal interaction using thematic analysis. Design/methodology/approach – Teleworkers recalled informal interactions with central office peers; interactions were coded using constructivist methodology, then collapsed into dominant themes using a constant comparison approach. Patterns in responses were then related to a literature-based (constructivist) analysis of how informal communication functions. Findings – Five key themes were identified: personal disclosure, sociality, support giving and getting, commiserating/complaining, and business updates and exchanges. These informal workplace interactions also reflected underlying dimensions of perceived organizational membership: need fulfillment, mattering, and belonging and suggest ways the framework could be strengthened. Research limitations/implications – Themes from reported interactions provide message-level evidence that informal communication serves both instrumental and constitutive functions. Including interactions reported by co-located employees would have allowed for a comparison. Practical implications – Results have important implications for how informal communication functions between peers. Managers can use the results to facilitate communication opportunities for remote and co-located employees. Originality/value – Message-level analysis of informal communication between peers has not been considered as important as hierarchical communication within businesses and organizations. Reported interactions illuminate how informal communication functions, suggest a link between informal interaction and important individual- and organizational-level outcomes, adding to existing knowledge about the understudied population of permanent, high-intensity teleworkers. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Employees behaviour; Social interaction; Teleworking",""

The author argues that fieldwork is always intersubjective and as such, the research site emerges out of the co-construction of the relationship between researcher and participant. Findings – The author argues that reflexivity is a required but neglected aspect of shadowing, and that spect-acting as a new term would require the researcher to take reflexivity more seriously, thereby opening up emancipatory possibilities in the field.

As Taiwan has taken the lead in the development of the convenience store sector, this phenomenon deserves further investigation so as to assist convenience store operators and restaurateurs in Taiwan in formulating strategies to cope with this trend. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the facilitators of the hybrid convenience store concept accepted by consumers within the framework of Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory. Design/methodology/approach – The data in the form of self-completion survey are collected in MRT stations in Taipei. In total of 289 questionnaires are collected and used for data analysis. Findings – It is found that the higher the levels of “compatibility”, “observability” and “trialability” are, the higher the likelihood that potential consumers will dine in hybrid convenience stores. It is also found that lower levels of “complexity” also increase the likelihood that potential consumers will dine in hybrid convenience stores. However, the findings do not support “relative advantage” as a facilitator. Practical implications – The research findings reveal that consumers in urban areas of Taiwan have gradually accepted the innovative concept of dining in hybrid convenience stores. According to the findings, a number of strategies might be applied in order to facilitate the adoption of the dining concept in hybrid convenience stores by potential consumers in Taiwan. For example, the dining process of fast food restaurants can be possible to emulate; having meals on a trial basis can be applied; TV commercials and word of mouth marketing strategies can also be employed. Originality/value – This paper extends/validates the DOI theory in the Taiwanese convenience store sector and as a consequence, this paper serves as a basic building block in the formulation of pertinent marketing strategies geared toward sustaining and/or increasing consumer patronage in hybrid convenience stores. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Convenience stores; Restaurants; Taiwan",""
"Brand and country of origin valuations of automobiles","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986120954&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910973847&partnerID=40&md5=68663d67ed24e9215e1e12e9c47cf873","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to quantify the value of brands and countries of origin in monetary units. The automobile industry in Thailand is chosen because of the variety of brands and the intense competition within the industry. Both the pick up truck and passenger car market shares have been dominated by Japanese brands for decades, whilst the luxury market has been dominated by German brands. Design/methodology/approach – The data are collected from an authors' survey carried out during the “Thailand International Motor Expo 2007”. A total of 244 models are chosen from 20 brands, and from 7 countries of origin. The hedonic price model is applied to ascertain the price premiums of these different brands, taking into account their countries of origin, since each automobile brand offers several models with distinguishably different features. Findings – The results indicate that different brand names affect consumers' “Willingness to Pay,” in which Mercedes, BMW, and Audi brands are ranked the highest. Surprisingly, Subaru, Mitsubishi and Toyota are the only Japanese brands to have significant brand values. The findings also illustrate a direct relationship between market acceptance and the price premium for automobiles in the luxury car segment, however the same relationship does not hold true for the cars in economy car segment. It seems that Thai consumers put the highest value on cars from Germany, whilst cars from Japan and the USA possess approximately the same value. Korean and Malaysian cars, which focus on low-prices as a means to obtain a competitive advantage, are as to be expected ranked last. An association was found between countries' GDP per capita and the price premium. Countries with a lower GDP per capita show lower price premiums and vise versa. The exception is Germany, which has a low GDP per capita yet has a higher price premium than the better ranked GDP countries such as the USA Research limitations/implications – Though the German brands are ranked the highest, competition in the car industry is likely to be intense, since their premiums are not noticeably different. Additionally, there are implications regarding entry barriers for new automobile brands from the same or different countries. These entry barriers are considered to be quite high, as the brand premiums could represent more than 25 percent of the car prices, at least for the compact car segment. A strategy of discounted price penetration is therefore recommended for a brand which is new to the market, and which does not originate from a highly regarded country. For existing brands with below average values, a customer-based approach is recommended in which those brands improve the attributes in order to create higher premiums. Originality/value – In addition to confirming the relationship between the price premiums of brands and their countries of origin, this paper successfully provides valuations in monetary units and rankings accordingly. This research could be useful to both incumbents and new entrants, when designing their pricing strategies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brands; Cars; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Price positioning; Thailand",""
"The effect of message appeals and unrealistic optimism on purchase intentions: The case of heart-disease prevention pills","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986099511&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011062287&partnerID=40&md5=91eea612bcc275e1999c4ee4186bca09","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to extend a 2007 study by investigating which types of message appeals are more effective in reducing unrealistic optimism (a tendency for people to believe that they are less prone than are others to encounter negative outcomes) and inducing purchase intentions of a lifethreatening hazard prevention product in collectivist and individualist cultures. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment was conducted with 133 American, 145 Singaporean, and 200 Thai undergraduates, totaling 478 participants. Findings – The findings confirm the existence of unrealistic optimism in the marketing setting and show that first, lower levels of optimism are associated with higher purchase intentions for the product; second, hazardrelated behavior priming advertisement appeals lead to lower purchase intentions than do advertisements without priming, contradicting some earlier findings; and third, participants from collectivist cultures (Singaporeans and Thais) show higher purchase intentions than do those from individualist cultures (Americans) for both the riskpriming and the expert advertisement appeals. Research limitations/implications – The samples, while well matched, consist of undergraduate students who are not necessarily representative of the populations as a whole. The samples also come from only three countries. In addition, the study uses a single message. Practical implications – The study suggests that: externalcontrol/collectivist cultures may be more influenced by advertising, regardless of the appeal employed; different types of cultures may require different amounts of advertising to achieve equal levels of effectiveness; unrealistic optimism needs to be addressed by marketers of preemptive products; and for products that are healthrelated and difficult to evaluate, advertisements using expert appeals may be more effective than those attempting to counter unrealistic optimism by priming the riskrelated behaviors. Originality/value – The paper has reaffirmed the existence of unrealistic optimism, and that this phenomenon exists internationally with respect to a highinvolvement risk product category. It has unveiled relationships between optimism and purchase intentions. Finally, the paper has identified both similarities and differences in terms of the existence of unrealistic optimism and the relative effectiveness of different message types across cultures. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertisements; Consumer behaviour; Diseases; Singapore; Thailand; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approach – A theoretical framework, based on de Beauvoir’s philosophy, is developed. It is argued that her feminist philosophy provides an appropriate theoretical lens for the study of careers. The challenges encountered in developing this approach together with their resolution are described. Findings – The theoretical framework informs the analysis and critique of the stories of career told by 13 women chartered accountants. Multiple meanings for the oft-reported categories for leaving public accounting surface, extending the women-in-accounting literature. Research limitations/implications – The use of a structured tool may obscure certain aspects of career or unduly highlight other aspects. The framework should be used in future studies of the careers of women professionals, e.g. lawyers and minority groups, such as men of colour to assess its contribution beyond the current study.

The results are to serve as a reference for managers when implementing brand extension strategies. Design/methodology/approach – The two major factors, “core-brand attitude” and “consumer perception fit”, have been included in studying their influence on consumer purchase intention towards extended products. Of the questionnaire surveys distributed to PC users in Taiwan, 667 valid samples were returned. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to establish the relationship model. Findings – The results indicate that consumers in Taiwan show a relatively high purchase intention towards virtually extended products, Microsoft PC. The relational structure shows that brand awareness has a significant influence on core-brand image (parent-brand image), thus indirectly affecting core-brand attitude and causing impacts on consumer purchase intention towards extended products. On the other hand, consumer perception fit has greater influence than core-brand attitude, denoting that both the brand association and product connection have a remarkable influence on consumer purchase intention towards extended products.

Design/methodology/approach – Through the case study approach, this paper explores the attempts of Adidas to create authenticity by teaming up with artists. It also investigates consumer attitudes toward the brand’s collaborative projects via a questionnaire survey. Findings – Authenticity can be understood in two general aspects: conceptual forms and incarnate forms. Within the value system of authenticity, Adidas’ collaborative projects and diverse promotional strategies are to a large degree consistent with consumer aspirations. Nonetheless, the factors that contribute to authenticity via conceptual (e.g. originality, exclusivity) and incarnate forms (e.g. creative process, final designs) occupy different positions in the consumer’s mind. This study also reveals that when a brand intends to launch such artistic collaborations, the selection of art style should be treated as an important issue, because specific consumer groups tend to have inclinations toward specific art forms. Research limitations/implications – More cases should be examined to enable the theory to be generalized to other artistic collaboration practices. Originality/value – As a pioneering effort in this field, this paper explores the application of artistic authenticity to the fashion world via a collaboration with fashion brands. More importantly, it examines the efficiency of such collaborations and the roles that diverse forms of authenticity play in consumers’ minds. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Arts; Brand management; Comsumer behaviour; Fashion design",""

Specifically, through an investigation of three e-mails sent to the author by a friend, Doug, the paper explores the notion that adjustment is a fluid concept and that through qualitative research methods it is possible to appreciate the expatriate experience in the context of an expatriate’s “whole life” of experiences. This is in contrast to positivist approaches to the study of adjustment which offer limited snapshots of adjustment at particular moments in time. Design/methodology/approach – The paper investigates three e-mails sent by Doug to the author. The e-mails constitute a form of naturally occurring data, and through forms of narrative analysis the e-mails are able to be examined to throw light on the process of expatriate adjustment. Findings – The paper highlights ways in which qualitative research methods generally, and specifically when used in relation to expatriates, enable a fuller understanding of the processes of “adjustment” that expatriates experience and its relationship to their life as a “work in progress”. This type of research approach and analysis complements the more positivist study of expatriates. In some aspects it supports research findings on adjustment, but it serves to humanize the independent expatriate and their experience. Research limitations/implications – The research is a case study of only a single subject. The paper suggests the potential for using naturally occurring data in the study of expatriates and independent expatriates in particular. Practical implications – Stories of the experiences of expatriation offer insightful and “real” access to the lived experience of the expatriate. In this sense, they can be much more powerful than other forms of cross-cultural training.

It also aims to pay particular attention to the role of history in this meaning making process. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on semi-structured interviews with players and coaches at two points in time. To preserve the richness of their experiences and illuminate the historical aspects of change, it focuses on the stories of three players and one supporting coach. Findings – Numerous symbols of change emerge that have multiple and contradictory meanings. The meanings around success and failure are renegotiated over time as individuals struggle with the unmet expectations of change. Moreover, individuals are unable to shed the failures of the past and move forward. Practical implications – Change is a complex and messy process of managing multiple meanings. Understanding change entails more than a snapshot picture of an organization. New leaders have no control over the past, yet they need to be aware of how individuals experienced the past in order to increase the likelihood of success in the present. Originality/value – Success and failure are experienced as an ongoing process as athletes and coaches experience, reflect on and interact with others. In illuminating the role of history in how change is experienced in the present, the paper demonstrates that the past can serve as both an immobilizing force, as well as a comparative point enabling individuals to rationalize their emotions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","History; Leadership; Organizational change; Sports",""

The study identifies factors affecting the inhabitants' perceptions about the tourist impact of the Olympic Games, and the development of special tourist types. Design/methodology/approach – A group of 1,000 urban Beijing residents from different districts are personally interviewed on their perceptions about Beijing as a tourist destination. Their perceptions are measured on the basis of infrastructure improvements made for the Olympic Games, and the impact these improvements will have in Beijing as a post Olympic city. Findings – The Olympic Games improve tourist infrastructure according to Beijing residents. Infrastructure for the Olympic Games affects the economic development of the Olympic city, as well as the touristic development of the city. The above mentioned factors lead to three clusters of residents, namely the eco tourism supporters, the linked tourism supporters, and the mainstream tourism supporters. These three groups with different characteristics are responsible for tourist improvement, additionally to the development of new tourist models mostly related to the Olympic Games infrastructure. Practical implications – The improvement of tourist infrastructure in an Olympic City will attract different types of tourists who are not attached only to sports. Tourists interested in culture, in ecotourism, in linked tourism, and in mainstream tourism will also be attracted by an Olympic City. The outcomes of the study can be used by future Olympic cities in order to improve their image as a tourist destination.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how China's unique blend of capitalism and socialism has influenced Chinese firms’ market orientation. Design/methodology/approach – Broadly speaking this paper's methodological approach can be described as a positivistic epistemology. Findings – The paper provides insights into how Chinese institutions facilitate or hinder firms’ market orientation practices through direct effect, externality effect and indirect causal chains. The central theme is that, compared with other countries, China's unaltered political institutions and newly created market institutions have led to unique roles of coercive, normative and mimetic pressures in the diffusion of market orientation among Chinese firms. Especially, regulative institutions’ influence on other institutions is more salient in China than in many other countries. Research limitations/implications – A lack of primary data and empirical documentation and a lack of in-depth treatment of some of the key issues are major limitations here. Practical implications – The paper analyses institutional pressures facing firms operating in China and their variation across different types of firms. An understanding of these pressures is essential to devise market-oriented approaches in the country. It also examines different institutional factors (e.g. Chinese professional associations) that influence a firm's capability to implement market-oriented practices. Originality/value – This paper's greatest value stems from the fact that it employs institutional theory as a lens to understand firms’ market orientation.

It is a form of guided introspection that seeks to develop finely grained first-person accounts by using distinctions in language, internal sensory representations and imagery that have been incorporated from neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). It is also a participative, relational and developmental form of interviewing, in the sense that the interviewee can gain significant insight into their experience; the process is not concerned purely with data gathering. Design/methodology/approach – The authors review the theoretical assumptions on which psychophenomenology is based, then describe the principal method used in psychophenomenology, the “explicitation interview”. The interview protocol is illustrated with transcript data, through which they identify specific aspects of NLP that have been incorporated into psychophenomenology. Findings – Psychophenomenology offers refinements to the precision of phenomenological methods found in organizational research, such as interpretative phenomenological analysis. Research limitations/implications – The epistemological claims and implications of psychophenomenology are reviewed. Practical implications – These developments may provide a basis for reconsidering the research value of introspection, which has often been dismissed as non-rigorous. Originality/value – The paper introduces psychophenomenology to the field of organizational research. It also describes how psychophenomenology has innovated by drawing from NLP, an approach to personal development that is found in organizational practices such as executive coaching, in order to enhance the precision and rigour of both interviews and transcript analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Interviews; Neurolinguistic programming; Phenomenology; Qualitative research",""

Design/methodology/approach – Both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering are employed to form segments of Japanese seniors based on their average cognitive age, as revealed by both Likert and semantic-differential scaling. Differences are sought between the two clusters on key segmentation variables. Findings – The results reveal that Japanese seniors who are younger, psychologically speaking, have more positive attitudes toward life satisfaction and aging than those respondents who are cognitively older. The psychologically younger respondents also tend to be more involved in activities and have better health along with economic comfort. The study further demonstrates, in a non-Western setting, the predictive power of cognitive age over chronological age since the revealed cognitive age segments have the same chronological age. Practical implications – The fact that average cognitive age relates to one's health makes it a powerful segmentation variable in international segmentation research on the mature market. Basically, cognitive age reveals an aptitude and, when coupled with purchasing power, the viability of senior segments may be assessed more clearly and strategically. Originality/value – The study validates the usefulness of cognitive age in global segmentation research and illustrates its potential as a better predictor of behavior than chronological age. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cognition; Japan; Market segmentation; Marketing strategy; Older consumers; Personal health",""
"Engineering support issues for flexibility in maintenance: An SAP-LAP framework","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986132937&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011026980&partnerID=40&md5=cc3d41999bd18068cb2007f6456dce9e","Purpose – Flexible system management has brought a concept of flexibility in all spheres including maintenance management. Considerable literature is available on various facets of flexibility management, namely, production, supply chain, daytoday activities, etc.; however, not much literature on flexibility in maintenance is reported. The purpose of this paper is to bridge this gap highlighting various issues involved in flexibility on maintenance. Design/methodology/approach – A situationactorsprocess (SAP)learningactionperformance (LAP) model has been applied to understand and analyze the concept of flexibility in maintenance. The paper analyses a case study of ABC, a Government maintenance organization for repair of automobiles in India, to discuss the various issues arising out of maintenance flexibility. Findings – Various issues concerning flexibility in maintenance are: business or corporate philosophy, systems and processes, inventory, manpower, performance measurements and information systems. Research limitations/implications – The concept of flexibility in maintenance has been demonstrated using only two facets of maintenance, i.e. manpower and the repair scope in the case study. Practical implications – The SAPLAP model presents the concept of flexibility in maintenance adequately. The concept can be implemented while planning the maintenance in any organization for various issues like inventory stock levels, manpower, repair scope, etc. The technicians may be trained on more than one specialty so that they can easily remuster into other streams in case of flexible maintenance environment. Originality/value – This is an original approach to apply the concept of flexibility in the area of maintenance management. The issues affecting maintenance flexibility are identified and future researchers may find these gaps interesting. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Flexible organizations; India; Maintenance",""
"Product effects on endorser image: The potential for reverse image transfer","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878182808&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011013182&partnerID=40&md5=48de8738761db49f816801b836d24241","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate reverse image transfer as it applies to both celebrities (actors/models) and celebrity athletes in a New Zealand context. It extends the work of Garland and Charbonneau which examined reverse image transfer (product image transferring to endorser) as it applied to celebrity athlete endorsers alone. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are collected from 240 New Zealand university undergraduate students who are split equally into eight treatment groups. Using Ohanian's sourcecredibility scale, each group rate several celebrities or celebrity athletes on their suitability for endorsing two contrasting products: orange juice (representing a positively perceived product) and cigarettes (representing a negatively perceived product). ANOVA (analysis of variance) is used to compare means between celebrities/celebrity athletes and the products they endorse. The study is a close replication of Till's work in the USA. Findings – The results show a pronounced polarising effect for celebrity athletes, as opposed to celebrities (actors/models), for the endorsement of both products but particularly for cigarettes, the negative product. The potential for reverse image transfer is real, demanding careful attention by celebrities, agents and marketers during evaluation of endorsement opportunities. Research limitations/implications – Though not compromising the research integrity, the sample of New Zealand students is restrictive. Further extension of the research is advisable to address limitations based on sample composition, cultural setting and time of research. Originality/value – Aside from addressing the paucity of research on reverse image transfer, this paper signals important managerial implications for celebrity endorsers and their agents. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Celebrities; Marketing strategy; New Zealand; Product endorsement; Product image",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of these two variables on consumers' responses to advertisements. Design/methodology/approach – A 2 × 2 experimental design was used to examine the effects of a song's period and the lyrics' relevance. The hypotheses were tested with a structural equation analysis. Findings – Previously heard old songs have positive ad effects due to evoking consumers' good moods or by generating more favorable nostalgiarelated thoughts. Highrelevance lyrics facilitate the production of favorable ad executionrelated thoughts, which improve ad attitude directly and indirectly through good moods. Research limitations/implications – Only undergraduate students are sampled. Further, the experiment focuses solely on musicdominated ads for low involvement products. Practical implications – For advertising targeting the young generation, the use of a popular song released during their childhood can elicit feelings of nostalgia and lead to good moods as well as favorable brand attitudes. Such effects, can be strengthened by highrelevance lyrics. Originality/value – Placing a previously heard popular song in a TV ad can evoke nostalgic feelings and generate favorable ad effects even when the product and other ad design elements are not related to nostalgic themes. The persuasion mechanism of nostalgia follows a dualroute process, in which the cognitive route seems to be more influential than the affective route. The importance of lyrics' relevance is demonstrated to the extent that its impact on brand attitude can exceed that of song's nostalgia. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Affective psychology; Cognition; Consumer behaviour; Memory; Music; Nostalgia",""

Design/methodology/approach – The idea that rhetoric is an important form of organizational discourse has gained interest among organizational scholars in recent years. Institutional theorists, especially, have been willing to embrace the “rhetorical turn” in organization studies. These scholars recognize that rhetoric plays an important role in creating, maintaining, and disrupting organizational and institutional orders. This paper adds to this research agenda by suggesting that organizational isomorphism can be partly understood as a rhetorical phenomenon. A method of rhetorical criticism – a qualitative approach for analyzing the rhetorical dimensions of texts and practice – and its efficacy for institutional research is explicated. Using a popular television program about crime scene investigations (which has arguably produced a “CSI effect” that influences the criminal justice system as an organizational field) as a sustained example, steps are provided for conducting rhetorical criticism of popular culture texts in order to account for isomorphic trends in an organizational field. Findings – Rhetorical analysis of cultural and organizational artifacts, including institutional work, can expose myths and ceremonies that guide practices effectively and problematically. Originality/value – The potential value of the paper is in its function as a guide for (neo)institutional and organization scholars looking for innovative approaches to studying organizations from a cultural perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cultural studies; Forensic science; Organizational analysis; Research methods; Rhetoric",""

At the same time, theorisation of a paradigm grounded in a pragmatic epistemology is presented. Design/methodology/approach – The paper seeks to explore the different assumptions guiding a pragmatist epistemology, based on the development of an alternative philosophic framework, such as an indigenous paradigm that draws its logic from a Ma¯ori worldview. In doing so, it counters the ideological tension created by the disjunction of applying an epistemological perspective that aligns with what we conceptualise as a mainstream Western view of knowledge creation and maintaining the integrity of taking an indigenous worldview. Findings – In the paper, we argue that kaupapa Ma¯ori research, as an indigenous paradigm draws from a pragmatist epistemology, providing a platform for a culturally attuned response to mainstream organisational research. Originality/value – The paper is of use to qualitative researchers, in and beyond indigenous contexts, as it grounded in a methodological approach that draws from a pragmatic epistemology offering insightful, more richly contextualised research avenues in organisation and management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Epistemology; Knowledge management; New Zealand; Organizational theory; Pragmatism",""

Design/methodology/approach – Strengths and weaknesses of logistics services of a well known cargo company in Turkey are defined by using a service quality scale (SERVQUAL), service quality attributes are categorized using the Kano model in order to see how well these attributes are able to satisfy customer needs, and findings are transferred to quality function deployment (QFD). Findings – The findings of the Kano model show that ten of the 27 service quality attributes can be categorized as “attractive”, implying the maximum effect on consumer satisfaction. Through the customer priority level of QFD, the three most important service quality attributes are found to be: VIP Service, informing customers about delivery time before sending, and taking deliveries from customers’ addresses. Also, strengthening information technology infrastructure is the most important technical requirement to focus with the highest technical importance level. Research limitations/implications – The study involves only one cargo company, it concerns just Trabzon city center branch offices and its sample includes only individual customers instead of individual and institutional customers together. Practical implications – Offering a case study, the paper presents a guide for cargo companies to employ different scientific methodologies in their service quality development efforts. Originality/value – Intending to offer scientific approaches to cargo companies as a tool of development in their practical procedures, the paper tries to bridge the current gap between academicians and practitioners and adds to the relatively limited theoretical literature. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Logistics data processing; Modelling; Quality function deployment; Service quality assurance; SERVQUAL; Turkey",""
"Relational factors that explain supply chain relationships","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986120899&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011062304&partnerID=40&md5=0688779aa8bebd868fb19edf11847835","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the types of relationships that exist along the supply chain and the capabilities that are needed to manage them effectively. Design/methodology/approach – This is exploratory research as there has been little empirical research into this area. Quantitative data were gathered by using a selfadministered questionnaire, using the Australian road freight industry as the context. There were 132 usable responses. Inferential and descriptive analysis, including factor analysis, confirmatory factor and regression analysis was used to examine the predictive power of relational factors in interfirm relationships. Findings – Three factors were identified as having significant influence on relationships: sharing, power and interdependency. “Sharing” is the willingness of the organisation to share resources with other members of the supply chain. “Power” relates to exercising control based on experience, knowledge and position in the supply chain. “Interdependency” is the relative levels of dependency along the supply chain. Research limitations/implications – The research only looks at the Australian road freight industry; a wider sample including other industries would help to strengthen the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications – When these factors are correlated to the types of relationship, arm's length, cooperation, collaboration and alliances, managerial implications can be identified. The more road freight businesses place importance on power, the less they will cooperate. The greater the importance of sharing and interdependency, the greater is the likelihood of arm's length relationships.

In particular, it applies these ideas critically to understand how managers’ identities are partly shaped by the dominant discourse or idea about what a manager should “be.” Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on three written narratives of managers. It applies a dialogical approach to consider how they position themselves interactionally in the narratives in such a way as to highlight a managerial identity based on being “enterprising” and “for change,” while simultaneously voicing alternative identities negatively. The use of the written narratives of managers and the application of a dialogical approach is an important contribution to the literature. Findings – The findings suggest that managers, when reflecting on organizational events through narrative, assume a managerial identity that reflects current dominant discourse about what a manager should “be.” In doing so they reject other possible discourses that offer alternatives, not only to managerial “being,” but also to what management and organizations might reflect and represent. The paper also, however, recognizes that some managers reject this identity and its implications for organizational activity. Research limitations/implications – The paper suggests that managerial identity is partly a product of a dominant discursive/ideological formation rather than individual choice. Although managers may reject this interpellation creating an alternative is constrained by the regime of truth that prevails about what management is at any given time. The approach might be considered overly deterministic in its view of managerial identity. Originality/value – The paper extends the understanding of managerial identity and how it is portrayed through narrative by using a dialogical approach to interpretation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Managers; Narratives; Work identity",""

"Would Indian consumers move from kirana stores to organized retailers when shopping for groceries?","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931079587&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910926281&partnerID=40&md5=7c829eb1a47976b6eb8ea479f07ccba4","Purpose – This article seeks to understand whether Indian consumers are likely to move from traditional kirana stores to large organized retailers while shopping for groceries. Design/methodology/approach – Two hypotheses were proposed: H1: customer patronage differs for different grocery store attributes and H2: customer perceptions of grocery store attributes differ for kirana stores and organized retailers. The study was carried out across four Indian cities- two major and two smaller cities with around 100 respondents from each city. Stratified systematic sampling design with a sample size of 409 was used for the study. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data collected with the help of a structured questionnaire. Findings – Customer patronage to grocery stores was found to be positively related to location, helpful, trustworthy salespeople, home shopping, cleanliness, offers, quality and negatively related to travel convenience. Kiranas do well on location but poorly on cleanliness, offers, quality, and helpful trustworthy salespeople. The converse is true for organized retailers. Research limitations/implications – Kiranas have major disadvantages on all customer perception scores except location. These scores being less important determinants of patronage compared with location, in the short run kiranas may not be ousted out of customers’ favour. However, in the long run if they do not work on these other factors, they would face oblivion. Practical implications – Kiranas need to upgrade their facilities to be able to compete with the organized retailers, who are expected to improve their location scores rapidly in the near future. Originality/value – The paper predicts whether the foray of large organized grocery retailing would close down millions of kirana shops and result in loss of livelihood, suggesting measures to counter the onslaught. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Customer loyalty; India; Retailers; Shopping",""

Design/methodology/approach – Through semi-structured interviews with managers, this paper attempts to answer the following question: Which factors influence managers’ motivation to distort the performance evaluation ratings of their subordinates? Findings – This paper offers three main contributions or implications. First, from a methodological point of view, using a qualitative research design to investigate the appraisal of subordinates’ performance is useful because it allows us to reduce the gap between research and practice. Second, this study shows that researchers must embrace or integrate various theoretical perspectives (rational, affective, political, strategic, cultural, justice, and symbolic), given that managers’ motivation to evaluate subordinate performance cannot be analyzed outside of the social context. Third, from a practical point of view, managers’ motivation to evaluate subordinate performance is less about the technique used and more about leadership support, execution, and overall performance culture. Originality/value – To date, prior research has focused on improving performance appraisal accuracy through experimental research design by emphasizing rating criteria, rater errors, rater training, and the various rating methods.

Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the multi-criteria decision-making tools such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) are adopted to solve the problem of selection of 3PRLP. Findings – In a real-time situation, collecting the returned products from the customer end to the manufacturer end becomes more tedious, time consuming work and also it makes the information flow in the supply chain management more complex. A separate logistics system has to be developed in order to inspect and maintain the collected returned products in the down stream management. This current scenario encourages the top-level management to seek for an alternative for collecting the returned products instead of making their supply chain structure to be complex. This gives rise to the term called 3PRLP. The 3PRLP will collect the returned products, inspect them and categorize them according to the various reverse logistics operations. A key finding of this work is a model to determine the best 3PRLP for the battery industry. Practical implication – This work provides a useful decision model for practicing managers and researchers within this area, and also shows the various relationships, and processes the information required for the management involved in the selection of a reverse logistics provider under fuzzy environment. Originality/value – In this research, seven attributes and 34 sub-attributes are considered and an interpretation of reverse logistics attributes in terms of their pair-wise comparisons has been carried out.

Findings – Japan stands out among Confucian societies in regulating soft issues. The other five societies share considerable similarities, though each society's approach ultimately reflects the entanglement and interaction between various economic, political, cultural and historical factors in the local context. Practical implications – For international advertisers, the ideological facet of advertising regulation in some Confucian societies spells unpredictable traps and troubles.

Also of interest was how symbolic meanings and motivations are similar or different to those in Western nations and the implications for the marketing of alcohol products. Design/methodology/approach – An ethnographic approach comprising participant observations and interviews is used to generate data relating to alcohol consumption. Observations are conducted at 11 venues including pubs, clubs, restaurants, and a convention centre. More than 40 h of observations yield data pertaining to public drinking while the interview data also provides insight into the nature of private drinking in Hong Kong. Findings – Alcohol consumption in Hong Kong may be primarily a function of the need to convey desired images to specific and generalised others. The finding that product symbolism dominates taste considerations supports previous research relating to beer consumption but varies somewhat from identified motivations for wine consumption in developed markets. Practical implications – Alcohol marketers may benefit from adapting their products to suit the specific taste preferences of Chinese consumers, although care would need to be taken to ensure the symbolic value of the beverage is not diminished in the process. A focus on the situational context and moderate consumption in promotional messages may increase perceived salience. Originality/value – Little previous research on alcohol consumption motivations has been conducted in Hong Kong. The findings provide insight into likely characteristics of the future alcohol market in mainland China. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Alcoholic drinks; China; Consumer behaviour; Hong Kong; Symbolism",""

Design/methodology/approach – The argument draws upon insights from discourse and conversation analysis, in particular the acknowledgement of the productive function of language use in social life. Findings – A radicalised approach to interviews is one that tries to abstain from letting the interview talk represent an organizational reality “out there.” The aim of radicalised interviewing is rather that of trying to identify situations and practices within the organization that resemble the interview situation. Research limitations/implications – Interview research within management and organization studies needs to take into consideration that the relation between interview accounts and organizational reality is one of the re-creation rather than re-presentation. This insight has implications for both the interview practice and the analysis of interview material. The challenge for the interviewer is to contribute to an interview situation that enables the re-creation of organizational reality. Practical implications – The practice of interviewing in business practice offers the same kind of problems as the research interview, and thus needs to take into consideration the re-creational nature of the interview situation.

"Cross-cultural generalization of the effect of option choice framing on product option choices","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986104242&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910973838&partnerID=40&md5=09f5dfc6ed4093d2186be72155fa3829","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the cross-cultural generalization of the effect of option choice framing on product option choices and other managerial and psychological variables. Design/methodology/approach – The experiment employs 124 Singaporean and 96 Thai working adults, who add options to a base model or delete options from a full model in a condominium purchase scenario. Hypotheses are derived from the different weights for monetary losses and utility gains from adding options vs utility losses and monetary gains from deleting options. Findings – For both Singaporeans and Thais, compared to additive framing, subtractive framing results in a higher number of options chosen, higher total option prices, higher expected product prices and higher perceived product prestige. For Thais, compared to additive framing, subtractive framing also results in lower perceived decision difficulty and shorter decision time. For Singaporeans, compared to additive framing, subtractive framing results in shorter decision time and higher perceived value. Research limitations/implications – The option choice task is a scenario, not a real-life choice task in which participants have to spend real money. Practical implications – Subtractive option choice framing should be used rather than additive option choice framing. However, in recession time, the use of subtractive framing may backfire because consumers perceive the product as more expensive than its counterpart presented under additive framing, thus lowering their purchase intention of the product. In addition, whenever marketers want consumers to perceive the starting price as low, the price of a base model should be emphasized as opposed to the price of a full model. Originality/value – This study examines an important issue – whether the superiority of subtractive framing over additive framing reported in past research is valid in other cultures that are very different from American and whether it is valid in another product category. The results qualify past findings that people give more weight to utility losses than monetary losses. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural studies; Decision making; Singapore; Thailand",""
"New perspectives on the causes of franchising conflict in Australia","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84155174455&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011026917&partnerID=40&md5=d137ad0fc60cd4d12bfd03abe8e7c8a0","Purpose – Although Australian franchising sector regulation promotes system disclosure and provides for mandatory conflict mediation, there is some concern that inequities exist within the conflict management process. From 2006 to 2008 no less than four government inquiries into franchising took place in Australia in an attempt to resolve problems occurring in the sector. A major issue was that of the perceived imbalance of power in the franchisorfranchisee relationship, which often results in conflict between the two parties. The purpose of this paper is to extend the conflict literature in dyadic exchange relationships through investigating the causes of conflict from the franchisor and franchisee perspectives. Design/methodology/approach – Exploratory research is undertaken to identify the major causes of franchising conflict. Facetoface interviews are conducted with 24 franchising experts, such as lawyers and mediators, to draw upon their considerable experience in the sector. Findings – The key findings suggest that a lack of due diligence is associated with the formation of unrealistic expectations which increases the potential for future relational conflict. Although franchising experience impacts upon operational approaches and conflict, the role played by third parties and market conditions both appear to exacerbate dissatisfaction in franchise systems. Research limitations/implications – This research is exploratory and therefore the findings are tentative. The preliminary conceptual models will be tested in a large quantitative survey of key franchising stakeholders in the near future. Originality/value – With the Australian franchising sector presently under intense scrutiny by regulators this research is timely and important. It is expected that the findings will provide government and industry representatives with a more balanced understanding of the causes of franchising conflict so that preventative action may be taken. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Conflict management; Due diligence; Franchising; Information disclosure",""

Design/methodology/approach – Two studies were conducted with undergraduates of a top Asian university with sample sizes of 106 and 100 using experimental setups. Findings – Replicating findings from existing research, a greater amount of WOM was shared between strong ties compared to weak ties. However, the main finding was that this tie strength effect only held for a prevention-focused WOM giver but not for a promotion-focused WOM giver. The latter was found instead giving a similar amount of WOM to strong and weak ties. Research limitations/implications – The two experiments required subjects to write out their WOM. This may be a limitation since WOM is usually spoken instead of written. Future research can compare spoken and written WOM to evaluate the robustness of the current findings. Practical implications – Findings from this paper can help companies solicit more WOM through priming the appropriate regulatory focus when consumers communicate with others that are of different social ties. Originality/value – The current paper contributes to existing WOM literature by investigating the moderating effect of regulatory focus on the relationship between tie strength and WOM amount. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Consumer goods; Conversation; Individual psychology",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on the author’s experience of her own design and implementation of the diary method, using qualitative diaries, dialogues and interviews. The application is known as the “diary project” and is carried out in a case-study organisation in which the researcher is addressing wider questions about gender, change and organisation. Findings – The outcomes show how the diary project methodology is effective for learning about gender norms and practices embedded in organisational culture. Reflections on the interface between the personal and the professional, the formal and the informal, emotion, sexuality and power, hierarchies and difference, draw out significant organisational phenomena which shape advantage and disadvantage and unequal access and control. Research limitations/implications – The diary project methodology is about the organisation in the present. To study gender embedded in the organisation requires the organisational researcher to also work with other research methods, to achieve a deep understanding. Practical implications – The experience of the diary project is that it offers organisational researchers and change practitioners a methodology for study and intervention. Originality/value – The paper is of use to readers looking for a participatory organisational research methodology to examine the gendered organisation.

Design/methodology/approach – A characterization of reflexivity as a process is developed from extant research, in four steps. First, the principal dimensions of reflexivity – reflection and recursion – are identified and delineated. Second, recursion is shown to have two modes, active and passive. Third, reflection is shown to have both closed, self-guided and open, relational modes. Fourth, through integrating the detailed characterizations of each of the dimensions, different types of reflexivity are identified and defined. Findings – The paper shows how different types of reflexivity may be experienced sequentially, as a progressive process, by organizational researchers. Implications for research practice are derived from a consideration of this process. Originality/value – The paper develops a novel conceptualization of reflexivity as a process with individual and relational aspects. This conceptualization supports important insights for the conduct and legitimation of reflexive research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause and effect analysis; Qualitative methods; Research",""

Findings – It is argued that methodological emotional reflexivity (MER) as a part of doing GT will increase both awareness and understanding about how emotions influence the research process. MER comprises emotional awareness, empathic understanding and emotions in decision making. Originality/value – The paper proposes acknowledging that emotions are part of, connected to, and both influence and are influenced by research decisions within GT. It is suggested thatMERbecomes an integral part of memoing in GT. Memos provides a link between data and evolving insights, and is considered fundamental in GT.

Design/methodology/approach – Taste-testing experiments were conducted (n = 263) using Brie cheese as the test product and a 3(COO) × 3(price) × 3 (fat content) conjoint analysis fractional factorial design. Findings – Price was clearly found to be the most important attribute contributing to perception of Brie quality, followed by fat content. COO also exerted a substantial influence on respondents’ evaluation. In the case of this sensory experiment, reliance on the extrinsic cues tested was found to remain extremely robust even when all intrinsic cues (through sensory experience) were available for respondent evaluation when objective product quality was manipulated to three differing levels. Research limitations/implications – The research presents a number of limitations. Convenience sampling was employed, limiting one's ability to generalize results. Further, the use of conjoint analysis for taste-testing experiment methodology is limited, particularly with a sample of this size with objective quality manipulations that are quantified and precise. A laboratory environment is also a limitation. Practical implications – The research demonstrated that, even when evaluating a relatively low involvement product, consumer belief in the price value schema dominates quality assessment. These findings mean that marketers cannot assume that intrinsic product attributes, even when experienced, will be interpreted or used accurately when evaluated by consumers. Hence results provide an illustration to managers of the importance of ensuring that consumers take the intended meaning from communicated intrinsic cues in particular. Originality/value – The research significantly advances understanding of consumers’ use of extrinsic cues (price and COO specifically), and their respective influence in their determination of both expected and experienced quality. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Country of origin; Food testing; Price positioning; Quality",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from face-to-face structured interviews from an intercept sample of 420 Hawaii consumers. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and correlation analysis to provide additional information about the association of variables. Findings – Significant associations were found between gender and knowledge about organic cotton, between cotton preference and ethnicity, and between cotton preference and knowledge of differences among organic and conventional cotton. This study also found that people who preferred organic cotton were more likely to purchase organic products and were more concerned about the environment than people who preferred conventional cotton, and that people who owned organic cotton products were more eco-literate than people who did not own organic cotton products. A profile describing characteristics of organic cotton consumers was developed which may assist organic product producers, marketers, and sellers. Research limitation/implications – This research only involved collecting and analyzing information from participants in Hawaii, therefore, more research may be needed to compare characteristics of potential organic cotton consumers in different regions of the USA.

Using field data structured in the form of repeated measurements it is to be shown, in a two-factor confirmatory factor analysis model, how the bias in SE can be derived when the non-independence is ignored. Design/methodology/approach – Three estimation procedures are compared: normal asymptotic theory (maximum likelihood); non-parametric standard error estimation (naïve bootstrap); and sandwich (robust covariance matrix) estimation (pseudo-maximum likelihood). Findings – The study reveals that, when using either normal asymptotic theory or non-parametric standard error estimation, the SE bias produced by the non-independence of observations can be noteworthy. Research limitations/implications – Considering the methodological constraints in employing field data, the three analyses examined must be interpreted independently and as a result taxonomic generalisations are limited. However, the study still provides “case study” evidence suggesting the existence of the relationship between non-independence of observations and standard error bias estimates. Originality/value – Given the increasing popularity of structural equation models in the social sciences and in particular in the marketing discipline, the paper provides a theoretical and practical insight into how to treat repeated measures and clustered data in general, adding to previous methodological research.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey method approach was used in this study. To test the dimensionality of the perceived service quality, all 20 items were analyzed using oblique rotation and varimax rotation. The hypotheses were tested using the structural equations modeling and general linear model of univariate analysis of variance. Findings – Perceived service quality was found to have a significant impact on customer satisfaction. In turn customer satisfaction was found to have a significant effect on trust. Both customer satisfaction and trust have significant effects on loyalty through word of mouth (WOM) while WOM is an antecedent of repeat visits or repurchase intentions. Interestingly, trust does not directly influence the latter. With the exception of the effect of satisfaction on trust, we found no significant difference between the effects of perceived service quality on satisfaction, satisfaction on loyalty, and trust on loyalty among the Qatari and Malaysian customers indicating that the relationships in the model did not hold across the two cultural groups because the respondents have similar cultural background. Research limitations/implications – This study suffers from a limitation in that it uses a convenience sampling technique without a fully matched profile of the respondents. However, the satisfactory fit of the estimated model allows for the study to be a basis of a reliable comparison for future research. Practical implications – In an ecommerce setting companies can increase customer loyalty directly by improving the ease of use, the attractiveness, and the security of their website. Thus, marketers should tailor their marketing strategies to fit each marketing environment because overseas success of their business is very much a function of cultural adaptability.

Design/methodology/approach – A “meansobjectives model” is applied, thereby linking sponsorship to brand equity factors and to strategic aims. Cobranding, revenue streams and new customers are identified as means factors. The objective factors are presented in three dimensions: product, corporation and region. The analysis is based on 492 advertisements, articles and press releases collected from Chinese newspapers and Chinese official web pages covering the period 20012007. Findings – Analysis sees seven dominant meansobjectives combinations in sponsorship leading to different pattern of sponsor advertising strategies depending on the lead time to the Olympic Games. First, sponsors mainly focus on cobranding marketing efforts. In the second stage, global Olympic sponsors link cobranding with corporation image, Chinese brands are focusing on product/corporation image and new customers. In the third stage global Olympic sponsors focus more on local markets and customers in advertising. Chinese brands tend to keep an activation strategy based on revenue and product. Only a few local sponsors place emphasis on leveraging their sponsorship investment toward creating an international image. Research limitations/implications – Data collection is limited to a period of altogether three months in 2006 and 2007, focusing on Chinese print media available in Beijing and Shanghai universities' libraries. Given the size of the Chinese media market the data therefore consist only of a random selection of advertisements. Further, the sample does not cover different marketing channels, like TV, radio etc., which might also be part of the sponsor's advertising strategy.

Primary data were obtained from managers responsible for own label development strategy in eight key retailers in Taipei through the use of a structured questionnaire with both closed and open-ended questions. Secondary data from various sources were also used.Findings- The development of retail own label products in Taiwan does not follow the pattern witnessed in the West as described in the literature. Only some of the strategic motives of using own label as stated in existing literature are fully echoed in this study. Furthermore, the progress of most of the retailers studied in Taiwan does not mirror the typical stages of evolution as advocated by Laaksonen and Reynolds.Originality/value- Many retailers, especially the international ones, believe that use of own label in Taiwan is important. However, an understanding of the development and strategic use of own label by retailers in Taiwan is not yet well established. The current study serves as a first step to fill this gap and sheds some light on the implications for own label development strategies to grocery retailers in Taiwan. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Generics; Labelling; Product management; Retailers; Taiwan",""
"Cross-national invariance of the effect of personal collectivistic orientation on brand loyalty and equity: The United States versus South Korean consumers","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951552384&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910926236&partnerID=40&md5=9876cc84f5c116015a9bd2b653edf403","Purpose – This study seeks to examine whether or not the effect of personal cultural orientation on brand-related consumer behaviors functions invariably at the individual level in two culturally opposite countries (South Korea and the USA). Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from college students from South Korea and the USA. A total of 415 eligible questionnaires were collected: 212 South Korea and 203 USA. Data analysis was conducted using Multivariate analysis of variance. Findings – It was found that personal collectivistic orientation had a significant effect on both brand loyalty and equity among both Americans and Koreans. Brand loyalty was higher among people of high collectivism than those of low collectivism across brands in both the US and South Korean samples. Likewise, brand equity was also higher among people of high collectivism than those of low collectivism across brands in both countries. These findings indicated that regardless of their national culture, collectivist consumers would show higher brand loyalty and equity than individualist consumers. Research limitations/implications – One limitation was that only one product category was examined in only two countries. Future research will need the validate the findings by including more product categories across more countries. In addition, other types of personal cultural orientation need to be investigated. Originality/value – One major contribution of the study is that it examines the personal cultural orientation, not stereotyping consumers by their country or subculture membership. The other contribution is that the effect of personal collectivistic orientation holds regardless of country-level culture. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand equity; Brand loyalty; Collectivism; Culture; South Korea; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approach – A screening experiment, designed as a Plackett-Burman design, is used to study main effects of 11 techniques for increasing survey response. Three measures of effect used are click rate, completion rate, and response rate. A convenience sample of students at a large university in New Zealand is used. Findings – Follow-up had significant impact on click rate; incentive and pre-notification had a significant impact on completion rate; no technique had significant effect on response rate. Research limitations/implications – Main effects are examined. Also, a limited number of approaches for each technique are studied. Originality/value – This paper illustrates the use of a methodology that researchers, practitioner, and academics alike, can use to select techniques to employ in an internet survey.

"When hot and noisy is good: Chinese values of renao and consumption metaphors","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76949095241&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910950040&partnerID=40&md5=97f0f9bcaa302345434ffc56d0315501","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to extend research on metaphors of consumption to a Chinese cultural setting, specifically examining consumer thoughts related the Chinese concept of renao (hot and noisy). Design/methodology/approach – The Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) was used – a photo elicitation approach and semi-structured interviews that surfaced metaphors. Field observation and participative techniques were combined with the 14 interviews, in Taiwan, through a grounded theory approach that classified results in categories using the software XSight. Findings – Five main categories of related concepts consistently arose: food, inexpensive, crowd, marketing communication and servicescape. Respondents closely tied renao with consumption behavior. All five categories resulted in rich descriptions that these consumers, and possibly a wider group, associate with successful retail locations. Research limitations/implications – This in-depth approach was limited to 14 respondents and two researchers living in Taiwan. Thus, both the sample and the sample frame are restricted. Although the concept of renao is common in all Chinese cultural settings, its exact interpretation differs in different locations, sub-cultures and marketing segments. Originality/value – Consumers expressing their values though consumption is a marketing topic both studied and used in the West. The convergence of consumers' perception of self and consumption is no less important, but certainly different, for consumers in a Chinese cultural setting. Local values heavily influence Chinese consumption in Taiwan, such as the central concept of renao. These local values are rarely discussed in Western literature. Retailers can benefit by incorporating at least some of these metaphors, while marketing researchers can gain an expanded definition of consumer self-image and values. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Consumer behaviour; Metaphors; National cultures",""
"The role of path dependency in a hospital merger","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931079804&doi=10.1108%2f17465641011089863&partnerID=40&md5=20784a1ce857d3d0a090cd320ea3e1e7","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how change processes are dependent on historical events, geographical conditions, strong stakeholders and social norms developed over long-time periods. The paper poses the question: what is the role of path dependencies in mergers between hospitals when motives of the mergers are ambiguous and the context of the change initiatives is characterized by conflicting goals? Design/methodology/approach – The primary objective of this study is to describe the experience of three hospitals that were merged into a hospital enterprise, with the focus on a change in activity from 2003 to 2006. This fieldwork allowed a longitudinal study. The empirical data were generated from observations, interviews, document studies and newspaper clippings. Findings – The investigations showed that the merger forced the hospitals to change, but the new organization – the different components of the merged hospital – followed different pathways to handle the externally imposed changes. Parallel processes evolved, and these processes were rooted in the historical and geographical conditions. Further, the paper illuminates the unique strengths of qualitative research methods that allowed a deeper understanding of these change processes. Originality/value – The paper’s findings add to our knowledge on the complex relations between externally imposed organizational change and the nature of internal organizational behaviour when intertwined with strong stakeholders. The paper particularly highlights the possible consequences when there is little interaction between the changes of systems and the practices of the professionals in hospitals when the processes are heavily influenced by path dependencies rooted in historical and geographical traditions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Amalgamations; Change management; Critical path analysis; Hospitals; Organizational change",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper’s approach includes a review of the literature in sociology, anthropology, psychology, and feminist studies, in which scholars have argued convincingly for the explicit need to acknowledge and utilize the emotions of researchers as they study social and organizational phenomenon. Also, past research is emotionally re-written as reflexive examples. Findings – The use of emotions as qualitative researchers can enrich the understanding of organizational and social life by offering new questions, concepts, and theories. At the level of methodology, this leads one to develop and reflect upon an emotional and cognitive orientation of the field. Originality/value – The majority of narratives in organization studies remain sanitized, emotion-less texts. While a discussion of researcher-emotion can remain a back-stage activity between colleagues over dinner, It is believed that much can be gained by a more explicit discussion. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Individual psychology; Organizations; Qualitative research; Research methods; Research work",""
"Enhancing brand preference through corporate social responsibility initiatives in the Thai banking sector","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986161505&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011062296&partnerID=40&md5=b2e7ecedef6b287abf1536f57f7f953b","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of three corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives on brand preference in the Thai banking sector. Design/methodology/approach – A 2 × 2 × 2 between subject experimental design was used to test the hypotheses in a bank setting. Three CSR initiatives were tested against a predictor variable of perceived brand quality and moderated by age, CSR predisposition and cultural values. The CSR initiatives comprised commitment to CSR; type of CSR programme; and transparency. Written vignettes disguised as press releases by the bank were used as stimulus materials and a survey completed by 219 consumers in Thailand. Findings – Overall, all three CSR initiatives had a modest but significant effect on brand preference. The level of influence varied according to age, CSR predisposition and cultural values. While older customers placed more emphasis on perceived brand quality overall it was also found that the type of CSR programme could significantly affect brand preference. In those groups high on the cultural value of individualism, commitment to CSR was found to be a strong contributor to brand preference. Similarly in those groups with a high power distance, brand preference was more influenced by CSR initiatives. Research limitations/implications – While CSR initiatives make modest improvements to brand preference overall, more substantial impacts occur under situational conditions. Discovering and exploiting such situations is critical to any firm making substantial investments in CSR. Practical implications – The differential impact of CSR initiatives on brand preference highlights the importance of carefully targeting stakeholders to optimise CSR investments. Communication strategies need to ensure that the appropriate message is designed for particular audiences. Originality/value – A specific dependent variable of brand preference is used in this study, together with three specific CSR initiatives and three moderating influences. In addition, perceived brand quality is utilised as a benchmark variable to test the strength of CSR initiatives. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Banks; Brand image; Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Thailand",""
"Knowledge construction and risk induction/mitigation in dialogical workgroup processes","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885731579&doi=10.1108%2f17465641011068839&partnerID=40&md5=95b70cf43b5ca656e8db278dc99d2aba","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge is constructed and risk is induced within the workgroup environment of a large North American aerospace company. Design/methodology/approach – Based on an epistemological position on knowledge and risk, an initial conceptual framework is proposed. This is then evaluated and re-constructed across a qualitative and ethnographic case study approach involving direct observations and interviews, whereby empirical results were interpreted and analysed across discourse analysis. Findings – A dialogical model is proposed describing both verbal and non-verbal interactions between group members leading towards knowledge complexification on the one hand and risk mitigation on the other hand. Factors leading towards dialogical breakdown and subsequent risk induction are also presented. Research limitations/implications – This single case study prevents generalizing the findings across the entire firm in question, and by extension any manner of external validity outside of the firm’s context. Additional workgroups/teams within the firm need to be evaluated, while similar studies in other institutions within the knowledge economy are to be envisaged. Practical implications – Workgroup managers must nurture an environment conducive towards mutual trust and respect, where individuals are given the time and freedom to express themselves, all the while being open to differing viewpoints and experiences. Coercive dialogue between members should be discouraged. It is proposed that this can be achieved across a parental “safety net” approach. Originality/value – The paper presents the “how” and “why” of an effective dialogical knowledge constructing process occurring at the interpersonal level, attempts to propose how management can to help achieve this within their organisation, and attempts to bridge the areas of knowledge creation and risk induction at the interpersonal/workgroup level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Aerospace industry; Group communications; Group work; Knowledge management; Risk management",""

Specifically, it applies Shotter’s “practical author” framework to examine the author-response interaction between the safety coordinator and othermid-level supervisors. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative methodology is employed to examine this authorship. Data include printed materials employees receive upon hire, an observation of an environment of care orientation presentation, and semi-structured interviews with the safety coordinator and mid-level supervisors. Findings – The paper reveals how the safety coordinator uses a variety of rhetorical strategies to balance the tensions between mandating compliance with environment of care requirements and facilitating buy-in to the idea of compliance as a moral and ethical imperative. This creates an ethos among the employees where they feel authorized to go beyond the requirements and act on their own to construct a safer culture. Research limitations/implications – The paper has multiple practical and theoretical implications that may be useful to health care and other organizations when examining the broader need for a complete, supportive environment where employees not only comply with but actually live and believe in the values of their organizations’ cultures. A limitation is that employee perspective and behavior are primarily inferred based on supervisor reports.

Design/methodology/approach – Aggregated (marketlevel) Nielsen timeseries category management and sales data for several variety enhancer categories in the Korean supermarket industry are analyzed. Findings – Across both small and large supermarkets, both the number of brands and the forward inventory level had positive effects on sales while days of supply of a product had a significant negative effect. For large supermarkets, the outofstock rate also had a significant negative effect, while for small supermarkets the retail distribution rate had a significant positive effect. Research limitations/implications – Using data for the Korean supermarket industry, this study demonstrates which policies for product assortment, pricing, stocking, and product replenishment can affect category sales and how these effects may vary between large and small stores. However, the findings rest on marketlevel aggregated data and may be limited in scope to variety enhancer (i.e. low purchase frequency and high penetration) categories. Future research could try to relax these limitations. Originality/value – The value of this study lies in confirming findings such as how category sales are higher in categories with a relatively larger number of brands (as has been observed in the US supermarket industry), as well as in the surprising finding that category pricing policies do not have a significant effect on category sales even though variety enhancer categories are generally considered price sensitive. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand management; Distribution; Pricing; South Korea; Supermarkets; Suppliers",""

Design/methodology/approach – The Multinational Corporation (MNC) in this study applies a standardized research approach worldwide to measure satisfaction among customers for business services. Quantitative surveys are used to gather data from 707 senior managers in the USA and 700 senior managers in Japan. Findings – The results of the analysis show that there are both similarities and differences across countries in the way customers conceptualize relevant construct, and evaluate supplier performance. The results also suggest that adaptation of research methodologies from country to country should be done. Research limitations/implications – This paper identifies key differences in the way customers both in the USA and Japan respond to survey research, but this paper has not identified reasons causing these differences. Practical implications – Conceptual models and research approaches developed in the USA cannot simply be applied cross culturally without modification. This study has implications in a business-to-business (B2B) services context only. Originality/value – MNCs play a major role in world trade, but over 30 years of discussion have failed to resolve the question of standardization vs adaptation in marketing across borders and consumer satisfaction research. The present study aims to address these concerns in a B2B services context and provide some useful insights for both managers and academics.

Design/methodology/approach – A single case study approach has been adopted to generate rich data designed to aid understanding of the complexities of multilevel governance, feature of international football governance. Findings – The key conclusions of this research are that the Phoenix is attracted to the Asian football market because of the financial rewards but are prevented in doing so because of policies related to Fédération Internationale de Football Association's confederation structures. Research limitations/implications – It is hoped that this paper will encourage more academics to investigate: the extent to which football's governance structures act as either a facilitating or constraining factor to the growth of football in the region; the possible convergence between Asian and Pacific sporting economies; how other Asian sporting organisations are reacting to increasing interest from nonAsian organisations in accessing their marketplaces; and the performance of a network and its members when subjected to multiple levels of governance. Originality/value – The originality of this paper lies in its proposition that conflict within an international strategic alliance is likely to be exacerbated when the alliance is characterised by multiple levels of governance.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a multidisciplinary literature review of the emotional phenomenon, research hypotheses are proposed and empirically tested against two samples exposed to two comparable major sport events in Australia and France. Findings – Data reveal that Australian and French spectators' emotional responses differ in terms of valence, but not in terms of intensity. This initial difference, in turn, impacts the effect of emotional responses on sponsorship attitudinal outcomes. The more positive are sportrelated emotions, the stronger their impact on the sponsorship persuasion process. The proposed mediating effect of attitude towards the event is partially supported. Research limitations/implications – The results are limited by the small sample size and the inherent bias of the verbal measurement of the emotional phenomenon. Originality/value – Despite omnipresence in sports events, emotions and their influence on sponsorship outcomes have not been clarified yet, once simply disregarded by many scholars. This paper provides evidence that emotions can contribute to the formation of attitudes towards sponsors, in some cases mediated by attitude towards the event. In addition, in line with the global reach of sports and sports sponsorship a comparison of results between samples from Australia and France creates a valuable contribution of this paper to marketing theory and practice. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Attitude surveys; Australia; France; Sponsorship; Sporting events",""

The paper aims to examine the effects of advertising recipients' positive and negative associations, that is their memories and fantasies evoked by the advertising stimulus, on brand attitude for advertisements that require little effort to process; focusing on positively framed advertisements. Design/methodology/approach – This paper suggests a model on the effects of positive and negative association on brand attitude and tests it using partial least square. Advertisements that are easy to process were selected in a pre-test. Findings – It is shown that if advertisements are easy to process, the effects of consumers' associations depend on their favourableness: positive associations have a positive effect and negative associations have a negative effect on brand attitude. These findings are an extension of knowledge on the effects of associations, because for informational advertisements previous research has demonstrated that associations generally have a negative effect on brand attitude. Practical implications – Results of this study suggest that evoking positive memories and fantasies in the target group enhances the effectiveness of advertisements that require little effort to process. Originality/value – Effects of associations on brand attitude have not been studied for advertisements that require little effort to process.

Design/methodology/approach – The results are based on a cross-section sample of 846 households in Vietnam using self-administrating questionnaires, with fish as a main research object, and analyzed using structural equation modelling. Findings – The relationship between perceived risk and satisfaction is negative and satisfaction has a significantly positive effect on repurchase loyalty. This study suggests that perceived risk has an indirect effect on repurchase loyalty through satisfaction. Besides direct effects on perceived risk and satisfaction, knowledge proves to moderate negatively both the relationship between perceived risk and satisfaction, and the relationship between satisfaction and repurchase loyalty. Research limitations/implications – This study mainly focuses on fish as a common food and considers the role of food risk with an emphasis on perceived health risk and subjective knowledge. Thus, future study should include other dimensions of risk, objective knowledge and other products. Other antecedents toward repurchase loyalty (e.g. price/value) or other moderators (e.g. ambivalence, personal characteristics) should be used in future studies. Practical implications – Management attention should focus on reducing risks with which consumers may be faced through producing fresh or safe fish products, and communicating broadly safe signals of their products. Communication strategy should focus much more on improving knowledge and signing food safety for consumers with lower knowledge than the others. Originality/value – This is believed to be the first study to empirically examine the combined role of perceived risk and knowledge within a satisfaction-loyalty framework in the Vietnamese market. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Consumer risk; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Fish (food); Vietnam",""

Specifically, retail segments and critical factors related to the nature of the food supplier relationships that may be influenced by the positioning strategies are investigated. Design/methodology/approach – The retail markets in Guangzou and Chengdu are investigated. Data are collected by means of observation and survey and then combined in the analyses. Observational research (i.e. expert assessments) is conducted in 152 retail outlets in order to assess their positioning strategies. The purchasing managers in the same retail outlets are personally interviewed by means of structured questionnaires. Findings – A threecluster solution for the positioning strategies is revealed: downmarket stores, middlerange stores, and upmarket stores. The annual sales and the number of selfservice counters are highest among upmarket retailers. They are also typically joint ventures, supermarkets and department stores, and members of a retail chain. A broad range of brands and products and also marketing support from the suppliers are most important for the upmarket stores.

Thumbnail sketches of the retailer segments enable food suppliers to make better and more informed decisions about how to position their product offer and marketing mix.

They were asked, via telephone and e-mail, whether (and if so, how) they perceived themselves to have been affected by their interview for “Hard Labour 1”. Findings – Some respondents are interviewed at a time of personal anxiety. This group perceived their interview as having been influential because it made them reflect deeply on their situation, bringing their thoughts to bear when they conducted subsequent negotiations with partners. However, participants do not see this as a reason to avoid qualitative research. They describe themselves as agentic beings who felt ownership of their involvement in “Hard Labour 1”. Their approach make to reflect upon the author’s interpretation of “safeguarding” which is now regarded as a concept which may be co-constructed between researcher and participants. Originality/value – The paper explores “safeguarding” in relation to the long-term effects of qualitative research interviews. It is suggest that undertaking a reflexive reappraisal of research practices is important because analyses of past projects may (as in the author’s case) result in a “shift” in understanding of research concepts from both an empirical and a theoretical perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Interviews; Marriage; Qualitative methods; Qualitative research; Role conflict",""
"Selecting key capabilities of TV-shopping companies applying analytic network process","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053969693&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910926308&partnerID=40&md5=b1212ac6b3f42094a2c446a28faaec74","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to help Taiwan TV-shopping companies to effectively select the key capabilities by introducing a multiple criteria decision-making method, the analytic network process (ANP), that has been employed in many areas of managerial decision making. Design/methodology/approach – Reviewing the literatures about the balanced scorecard and interviewing the executives obtains the perspectives and criteria to construct the hierarchy for selecting the key capabilities of TV-shopping companies. Selecting perspectives and criteria of the balanced scorecard are interrelated. Owing to the interdependent relations in decision making, ANP is applied, which captures the outcome of dependency between the perspectives and criteria for handling such problems. Findings – After reviewing the literatures about the balanced scorecard and interviewing the executives, ten critical criteria are retained: proposal, employee satisfaction, data integrity, risk, treatment, customer satisfaction, brand, revenue growth, cost, budget. Practical implications – According to the ten important criteria, Taiwan TV-shopping companies could select the optimal key capabilities more effectively. Moreover, a practical application of ANP presented in section 4 is generic and also suitable to be exploited for Taiwan TV-shopping companies. Originality/value – As TV-shopping channels have been increasing and the industry prospering, a more specified and scientific selection method is essential for the more complex decision making of determining key capability, a critical source of core competitiveness. The paper contributes to selecting the optimal key capabilities more effectively. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Balanced scorecard; Electronic commerce; Taiwan; Television",""
"The correlates of cognitive ageing and adoption of defensive-ageing strategies among older adults","2009","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986097669&doi=10.1108%2f13555850910950095&partnerID=40&md5=ecdb1a3dec045b3a380b29701e0f0780","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to test the relationship between cognitive age and the adoption of defensive ageing consumption activities and its effect on life satisfaction in an Asian context. The relationship between the antecedent variables of chronological age, biological age and transitional life events and cognitive age is examined. Design/methodology/approach – Survey method. The study was conducted in Malaysia, an Asian country that is characterized as collectivistic. Data collection method used is convenience sampling method, using a sample of adults aged 40 years or older based on previous research. Measures used include cognitive age developed by Barak and Schiffman and validated by Wilkes. Life stage transitional events include a list of ten major life events that respondents experienced in the past 12 months. Biological changes are summated index of the number of biological changes (e.g. lengthy hospitalization or rehabilitation, hearing impairment) adopted from Mathur and Moschis. Defensive ageing consumption activities include skin care products, health supplements, beauty treatment and exercising, that are commonly adopted to fight ageing. Findings – The paper finds that in the context of an Asian country, consumers view themselves to be several younger than their chronological age, consistent with past research. Biological changes, transitional life events and chronological age had a significant positive relationship with cognitive age, consistent with the findings of past research. To the extent that cognitive age was found to be positively related to transitional life events, regression analysis showed that life event was not a predictor of cognitive age, further contributing to the inconclusive evidence regarding the effect of life events on cognitive age. Research results supported the negative relationship between cognitive age and anti-ageing consumption behaviour. Practical implications – Study of this nature will help to shape marketers' approach to attract older consumers. Marketers should shift their focus away from regarding older consumers as old since older consumers tend to view themselves as younger than their chronological age. An understanding of how consumers perceive themselves in terms of their cognitive age is useful for segmentation. Knowing how older adults view “age” is useful for communication strategies. Originality/value – This paper examines the effect of cognitive age on defensive ageing consumption activities in an Asian country, a collectivist society. The defensive consumption strategies included in this study were a range of products were commonly known but not tested. It extends the research by looking at the effect of defensive ageing consumption activities on life satisfaction. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cognition; Consumer behaviour; Individual perception; Lifestyles; Malaysia; Older consumers",""

Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology is to apply an innovative tool to discover knowledge on customer behavior patterns instead of using conventional statistical methods. The RS theory was applied to discover the voice of customers in market research. The collected data contained 422 records. Each record included 20 condition attributes as well as two decision attributes. The important attributes that ensured high quality of classification were generated first. Then decision rules for classifying high and low overall satisfaction and loyalty categories were derived. Findings – Three important facts were found: the important product and service attributes that lead to overall satisfaction and loyalty; the percentage of latently dissatisfied customers; and customer decision rules. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited by the case company and its experience. These rules were presented to the company's sales and marketing managers who believed that they provided them with valuable information for creating strategies to increase customer satisfaction and retention. Originality/value – RS theory provides a mathematical tool to discover patterns hidden in survey data. The paper describes a new attempt of applying a RS-based method to analyze overall customer satisfaction and loyalty behavior through regular satisfaction questionnaire surveys. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer satisfaction; Manufacturing industries; Taiwan",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered from 388 consumers in Australia across four different product classes. Data analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression analysis with threeway interactions and a novel post hoc slope analysis is introduced to the marketing area. Findings – Overall, the study findings suggest that the importance that consumers place on countryoforigin (COO) image when they evaluate products is contingent on the product context. Specifically, the study findings show that productcountry image, productorigin congruency and product involvement interact on product evaluations and intentions such that productorigin congruency plays a differentiating role for consumers in a low involvement situation, but a neutral role for consumers in a high involvement situation. Therefore, when a company deals with lessinvolved customers, the COO image and the congruency of the product origins are particularly important issues. Conversely, when a company deals with more productinvolved customers, productorigin congruency has no differential influence on their product evaluations and behavioural intentions to purchase. Originality/value – An important extension to past research in the area is to provide analyses of the joint effects which may be different from their roles when investigated separately. The present paper represents the first empirical investigation of the threeway interaction of productorigin image, productorigin congruency and product involvement on consumers' productrelated evaluations and behavioural intentions.

Development of a method based on Weick’s sensemaking is suggested as a starting point for a heuristic that takes into account missing elements from his original model while operationalizing (critical) sensemaking as an analytical tool for understanding organizational events. Design/methodology/approach – Following the trajectory of sensemaking, the limitations of Weick’s model were discussed (i.e. failure to address power and context) and the critical sensemaking was developed as a method that takes into account agency in context. Empirical studies that apply sensemaking were discussed. Findings – It is concluded that plausibility and identity construction are key to understanding how some voices are heard over others and through critical sensemaking sense that can be made of such phenomena as the gendering or organizational culture and discriminatory practices in organizations. Practical implications – A heuristic can help people to understand the socio-psychological properties involved in behavioural outcomes.

"Reconceptualization of price mavenism: Do Chinese consumers get a glow when they know?","2010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876440636&doi=10.1108%2f13555851011062232&partnerID=40&md5=ee735cb385b843c0df709e83037e8ff9","Purpose – Buyers in China often communicate positive and negative purchasing experiences through wordofmouth (WOM), which creates special problems and opportunities for marketers. Price mavenism, which is associated with priceinformation searching and pricesharing behavior, is often considered a negative dimension of price. The purpose of this paper, however, is to propose price mavenism as an outcome variable arising from both positive perceptions of price (prestige sensitivity) and negative perceptions (price and value consciousness) and examine that the “know” (price mavenism) will positively impact the “glow” (shopping hedonism) among the Chinese. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through a survey in Shanghai, China. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings – This study found that prestige sensitivity, price consciousness and value consciousness shaped price mavenism among the Chinese, supporting the idea that price mavenism arises from both positive and negative perceptions of price. In addition, for the Chinese, being a source of price information and sharing the knowledge with their social groups fulfill a hedonic motivation for shopping. While value consciousness was positively associated with shopping hedonism, price consciousness per se was not. Research limitations/implications – This study challenges the idea that price mavenism is mainly explained by a negative perception of price. Practical implications – By understanding the drivers of price mavenism and their impacts on shopping hedonism, international marketers can finetune their marketing strategies to appeal more effectively to price mavens in China. Originality/value – This study highlights the importance of cultural perspectives in understanding the structure of price mavenism and its theoretical and marketing foundations. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Consumer behaviour; Influence; Perception; Pricing; Shopping",""

While these opportunities exist, to date little is known about the extent to which marron growing is meaningful to local entrepreneurs in commercial terms, their level of involvement with this industry, or constraints they may face. This paper aims to examine these dimensions to illustrate marron's importance for the areas where they are grown. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 26 small marron growers accepted the invitation to participate in semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews. Findings – Operators' comments illustrate the significant potential for marron to become both a niche market product as well as a rural niche market that helps promote the area where they are grown. However, growing marron as a full-time activity is still very limited; in fact, many respondents grow marron marginally and as an extra income stream because of the crustacean's current high commercial value, thus suggesting the industry's current developmental stage. Research limitations/implications – With some 200 marron growers in Western Australia, the number of participating operations is limited to make generalisations of the industry. Practical implications – With growing consumer sophistication, knowledge and interest in gourmet foods, the findings not only have implications for the marron growing industry, but also for hospitality and tourism, particularly in view of marron growing's potential to blend with these industries.

Tree graphs, concept mapping, and member checking are applied in a managerial case study, complementing a conventional grounded theory approach. Findings – The paper suggests that naturalistic inquiries, such as grounded theory and thematic analysis, can use mixed methods and multiple sources and coders in order to offset biases and to validate and sort findings. The case study presents three different perspectives on how an organization comprehends diversity as a strategic issue. Originality/value – The paper suggests a mixed methods design that addresses some of the potential shortcomings often found in grounded theory and other qualitative studies, their theory development and their documentation of processes.

Design/methodology/approach – The experiment employs two levels of option choice reversibility: fully reversible without a penalty vs strictly irreversible. Participants add options to a base model or delete options from a full model and are either allowed or not allowed to change options in a condominium purchase scenario. Findings – Compared to participants in the irreversible choice condition, those in the reversible choice select more options and end up with higher total spending. In the irreversible option choice condition, participants anticipate more upset (one aspect of regret) when they take actions than inaction, but in the reversible option choice condition, the reverse is true. Research limitations/implications – The study uses only one decision stimulus, which is a condominium purchase, and the purchase scenario might not be as realistic as an actual purchase decision. Practical implications – Refunds and option change permission policies make consumers feel they can reverse their buying decisions, making them feel the decisions are less risky and thus inducing them to buy more than when no refunds or option change is allowed after purchase. To drive consumers to take actions, marketers should allow consumers to change their mind after making decisions and assure them of such policy. Originality/value – The paper shows the effect of decision reversibility on the total spending (i.e. the total costs of choices made) and extends the theory about omission biases by demonstrating that regrets from actions/inaction depend on decision reversibility. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Marketing strategy; Property marketing; Singapore",""

Design/methodology/approach – Thepaperdrawson the authors’ experience of empirical qualitative research with working carers. This experience is grounded within the traditions of interpretative phenomenology and critical epistemology. Findings – Two reflexive risks: an unintended focus on researcher rather than participant; and process at the expense of substance are discussed and the first of these, reflexive narcissism, is associated with the recognition of biographical similarity between researcher and participant, and the second, a kind of reflexive “process-ism”, with certain research designs involving meta-reflection with participants on the research experience. The paper advocates the use of multiple reflexivities and an intrinsic sensibility to reflexive possibility throughout the duration of a research programme. Research limitations/implications – The paper offers an alternative model of reflexivity and some practical guidelines, which may be of value to researchers working across a range of different qualitative methodologies. Practical implications – The paper makes some preliminary observations about the phenomenon of the working carer, which may be of value to organisational practitioners.

Researchers developed a theoretical model and tested it in the postliberalized Indian retail banking context to address these concerns. Design/methodology/approach – Bank branches constituted the unit of analysis. Further to getting initial insights on market orientation in retail banking through interviews researchers conducted a survey among branch managers. A total of 305 branch managers were contacted of which 122 cooperated. Findings – Regression results suggest that superior personnel related and goal setting autonomy at boundary spanning levels have positive market orientation as well as performance implications. Marketing autonomy did not have significant impact on market orientation. Autonomy and decentralization though conceptually different displayed similar implications on market orientation and performance. Formalization while negatively impacting market orientation did not directly impact performance. Practical implications – As firm performance is dependent on subunit performance, managers should naturally be interested in factors that enhance performance at subunit level. Current research finds evidence for superior personnel and goal setting autonomy as well as less rigid rules facilitating market orientation and performance at the subunit level. Originality/value – This is the first effort to study market orientation at the boundary spanning levels in service organizations.

The research examines the broader question of whether sponsorship has the potential to transcend cultural boundaries and contribute to financial performance in regional markets. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is based on the event study technique which is applied to the estimation of excess returns that arise in response to announcements of corporate sponsorship made by leading industrial stocks trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. Regressions examine whether the cost and duration of sponsorship signal information of importance to investors regarding the financial prospects of sponsoring firms. Findings – A small, fleeting positive increase in wealth effects is observed indicating that economically, sponsorship expenditure in Australia is more or less value neutral. While investors appear indifferent to sponsorship cost, they value shortterm sponsorships of less than two years in particular. Research limitations/implications – Future research needs to examine the role of associated variables such as contract size and length, and the type and level of sponsorship investment. Originality/value – For firms, the study indicates that sponsorship in smaller regional markets should be valued by investors especially when firms keep the duration of the sponsorship as short. As stock prices tend to rise briefly following sponsorship announcements, marketers should leverage sponsorships immediately to gain the attention of investors. For a regional market, short and sharp sponsorships appear to be the optimal approach. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Financial performance; Sponsorship; Stock prices",""

The hypotheses were tested by employing structural equation modelling with a maximum likelihood estimation option. Findings- It was found that although both MO and CSR could enhance performance, once the effects of CSR are accounted for, the direct effects of MO on performance diminish considerably to almost non-existent. Although this result may be due to the fact that the research is conducted in China, a country where CSR might be crucially important to performance given the country's socialist legacy, it nonetheless provides strong evidence that MO's impact on organizational performance is mediated by CSR.Research limitations/implications- The main limitations include the use of cross-sectional data, the subjective measurement of performance and the uniqueness of the research setting (China).

Whereas this might be considered a competitive situation, the purpose of this paper is to examine how interest in overseas football (soccer) leagues played a symbiotic role in the successful development of an Australian national soccer league. Design/methodology/approach – Results of survey data are presented from two clubs in Australia's newly formed ALeague. Three surveys were conducted over a two year period with over 3,700 season ticket holders. Specific attention is paid to fans' previous interest and exposure to football, which is then related to attitudes and behaviour associated with the new clubs.

Those who follow teams in overseas leagues are more likely to be heavy consumers of the new local league than those who follow local leagues or had no prior experience. They also exhibit stronger attitudinal and behavioural loyalty, such as higher attendance and renewal rates of season tickets. Practical implications – Recognising fan interest in multiple teams/leagues as positive involves a shift in management thinking away from a competitive to a collaborative stance. In this case, rapid adoption of new teams is encouraged by capitalising on strong interest in overseas leagues. This requires careful structuring and branding of the competition that mimicks familiar foreign leagues, while minimising unfavourable comparisons in areas like quality of play. Originality/value – This study capitalises on the rare opportunity to examine foundation teams in a new national league. The findings highlight the importance and value of taking a “global” perspective to the marketing of sports, and of carefully leveraging the interest in other elite competitions to build interest in new leagues. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Consumer behaviour; Football; Marketing strategy; Sports",""

Design/methodology/approach – Fitting with an inductive approach, 12 semistructured interviews are conducted in order to analyse the perceptions of Chinese fans of four English Premier League clubs. Findings – The results of this research highlight the fact that the strength of professional football brand equity on the Chinese market is strongly determined by the level of brand awareness and perceived quality but, due to the increasing competition on foreign markets, professional football clubs need to clearly define their strategic marketing in order to improve the two other dimensions of brand equity, which are brand image and loyalty, which represents crucial stake to distinguish themselves. Originality/value – The results provide useful information for professional clubs in general which want to become global but also provide relevant ways to improve brand equity for the four clubs investigated. This paper is one of the first to analyse perceived brand equity of professional clubs in direct competition among foreign potential or current customers. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand equity; China; Football; International business",""

The impact of the socio-cultural influences on the gender roles portrayal in magazine advertisements of the two countries is examined. Design/methodology/approach – Advertisements appearing in popular Indian and US magazine advertisements were analyzed with respect to the portrayal of male and female models shown in the print advertisements. The advertisements for five products were examined and observations were recorded. The role portrayals of the male and female models in the two countries are compared and discussed. Findings – The study concludes that there are both significant differences and some similarities in characteristics of gender roles as manifested in Indian and US magazine advertisements. The findings are consistent with those of the few earlier researchers comparing gender roles in different countries. The overall results of the present study suggest to international advertisers that in developing their advertising campaigns for international markets it is important to reflect the cultural values of the society in which they wish to do business. Research limitations/implications – It is important to take into consideration the limitations of the study with regard to the advertising medium (magazines) and the products advertised. The study was restricted to selected magazines and products; other media such as TV and other products were not considered. The Indian magazines selected for this study are popular Indian national magazines in English which target the educated, well-to-do, middle-class, affluent, urban Indians who can afford to buy these products. Originality/value – There are few cross-cultural studies that have examined gender roles portrayal in US advertising vs those of developed and developing countries and this study adds to that body of knowledge. The results are important for guiding marketers in developing advertising campaigns. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising; Cross-cultural studies; Gender; India; Magazines; Role play; United States of America",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a case study approach with indepth interviews and structured observation of PRM processes at the focal company. Findings – The focal company was able to design an efficient and effective product recovery and recycle manufacturing system by standardizing highquality raw materials, using a modular structure for the product and maintaining control over the entire process and bypassing the temptation to use thirdparty collectors and processors. Research limitations/implications – Primary research relates to the single case study and the focal company; however, the findings may not generally apply to other fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG).

Design-methodology/approach – Since this paper proposes a conceptual model, a qualitative approach is taken to gather required information mainly through a search of the literature. Findings – It is argued that the effect of trust on B2B cooperation would be stronger in the collectivist culture than in the individualist culture. Furthermore, the negative consequence of power would be relatively insignificant in the collectivist culture because collectivist network tends to maintain harmony. It is possible to use power coercively in a high-power distance culture because in such a culture, cooperation is assumed to be power induced. However, opportunism is likely to raise a barrier to reap the benefits that cooperation generates in such cultures. Research limitations/implications – First, only two of the six dimensions originally proposed by Hofstede in 1980 are adopted for this paper. So, the proposed conceptual model only represents a partial conceptualisation of the Hofstede's framework. Secondly, this paper included only the relationship among three constructs (trust, power, and cooperation) drawn from the relationship paradigm reported in the literature. Therefore, the paper conceptualises a partial view of possible exchanges. Originality/value – This paper helps broaden an understanding of relationships involving power, trust, and cooperation and can be considered an advancement in research because of its approach to study relationships between the above variables in an international setting proposing culture as having moderating effects on those relationships. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business-to-business marketing; National cultures; Relationship marketing",""
"The selection of international retail franchisees in East Asia","2007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955935589&doi=10.1108%2f13555850710827878&partnerID=40&md5=fdefa7b13dc435249c51f158654997af","Purpose – Although international franchising has occurred in East Asia over the past 20 years, surprisingly very little academic research has been undertaken to understand key dynamics of this marketing phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to examine franchise resources, which is a key construct in the internationalization of retail franchising. Design/methodology/approach – A multiple case study approach has been adopted to generate rich data designed to aid understanding of the complexities inherent within such an international marketing relationship. The data were drawn from five US food service retail franchises, which are household brands across East Asia, operating in Singapore. Findings – This study presents several interesting findings for the retail franchise industry. First, consistent with resource scarcity theory, international franchising relationship begins with a high degree of franchise dependency on the local franchisees. Next, international franchisors will be well served to select their overseas franchisees with strong financial resources to engage in rapid expansion, good contacts to secure early stores in prime retail locations and well-proven local knowledge to modify the concept to suit particular market needs. Practical implications – Findings from this study have important managerial implications for international retail franchisors on how to effectively select franchisees to successfully launch and manage their brands in East Asia. Originality/value – This empirical study has made a major contribution in adding to the limited body of empirical knowledge on franchisee selection in international retail franchising, particularly in East Asia. It is hoped that this paper will encourage more academics to investigate why certain international retail franchise concepts perform relatively better in East Asia than others. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Economic resources; Food service; Franchising; National markets; Singapore",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs historical analysis; and textual analysis to achieve its purpose. Findings – Chinese advertising regulation relies largely on government regulation, and self-regulation plays a much subdued and marginal role. The Chinese regulator aims to control the negative effects of advertising through rigorous regulation as well as certification and censorship programs, but its various advertising laws and regulations are invariably phrased in vague and general terms, so that enforcement and compliance become a major issue. The lack of autonomous trade and consumer organizations combined with minimal public participation in the system further reduces its transparency and effectiveness. Practical implications – The paper offers a detailed road-map for advertising professionals to navigate the complex Chinese advertising regulation system. Originality/value – The paper is the first English article to provide a systematic examination of Chinese advertising regulation. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising standards; China; Laws",""
"Mature franchise systems use multiple unit franchising to leverage learning economies and sustain systemwide growth","2007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986038197&doi=10.1108%2f13555850710738471&partnerID=40&md5=43220f8ff9f1352ff0ed9bd3d6b9fe79","Purpose – This paper aims to extend current understanding of organisational choice theory through examining to what extent firm-level factors influence the growth of franchisee-owned mini-chains within Australian franchise systems. In particular, this study examines how the age of the system, corporatisation of management processes, plurality of distribution, levels of intra-firm conflict and franchise system complexity influence multiple unit franchising adoption. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative methodology was adopted to gain a clearer picture of the salient issues influencing multiple unit franchising adoption from the franchisor's perspective. Findings – The research reveals that mature franchise systems in Australia use sequential methods of multiple unit franchising expansion in order to minimise adverse selection costs and leverage learning economies derived from previous experiences in managing intra-firm channel relationships. Research limitations/implications – Industry-specific influences and differences in managerial orientations may limit the predictive application of this study to all franchise systems. However, on balance the reflections offered by the participants provide a rich and valuable source of information about the factors influencing their willingness to encourage this growth strategy. Practical implications – Franchisors need to consider upfront whether they are ready and able to encourage multiple unit ownership within their systems. Less experienced franchisors may need to corporatise operations, minimise channel conflict and introduce administrative support procedures to ensure the recruitment of suitable franchisee candidates who will assist in realising the franchisor's goals, thus promoting a harmonious franchising relationship. Originality/value – Whereas, previous research has investigated motivations for encouraging multiple unit franchising, this paper supplements that literature by examining multiple unit franchising within Australia. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Corporate governance; Franchising; Learning organizations",""

Based on this suggestions for domestic retailers’ development strategies are made. Design/methodology/approach – The landscape of China's retail sector is given first in the paper. A critical review of variations of regional markets following the models adopted by Swanson and Cui and Liu is carried out. A focus group discussion is conducted. Analysis of the focus group discussion highlights the strategic issues of retail development and expansion. Findings – Synthesis of recent studies on China's retail market and results generated from the focus group indicate that the development patterns in the regional markets could vary. Domestic and international retailers enjoy different advantages and face different challenges in their expansion. Issues concerning learning, infrastructure development, government policy and business culture are addressed.

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 250 children aged between 7 and 12 years, drawn in the sample from five major towns of the relatively affluent western state of Gujarat (India) by using the cluster sampling approach. A simple questionnaire using three point rating scale was administered with the help of moderators. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software. Findings – It was found that children's ability to decode and process advertising messages and to understand their intents is influenced not only by their cognitive abilities at different age strata but also by their social and personal environments. Social norms related to acceptability and appropriateness of gender behavior also influence the processing of ad messages by the children of both sexes. Other elements like likeability of the model, character or endorser, story line, slogan and the music will create liking or disliking for a particular advertisement and hence decoding of its message. Research limitations/implications – As it was not possible to use advanced psychometric tools for the study on children, a simple three a point scale used for the purpose could have had its own limitations. Future research can benefit from further improvements in measuring techniques. Originality/value – How children decode an advertising message and what are the sources of influence is not an actively researched topic in India.

Shopping malls are not nearly as well established in developing and newly industrialized countries, however. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to assess international consumer behavior in regards to shopping malls in a non-Western country, specifically, Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach – A survey of Malaysian university students was conducted to assess the mall-directed shopping habits and shopping orientations of young adults in that country. A total of 132 usable surveys were obtained from five university campuses in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia, a region with a numerous institutions of higher learning. Findings – Malaysian students were motivated to visit malls primarily by the interior design of the mall; products that interested them; opportunities for socializing with friends; and convenient one-stop shopping. Further analysis showed that younger respondents have more favorable dispositions or shopping orientations towards malls than somewhat older respondents. Post-secondary students in the Klang Valley of Malaysia were frequent and long-staying visitors to shopping malls, typically visiting six stores per 2.5 h mall visit. And, more than one-third of respondents visited three or more different shopping malls during the previous 30 days. Generally, the observed Malaysian shopping behavior was similar to that observed of Western shoppers in prior shopping studies. Research limitations/implications – The sampling frame for this research was limited to students in the Klang Valley regions in Malaysia. Study findings, although interesting, are clearly not generalizable to all populations of non-Western consumers or even all Malaysian consumers. The non-probabilistic convenience sampling methods used in this research due to time and resource constraints may have lead to biases in selection of respondents. It is recommended that future research utilize random sampling methods to ensure the generalizability of results. Future research should also consider a broader demographic profile (not just students) representing multiple geographical locations in Malaysia as well as other countries in the Asia-pacific region given that consumers' shopping-related perceptions and expectations are likely to differ across countries or cultures throughout the world. Originality/value – The data indicated the primacy of certain shopping motives over others in explaining why respondents visited shopping malls. The results of our study have several implications that should be of benefit to the retailing industry, and mall management, specifically. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural studies; Malaysia; Shopping centres",""

Through the deconstruction a number of important methodological and epistemological issues are raised. Firstly, the way in which the value of qualitative research in management and organization studies is judged more by how it conforms to acceptable ways of data collection, analysis and interpretation (strategic apparatus) than on any “truth” value it may have. Secondly, a consideration of how the “I” of the researcher is influential in how research is undertaken and written up. Thirdly, that this “I” of the researcher is also determined by what is acceptable “scientific” discourse and by other prevailing discourses. Design/methodology/approach – In a paper published in 1996, the author detailed the “dark side” of an entrepreneur for whom he worked. Using a psychoanalytic framework this paper constructed the entrepreneur as an irrational and unethical incompetent. In the present paper, this earlier work is deconstructed using insights from Derrida’s in order to highlight “strategic exclusions,” and to offer alternative readings. These alternative readings emphasize the influence of various discourses on the construction of the earlier paper, and also introduce a reading of the earlier paper as a psychoanalytic narrative. Findings – The paper highlights the uses to which “objective tools” of analysis can be put in order to manipulate and construct an explanation and interpretation of personal experiences.This raises important epistemological issues concerning the influence of broader discourses on the representation of experiences and how realities and identities are constructed and performed. The paper concludes by suggesting that whom we are as researchers, and what we observe and write, is more complex and influenced by more discourse(s) than we might think. Even if researchers tell impressionistic and confessional tales simultaneously with their realist ones, it is necessary to consider what discourses may lay behind their telling. It has been argued that a limitation of deconstruction is that it may result in endless iterations and readings of text with no discursive closure. This may be a limitation of the deconstruction offered here. Originality/value – The paper raises questions about the nature of the “academic” narrative and the importance of deconstruction in establishing author positioning within narrative. It contributes to the discussion about objectivity in organizational and management research and issues of epistemology and ontology more generally. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurs; Experiential learning; Narratives",""

Findings – If one steps down from the tip of the iceberg and inspects the underwater properties of case study research and network theory a common core is found: the recognition of complexity. The methodologies supplement each other, case study research primarily using verbal language and qualitative data, while network theory uses a nodes-and-links language that opens up for verbal, graphic and mathematical treatment. Case study research is primarily associated with qualitative research in social sciences and network theory with quantitative research in both social and natural sciences. By abolishing the unfortunate categories of qualitative/quantitative and natural sciences/social sciences that have been set against each other, and letting them join forces for a common goal – to learn about life – people open up for methodological creativity.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper tests these effects based on relevant theories in the communication and advertising literature on two distinct ethnic groups (Malay and Chinese) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia utilizing questionnaires based on a fictitious advertisement for the dominant and non-dominant ethnic group in Malaysia. The advertisement used was for a fictitious can of drink and its design was common in Malaysia. Data collected were analyzed using Manova, General Linear Model, and Bonferoni. Findings – There were negative attitudinal, emotional, and behavioral reactions by those not targeted who saw these advertisements. Research limitations/implications – One limitation is that the study used two different advertisements, but each respondent saw only one. The advertisement was also for a fictitious product. Future research will benefit from further improvements (impact of product type or advertisement format) and replication of other ethnic groups or targeted groups. Practical implications – A practical implication is the importance of predetermining the appropriate use of language and dominance of the targeted group. Targeted communications strategy may not be the most effective method of communicating with a specific ethnic group in a plural society. Originality/value – The major contribution of this paper consists of the determination of negative effects of advertising on those not targeted, and the finding that the level of dominance plays a role in consumers’ reactions towards targeted advertising.

Design/methodology/approach – Personal interviews were conducted with 200 private entrepreneurs in China. A structured survey instrument was used and data were analyzed using SAS tools. Findings – Four key findings: Chinese entrepreneurs focus primarily on reaching an industrial client base among private companies in China; their marketing practices suggest that they prefer tight control over their operations; they use listed prices extensively and salespeople are typically given some flexibility in deviating from those listed prices; the development of sales/distribution networks is enhanced through the use of listed prices but is hurt by the flexibility salespeople have in deviating from those listed prices. Some marketing practices differ by geographic location of the entrepreneurial firm (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou) and by the type of entrepreneur (returnee, local). Research limitations/implications – It is imposible to offer a clear reference point for Chinese entrepreneurs; hence, apart from documenting their practices, it is not certain whether these practices are significantly different from others. All data are self-reported (including financial performance). Sampling frame: although every attempt was made to have a representative sample, there was no way to guarantee this. More comprehensive research to validate the findings is needed.

"Strategic marketing in Chinese manufacturing companies","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986038188&doi=10.1108%2f13555850810890057&partnerID=40&md5=17b74bb47d3e251973ea1940fa0773d3","This article aims to examine the extent to which Western World “textbook” strategic marketing is being practised within Chinese manufacturing companies as well as its contribution to competitive success. Data were collected by means of a web-based survey. A total of 89 usable questionnaires were received from Chinese manufacturing firms employing at least 50 people. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS. The results confirm that, on the whole, the basic strategic marketing practices which are typically advocated in the mainstream Western academic and prescriptive literature are being widely practised within Chinese manufacturing companies. The results also show the higher performing firms are clearly differentiated from their lower performing counterparts by doing more and better marketing. Because of the relatively low response rate, one limitation is the extent to which the sample is representative of the population under scrutiny. Also, in spite of the questionnaire being back translated, some misunderstanding of the questions cannot be ruled out. Originality/value — The paper confirms that Western strategic marketing practices are clearly associated with the higher performing Chinese manufacturing companies. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Competitive strategy; Manufacturing industries; Strategic marketing",""

Using narrative analysis, the purpose of this paper is to show how strategic intent of these two companies is revealed through their letters to shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative narrative analysis incorporating literary genres and strategic narratives and applying them to strategic schools of thought. Findings – Nike uses many narrative styles, suggesting they view events in a variety of ways in their sensemaking. Reebok, on the other hand, used a limited number of narrative styles, suggesting a limited view or interpretation of events. Research limitations/implications – Future research could include additional documents of the companies, both public and private. Practical implications – This analysis shows that companies can successfully use polyplotted and flexible narrative styles, whereas the old school of strategy suggested a single, unwavering course. Originality/value – The contribution of this paper is the use of organizational narrative as epistemology within the study of strategic management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Corporate communications; Corporate strategy; Epistemology; Literary forms; Narratives",""
"Online word-of-mouth: A comparison of American and Chinese discussion boards","2006","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986166567&doi=10.1108%2f13555850610658282&partnerID=40&md5=4c29cb867e1dc27a9f03d29c1ddd25dc","Purpose – The important influence of peer recommendations on consumer purchases has been strongly established. However, the growth of electronic discussion boards has created a channel for online word-of-mouth (OWOM) between people who have never met. This study aims to examine and compare the frequency and content of postings on digital camera electronic discussion boards within US and China based websites. Methodology – Data was collected from the “Photography” discussion boards on eBay and EachNet (a China based website). A total of 552 discussion postings from 257 participants over a three month period were analyzed and coded. Findings – The analysis showed quantitative and qualitative differences in the content across the two sites. There were differences in the pattern of brand mentions across the two websites, and requests for information seeking behaviour also varied across the two sites; users of EachNet were more likely to request information, thus possibly increasing the likelihood of, and influence of, OWOM on this website. There were also significant differences in content, with higher country of origin (CoO) effects on EachNet. CoO effects were largely strongly negative, in particular showing high levels of negative references to brands originating from Japan. Research limitations/implications – A limitation is the inability to ascertain the nationality of the participants on the discussion boards. Future research will also benefit from an extension of product categories. Originality/value – The study is the first to examine word-of-mouth (WOM) in online discussion boards and thus provides valuable insight for marketers into this growing source of WOM. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Cross-cultural studies; Electronic commerce; Group discussion",""

"Moderating effects of parent control on international joint ventures’ strategic objectives and performance","2007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954264247&doi=10.1108%2f13555850710772941&partnerID=40&md5=c03ea93524b29b6d1d1819e375e292ab","Purpose – The aim of this study is, first, to explore the moderating effects of parent control on the strategic objectives of foreign firms entering international joint ventures (IJVs) and, second, to assess performance in relation to these objectives. Design/methodology/approach – The study integrates three major theoretical streams in the IJV field to investigate the rationale for the formation of IJVs. The primary data collection method was a web-based survey. The ability to collect large amounts of data without interviewers, stationery or postage, makes the cost of doing web surveys very attractive. Sino-European manufacturing IJVs (in industries such as machinery, textiles, and electronics) were investigated. Findings – The strong empirical evidence in this study confirms the significant moderating effects of parent control on attainment of strategic objectives, suggesting that different strategic objectives of foreign partners have different performance outcomes based on the degree of control exercised by the partner and the focus on different IJV activities. The findings also indicate that market-developing and knowledge-acquiring objectives outperform efficiency-seeking objectives. Research limitations/implications – The purpose of this study was to examine satisfaction with performance from the point of view of the foreign IJV partner. Hence, data were collected from foreign senior management who represent foreign partners. Second, the single IJV host country context (China) inevitably raises the question as to whether the findings from this study can be generalised to IJVs in other emerging markets. Third, the relatively small sample size (61 IJVs), although comparable with previous studies, limits the use of more powerful statistical tools. Practical implications – The findings of this study suggest that parent companies should formulate different control structures according to different strategic objectives. Second, and rather interestingly, different categories of objectives perform differently in joint ventures. It seems, for example, that, in joint ventures with Chinese partners, European multinational enterprises achieve better results in relation to market development and knowledge acquisition than when seeking organisational efficiency. Originality/value – Prior research has tended to examine the IJV phenomenon from a single theoretical perspective. This study attempts to integrate three major theoretical streams in the IJV field to investigate the rationale for the formation of IJVs. As such, it potentially offers more comprehensive explanatory power. A further innovation is related to the use of a web-based survey rather than the traditional mail survey. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Joint ventures; Knowledge management; Parent companies; Performance management",""

Using means-end chain theory as a basis for the theoretical framework, the paper proposes and tests a conceptual model of the relationships among the constructs of personal values, benefits, attributes, and re-patronage intention. Hypotheses are proposed, and these are then tested using structural equation modelling on data from 279 experienced online customers in South Korea. A personal value of “social affiliation” acts as an enduring belief in motivating a customer to seek hedonic and utilitarian benefits, whereas a personal value of “self actualization” produces motivation to seek only utilitarian benefits. The seeking of hedonic and utilitarian benefits leads customers to evaluate certain attributes of online stores — such as visual design, product assortment, information quality, and after-sales service. The attributes of online stores have a positive effect on re-patronage intention. Limitations include problems associated with convenience sampling (dominated by extrinsically oriented shoppers) and measurement errors (with respect to the construct of personal values). Future studies could examine a more diverse range of personal values and online shopping benefits and attributes. The present study is the first to investigate personal values as enduring and underlying sources of motivation with respect to online shopping. The paper presents an original conceptual model of personal values, shopping benefits, shopping attributes, and re-patronage intention. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Internet shopping; Motivation (psychology); South Korea; Store ambience",""
"Mediated effects of export promotion programs on firm export performance","2006","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650034614&doi=10.1108%2f13555850610658255&partnerID=40&md5=a07ffa8ae45d4bea8d2ec4a66da95567","Purpose – The impact of export promotion programs (EPPs) on firm export performance (FEP) has received little attention in the export literature. This paper attempts to investigate the direct and indirect impact of EPPs on FEP in a comprehensive model. The indirect effects of EPPs on FEP have been conceptualized through a set of firm- and management-related antecedents for empirical testing. Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were collected through mail survey from a sample of 203 exporting firms in three export-oriented industries in a developing country. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings – Results suggest that in addition to its direct impact on the FEP, the usage of EPPs has direct impact on firm's export knowledge, and managers’ perception that in turn influence commitment to export, export strategy and FEP. Research limitations/implications – Findings provide empirical support to theorize indirect effect of the usage of EPPs on FEP. Findings also provide guidelines for managers how to benefit from EPPs to gain export knowledge toward increasing commitment for successful exporting. Policy makers can also benefit from the study finding in designing policy programs. Readers should use caution in generalizing the findings unless verified in other developed and developing country contexts. Originality value – The theoretical framework developed for the study is original and drawn on the extant literature. The empirical testing of the theoretical model in a developing country context is a significant contribution to fill the much needed gap in the literature toward generalizing similar findings. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Bangladesh; Developing countries; Exports",""

The paper elaborates two household panels, one national (Taylor Nelson Sofres Group) and the other regional (elaborated by us) which complements the information provided by the former. The results confirm the use of reference prices by consumers, highlighting the importance of the stimuli present at the point of sale for their formation. Likewise, the paper observes the interrelation of strategic decisions, emphasising the collateral effects derived from them. The paper cautions retailers that immediate discounts as a promotional strategy may be successful, but this does not apply to all product categories. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising; Consumer behaviour; Discounts; Elasticity; Prices",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered via a self-administered mail survey of Australian exporters. The sample consisted of 133 Australian firms coming from a wide cross-section of industries. Findings – The findings indicate that, when the internet was used to achieve a competitive advantage for the firm and reduce the costs associated in doing international business, these uses of the internet were significant in discriminating between high and low export marketing performance. Furthermore, the international experience of the export venture's management was a significant factor in discriminating between high and low export marketing performance. Research limitations/implications – From a methodological perspective, a potential concern may be that the measures are all self-reported. Consequently, the relationships tested may be susceptible to the influence of common method variance. Evidence has been provided that, when the internet is used for cost reduction purposes and as a competitive weapon, this will have a positive impact on export marketing performance.

The study also seeks to address views across Australian creatives and their clients. Design/methodology/approach – The design combined preliminary qualitative work using depth interviews with a subsequent questionnaire-based survey of the various stakeholder groups. Opinions of Australian creatives are compared, using the same survey instrument, with those of a sample of Australian advertiser clients. The views of the various national groups of creatives are then compared using the same instrument. Findings – The results indicated that a group of factors encourage creatives, and to an extent their clients, to have high expectations of the achievement of optimal creative work. There was more agreement among the creatives across the three countries than agreement between the Australian advertisers and any of the groups of creatives. There were also differences evident between the views of Malaysian creatives, on the one hand, and their Australian and New Zealand counterparts, on the other. A finding that Malaysian creatives were in slightly more agreement with the Australian advertisers than were Australian and New Zealand creatives was unanticipated. Research limitations/implications – Identified limitations include failure to collect data from advertiser stakeholders (clients) in the non-Australian countries. This meant that direct comparisons of client-agency beliefs could not be made within these countries. The challenge now is to explore the reasons why the differences and similarities found exist. Practical implications – Changes to practice to be made as a result of this research relate to management of the structured transfer of information between agency and client stakeholders, and management of authority issues in this relationship, particularly across cultures.

Design/methodology/approach – Information was gathered through the use of semi-structured interviews conducted with 44 individuals who were drawn from four observer-identified types of “expert” informant who were taken to generally represent key groups of stakeholders in the conduct, evaluation and dissemination of qualitative management research. Interview data from these individuals were analysed though an iterative process using the NVivo software package to inductively generate definitional categories and explore aspects of their interrelationships. Findings – From data analysis it was apparent that there are eight different, but often interrelated, ways in which interviewees define qualitative management research. The philosophical dimensions of each of these variable definitions are outlined and their relationships to the methodological literature are explored. The variety identified amongst informants, indicates how there is a potential dissensus possible regarding what qualitative management research might entail, as well as regarding its provenance and its academic status. This dissensus potentially can create problems with regard to its evaluation. Originality/value – So whist there is little evidence to suggest any systematic relationship between the variable institutional backgrounds of informants and how they variably define and perceive qualitative management research, philosophical influences upon this contested terrain are explored and the implications of the identified dissensus for how qualitative management research is perceived and evaluated is discussed. The implications of this evidently contested terrain are discussed with particular reference to the future constitution of qualitative management research and its evaluation. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Epistemology; Management research; Qualitative methods; Qualitative research",""

The other is to empirically test the hypothesized relationship between cause's attributes and purchase intention in such environment. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops a measure for exploring the cause's attributes influencing consumer's purchasing intention. Two groups of valid samples, respectively, with 178 and 376 respondents are collected through questionnaire survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are employed to extract and test the key influential attributes on the basis of data of two samples respectively, and structural equation model is used to define the structure of influencing attributes and to measure the degree of impact for each attribute on the consumer's purchasing intention. Findings – The results show that the degree of cause's participation for consumer, fit between the brand and the cause, cause importance, congruence between the firm's product and the cause, cause proximity play an important role in consumers’ attitudes toward the product and firm and their intentions to purchase the advertised product and participate in the CRM campaign, which suggests an opportunity for nonprofits to compete for these vital resources by nurturing and leveraging the antecedent factors and an opportunity for firms to select a cause partner. Research limitations/implications – The sample is a convenience sample that is the main limitations of this research. The EFA and CFA is difficult to generalize to a larger audience, and there was a lack of experimental control for the questionnaire investigation, so the quality of questionnaire can not be ensured. Practical implications – This research should help firms determine the best partners for strategic social alliances, and provide an advice on how to make them maximum participation, also should help current and potential consumers ascribe personality traits to nonprofit organizations and differentiate between nonprofits on the basis of the cause's attributes. At the same time, this paper provides several interesting areas for future research that will further aid marketing managers to develop a more effective CRM campaign to fit with goals of corporate, which adds some valuable insights or new ideas to develop essential theory. Originality/value – This paper offers interesting insight into the development of CRM campaigns, and explores the five variables: the degree of cause's participation for consumer; fit between the brand and the cause; cause importance; congruence between the firm's product and the cause; cause proximity also should influence consumer's purchasing attitude, intention and decision behavior in the Chinese context. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Buying behavior; Cause marketing; China; Consumer behavior",""

These findings derive from a content analysis of articles based on mixed methods research and from interviews with mixed methods researchers. Second, the paper examines the paradox that qualitative research is often viewed as generating interesting findings but that qualitative researchers frequently feel that they experience difficulty in placing qualitative articles in mainstream journals. Findings – The findings from the mixed methods study demonstrate that mixed methods research is often rationalized in a different way from how it is actually employed. Research limitations/implications – The second part of the paper should be extended so that a more comprehensive analysis of publication patterns can be carried out. Originality/value – There are relatively few examinations of what we mean by “methodology.” The paper tries to move these considerations forward by arguing that methodology is about the examination of “methodic practice.” © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Qualitative research; Research methods",""

Data were collected from Japanese department store buyers and specialty store buyers. A total of 141 cases were analyzed using the EQS structural equation modeling software. Results show that the traditional model had a higher explanatory power than the performance model, which indicates the strong influence of culture on Japanese channel relationships.

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 33 virtual community sites from both countries were randomly selected and evaluated based on eight criteria relating to technical, marketing, and cross-cultural aspects. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance and χ2-square statistics to identify the similarities and differences between the two countries’ virtual community sites. Findings – The study found significant differences between the countries in the use of graphics and images, the amount of advertisement and promotional messages, the choices of language, the inclusion of religious content, the frequency of message concerning group welfare, equality and loyalty, and the number of structured messages. The study also found some similarities in navigational efficiency and online product information. In conclusion, the research found gaps in the technical, marketing, and cultural aspects between virtual communities in the industrially developing and developed countries.

Design/methodology/approach – Hofstede's multidimensional framework serves as the conceptual basis for the study. Hierarchical multivariate regressions are conducted to test the hypothesized effects using a large-scale secondary dataset representing socio-economic structure and the penetration of the internet for 58 countries. Findings – The results provide supporting empirical evidence linking nearly all of Hofstede's cultural dimensions to nations’ internet penetration either as main effects or as interactions with countries’ educational levels. Research limitations/implications – Limitations include the use of secondary data for a limited number of countries. Only the adoption and usage of one technological innovation – the internet – was investigated and only one social-economic variable was examined for its moderating effect on the relationship between culture and internet access and usage. Future research will benefit from examining other potential factors such as a nation's demographic composition and their roles in adoption and diffusion of the Internet. In addition, Hofstede's framework is based on work related values of one business setting, which may not be representative of the entire national population, and may not overlap to other applications such as consumer behavior. Nonetheless, the framework has been tested with success in consumer research. Additional research on new technology adoption and diffusion could be conducted using other typologies of national cultural dimensions, such as the one developed by Schwartz. Managerial implications are discussed with respect to formulating effective marketing strategies for market entry, message design and promotional media choice. Originality/value – The present study contributes to the literature on cross-national internet use and access by incorporating the full range of Hofstede's cultural dimensions, along with a socio-economic variable, a nation's educational level, as a moderating factor. The dependent variable, use and access of the internet, is measured using three different metrics, namely, internet usage, narrowband penetration and broadband penetration. In doing so, this study differs from and extends previous cross-national research on internet adoption and diffusion. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Culture; Education; Globalization; Internet",""
"A model for customer-focused objective-based performance evaluation of logistics service providers","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70449534408&doi=10.1108%2f13555850810890075&partnerID=40&md5=3b9722da6901621bfdb29203f386a48b","This paper aims to propose a customer-oriented, objective-based model for evaluating the performance of logistics service providers (LSPs). The study develops an appropriate customer-oriented, objective-based measurement model for LSPs on conceptual grounds. The paper illustrates the application in the form of a case study of a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer. Satisfactory results are obtained in demonstrating the application of the model. Compared with the previous model used by the case company, the new model produced sensitive, accurate, and effective manufacturing performance rating results for different achievement levels. The proposed LSP performance-rating model can be applied by a variety of manufacturers to assess all kinds of LSPs in various industries. The proposed model can assist manufacturers in selecting the best LSP and integrating LSP capabilities to develop an appropriate quality-and-profit improvement program using customer-specific requirements. This paper proposes an original model to solve the problem of multiple measurements in assessing an LSP, taking into account the total cost of logistics (including net price, delivery, quality, service, and so on). © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cost effectiveness; Customer satisfaction; Distribution management; Performance measurement (quality)",""

Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 75 business managers from various industries in India was surveyed, and analysis was done using moderated multiple regression analysis. Findings – The key finding of the study is that among the five different types of connection that a firm has (with competitors (C), value chain partners (V), internal (I), external (E) entities and auxiliary (A) connections), the A-connections like those with banks, MR agencies, advertising agencies and other service providers, have the most favorable impact on relationship quality with firms’ customers, when its boundary personnel exhibit high TIO (bonding) towards their customer. However, the direct impact of A-connection on RQ is negative, possibly due to the negative externalities such as sharing limited common resources. Other four connections were found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications – A major limitation of this study is sample size (75). Hence, the findings of this study may not be generalisable. Practical implications – The findings of this study suggest that higher ability to bond disparate actors in network of business firm (TIO) have a strong and favorable impact on improving the RQ with its customers in embedded relationships. Originality/value – The major contribution of the study is to explain the moderating role of TIO in the network embedded dyadic business relationships. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Channel relations; Emerging markets; India; Networking; Strategic business units",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data on channel structure were collected on national, regional and municipal levels. The hypotheses in this study were tested by using time series and cross-sectional data. The ordinary least squares method was used for multiple regression and correlation analyses. Findings – The most significant findings from the above research are that channel structure is determined by economic development and, to some extent, by government policy. Both of these factors work hand-in-hand to affect distribution reform. First, economic development provides the need for more efficient channels, first as more privately-owned intermediaries enter the distribution system, and later as the number of channel intermediaries contracts, partly stemming from vertical integration and from a shakeout of less efficient enterprises. Second, government policy can be formulated to encourage these developments. In order to promote distribution reform, the government's “open policy”, which allows for market access by foreign firms as well as local ones, should be continued. Research limitations/implications – More cross-sectional data for China are needed in order to better analyze the impact of different economic sectors (at different levels of development) on channel evolution. As more data become available, these analyses will be possible. Originality/value – Very little is known about the factors that shape a nation's channel system. Improvements in distribution systems are crucial to upgrading marketing systems in developing countries. Understanding how improvements in distribution systems contribute to economic development can aid decision makers in developing countries to improve resource allocation. This study has contributed to the theory of channel evolution in developing countries. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Channel flow; China; Economic development; Government policy; Marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper combines qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The qualitative study involved 23 minicases with Swiss manufacturing companies which operate a service organization in Western Europe and China. The results of the minicases were validated externally by using factor and discriminant analysis. Findings – The results suggest that the service orientation of corporate culture, human resource management and the entire organization is significantly lower in Chinese service organizations than in their Western European counterparts, leading to significantly lower financial service-related performance outcomes. Research limitations/implications – For service management theorists, the findings suggest that increasing financial service-related performance outcomes in China is affected to a high degree by Chinese cultural characteristics. Practical implications – For managers, the findings suggest that implicit logic for increasing financial service-related performance outcomes starts with overcoming typical and, in some respects, limiting cultural characteristics. Originality/value – Unfortunately, the existing literature provides surprisingly little in the way of suggestions as to the actual differences between Western European and Chinese service organizations. This research closes this gap by validating factors that differentiate Western European from Chinese service organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Customer orientation; Manufacturing industries; Performance levels; Service industries; Switzerland",""

Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study were collected by mailing a questionnaire to 283 advertising agencies executives who were selected from the All-Asia Ad Agency Guide. A total of 1,086 questionnaires were sent out and 163 were returned for a response rate of 15 per cent. Factor analysis was first used to identify various success factors, and ANOVA was used to compare the means of each factor related to the degree of success of the campaign. Correlation analysis was then used to examine the relationship between successful brand advertising campaign and various success factors. Findings – The results of the ANOVA indicate that there are significant relationships between some items in each factor and the degree of success of an advertising campaign. Correlation analysis further reveals that message/creativity, media selection, market research, market share, and product uniqueness are significantly related to the success of brand advertising in China. No significant relationship is found between brand success and competition or agency/client relationship. Research limitations/implications – The respondents may have been biased about the extent to which their advertising campaigns are successful or how creative an advertisement should be. Their perceptions of successful or creative advertising could be very different, especially in relation to those questions that asked respondents to critique their own work. All of these affect the rigor of the study. Another limitation of the study is the low response rate. If the sample size had been large enough, comparisons could have been made concerning the correlates of successful brand advertising across different regions in China. Originality/value – In addition to providing researchers with further understanding of brand advertising in China, this study provides some insights about the ways in which multinational advertising managers contribute to successful brand advertising. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising; Brand image; China; Marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach– Framed by translation discourse and a view of the social world as a sociology of associations, participation in organisations is conceptualised as a network building practice. Actor-network theory (ANT) is used as an analytical method to describe the character of everyday constructions of participation practice related to changes in curriculum and its delivery in an Australian independent school. Findings– It was found that participation was performed as an uncertain practice. People in relation with technology and other material entities, co-constructed and re-constructed multiple participation practices. Practical implications– For researchers, an ANT account of constructing participation practices provides an additional analytical tool for investigating participation in terms of relationality. The idea of constructing participation as networked practice provides practitioners with a reflective tool for detecting and enabling multiple (and sometimes inconsistent) participation practices. Originality/value– Compared to participation research approaches that predetermine and predict variables of relevance, this paper is concerned with the everyday management of participation as an uncertain sociomaterial practice. In pursuing a critical line of inquiry, managerialist informed notions of planning, organising and coordinating are not debunked form relevance. Rather, it is proposed that translation and managerial discourses are co-implicated in complex investigations of participation practice. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Design/methodology/approach — Survey method for data collection was used. Data were collected from a sample of 1,207 retail customers in India's unorganized retail sector across five product categories in Varanasi, India. Findings — Results showed that six of the independent variables considered, namely, shopping attitude of respondent, store loyalty (SL), perceived store prices, store distance, shopping frequency, and brand loyalty (in order of importance of impact) significantly influenced consumers' attitude towards retail store in out-of-stock. Research limitations/implications — Data were collected only for five product categories and for unorganized retail setting because of which results and findings are not generalizeable to beyond these boundaries. Practical implications — Implications of this for retailers and future research are discussed. Originality/value — Since attitudes towards retail outlets are very important in determining future SL and subsequent profitability, understanding of consumer store attitudes in negative events like stockout is importantly for retailers.

Yet, what really is the extent of the changes/paradigms adopted by firms in India? What changes have the forces of challenges brought in, in the marketing management of Indian firms? The purpose of the present study is to find answers to these questions. Design/methodology/approach – Expert opinion method has been adopted, wherein CEOs/Heads of marketing department have been personally interviewed. Findings – Content analysis of the responses gathered shows that, Indian firms are now coming forward to accepting professional management. Conflict paradigm, where primary emphasis is on competition has been greatly acknowledged. Social constructionism, with its strong emphasis on consumers’ view, is also reflected in the responses. From being inward-looking, the respondent firms are becoming outward-looking due to the pressures of the market. It is “quality” which is the paradigm that has gained a new momentum, in the form of customer-specific quality to gain market, quality to withstand competition and quality pressure from world market. Research limitations/implications – Coverage of many more industrial cities like Mumbai and Delhi has not been included due to insufficient response to the mailed questionnaires. Hence the study has been to the extent of personal interviews in selective cities. Originality/value – For academicians and marketing professionals, the study provides a practical insight into the changes in business practices among Indian firms.

"Malaysian grocery shoppers’ behavioural response to stock-outs","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650506188&doi=10.1108%2f13555850810909722&partnerID=40&md5=e0bfd0687033fdacc2d6d940e4f811d6","Purpose – A better understanding of the response of shoppers in developing countries to inevitable product stock-outs would help logisticians to put structures in place to reduce the disruption. The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in orientations that characterize shoppers’ responses to stock-outs in retailing environments by comparing an emerging economy, Malaysia, with a developed economy, Australia. Design/methodology/approach – Randomly selected adult grocery shoppers across Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were surveyed to examine shoppers’ behavioural response to a most recent stock-out of their preferred dairy item. This study followed the methodology and reporting framework adopted in an Australian study. Findings – When responding to stock-outs of their preferred grocery items, shopping lists serve as instruments that give archetypical Malaysian shoppers, unlike their Australian counterparts, a framework to adjust their budgets and seek alternatives within the store itself rather than venture to another store. Most Malaysian shoppers’ reactions to an out-of-stock situation, just as their Australian counterparts, appear to be underpinned by their household size. If their preferred item is not available, the frugal and observant among Malaysian shoppers, however, are not inclined as much as their Australian counterparts, to buy more of their alternative choice, even if these substitute items are discounted. Research limitations/implications – Insight into Malaysian shoppers’ behavioural response to inadequate shelf life of perishable products, considering that they might feel impelled to act as per their shopping lists, would give members of the supply chain confidence to adopt inventory management policies that make a judicious balance between avoiding stock-outs and ensuring stock availability with acceptable shelf life. Practical implications – Malaysian frugal and observant shoppers when responding to stock-outs of their preferred items might allow the opportunity to let a bargain pass on alternative brands or variants, because these shoppers, guided by their shopping lists, are possibly hamstrung, by budgetary constraints in not being able to make heavier purchase outlays and by likely storage constraints in their living accommodation. Retailers in Malaysia have a greater challenge than Australian retailers to dispose of stocks of grocery products that are fast approaching their expiry dates through discounting, because Malaysian shoppers may resist buying more than their immediate need. Originality/value – Malaysian shoppers, inclined to carry memory scripts to assist them in their shopping efforts, are conditioned to stay within their planned budgets and when confronted with a stock-out of their preferred item, are likely to resist buying anymore than what they had planned to buy. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Consumer behaviour; Malaysia; Stock control",""

This study also shows that more extensive use of ES improves new product (NP) performance, and that perception of higher technology turbulence increases usage of ES. Design/methodology/approach – Data from a survey of 124 Thai SMEs through statistical package for the social sciences software shows that more extensive acquisition of ES information does improve NP performance. Findings – Managers who perceive more technological turbulence do use ES more extensively. The technology strategy of the company does not have much impact on the use of ES. The results indicate that even SMEs can benefit from ES, a practice more commonly carried out by larger companies. Some SMEs seem to recognize that more turbulent environments require more extensive scanning. Research limitations/implications – These results may not hold exactly this way in other industries where technology plays a much greater role. Also, the impact of technology strategy on ES usage would be much more apparent in more technology intensive industries. It is clear that industry context variables should be included in future research to more fully understand the role of ES and NPD outcomes, as well as the factors that encourage companies to use ES more extensively. In addition, the ES impact on NPD outcomes should be examined in conjunction with some of the other determinants of quality NPD process. Originality/value – The major contributions of the study consist of how comprehensive use of ES makes a significant contribution to NP performance, the findings on the impact of technology strategy, technology turbulence upon ES and the impact of ES upon NPD. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Food industry; Product development; Technology led strategy; Thailand",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper traces the methodological development of grounded theory with particular emphasis on the variations, contradictions and modifications to the methodology both between and within the Glaserian and Straussian Schools. Totally 32 empirical grounded theory studies published in the management literature since 2002 are analysed in order to gauge the impact of these variations on the manner in which researchers have employed the grounded theory methodology. Findings – It is argued that grounded theory in management research is in danger of losing its integrity. The methodology has become so pliant that management researchers appear to have accepted it as a situation of “anything goes” “Grounded theory” is now loosely used as a generic term to refer to any qualitative approach in which an inductive analysis is grounded in data.

Design/methodology/approach – Two studies were conducted with undergraduates of a top Asian university with sample sizes of 221 and 253 using experimental setups. Findings – It was found that subjects tend to base their evaluations more on later information than earlier information regardless of involvement level. This recency effect was consistently found across the product categories of tourist destination and restaurant in both studies. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation is that the manipulation of involvement level might not have been strong enough. Despite obtaining differences between high and low involvement levels in the pretest for both products, the difference was found again in only the restaurant category in the manipulation check of both studies. Future research can increase the gap between high and low involvement levels using non-laboratory settings to ensure effective involvement level manipulation. Practical implications – Findings of this paper can help companies to position messages in their favour when both positive and negative information needs to be presented.

Through an analytical review, research hypotheses were built. An empirical investigation was carried out among Japanese consumers. Two brands of electronics with different levels of reputation were investigated. Results showed that COO had an effect on brand perception. This effect differs across brands and across countries of production. Brand-origin appears to be of significant impact on consumer perception. Brand images are found to be multidimensional. Their structures differ across brands and across COO. COO has multiple effects on brand image perception. Brand image is multidimensional. This research dealt with one type of product among culturally similar respondents which may limit the finding. Marketing actions should be customized across brands with different levels of reputation. Brand image should be assessed as a multidimensional concept incorporating multiple facets. Consumers are influenced by the brand-origin. Marketers should be aware of this association.

Design/methodology/approach – Guided by recent advance in social identity theory and social motivation theory, a dynamic iterative model of brand origin recognition is proposed. Six hypotheses were tested using a sample of 145 consumers from west of India. Using paired t-test, average consumer preference of brand origin was analysed for different product categories. A factor analysis with varimax rotation for determining band images was also carried out. Findings – The results demonstrated that most consumers can recognise the brand origin correctly but the power of recognition decreases when the brand has a long history of “localization”. Distinguished trajectories of consumer perceptions of foreign brands and domestics brands were projected, and this allowed one to extend existing country of origin (CO) research to brand of origin research. Practical implications – The results implied that brand origin is a useful concept for companies engaging in an emerging market such as India. But the changing nature of the concept requires careful steering and nurturing if companies want to attach a positive value to its brand via brand origin association. Originality/value – Research into CO effect has been extensive.

"A less-developed country perspective of consumer ethnocentrism and “country of origin” effects: Indonesian evidence","2006","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986180707&doi=10.1108%2f13555850610658246&partnerID=40&md5=c455ea489e52a077080ca862cec273f9","Purpose – This paper seeks to examine the concept of “consumer ethnocentrism” (CE) and its impact on product evaluation and preferences among Indonesian consumers. Design/methodology/approach – The survey involved interviewing a representative sample of Indonesian consumers who had previously purchased the products in question, namely colour television and who had travelled by international airlines. A total of 547 usable questionnaires were completed in face-to-face interviews in Indonesia. Conjoint analysis was employed to study the relative importance and part-worth estimates of country-of-origin (COO) effects across high and low CE groups. Findings – Results of a sample survey of Indonesian consumers are discussed. They show, firstly, that the overall level of CE of Indonesian consumers, compared with published results for a range of countries, is notably high. Secondly, results of conjoint analysis showing the relationship between CE and consumer evaluations of “COO”, product quality perceptions, and purchase intentions, for both tangible goods and intangible services, are discussed. Research limitations/implications – The actual sample was heavily biased to upper socio-economic groups because of its focus on international airlines as one of the subject products. This will inevitably distort the average Consumer ethnocentric tendency scale score, but was felt to be unavoidable. Originality/value – In the past, research on country-of-origin effects has been carried out mostly in more developed countries considering products made in less developed countries (LDC's). In the present research, attention has been given to understand the effects of consumer CE on perceptions of product quality, price, perceived value, and product choice from the point of view of consumers from LDC's. In addition, the study of COO effects in relation to intangible services is noteworthy. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumers; Country of origin; Ethnocentrism; Indonesia; Statistical analysis",""

This study was designed to explore for the possible differences and similarities in spousal influences in different cultural environments by comparing Singaporean family purchase decision-making process to that of US families. Design/methodology/approach – Quota sampling was adopted to generate primary data for the examination of Singaporean spousal influence in family purchase decision-making; data previously reported on US spousal families was used to compare with the primary data collected in Singapore. Findings – Differences in marital values between Singaporean husbands and wives were found to be associated with differences in perceived patterns of influence throughout the family decision-making process. The findings indicate that family purchase decision-making is a culture-specific phenomenon. The study found that the level of egalitarianism, which usually indicates a more syncratic or cooperative family purchase decision-making, was associated positively with higher levels of education and income. Research limitations/implications – This study revealed a positive relationship between joint decisions and the level of egalitarianism, however, such evidence is still limited. To depend the understanding of spousal influences in family purchase decision-making in different cultural environments, future research may need to go beyond demographics to include more cognitive, psychological as well as social environmental factors, such as the involvement level, the time a spouse spent alone for shopping, the love, affection, trust and confidence a spouse would have for or earned from another spouse, the importance a spouse would attach to his or her marriage and family, etc. Originality/value – The paper offers insight into family purchase decision-making within Easlern countries. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural studies; Family; Singapore; Spouses",""

Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon interviews with key actors in the firms under study to explore their experiences with consumers and other constituents in determining how competitive advantage is constructed in this environment. These data are complemented data with interviews with governmental representatives and material from secondary sources. Findings – The results reveal efforts of firms to construct and increase organizational legitimacy through the prominence of discourses of professionalism based on artistry and medicine/public health. These bases of competitive differentiation are not the clear result of exogenous pressure, rather they arise through the active efforts of the firm to construct value guidelines for consumers and other constituents. Practical implications – Strategic management in small firms is a complex and dynamic process that does not necessarily mirror that of large organizations. Constructing competitive advantage is an interacting process between key actors of small firms and various constituents. Originality/value – The paper extends the application of institutional theory in strategic management by illuminating the active role that firms play in creating industry norms, especially in industries where norms are not well established or no longer entrenched. Moreover, exploring an alternative site of study offers a means through which to see well-studied issues in new ways. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Canada; Competitive advantage; Management strategy; Organizational theory; Small enterprises",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study used a sample of 197 shipping companies, port operators and freight forwarders/logistics service providers, employing the triangulation of both mail survey and in-depth interview techniques. A total of 120 usable questionnaires were returned and 25 interviews conducted. Data were analysed using the SPSS 13.0 software and thematic analysis technique. Findings – It was found that service quality in maritime transport is a six-dimensional construct consisting of resources, outcomes, process, management, image, and social responsibility (ROPMIS), with each dimension measured by a number of explaining factors making up a total of 24 factors. Findings also revealed that factors involving the outcomes and process of service provision, as well as the management factors, which all focus on satisfying the customers, received high ranking. They also emphasised process and management-related factors which involve the centre of all quality systems: the human element. Research limitations/implications – As this is the first stage of a more comprehensive study, the model was tested only with service providers, and this is the major limitation. Future research direction is desired, e.g. conducting the study using the same instruments on customers and compare the gaps with this research. Originality/value – The major contribution of this study is to fully operationalise service quality as a six-dimensional construct in the context of maritime transport, and findings on the ranking of dimensions/factors involved in the model. Although this is the first model of service quality in maritime transport with specific quality factors, its generic dimensions could be generalised to other service sectors as well. The research also has great managerial implications as managers across maritime transport companies can use the tool to develop questionnaire for customer satisfaction survey, thus facilitating a universal benchmarking approach across the industry. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer services quality; Freight forwarding; Quality management; SERVQUAL; Vietnam",""

Design/methodology/approach – This study has used the experiences of a group of exporting firms to achieve its research objectives. It has employed both main effect and interaction methods to assess its research framework. Findings – The outcomes of this study reveal that, in addition to the main effect outcomes, some significant variations exist. Some of these variations are consistent with the main effects, while others are not. On some occasions a factor is not identified as a main effect factor, and yet it has a significant impact in a certain situation (e.g. infrastructure*IDs). The interaction outcomes are more significant in terms of the price, promotion and performance components. The interaction outcomes show that firms might be able to use a number of alternatives to achieve their performance goals when operating in a foreign host market, even in the absence of a main effect. These alternatives have not been outlined in the existing literature. Research limitations/implications – The results point out that researchers may need to be cautious about generalising their findings without conducting a thorough statistical examination on the sub-group variations within a study.

Design/methodology/approach – A framework based on accepted definition of marketing strategy was developed which could notionally evaluate the appropriateness of marketing strategies and its impact on the market position of the firms. The framework was tested on a set of small scale bakery firms operating in the city of Kolkata. The marketing mix of the firms was studied through case study method. A customer survey was conducted to measure the firms’ market offerings with respect to their target segment. For this, data were collected from 546 consumers and analyzed using multivariate techniques. Findings – It was observed that the firms, which could align their market offerings with respect to the target segment, achieved higher performance. Research limitations/implications – The framework used was easy and simple to comprehend. The only two input components required were the marketing mix elements and a corresponding survey to understand customer perceptions. The interpretation of appropriateness, which is reactive in nature, is important, particularly for small firms where marketing is mostly informal, unplanned, relies on intuition and differs from that of large companies. The marketing mix elements were composed through qualitative observations and interviews only. Further research may be undertaken to refine the same in future.

Design/methodology/approach – The study used interviews from a convenience sample of 445 visitors to a motor vehicle show over a three-day period using a choice-based conjoint analysis study design. Findings – The NFC scale used in this study focused on abstract thinking. Results showed that consumers' responses to components from different countries changed their overall purchase intentions, and nationalism appeared to play a strong role in consumer attitudes to components. Consumers exhibiting high levels of NFC were more engaged in more complex assessment of the country of origin (COO) cue in their product evaluation than those who have less NFC. Practical implications – Manufacturers sourcing components from low labour cost countries need to be cautious. Even trusted brands may be sullied by components sourced from countries with negative stereotypes.

"Evaluating petroleum supply chain performance: Application of analytical hierarchy process to balanced scorecard","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955674302&doi=10.1108%2f13555850810890093&partnerID=40&md5=37ee8e890c3cac2c405937f6da4576e5","Performance evaluation in supply chain management (SCM) is not a straightforward task. This becomes even more complicated while evaluating a process industry supply chain because of its inherently different characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a method to evaluate the performance of one such process supply chain, namely the petroleum industry supply chain. The paper uses a combination of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and balanced scorecard (BSC) for evaluating performance of the petroleum supply chain. The choice of factors determining supply chain performance under the four perspectives of BSC has been validated using opinion from subject matter experts (SMEs). In order to determine relative importance of criteria opinion of SMEs has been collected in the form of pairwise comparisons. Using these comparisons, the AHP technique has been applied to determine the relative weights of various perspectives as well as the factors under each perspective. The importance of four perspectives with respect to petroleum supply chain performance in descending order of importance comes out as: customer, financial, internal business process, innovation and learning. Within these perspectives, the following factors seem to be most important respectively: purity of product, market share, steady supply of raw material and use of information technology. Most research work has focused on discrete part manufacturing supply chains. Process industry supply chains deserve a different treatment due to their inherently different characteristics. The methodology suggested in this paper tries to include these characteristics and can help in comparing performance of supply chains of different petroleum companies. The value of this paper lies in the unique approach towards determining the performance of process industry supply chains. By using BSC, non-financial factors have also been taken into account. Opinion of SMEs has been quantified using the AHP technique thus converting qualitative data to quantitative data. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Analytical hierarchy process; Balanced scorecard; Performance measurement (quality); Petroleum; Supply chain management",""

Design/methodology/approach – The study is an exploratory one, conducted in a sample of 63 Indian organisations manufacturing general-purpose machinery. Data pertaining to a total of 191 product lines in four phases of the PLC (42 in introduction, 59 in growth, 53 in maturity and 37 in decline phase) were collected using a specially developed questionnaire. Findings – The results of the descriptive analysis revealed that the marketing programme variables emphasised in different PLC were different. In the Introduction phase decisions about product attributes, physical performance of the product, direct mail advertising, quality improvements and differentiation by design were emphasized. In Growth phase: feature additions, improvements in product styling, quality and service and market segmentation. In maturity and decline phases re-tailoring products, sales force efforts were some of the marketing variables emphasised. The results support the views in literature about MP being different in different phases of the PLC. Based on a discriminant analysis, marketing variables that discriminate the different phases of the PLC were also obtained. Research limitations/implications – The study is done in the machine-building industry in one country (India) – this limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications – The results can be useful to marketing managers to anticipate the type of strategic MP in future and this in turn can help in planning activities of other management functions like manufacturing and R&D.

Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on two surveys conducted in China and Tianjin, respectively, under the support from government authorities. Comparative analyses were conducted to ascertain the differences between logistics firms in China and developed countries, as well as regional differences within China. Findings – The results reveal that Chinese logistics providers depend heavily on transportation and warehousing businesses but lack value-added services and logistics information management. Rate setting ranks highly in provider priority while the importance of lead-time performance is largely ignored. Significant regional differences in logistics exist and there is a long way for Chinese logistics providers to go in achieving international service standards. Most local firms wish to establish strategic alliances to enhance competitiveness. Originality/value – This research enriches the literature by investigating the current status and future prospects of logistics service providers in a transitional economy. China being an emerging player in the world economy, an understanding and assessment of China's logistics service providers is appropriate and timely.

Conversatio is the novel hermeneutical method that is discussed in conjunction with liminal ethnography. Findings – Liminal ethnography as outlined in the paper emerged as an approach from preliminary contact with the organisational reality of the monastery as a type of total institution. Similarly, conversatio suggested itself as a method that maximises limited face to face contact with interlocutors whose access to the external world is restricted by a behavioural code enshrined in a Rule. Research limitations/implications – Paradoxically, the restrictions imposed on the researcher provided inspiration for the analytical approach proposed by the paper therefore initial limitations such as restricted access eventually spurred conceptual development.

This involves examining the nature and extent of the COO effect amongst urban Chinese consumers and the impact of COO on actual purchase behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire is used to collect COO information from a sample of 432 Shanghai consumers and a consumer panel is used to track the purchase behaviour of the same consumers over 6 months. Findings – First, Chinese consumers generally say they prefer to buy local Chinese grocery brands. Second, Chinese consumers believe it is important to buy local brands for a range of Chinese-style and Western-style product categories. Third, however, the stated preference for Chinese brands was generally not reflected in actual purchase behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The results support the growing view that Chinese consumers are not necessarily attracted to foreign brands. However, the disparity between stated preferences and behaviour suggests that there are other factors that may moderate the COO effect, such as imperfect knowledge of which brands are local or foreign. Practical implications – To capitalize on the stated preference for local brands, and to address consumers’ imperfect knowledge of which brands are local or foreign, managers may benefit by promoting the Chinese origin of their brands and by positioning their brands as being local. Originality/value – In contrast to the experimental designs used in previous studies, actual purchase data is measured here in a real-life setting.

The purpose of this paper is to identify some of the major issues related to such implementation and draw out practices from literature to serve as remedies for these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper starts by suggesting a broad framework for implementing supply chain management (SCM) in a firm. This consists of strategy formulation, identification of areas for improving material flow, identifying issues in these areas, and finally performance evaluation in order to determine how well the supply chain initiative has been implemented. Subsequently, the paper follows this framework step by step and in the process identifies the issues likely to arise in the process of SCM implementation. By reviewing current literature it suggests how these issues can be handled effectively. Findings – The major issues related to SCM implementation are in the areas of logistics, outsourcing/partnerships, and environment. Apart from these issues the prerequisite for implementation is formulation of strategy while the final step in the exercise is performance evaluation. These two activities need to be handled carefully also. Practical implications – The paper has important implications for the industry since it tries to bring out practices which would help in successful implementation of SCM in a firm. This is more so for the process industry which has lagged behind its counterparts in other industries with respect to implementation of SCM. Originality/value – The value of this paper which is based on extensive literature review lies in: suggesting a framework to implement SCM, identifying likely issues, and suggesting ways to handle them. The summary diagrams would definitely facilitate understanding. This can be of interest to SCM personnel in the industry.

Fuzzy set techniques are applied to assess the meaning of logistics performance within the decision process of freight operators. The fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process is applied to identify the relative significance among the attributes in the hierarchy framework levels. Consequently, the fuzzy-multi-criteria analysis is used to assess decision makers' perception of the logistics performance via proper assignment of numerical scores. The subjective judgments for hierarchical attributes are transformed into fuzzy degrees of score. Results show a summary of performance indices for different levels in the hierarchy framework. The results demonstrate that the lack of coordination among modes limit the attractiveness of intermodal system. In addition, the methodology is proposed to examine changing variables regarding modal shift and challenge the truck dominance in Thailand. The proposed framework is only a starting point for integrating the views of logistics operators in the analytical processes. This study did not include several external social costs such as accidents, congestion, and environmental costs. The methodology provides an approach lead to the index values for assessment and comparative analysis. The strengths and limitations of each alternative were benchmarked relative to a set of hierarchical attributes. Sensitivity analyses of significant variables are performed to examine the impact on changed costs and services levels. The model can entail use of corresponding parameters to improve a logistics system. The performance measurement is formulated from the modal choice perspective with a human decision problem. The use of logistics performance base indicators has been linked to the intermodal transport system.

Relevant hypotheses were constructed and a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in the travel industry. Factor analysis and regression analysis were used to test these hypotheses. The major benefits of Internet use were interactional and transactional benefits. The main barriers of the Internet use were organizational weaknesses, poor IT infrastructure, mistrust of the Internet system and legal issues. While the benefits positively contributed to the service and social bonds, the barriers negatively impacted the development of these bonds. The interactional benefits play a major role to increase switching costs. The customer relationships and switching costs concurrently enhanced the customer loyalty. Cross-sectional data were used to explore customer relationships while these bonds are basically a dynamic phenomenon that evolves over time.

It is argued that IJVs provide a platform for organisational learning, which facilitates organisational performance. Intuitively, IJVs that are learning oriented should have a positive impact upon organisational performance. However, it is unclear as to whether a firm in an IJV should focus more on being learning oriented, or market oriented. The paper aims to address this question. A survey of 168 senior managers involved in IJVs in Malaysia. Data were analysed using two-stage least squares estimators for latent variable models. Results suggest that for IJVs, a market orientation has a more positive impact on organisational performance than a learning orientation. The non-linear relationship between market orientation and performance suggest that larger gains in performance are achieved by firms who have low initial levels of market orientation. Thus, in the absence of one or the other, it is preferable for a firm in an IJV to have a strong market orientation. For managers of IJVs, the study would suggest that firms should concentrate on improving their organisations' overall level of market orientation if they are to improve the level of business performance.

Design/methodology/approach – The empirical data were generated from a video recorded and transcribed management meeting, and participant observation. The analysis of institutional discourses and practices builds upon the assumption that language and texts are the main tools for understanding actors’ social reality. The managers’ ways of sensemaking of institutional discourses and practices is captured through their use of tools like rhetorical strategies, frames, and categories in talk-in-interaction. Findings – The team managers’ ways of sensemaking through mobilizing rhetorical strategies, institutional categories, and how they recontextualise frames in negotiation of a disputed issue, adds new aspects to previous studies of the multi voiced complex integration processes in a cross-border acquisition. The significance of the results is the revealing of actors’ frequent use of rhetorical strategies, frames, and categories in sensemaking processes. The study calls for further research on structural features of institutional talk as related to the dynamics of talk-in-interaction. Originality/value – The findings and methods of analysis contribute to international business studies and to the empirical-based research on institutional interaction through text and talk. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acquisitions and mergers; Communication; Meetings; Rhetoric; Team management",""
"The “I”, the “me” and the “you know”: Identifying identities in organisations","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931067361&doi=10.1108%2f17465640810870382&partnerID=40&md5=2c349390734bb06b40602c3096bd1d7f","Purpose – “Identity” is of major interest in organisation studies, but as identity is concerned very much with subjectivity it is difficult to explore it empirically. The purpose of this paper is to offer a methodology for analysing interview transcripts designed to discover the ongoing processes of becoming of the self, or of identities, embedded in the data. This way of analysing qualitative data allows the development of theories of how others construct their identities through the swift-moving concatenation of selves appearing, disappearing and reappearing in the moment-to-moment construction of the self. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology involves analysis of personal pronouns and the gaps and interruptions in speech. Personal pronouns, it is shown, illustrate the appearance of different enactments of the self, each appearance/re-appearance signalled by pauses, gaps or other interruptions in the flow of speech. The method is based on the theories of Bollas, a psychoanalytical theorist, and Harre´, and Mu¨hlha¨usler and Harre´ who have explored how personal pronouns work. Findings – The paper demonstrates how subjects explore who they are as an “I” and a “me”, revealing the multiple selves that appear in any transcript, and thus processes of identity formation. Provision of a worked example of the model, of a manager discussing her work, demonstrates how analysis of personal pronouns illuminates aspects of subject formation whose exploration is difficult. Research limitations/implications – The methodology is recommended for others’ use and adaptation. It allows possibilities for expanding the types of research questions that may be posed, as it provides a method for data analysis, personal pronoun use, that attempts to work with the “other minds” problematic. In other words, it allows glimpses of how subjects see themselves. Originality/value – This paper is of use to qualitative researchers, and if its methodology is taken up can expand knowledge of the constructions of selves in the workplace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","English language; Individual perception; Individual psychology; Interviews; Qualitativemethods; Self actualization",""
"Managing spoiled identities: dirty workers’ struggles for a favourable sense of self","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80555141046&doi=10.1108%2f17465640810920278&partnerID=40&md5=e87964416222852c263bdec47c7f7649","Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to explore how a group of dirty workers, that is, exotic dancers employed in a gentlemen’s club, engage in identity construction amidst various macro, meso and micro considerations. Design/methodology/approach– This study adopts a social constructivist approach in exploring the stories of a group of 21 dancers employed at a chain of exotic dancing clubs in the UK, For Your Eyes Only. Findings– Identity construction is a complex process whereby dancers struggle to secure a positive sense of self among the various resources they encounter. The findings focus upon the processes of distancing through projecting disgust upon clients, other dancers and other clubs. Dancers do this to minimize the stigma associated with their own identities and position themselves in a more favourable light to others. In doing this, dancers construct a variety of identity roles for themselves and “others.” This process of distancing also results in the construction of a hierarchy of stigmatization whereby dancers categorize motivations for dancing, type of dancing and type of clubs to rationalize the work they perform and manage their spoiled identities. Practical implications– The stories of these dancers illustrate the messy nature of identity construction for dirty workers. In turn, it also illuminates how a better understanding of the complexity of identity construction for exotic dancers can offer insights transferable to other dirty work occupations and organizations in general. Originality/value– The paper provides an indepth look at an occupational site that is relatively unexplored in organization studies and thus makes a unique empirical contribution. It also offers a more comprehensive theoretical lens for understanding identity construction and dirty workers © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entertainment industry; Self esteem; United Kingdom; Work identity",""

Focus group research was conducted. In total 71 participants from Taiwan's electronics industry were allocated into eight different groups ranging from minimum eight to maximum ten participants in a group. Suggested critical success factors of re-innovation include time reduction in development process, cost reduction in product manufacture, products with high levels of customization, relative advantage, or added value, efficiently internal coordination and external cooperation, appropriate product introduction timing, and less aggressive competitors responses. A main limitation of this study is that the field data were all from Taiwanese-based companies in certain industries. Generalization could be increased by collecting data from other countries and industries. Firms using the approach of re-innovation should take into account various characteristics of different innovation types so as to adjust their approaches of new product development. The first contribution of this study is to provide information regarding the critical success factors of product re-innovation in Taiwan's electronics industry. Second, the knowledge of new product development can be added because of an increase in the understanding of re-innovation in the Asia-Pacific region which has received much less attention than North America and Europe by innovation researchers. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Critical success factors; Design and development; Electronics industry; Innovation; Taiwan",""

It includes an account of learning to read and recognise stories as a particular form of organizational narrative in the National Health Service (NHS). Design/methodology/approach – The study involved a retrospective search for stories contained within ethnographic data collected from a mental health organization. A small number of stories were analysed in an attempt to discover how stories were used in one particular organizational setting. Findings – The stories told by staff ranged from heroic action on behalf of a patient and in spite of the organization, to tragic stories of staff coming to harm. Stories told by patients concerned their experiences of meaningful relationships with the staff. Alongside this small collection of stories, two particular phenomena associated with storytelling are described; the first involves counter-stories, which involved either discrediting accounts of patient as storytellers or offered different stories to suggest competing interpretations. The second involved collapsed story forms exchanged between staff as a means of convergent sense-making. Originality/value – The paper works with stories as a particular narrative form in one particular mental health setting. These stories have the potential to draw attention to aspects of organisational life such as fears about harming patients or coming to harm and possibilities for relationships between patients and staff.

Design/methodology/approach – The aim was achieved through an empirical study involving a survey. Of 700 questionnaires sent out, 128 were returned. The dataset from the sample underwent series of statistical analyses, i.e. reliability test, factor analyses (exploratory and confirmatory) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings – Factor analyses extracted two dimensions, i.e. CSM and perceived business performance. All related indicators manifested their constructs respectively. Although there were expectations where CSM would diverged into more dimensions via exploratory factor analysis (i.e. market research, customer assessment, customer satisfaction and customer relationship management), the results show that CSM were encapsulated as a single construct by respondents. The findings confirmed that CSM had significant association on PBPM, i.e. 0.83 standardised regression weights. Research limitations/implications – One limitation was the size of the sample. Although the permissible threshold of sample size was met, the research would not be jeopardized with larger sample size. Future research can entail foreign banks so that the results can be compared in contrast with the ones gathered in this paper. Practical implications – The results can help bankers enhance their competitiveness with more emphasis on CSM through market research, customer satisfaction, customer assessment and handling of customer. These aspects are important key drivers towards successful implementation of CSM. Originality/value – Although CSM is multi faceted, it was viewed by the respondents as a single construct. The paper empirically justified the effectiveness of CSM on PBPM.

Design/methodology/approach – Case studies investigated aspects of cultural change post-implementation of family-friendly policies. A grounded theory approach was adopted in the collection and analysis of the data, largely but not exclusively obtained through three sets of interviews, giving a limited longitudinal dimension to the study. Findings – As both organizations had been sated with change, the idea that further adjustment was necessary to facilitate better work-life balance for employees was potentially alienating to the very members most needing to be “brought on board”. Harnessing widely esteemed values and adopting the language of “cultural revitalisation” rather than cultural change appeared more effective in securing broader support of employees. Research limitations/implications – Studies began after policy implementation so there was significant dependence on participant recall to access perceptions of any shifts and HR managers determined sample composition. Both necessitated the use of a wide range of supplementary evidence (as befits case study research) and the latter the development of an “informal track” of participants. Practical implications – Cultural change programmes must appreciate the importance of enduring values, correctly identifying those which appear most resonant for employees, ensuring that these feature prominently when promoting a “work-life balance” agenda. Originality/value – It is unusual for case studies to look in detail at processes of change. This paper refines notions of organizational culture change and considers how best to include employees most likely to be resistant to a “work-life balance” agenda. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Family-friendly organizations; Job satisfaction; Organizational culture; Working patterns",""

The study is based on case research method involving in-depth interviews with 120 local and expatriates of 7 companies and their 14 suppliers. In Thailand, the manufacturer—supplier relationship starts out as a market-exchange-type relationship, and then gradually moves to a partnering type. The stages in evolution involve constant efforts on the part of foreign manufacturers to develop the suppliers by offering resources, training, feedback and solutions. The supplier capability building programs, bridging of cultural differences and formation of trust provides the basis for enduring partnerships. These partnerships are symbiotic relationships in which manufacturers benefit from suppliers' knowledge of local production and market factors and suppliers benefit from manufacturer's technical and managerial support. Additionally, closer collaboration with suppliers helps to prevent the leakage of business intelligence and theft of intellectual property and to prevent suppliers from working with competitors, thus allowing manufacturers to devote undivided attention to smooth supply of parts without any shortage. In emerging markets, the local suppliers play key role in the success of foreign automobile companies. However, the local suppliers need technical and managerial support from manufacturers. The process of building a network of competent local suppliers consumes time and resources, therefore manufacturers should take a long-term view of the market. The undeniable importance of overcoming cultural differences and building trust is the hallmark of successful partnerships. The paper highlights the importance and process of developing local suppliers in emerging markets using Thai automobile industry as an example. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Automotive industry; Emerging markets; Partnership; Supplier relations; Thailand",""

In this paper, an integrated model using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and FMICMAC analysis has been developed to identify and classify the key selection criteria of 3PL services providers, typically identified by many researchers and practiced by the shippers for effective supply chain management. The key criteria are also modeled to find their role and mutual influence in the selection of 3PL services providers. The key finding of this modeling helps to identify and classify the criteria, which may be further used, to identify the potential 3PL services provider. Integrated model reveals, criteria such as information technology capability; size and quality of fixed assets and quality of management as independent criteria, whereas criteria such as compatibility, long-term relation and reputation as dependent criteria. Criterion namely flexibility in operation and delivery is found to be an autonomous criterion. The important criteria like quality of service, information sharing and trust, geographical spread and range of services, delivery performance, operational performance, financial stability, optimum cost, and surge capacity are found as the linkage criteria. Integrated model also establishes the direct and indirect relationship among various criteria, which plays a significant role in the selection process. The research provide an integrated model using ISM and FMICMAC to identify and classify various key criteria required for the selection of 3PL services providers. The various key criteria have been grouped under four broad classification, namely, dependent criteria, independent criteria, autonomous criteria and linkage criteria based on their driving and dependence power, deduced from fuzzy reachability value. The model helps in the identification, classification and selection of key criteria along with their behavior, thus this research will help logistics managers to select right criteria for the selection of potential 3PL services providers for their logistics need. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Channel relations; Distribution management; Freight forwarding; Structural analysis",""

Findings– Researchers and translators should recognize the linguistic and cultural differences that data translation must negotiate. It is argued here that researchers and translators should preserve and highlight cultural differences rather than resembling the dominant values of the target culture by translation. A translator is an integral part of the knowledge producing system. The roles of the translator as both an inter-cultural communicator and a data interpreter must be acknowledged in the research process.

The AIO (Activities, Interest, and Opinions) and VALS (Values, Attitudes, and Life-Styles) statements adapted from the current cross-cultural marketing literature were utilized to determine different US and Canadian consumer market segments. The research tools and techniques used in this study help retail businesses as well as manufacturing companies of the two countries to develop and execute more effective target marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach – The data for this study were collected through self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires were administered in two different locations. First, in Brandon, Canada and second, in the rural part of south central Pennsylvania (York and Lancaster counties). Both regions are similar to each other, each having a flourishing agricultural industry and a significant number of companies in the service and manufacturing industries. The data were collected through a drop-off and pick-up method among a sample of 300 Canadian married or common-law families and 400 in the USA. Findings – The study results show that there are, indeed, differences among the consumers’ life-styles in the two countries which were similar in demographics and as such may have been previously treated the same way by marketers, but in reality have very different lifestyles.

Design/methodology/approach – The total sample of 454 included adult working Chinese from Shanghai, Taipei, and Hong Kong. Factor analysis was performed to identify separately the shopping orientations and dimensions of the personal values of the subjects. ANOVA analysis was then used to examine the differences among the subjects in terms of their shopping orientation and personal values. Lastly, correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between dimensions of personal values and shopping orientations. Findings – As expected, the results showed that Chinese consumers in Greater China shared similar personal values, but differences were found in their shopping orientation. Significant relationships were found between dimensions of personal values and the eight shopping orientations. Among the dimensions of personal values, self-actualization played a major role in six of the eight shopping orientations, with shopping gender roles and economic shopping being the exceptions. Personalized shopping, advertised specials, and shopping for self-satisfaction were found to be the three major shopping orientations that were closely related to personal values. Shopping gender roles and economic shopping were found to be unrelated to any personal values as they reflect individual short-term goals rather than long-term values. Research limitations/implications – The Shanghai data were collected using judgment sampling as there are regulations that restrict the distribution of questionnaires in public streets in mainland China, whereas the Taipei and Hong Kong data were collected using random sampling. Different collection methods in the sampling process may have led to a problem regarding the representativeness of the sample. Practical implications – Among the dimensions of personal values, self-actualization played a major role in shopping orientation. The self-actualization needs of consumers could be achieved through smart shopping and bargain hunting, but also through personalized shopping and shopping satisfaction. Because consumer shopping satisfaction is generally not high in Greater China, improvements could be made to enhance shopping satisfaction by providing a shopping environment that enables consumers to demonstrate their intellectual thinking and that meets their self-actualization needs. Personalized shopping is also important for Chinese consumers who prefer closer personal relationships with salespersons. Originality/value – Various studies have focused on the classification of the shopping orientations of consumers from different perspectives, but few studies have investigated the influence of personal values on shopping orientation, especially in the Greater China market. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Consumer behavior; Individual psychology; Social values",""

Design/methodology/approach – Commencing doctoral research, and committed to an orthodox grounded theory approach, a unique story was uncovered which, to do it and the research justice, required an alternative form of representation. Intuition decreed that this should be narrative. However, grounded theory and narrative entail epistemologically and ontologically incommensurate paradigms. The paper seeks to consider whether inclusion of the unique story would compromise, or subvert, the already emergent grounded theory. An exploration of the relationship between different epistemological and ontological traditions is also to be made, based on the assumption that method “slurring,” and a more eclectic approach to using incommensurate paradigms, may be valuable. Findings – In transcribing and coding data using strictly orthodox grounded theory methods, the researcher runs the risk of “stripping” the research story of some critical dimension(s). However, combining a narrative approach with that of grounded theory, the paper allows for the representation of an atypical “Maverick” case, along-side other more typical cases. Originality/value – The paper points out, to the early career qualitative researcher in particular, that it is legitimate to combine seemingly incommensurate methodologies, notably where not to do so would result in the loss of enriching and powerful insights into basic social processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Narratives; Qualitative research; Research methods",""

Design/methodology/approach – Using ethnographic in-depth interviews, data were collected from 20 Indian UK-based “buyers” who have either previously bought or are currently buying from organisations based in India. Investigates the perceptions surrounding challenges and/or benefits held by these 20 SMEs. Identified areas such as inter-cultural blending, community support, country-of-origin effects, generational shifts and finally, attitudes towards quality, price, consistency, and branding. Findings – Findings indicate that the respondents did not vary at all on their collective perceptions about buying from emerging economies, specifically, India. The over-riding issue that was highlighted many times over was one of “trust in the relationship” between buyer and seller. Findings also suggest the need to take a holistic view on the whole arena of “marketing paradigms for emerging economies”. Despite a climate of increased globalization, an intensification of international contact of businesses, increased travel of executives, and an enlarged overseas education by Indians, there still seems to be a vast gap between the perceptions that are held by India-based executives and their UK counterparts (high cultural distance).

This study has demonstrated that the durable goods sector in Taiwan emphasizes the condition of a franchisee personal condition more than its store location, and our results further indicate that a franchiser should emphasize finance and business ability when selecting franchisees. Additionally, consumer purchasing power, individuals passing by and parking convenience are all important factors for selecting a franchisee.

There are different coordination mechanisms reported in the literature that have been discussed in isolation like information sharing, information technology, long-term partnerships, and joint decision making which help in coordinating supply chain members. Various coordination models have been proposed considering isolated activities of the supply chain. There is a need to consider a holistic perspective of coordination in the entire supply chain. This paper sets out to analyze a case study of XYZ, a leading automotive parts manufacturer in India, to throw light on the status of coordination in its supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – A situation-actor-process (SAP)-learning-action-performance (LAP) model has been applied to analyze the case study of XYZ. The situation represents the present scenario of the organization. Actors are the participants, influencing the situation to evolve different business processes. Based on SAP, various learning issues have been analyzed which lead to suitable action followed by impact of SAP on the performance of the supply chain of the organization. Findings – Various issues that need attention are: the type of relationship with suppliers and buyers, coordination effort with supply chain members, various mechanisms like information sharing, information technology, information systems, joint decision making, and flexibility required to adopt the above-mentioned issues of coordination. Research limitations/implications – The flexible model of SAP-LAP is used to explain soft and hard issues of supply chain coordination in a managerial context with reference to a dynamic SAP-LAP model as applied to the case of XYZ. Practical implications – The flexible model of SAP-LAP presents the situation of coordination to participants who may initiate the processes needed to be coordinated. It also helps in identifying flexibility gaps in adoption of coordination mechanisms. The synthesis of SAP leads to LAP, which bridges the gap of flexibility by suggesting improvement actions on the gaps of flexibility or the learning from the present situation, actors and processes. Originality/value – This is a novel approach to analyze quantitative and qualitative issues of supply chain coordination in a single model comprising various perspectives on coordination, coordination mechanisms, and flexibility required to coordinate, and the impact of coordination on performance of the supply chain. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Flexible organizations; Situation analysis; Supply chain management",""
"The influence of explicit and implicit service promises on Chinese students’ expectations of overseas universities","2006","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986173877&doi=10.1108%2f13555850610658273&partnerID=40&md5=6d2827f7f3ae3f1c06839e450ae689a8","Purpose – This study aims to extend the knowledge and literature on which information sources influences (explicit service promises such as advertising, personal selling; implicit service promises such as tangibles and price; past experiences; word of mouth; image and reputation) Chinese students’ expectations of overseas universities’ service quality. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from undergraduate Chinese students from two universities in Australia. A total of 133 questionnaires were returned for data analysis. Factor analysis and multiple analysis of variance were conducted for this study. Findings – Results indicate the three most influential sources of information on Chinese students expectations of universities are: past experiences, advertising and word of mouth. Findings suggest that the more explicit and implicit service promises the respondent is exposed to; the higher the desired and predicted expectations of the university's service quality. However their level of expectations (both desired and predicted) is considerably greater when exposed to explicit service promises. Research limitations/implications – One limitation of this study includes the results obtained as not necessarily generalisable or applicable to other cultures (for instance Europeans). Future research could examine Chinese students’ formation of expectations based on other factors such as human values. Originality/value – The theoretical contribution of this study consists of applying and extending Zeithaml et al.'s model, that proposes that a customer's level of expectations is dependent on several antecedents, within a higher education (pre-purchase) context using a Chinese sample. The main managerial implication is that measuring the influence of information sources on Chinese students will provide universities with more effective ways of targeting Chinese consumers with their marketing communication campaigns. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; China; Consumers; Customer services quality; Information research; Students",""
"Longitudinal textual analysis: An innovative method for analysing how realised strategies evolve","2007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904705544&doi=10.1108%2f17465640710778511&partnerID=40&md5=8c7e8a3f46acaffd0c3f15fb73d2e406","Purpose – This paper aims to present an innovative methodological framework developed out of primary research that will lead to new understanding about patterns in the strategic actions realised by firms within an industry. The framework is to be applied to increase understanding of how realised strategies evolved in the pharmaceutical industry and overcomes some of the limitations of other methods. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach was developed adapting techniques from text, thematic and content analysis to identify and categorise strategic actions realised by pharmaceutical firms (referred to as grand strategies). Strategic actions were not pre-selected but allowed to emerge during the data collection process from public announcements by firms in the industry’s main journal, Scrip. Building upon the work of Pearce and Robinson grand strategies can be understood as the packages of strategic actions that firms had planned and/or realised in order to achieve long-term objectives. Findings – A framework of realised strategic actions and grand strategies in the pharmaceutical industry was developed with 23 mutually exclusive categories. The paper shows how the framework can be used as an analytical tool to explore patterns in strategic action and grand strategy evolution, temporal patterns in strategy development and strategic action coevolution. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of the categorisation is that it is based on material collected from two years of empirical data from Scrip in order to develop the methodological framework. The framework was applied to data collected over an 11 year period in order to explore how the strategic actions of individual firms had evolved and co-evolved. Data sources were limited to published sources. Originality/value – The qualitative approach presented here offers a level of depth that has not been achieved by methodological approaches previously used to explore and compare patterns in realised strategic actions by firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry. The innovative approach contributes to management research in two key ways: providing a methodological framework that overcomes the limitations of previous studies into strategy evolution; and providing a systematic approach to data collection and analysis that can contribute to theory building with regard to strategy evolution. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Emergent strategy; Pharmaceuticals industry; Research",""

The value of the perishable food can be traced based on an automatic product identification technology radio frequency identification (RFID). With the support of the RFID, an optimization model can be developed to enable product tracking. The analysis of the model shows promising benefits of applying a dynamic pricing policy and obtains the optimal ordering decision in respects of deterministic and stochastic demand function with RFID. Although technological approaches for tracking products have attracted increasing attentions in both research and practice, little research have proved the profit using RFID by mathematics, the result of this paper can prove the benefit by using RFID. The result of this paper can tell the supermarket how to make the price and the ordering decision by using the RFID. This study proves the benefit of using the RFID by mathematical model based on the conceptual model before, and tell the method how to use RFID for pricing and making ordering decision. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Food products; Fresh food; Orders and ordering; Pricing; Supermarkets; Tracking",""

Design/methodology/approach – The data for this study were collected from the small and medium size manufacturing firms located in and around Mumbai. A total of 67 CEOs/business heads were randomly selected and personally interviewed with the help of a structured questionnaire. Findings – Study strengthens the view that small and medium enterprises need to invest in relationships so that such investments are turned into relational switching barriers and they would thereby help in increasing customer retention. It also shows that if relational switching costs are higher, then even if satisfaction is lower the customer is less likely to terminate the relationship. Research limitations/implications – For marketing practitioners, the findings validate the long-held belief that relationship marketing orientation is critical for business performance. However, data in this study were obtained from manufacturing firms, which are into plastics and light engineering sector. Replication of this study on a wider scale across different industries is essential for the generalization of the findings. Further, it could be useful to explore the complexities of the relationship between relational switching costs and other types of switching costs like the set-up and financial costs. Originality/value – Although empirical studies have dealt with the customers’ switching behaviour, the concept of relational switching costs and its impact on other relational parameters is relatively new.

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative interview study is used to investigate an occupational group (hospital dieticians) as it tried to increase its influence in a setting of established occupational groups. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with dieticians and managers at a university hospital, and by the examination of selected hospital documents. Findings – This study concludes that the dieticians’ boundary work to become more influential in a setting of established groups was characterized by their boundary setting actions as inner dialogue and their boundary spanning actions as outer dialogue. In the inner dialogue, the dieticians established a professional group and a vocabulary for the continuous communication of their unique competence that could relate to the existing medical knowledge. In the outer dialogue, the dieticians structured and made sense of their setting by the labelling of roles as power entities and by using self-images and metaphors. Research limitations/implications – This research was designed to describe the dieticians’ efforts and experiences in the studied setting. Therefore, the data provide access to one occupational group but not to the other groups in that setting. A second limitation is the absence of observations. Practical implications – This research contributes to the knowledge of the relevance of practitioners involved in boundary work aimed at improving professional collaboration. The study is helpful in identifying important boundaries that facilitate the establishment of collaborative relationships, and the development of accounts, procedures and routines.

"The impact of consumer ethnocentrism and country of origin sub-components for high involvement products on young Chinese consumers’ product assessments","2008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986165691&doi=10.1108%2f13555850810909759&partnerID=40&md5=e5855a8ccb2e0e02ab10bb8f4430956a","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of country of origin (COO) sub-components (i.e. design, assembly and parts), as well as the extent to which consumer ethnocentrism tendencies interact with these COO sub-components for young Chinese consumers with regards to product quality assessments and purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach – A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental design was used to examine the effects of the three sub-components of COO with two levels of sourcing location – Home (China) and Foreign (Germany), for two high involvement products (an automobile and a digital camera). Chinese students in China represented the sample of 272 respondents. MANOVA was used to examine the direct effects and interactions of the three COO components, as well as ethnocentrism, measured using the CETSCALE. Findings – It was found that the three COO sub-components did not influence young Chinese consumers’ evaluation of product quality or purchase intentions. In addition, consumers’ level of ethnocentrism also did not have a direct effect on perceived product quality or purchase intentions. There was only one statistically significant interaction effect between ethnocentrism and country of parts for one of the two products. As such, COO dimensions and young Chinese consumers’ ethnocentrism appears to have limited influence on their assessments of product quality or purchase intentions. This may occur because young Chinese consumers perceive that hybrid products are the norm for high involvement products in China as these products are all these consumers have experienced. Originality/value – The findings of this research dispute the commonly held belief and evidence that sub-components of COO have an impact on the perceptions of product quality and purchase intentions. Young Chinese consumers may be different to consumers from western countries because they have been extensively exposed to hybrid products. Given the size and growth potential of China, young Chinese are an important, under-researched segment within the Chinese market. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Assembly; China; Country of origin; Design; Ethnocentrism; Parts",""

Design/methodology/approach – An experiment is conducted with 131 US, 111 Singaporean, and 127 Thai undergraduates. Findings – The findings confirm the existence of unrealistic optimism in the marketing setting and show that: lower levels of optimism are associated with higher purchase intentions for the product; hazard-related behavior-priming ad appeals lead to higher purchase intentions than ads without priming; Singaporeans show higher purchase intentions than Americans for both the risk-priming and the expert ad appeals, and they also show higher purchase intentions than Thais for expert ad appeals. Research limitations/implications – The samples, while well matched, consist of undergraduate students who are not necessarily representative of the populations as a whole. The samples also come from only three countries. Finally, only one product is employed. Practical implications – The study suggests that: external-control/collectivist cultures may be more influenced by advertising, regardless of the appeal employed; different types of cultures may require different amounts of advertising to achieve equal levels of effectiveness; unrealistic optimism needs to be addressed by marketers of preemptive products; marketers should use ads that prime risky behaviors when promoting products for reducing/preventing undesirable outcomes/hazards. Originality/value – The study has re-affirmed that unrealistic optimism exists, and that this phenomenon exists internationally with respect to a relatively lower-involvement risk product category than had previously been studied. It has unveiled relationships between optimism and purchase intentions. Finally, the study has identified both similarities and differences in terms of the existence of unrealistic optimism and the relative effectiveness of different message types across cultures. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising effectiveness; Purchasing; Self-esteem; Singapore; Thailand; United States of America",""

A questionnaire was issued to gather the information from a sample with 123 individuals. The approach is quantitative. Findings – It was found that recycling behaviour has become a routine or habit with recognized awareness of ecology and recycling, but without a high level of involvement, since today's adoption process does not require such effort. This implies that the efficacy of the reward technique has been transformed and consequently its effects must be understood differently. To be specific, responders and non-responders are similar, in terms of their levels of beliefs about recycling, ecological concern and involvement with recycling, and both show the same model of adoption with a low hierarchy of effect and with a few minor differences. Nevertheless there is only one difference between sustainers and non-sustainers, namely, the sustainers’ greater ecological concern before the promotion application.

A conceptual frame work of location selection for distribution centre is worked out through three main stages. At the first stage, a general geographical area for distribution centre is identified based on the Centre of Gravity principle, taking into consideration socio-economic factors. The second stage of the selection process involves the identification of alternative locations for the distribution centre and the airports and seaports to be used for in bound and out bound cargo flows within the defined general geographical area. The third stage focuses on specific site selection among the identified alternative locations for the distribution centre based on the quantitative approach. This involves a mathematical model which aims to optimise either the total distribution cost or the integration of total distance transport with given relevant volumes of cargo. In order to illustrate the conceptual frame work, a case study of a logistics service provider will be provided. Data from the case study proved that the conceptual framework for selection is valid and can be of value to logistics companies in their operations and management. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Distribution centre; Location; Logistics; Selection",""

Design/methodology/approach - Three trends are reviewed: postmodern fragmentation, late modern appropriations of postmodern moves; and emergent awareness of the dark-side of postmodern. Findings - On the way to postmodern theory the revolution to reform modern capitalism fragmented into rhetoric-strands, while practice became ineffective. Research limitations/implications - The paper concludes with possibilities for participatory research in ways that enact more postmodern forms of capitalist praxis. Practical implications - It is suggested that qualitative studies of postmodern praxis can be conducted; such as postmodern organizations that enact the dark-side of biotechnology; consumer organizations, such as Blackspot and No Sweat that contract to non-sweatshop factories; and autoethnographic examples of how building a Harley-Davidson chopper is post-production and post-consumption. Originality/value - The paper shows that in the fragmentation of moderns and postmoderns, there is a relentless appropriation of postmodern moves by late modernism. This is one contributing factor to the “dark side of postmodern.” Other contributing factors are naive brands of postmodern (e.g. chaos theory, complexity, new age spirituality) which, sometimes only see the positive potentialities, and blind one to the dark side. What is original is the call for a combination of critical theory and postmodern theory (critical postmodern) that looks at the relation between various ideas of modern and postmodern and how they can be studied in their dialogicality. © 2006 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Philosophy; Postmodernism",""

Franchising in an emerging market was selected as the context because – (1) future growth is likely to come from newly emerging markets, (2) franchising is primarily seen as a foreign concept in emerging markets and has attracted its fair share of attention, both positive and negative. The results indicate that people evaluate franchising using four key factors – well being of small businesses, socio-economic, socio-cultural well being, and employment opportunity. This study further investigates the relationship between these factors and patronage behaviour. Some of these factors were associated with patronage behaviour and the associated residual feeling. Clearly, in order to succeed in emerging and developing markets, the franchising industry must pay heed to public opinion. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Franchises; India; Markets",""

Design/methodology/approach – After a consideration of some current relevant pedagogical issues the author presents an autoethnographic account of his own parallel experiences of teaching qualitative research methods and learning to play a musical instrument. Emotional aspects of teaching and learning are highlighted in an analysis of the dynamic interaction between the two activities. This is presented as an example of how the “use of learning stories” can increase sensitivity to the anxieties of students. Findings – Finds that the core of the argument lies in the value of self-reflexivity to the business school teacher and that looking inward at personal learning experiences is invaluable for informing current and future teaching practice. Recent learning experiences seem to have the most potential and learning something that is found difficult may be the richest source of empathy and insight. Practical implications – It is argued that reflexive analysis by research-methods lecturers of their own learning experiences can develop synergies which would not only improve the effectiveness of their teaching but also enrich the learning experience of their students. Originality/value – The paper is an attempt to generate some original ideas about teaching research methods in business schools via a mix of autoethnography and music.

As soon as a negative rumour begins to spread, sales often fall drastically. The major battle is not only to recover sales but how to recover consumer confidence before buyers eliminate the company's brands from their evoked set. The literature on commercial rumour implicitly assumes that consumers will react to commercial rumours in a homogenous manner. However, most marketing scholars involved in studying cultural effects suggest that the culture of the buyer will influence their reaction specifically through their acceptance/rejection of the source attempting to refute the rumour. Therefore, any attempt to address commercial rumour without regard to the buyers’ cultural backgrounds may not be effective. An experiment was developed to test the effect of cultural background on choice of spokesperson to refute commercial rumours. The results of this experiment show that consumers from Eastern and Western cultural backgrounds respond in a different manner to spokespersons addressing commercial rumours. Their cultural backgrounds and values appear to influence their belief about the veracity of the source responding to the commercial rumours and their message. It is recommended that marketing personnel consider consumers’ and buyers’ core values when developing strategies for and selecting sources for controlling commercial rumours. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Consumers; Cultural synergy; Marketing strategy",""

The results show that there is no difference among the four adaptation levels on disconfirmation of the adaptor's stereo types. The high adaptation using English condition is perceived to be more situationally caused than is the high adaptation using the native language condition, which in turn is perceived to be more situationally caused than is the moderate adaptation condition, and the high adaptation using English condition is perceived to be more situationally caused than is the no adaptation condition.

Findings - Ethnography remains relatively free from technical jargon and high-wire abstraction. Because of its relative freedom from a thoroughly specialized vocabulary and a privileged conceptual apparatus, ethnography continues to carry a slight literary air compared to other forms of social science writing. Ethnography maintains an almost obsessive focus on the ""empirical."" Despite attempts to develop a standard methodology over the last 20 years, there is still not much of a technique attached to ethnography. Originality/value - The paper presents the original views of a renowned ethnographer about developments within the practice of ethnography during the last 20 years. © 2006 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Ethnography; Qualitative research",""
"A macro and micro perspective of the global software industry with specific orientation to India, China and the Philippines","2004","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84993090043&doi=10.1108%2f13555850410765267&partnerID=40&md5=4d13715cba6768041657abc802042564","Much has been made of the importance of the Indian market as the future of the software industry. However, according to mainstream internationalisation theory the market in India may be seen as a less preferential market to other higher growth and low cost markets such as China and Russia. India will have to move higher up the value chain if it is to maintain this favourable position. This article sets out to explain the main reasons why India is proving attractive for foreign direct investment by examining theories of internationalisation and drawing on key FDI data. Contrasts are also made with other important markets including China and Philippines. The article then goes on to examine industry specific variables. The article then considers some alternative historical and cultural factors that may also have a role in explaining the success of this particular industry and location. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Global strategies; India; Software industry",""
"Existence-driven anticipating of CONCOLS: Management of technology protocol (MOTEP) step #6, #12:Corporate empirical experience","2002","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931329057&partnerID=40&md5=03b9c90e3132cbe70b037e8af3c6283d","OVERVIEW: Using 6 Corporate Applications and 2 Country Applications, in Chapter 1we developed Steps #1-8 ofManagement Of Technology Protocol (MOTEP); and using 6 Corporate and 3 Country Applications , in Chapter 2 we developed Steps # 9-12. We raised the question: How did the de facto CTOs in Countries and Corporations perform their job of anticipating quantum jumps in technology so that the country/corporation could survive? It was explored in Ch.3 From Survival-driven anticipating of discontinuities in technology in Ch. 3, we turned to Territory-driven anticipating of Technology in two parts: (1) Consumer Use (Ch. 4), and (2) Corporate Use (Ch. 5). To meet the consumer expectations, financial service companies find that they have to form CONCOLs with technology companies. For instance, VISA is a CONCOL: the 22,000 owner-member banks compete with each other for the 750 million customers and cooperate by honoring one another’s VISAcards accepted at 15 million merchant locations in 200 countries. The CONCOLs are no luxury; they can make the difference between life and death. In Ch. 6 we turn to existence-driven anticipating of CONCOLs. Ken Olsen who created the mini-computer industry, steadfastly maintained that the personal computer would fall flat on its face in business. As a consequence, he refused the overture by AT&T to form a CONCOL twice: in 1983 and 1985. AT&T, recognizing that (wired) voice calls making up 80 percent of business revenue in 1999 would not be sustainable in the face of the Internet, offered IPO of AT&TWireless on April 27, 2000. Contravening Ken Olsen’s dogma that a telephone company and a computer company being absolute extremes can never work together, AT&T and IBM announced an alliance (Mobile e-business CONCOL) in February 2000 to offer wireless data services to their business customers. Wireless Internet Access is emerging as the competitive background of e-business and K-economy. Europe is hard at work to create Mobile Internet Portals; so is the US, AOL and Microsoft busily forming Content-Carrier CONCOLs.","",""

In this article, we consider three layers of customers in the client company. There are project directors who interface with and accept the final product (i.e. IT system) from the IS company, users who actually use the IT system for their daily operations, and finally operators who do maintenance works for the IT system. We propose that each customer group (i.e. project director, user, or operator) evaluates the IT systems success with a different set of criteria. Transaction relationship and partnership turn out to be important determinants for the project directors: task-related and IS-related output performances seem to be less influential. The reverse conclusion can be made for users and operators. One additional insight is that IS company's efforts to understand its customer's tasks and share risks with the customer company might have unexpected effects. Although the project directors seem to like such close involvement, it can be detrimental to the users’ satisfaction with the IS outsourcing projects. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Information strategy; Information studies; Korea",""

Results from an emerging market, India, indicate that perceived orientation towards both profitability and market share is not associated with any of the channel support considered. Growth orientation however is strongly associated with most of the channel support activities – both business (e.g., business advice, pricing and ordering assistance, and personnel training) as well as marketing (advertising support, sales promotional material, and inventory management assistance) oriented activities. In contrast, perceived sales volume orientation is only associated with advertising support and business advice, however, the relationship is negative.

Pictorial representation provides a means of exploring the various factors that may influence, limit or inhibit researchers in their practice. Design/methodology/approach – Three groups were engaged in creating pictorial representations of either “research” or “researchers”. Groups of new doctorate in Business Administration students, second year PhD students and a network of women academic staff from two UK university business schools described their drawings to their group and engaged in general discussion of the issues raised. Findings – Drawing and discussing pictures allows emotional and unconscious aspects of engaging in research to surface, helping drawers put into words what may be difficult to voice. Such images enrich and enliven the difficult area of research methods teaching and their personal nature helps to “acknowledge the individual in the researcher”. Research limitations/implications – This paper is based on research with a small number of participants.

In this study, consumer judgements of two technological products varying in their level of complexity made in highly, moderately, and newly industrialised countries were obtained in a multi-attribute context. The results show that the country-of-origin image of moderately and newly industrialised countries was less negative for technologically simpler products (i.e. a television) than they were for technologically complex products (i.e. a computer). It appears that the negative image of moderately and newly industrialised countries can be attenuated by making Taiwanese consumers more familiar with products made in these countries and/or by providing them with other product-related information such as brand name and warranty. Newly industrialised countries were perceived more negatively as countries of design than as countries of assembly, especially in the context of making technologically complex products. The image of foreign countries as producers of consumer goods was positively correlated with education. The more familiar consumers were with the products of a country, the more favourable was their evaluation of that country. Consumer involvement with purchasing a technologically complex product such as a computer was positively associated with the appreciation of products made in moderately industrialised countries.

This paper aims to explore the potential of critical discourse analysis (CDA) to provide new and different understandings of HRM and processes of organisational change, and which highlights the creative role of language in the shaping of organisation and management practice. Design/methodology/approach – A case study analysis of managers’ experiences of introducing change in a large catering firm is drawn upon to highlight the inherent tensions in people management, which stem from the need for employers to motivate and control labour in order to remain profitable. This is illustrated in a change programme aimed at increasing organisational efficiency and achieving a “results driven culture” that exhorted managers to think and behave as “entrepreneurs” and to “comply” with stringent new rules on managing their staff. Findings – It is concluded that conflict and resistance is an inevitable feature of HRM-based initiatives and that CDA offers a powerful lens for exploring this dynamic. Importantly, it provides a less restrictive view of management decision making than that found in conventional understandings of HRM, which tend to treat management as a more or less culturally unified body, and ignores the subjectivity of managers. In contrast, the empirical evidence presented here provides an example of how the deployment of CDA can provide rich insights into the dynamics of HRM-based change rooted in a complex shifting network of alliances (and related discourses).

Design/methodology/approach – Experiments were conducted at a university in South China with a total of 157 commerce students. Four advertisements, designed for the same fictional brand but featuring different genders and different levels of sex appeal, were tested in the experiments. Data analyses were conducted using t-tests and ANOVA tests. Findings – When comparing the male and female differences in the responses to the ads, it was found that males and females only differed significantly when they were exposed to the ad featuring a male model with the low level of sex appeal. No significant differences were found between male and female consumers regarding the other three ads featuring the male model with the high level of sex appeal or featuring the female model with the low or high level of sex appeal. Further analyses on male or female consumers’ responses to the four ads found that females had significantly different attitudes towards the ads, whereas males did not. Research limitations/implications – Using a convenient sample and testing only one product category were two major limitations of this study. Future research should adopt a more representative sample and test different product categories. Practical implications – The findings of this study suggest that international advertisers need to take careful consideration if they are going to use sex appeal in their advertising to the Chinese consumers. Particularly, they must first take into account whether an ad targets a male or female audience. Originality/value – This article is the first empirical study on mainland Chinese consumers’ responses to sex appeal advertising.

SARS emerged in China in November 2002 and has spread to 26 countries. The SARS epidemic has caused the most severe economic crisis in Southeast Asia since the wave of bank failures and currency devaluations that swept the region five years ago. The SARS epidemic has prompted health officials to implement travel advisories and restrictions, in order to defer nonessential travel to regions of Asia with large numbers of SARS cases. They are enforcing quarantine and isolation measures in major cities to try and limit the spread of SARS. The President of the United States has signed an executive order adding SARS to the list of communicable diseases that can be quarantined. A major disruption in China could paralyze just-in-time supply chains and cause an economic crisis for retailers and other businesses worldwide. The SARS epidemic has caused many economists to drastically reduce their economic-growth forecasts for Asia.

"Understanding the interrelationship between regional differences and material aspiration in the context of Indian diversity: Results of an exploratory study","2005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992999058&doi=10.1108%2f13555850510672403&partnerID=40&md5=8afc2cb5cbd9c1a072628145224a0c48","In the last decade, the scope of consumer research has been expanded beyond choice and decision-making to include various behaviour parameters like the meanings of possession and materialism but that should be studied in the background of cultural differences. Consumer behaviour has been found to be affected by regional differences that come out of various geographic, topological and cultural factors including values, motives and lifestyle. These give rise to distinct subcultures and can be an important determinant of both consumption and non-consumption behaviours. India being highly diversified, the differences in geographic subculture are hypothesised to be significant. Accordingly this present study extends the current literature and explores the interaction among cultural adherence, materialism, preacquisition dream propensity and pre-purchase “wish list” all of which are hypothesised to be actually reflecting the influence of regional differences. The degree of materialism was found to be significantly correlated with the intensity of cultural adherence. Regional differences and cultural adherence, as a whole, was also found to be significantly related to materialism and prepurchase dreaming propensity. An interesting perspective was revealed from the content analysis of wish list. Implications of the findings for the study of materialism are also discussed. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer research; India; Regional differences",""

We raised the question: How did the de facto CTOs in Countries and Corporations perform their job of anticipating quantum jumps in technology? During the half-century from 1937 when Churchill placed the entire defense eggs of Britain in the technology basket of unproven radar, to 1987 when IBM research scientists won the Nobel Prize for their discovery of superconductors at higher temperatures, how did the de facto CTOs do their work of anticipating technological discontinuities? is the question we explored in 9 Country Applications and 5 Corporate Applications in Chapter 3. From Survival-driven anticipating of discontinuities in technology in Ch. 3, we turned to Territory-driven anticipating of Technology in two parts: (1) Consumer Use (Ch. 4), and (2) Corporate Use (Ch. 5). Consumer expenditure drives two-thirds of US GNP. The largest single item of expenditure for most consumers is the mortgage on their homes; and the second most expensive item is the car. The expenditure on items for daily living comes under retailing. We discussed in Ch. 4 Territory-driven anticipating of Technology-Consumer Use comprising the three items: (1) Consumer-Retailing, (2) Consumer Mortgaging, and (13) Consumer-auto purchasing. In Ch. 5 we turn to Territory-driven anticipating of Technology-Corporate Use. The territory is drawn by what the consumer expects. Three demands are made by the consumer: (1) Stop electronically stealing my money, (2) Higher interest for my deposits, lower interest for my loans, and (3) My interactive, mobile, secure access to Internet. Money is no longer what it has been since its invention. The guarantee of the value of cash/currency by “the full credit of” a sovereign government is taken over by VISA (and other “credit” cards) which is in the business of exchange of money value-universal. VISA is a CONCOL: the 22,000 owner-member banks compete with each other for the 750 million customers and cooperate by honoring one another’s VISA cards accepted at 15 million merchant locations in 200 countries. As VISA purchases move toward becoming Internet transactions, traditional brokerage houses like Merrill Lynch find it indispensable to offer DL-Jdirect Online Brokerage. Not only the brokers but also the bankers face keen competition from Fidelity, Schwab and others who have taken over 72 percent of household assets, which are no longer in bank accounts and term deposits. The struggle for survival of the banks drives them into CONCOLs with technology companies as shown in three examples, one each from Canada, USA, and Brazil.","",""

A comparison of responses from young women inHong Kong and the US indicate that both cultures are similar in the degree of body dissatisfaction and dieting behavior exhibited. However, Western women spend significantly more time exercising and are more willing to have plastic surgery to improve their appearance. The third person effect appears robust across cultures, but generally does not contribute significantly to explaining body image related attitudes and behaviors.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes how there is a very clear, but not yet fully recognized, difference between (at least some crucial forms of dialogically-structured) qualitative research and current more quantitative forms – a difference that is not fully captured in characterizing it as more focussed on subjective experience and as context-oriented. Findings – Central to this approach is a kind of poetic writing that requires a special kind of slow reading that leads us, not to a referential-representational understanding of the text, but to a relationally-responsive understanding of it, a shift from being concerned with the extra knowledge or information that one is left with after reading a text to a concern with what can happen during one’s reading of it. Its focus is thus on the provision of detailed portrayals rather than on accurate representations, and with how ‘striking’ expressions remembered from our reading of such portrayals can come to in-form our ways of perceiving, acting, talking, thinking, and evaluating events occurring around us. Originality/value – Through this way, the seemingly merely descriptive inquiries of the kind Wittgenstein advocates can be applied, for example, in making sense of knowledge creation and innovation in organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Philosophical concepts; Qualitative methods; Research",""

The logical approach has been emphasised in the English rhetorical tradition while both qing (emotional approach) and li (logical approach) are the focus of persuasion in the Chinese tradition.

Chronologically 20 to 59 year old respondents’ inner-age satisfaction was gauged as the average difference between feel, look, do, and interest cognitive (self-perceived) and desired (ideal) inner-age dimensions. Analyses of covariance (with chronological age factored out) across the four nations showed Nigeria to differ significantly in terms of inner-age satisfaction from each Asian population, contrary to the Asian societies where no differences were found across samples (except between Korea and India where inner-age satisfaction differed at a p.05). High levels of satisfaction with inner-age (coming about when cognitive and desired ages are equal) commonly transpired: 31.4 per cent of Indian, 36.9 per cent of Nigerian, 44.3 per cent of Chinese, and 44.9 per cent of Korean respondents. Age dissatisfaction in an elder direction (ideal age older than self-perceived age) was atypical and happened most often among Nigerian (23.4 per cent) and least among Korean subjects (10.7 per cent). In contrast, wishing for a younger innerage was a commonplace phenomenon in India (50.6 per cent of the sample), as well as in China where it occurred the least (36.6 per cent).

H5N1 mutates quickly and tends to pick up genes from flu viruses that affect other species. The flu is far more contagious and harder to contain than the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus.

How well did de facto Country and Corporate CTOs perform in Survival-Driven anticipating of Technology? We examined the record of 5 Country Applications and 12 Corporate Applications in Chapters 1 and 2. Under the actual threat of annihilation, how does one anticipate technological discontinuities indispensable for country/corporate survival? is the question we explored in 9 Country Applications and 5 Corporate Applications in Chapter 3. From anticipating discontinuities in technology in Ch. 3, we turn to anticipating discontinuities in territory in Ch.4. How utterly easy it is to miss the most significant technological-cumterritorial developments rights under one’s very nose is illustrated by Bill Gates writing the Internet off in 1995, only turning 1800around to make it the centerpiece of Microsoft strategy in 1996. He focused on the technology and its inadequacies, which led him to misread the territory (market) for Internet. When the “Truth” is that there is a $100 million (or $100 billion) market for the particular “product/ service,” and one falsely denies that “Truth” and does not invest in the [Internet] territory, one loses potential profit. On the other hand, when the “Truth” is that there is no market for the “product/service,” and one falsely accepts the falsehood that these is an adequate market, and invests in the [Internet] territory, one loses present capital. The worse of the two consequences determines Type I error, which one wants to make as infrequently as possible (say, 1 in 100 times, or 1 in 20 times, etc). What technology should we invest in most to reduce Type I error? Is it the technology that would facilitate Raw Data Retrieval; Refined Data Retrieval; or Interaction Insight? It depends on which generates proportionally higher returns in two areas: (1) Consumer Use, and (2) Corporate Use. To know what kind of IT technology we need to anticipate, we need to know its territory (market). Consumer expenditures drive two-thirds of US GNP. Thus, the primary concern of the consumer is consumption: grocery, clothing, etc., bought mostly from retail outlets. The largest single item of expenditure for most consumers is the mortgage on their homes; and the second most expensive item is the car. We will discuss in Ch. 4 Territory-driven anticipating of Technology-Consumer Use comprising: (1) Consumer-Retailing, (12) Consumer-Mortgaging, and (13) Consumer-auto purchasing.

The new democracy chose non-alignment, installed a large national government and legislated protectionist policies, which kept out most foreign products that almost led to economic isolation. The political leaders believed that protectionism would make India self-reliant and eventually improve the standard of living especially for the poorer Indians. While other Asian countries were encouraging foreign capital and multinationals, India was doing its best to keep them out (Business Asia, 2000). Although India moved towards self-reliance, the lack of competition hindered the country's own economic and technological developments. As a result the market was forced to accept local products that were often inferior or old-fashioned. For example, until recently the leading car on India's road was “Ambassador”, a reproduction of a British design from the early 1950s that was bulky and a gas-guzzler. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","India; Political independence; Westernisation",""

The exploratory analysis suggests a positive relationship between market segmentation and performance. Differentiation and market orientation do not seem to be significantly associated with improved performance, although cross-functional customer focus shows a significant relationship. Further discriminant analysis of the significant predictor variables suggests that two variables, viz. market segmentation and positioning, and cross-functional customer focus are useful in differentiating between high and low performers.

In this article a specific case of interrelation between the uses of IT at the third party logistics service providers (3PLs) in Singapore is highlighted. Information collected through a randomly selected sample of 3PLs indicates that more and more service providers are either planning to incorporate IT in their operations or are benefiting from their use. Towards this end, the providers are acquiring new knowledge, skills and technologies. The survey results showed that respondents are also concerned about their investments in IT as they feel that with rapidly changing technology, their equipment, skill and processes could become obsolete before any tangible benefits could be derived from them. The providers indicate that financial justification is another key barrier to full-scale IT implementation. These constraints hinder the implementation of strategic IT projects, which require significant investments. Therefore, a package program for skill development and equipment incentive could be initiated for 3PLs in Singapore. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Information technology; Logistics service providers; Third party logistics",""

However, leading academics conclude that strategy is “elusive” and “complex”. The purpose of this paper is to unravel strategy’s elusiveness and unpack its complexity through empirical hermeneutic investigation. Design/methodology/approach – Strauss’ grounded theory is used to investigate leisure and cultural managers’ understanding of strategy-making. Data were collected through multiple interviews with senior managers of a local authority, and the organisations strategy documents were examined. The grounded theory’s transferability to organisations in, and outside, public leisure and culture was provisionally tested. Findings – It was found that in making strategy, managers engage in purposeful, complex processes, here termed “navigational translation” which have mutually impacting relationships with organisational resources, the environment and managers’ character, explaining its complexity and elusiveness. The provisional testing of navigational translation’s transferability suggests that it has scope beyond public sector leisure and cultural strategy. Research limitations/implications – As this research focused on theory generation, a main limitation is its small-scale testing of navigational translation’s transferability. Future research could test transferability with more organisations in leisure, culture and other fields. Practical implications – This explanation provides a robust understanding of strategy that could improve practice. It empowers managers so that they are no longer subjugated to unrealisable expectations that rationalistic strategy tools will work in a complex world. Originality/value – Navigational translation offers a richer, practitioner-oriented understanding of strategy, which utilises leading academic explanations from the various, competing and divergent strategy schools into a pragmatic, multiparadigmatic framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate strategy; Management strategy",""

The main elements of the model are as follows: cost, time, distance, transport mode and intermodal transfer. The model is tested using real data over a series of alternative routes between Marseilles and Vientiane. The selection of appropriate international logistics system will have a direct impact on the efficiency of Lao PDR import channels.

We will now develop Steps #9-12, using 6 Corporate Applications and 3 Country Applications. MOTEP Step #9 specifies the twin conditions necessary for accountability. The decision-maker has to be “High Enough,” and “Hurt Enough” to be truly accountable.Watson, being Chairman and CEO, was high enough.We see that he “hurt enough” because he was forever seeking his father’s approval. He was most remorseful for forcing younger brother Dick into a horse race with other executives in the arena of System/360 for the top post, which he says was the “worst business and family mistake I ever made.” System/360 was the “biggest, riskiest decision”Watson says he ever made. Not being a technologist, how did he decide to “bet the company” on integrated chips (IC) which were an emerging technology? Again, how did Churchill, someone “who knew nothing of science,” commit the entire defense of Great Britain to a technology which was a “pipe dream” of British scientists? An imperative qualification is MOTEP Step #10: Trusted Technology Advisor Deciphering the signals from the experts. President Truman had a plaque on his desk which read:” The Buck stops here.” Since Churchill rewrote the entire defense of Great Britain on the advice of his de facto Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Lindemann, it would only be natural that if he had a plaque, it would declare a similar sentiment. When Dessauer found that the Copier A, into which Xerox sank so much of its sparse resources upon his recommendation, was a flop, he felt that Xerox could justifiably ask for his resignation. MOTEP Step #11 states the motto of the CTO: “The buck stops here.” TheCTOdeals in discontinuities, or to use our terminology, quantum jumps.With respect to superconductors, he would have had to wait for 75 years from the time superconductivity was discovered to find the first tentative quantum jump. All through the 75 years from 1911 through 1985, the increase in Transition Temperature, T, was at an annual average of 0.26676 K per year. Why would aCTOforecast a quantum jump of 56-fold increase in 1986, followed by a 337-fold increase in 1987? 63 Nevertheless, it is the bounded duty of the CTO to see beyond others. His focus should steadily be on the substantive questions, so that the habitually prepared mind can jump at the answer. Hence MOTEP Step #12: CTO Substantively Forecast Discontinuities.","",""

Analyses of data suggested that Hong Kong clothing manufacturers are increasingly integrating forwardly by utilizing foreign based channel intermediaries, as well as establishing internalized export departments and overseas sales offices to handle their export functions. In addition, a dominant trend of horizontal integration exists in the form of expansion of outward processing facilities in southern China. Such developments aim to take advantage of the lower cost production so as to remain competitive with low cost producers from other less developed/developing countries. © Emerald Backfiles 2007 1995, MCB UP Ltd","",""

Formulates hypotheses, based on the earlier research, that children will receive spending money by the time they are four, that the amount will increase as they get older, children will spend money by the age of four, they will also save money, older children will visit more shops than younger children, and children will go shopping without parents by the age of four. Outlines the research methodology used – 318 questionnaires used for analysis, composition of the sample of respondents, demographics – and records how analysis of variance was used to make comparisons with data from the earlier study. Considers income, spending and saving attitudes in children, as well as how they spend and what they buy. Finds that, in 1994 (compared to 1989) children aged 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 receive more money; 4, 7 and 10 year olds spend a higher percent of their income, saving has decreased for 4, 7 and 10 year olds, children's real income has doubled since 1989, independent shopping trips seem to have been postponed until the child is 6 but co-shopping with parents has increased for all ages; most shopping trips without parents focused on food stores and street vendors that were easily accessible from home, but purchasing behaviour has not changed significantly. Indicates that Hong Kong children are pursuing a western (US) model of spending income, rather than the Chinese model of saving, and that children are undergoing consumer socialization and consumer education – as evidenced by the single fact that in 1994 $161.8 million was spent in Hong Kong by children aged 412. © 1998, MCB UP Limited","Children; Consumer behaviour; Hong Kong",""

Its major competitor continues to be the USA, while its three top European rivals: Germany, France and Italy - in combination - have consistently outperformed Japan. Significantly, Japan remains the single largest recipient of US pharmaceutical exports with a surplus over imports of more than $500 billion. Discusses various findings based on survey results within Japan's market structure. Posits that the US experience shows that successfully operating on the Japanese market requires considerable preparation, especially in the areas of distribution and promotion.

Following a review of the literature, this paper discusses the experts' opinions of the role of self-service technologies and human bank staff in New Zealand retail banking to the years 2000 and 2010. These opinions were identified through a Delphi study held with leading executives from various sectors of the economy. The research indicated that in the future utilisation of home banking by television will be limited to a specific and small market segment. Home banking by personal computer will be relatively more widespread, although it is unlikely to be used by more than twenty per cent of the banking population. Home banking by automated telephone service will be more widespread still, yet acceptance is unlikely to be greater than thirty per cent of the banking population. ‘Staffless branches’ (which are staffed predominately by self-service technology) will be available in all main city centres before the turn of the century. Automatic Telling Machines (ATMs) will be the most utilised self-service technology in the future. Due to the increased use of self-service technologies, especially ATMs, the use of human bank tellers will gradually fall over the next twenty years. As a result, human bank tellers will be freed-up from normal transactional duties, and will become more involved in customer service and selling. © 1993, MCB UP Limited. All rights reserved.","",""

No matter when BNT arrives, there is a fundamental question that has to be raised and answered, which is the theme of this chapter: the UTILIZATION of the exploding multimedia content of the Information Superskyway. How will people USE 1,000 times the current content, arriving 1,000 times as fast? We discuss nine imperative issues of utilization. (1) Use of Content on the Information Superskyway. More than 20 years before IT became a household word, the US National Science Foundation issued a Request for Proposal entitled: “Systems Approach to Evaluate the Use of Science and Technology Information in the Electronic Alternative to Paper-based Communication.” The same approach is germane toward the use of the entire IT content today. (2) Use of IT Data in Corporate Decision-Making. In 1972, IBM headquarters removed the computer consoles placed next to the desk of senior executives because the computers were hardly used in two years. How can nonuse be avoided? (3) Networks obsoleting skills, structure. The fusion of computers and communications empowers all the workers to form, dissolve, and re-form networks based on their relative competitiveness. With the ability to source globally, virtual corporations can be formed, dissolved, and re-formed based on their competitiveness and credibility. (4) Significant resource commitment to unproven technology. With the very survival of Great Britain at stake, the non-specialist Churchill had to lay all the technology eggs in the single basket called the “radar,” trusting that “the promises made by our scientists for the still unproven radar would be kept.” It would remain unproven for four years yet. (5) Sensitivity of significant resource commitment to technology forecast. Far more tenuous than the “promises for radar” was Einstein's opinion that nuclear-energy could be released. Roosevelt launched the atomic bomb project on that opinion. Had he sought a second opinion from an eminent physicist like Niels Bohr, he would have questioned Einstein's opinion as scientific arm-waving. (6) Sensitivity of significant resource commitment to technology-generated market forecast. Churchill's reliance on Lindemann for technology advice is echoed in IBM CEO Watson's reliance on Birkenstock. In 1948, the latter encouraged the former to stand up against Watson, Sr. and abandon punch cards for magnetic tape. In 1956, he persuaded Watson, Jr. to negotiate with Texas Instruments to cut down the price of IC to $1.50, making it economically feasible to use IC in System/360. (7) Protection of Primogeniture of Ideas on the Internet. In order not to inhibit the inventor from collaborative interactions, the paternity of seminal ideas has to be unambiguously established when interactive exchanges are instantaneous, as on the Internet. (8) Inter-disciplinary (synergistic) linguistics. The prerequisite to any inter-disciplinary communication is the ability of each to understand one language in addition to one's own discipline. A truly inter-disciplinary language would enable those in different disciplines to communicate with everyone else, enabling synergy to be generated. (8) Putting the Content in the Context. The explosion of instantaneous data racing thousand times as fast as at present is sand without substance, unless the symbols written in sand are given substance by the context of the decision-maker. The data should be ordered and processed to answer questions of the type: Must I expand the external boundaries; if so, in which direction? Must I expand the internal boundaries; if so, in which direction. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

Bill Gates puts the date of the Information Superskyway (as we prefer to call it) at least a decade away; and Michael Dertouzos, Director of MIT Computer Science Laboratory since 1974, deplores the decade that will be wasted. What are the Technology, Demand, and Supply Issues that drive/delay the Highway/Sky-way? Technology Issue 1: Hardly anybody is working on Shared Conventions for interconnected machines to work together. Dertouzos warns: Major players of the 1990s who keep extolling fiber optics, real-time video, virtual reality, multimedia, and electronic commerce will discover that none of these awesome stuff will be useful unless computers and software at diverse sites can “understand” one another. Supply Issue 1: Dertouzos' war of spiders is one in which 3C industry members each offer the customer a car to drive on the Highway so long as he(she) never drives another car or wheeled vehicle. Supply Issue 2: Dertouzos declares: “There is no true information infrastructure anywhere in the world today.” Everybody is busy putting up toll booths, but nobody is putting up the highway. Demand Issue 1: Europeans declare “Good roads create traffic.” Video on demand is too small to justify the massive investment necessary to connect just the US homes to the broadband network. Europeans urge the Economic Community to remove IT barriers. Demand Issue 2: American and European experts concur that customer and business applications are the driver. This concurrent emphasis on applications confirms the USE-orientation: What do you USE the high-speed, high-capacity switched network for? which we raised as Issue 1 in Chapter 6. Demand Issue 3: In his keynote address to the Harvard Conference on Internet and Society, Intel Vice President McGeady blasted Digital Pundits (Al Gore, Nicholas Negroponte) for taking us down the wrong path of interactive television which would simply subject us to an avalanche of advertising… They all failed to realize that the information reformation is about personal information, not about the same old stuff turned into bits and delivered to your doorstep in a slightly new way.

Surprisingly, small nonlicensee firms are found to scan international technology developments more than their licensee counterparts. In addition, whereas nonlicensee firms have higher perceptions of the costs of technology licensing than licensees, paradoxically they also appear to have higher perceived benefits than licensees.

If we are today in the propeller airplane stage, Broadband Network Technology (BNT) is beyond Supersonic Concorde, to reach which we need to traverse through [1] turbo-prop technology, [2] jet engine technology, [3] 747-technology, [4]jumbo jet technology, and [5] supersonic technology to [6] supersonic+ technology. Information Superskyway should result in what Dertouzos, Director of MIT Computer Science Labatory, calls Information Marketplace: “the collection of people, computers, communications, software and services that will be engaged in the intraorganizational and interpersonal informational transactions of the future.” 3C firms jockey for position on the Information Superskyway. While they offer better access to the Internet, they also seek to restrict the access to products and services they control. Dertouzos says that all companies shoud cooperate with their competitors to build a shared information infrastructure, so that they can compete. It echoes our own definition of Concomitant Coalition: association of one party(ies) with and against the same party(ies) in the same game or activity. We discuss three CONCOLs: [1] Microsoft-Netscape working together and in competition, as Bill Gates puts it, to define standards that will help overcome the Internet's limitations. They compete on supplying components of the software platform for interactive networks; but they cooperate in developing an industry standard, no matter whose components finally get accepted. [2] Sun-NCR-Intel working together against Microsoft which is pushing its Windows NT as a substitute for Sun's Unix operating system. [3] Intel-SAP working together against Microsoft, IBM on business management software. Pandesic, the 50-50 joint venture between Intel (whose chips control the basic functions of 80 percent of the world's PCs), and Germany-based SAP (the world's biggest publisher of business management software), will provide on-line merchants the necessary hard-and-software, to tap into the projected US$234 billion economy on the Internet by the year 2002. We saw in Chapter 4 that the main players in 3C industries are racing each other on their own pathways to the Information Superskyway. In this chapter we find 3C firms entering into CONCOLs to tap into the rich bounty on the Internet. However, Dertouzos warns that none of the awesome powers of fiber optics, real-time video, virtual reality, multimedia, and electronic commerce would be realized unless computers and software at diverse sites can “understand” one another. But he says: “Hardly anyone today is paying attention to shared conventions that will allow interconnected machines to understand and work with each other without the constant intervention of a human being. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

But there is an inherent conflict in techtransfer. The transferee is with the transferor on technology, but against on trade. Without a definition of techtransfer, protagonists can argue that Malaysia receives excellent techtransfer, while detractors can argue, with equal justification, exactly the opposite. Therefore we need a proper definition of techtransfer: Duplicating on a self-sustained basis, a foreign process of multiplying manyfold, the output/input ratio in converting physical/mental, matter/energy inputs into directly useable output(s). To assess the role of techtransfer in Malaysian development, it would be instructive to learn from possibly another Developing Asian country with comparable population, size, stability, and geographic location. Since Taiwan enjoyed the current per capita GDP of Malaysia ten years ago, Taiwan techtransfer experience ten years ago would be an instructive parallel for Malaysia today. Since trade is 94.8% of Taiwan GDP, the three leading export industries of Taiwan were chosen-electric and electronic; textiles, and plastic industries. A sample of eight Taiwanese firms from these industries was selected; so also two multinationals with long-standing ties with Taiwan. The top management was interviewed in depth on techtransfer as defined above. Six elements of progress and six problems were identified in techtransfer in the mid-80s. The elements of progress were: (1) Higher-value manufacture, (2) Spawning of competitive companies, (3) Overseas hitech training, (4) Learning to operate hitech machinery, (5) Indirect acquisition of Know-Why, and (6) Hitech contacts within the multinationals. The problems were: (1) Manufacturing segmentation, (2) Segmented technical assistance, (3) Overseas manufacture of critical components, (4) Short-run improvements, (5) Inability to innovate, and (6) Ignored marketing. One of the self-preservation techniques of the hitech transferor is to provide the glitter and not the gold. If the hitech transferor can make the transferee believe that hitech is transferred in substance while only doing so in form, that would help preserve the former's territory (market) without jeopardizing technology. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

Customized hitech products (PS: Performance-Specific products) are first demanded in small quantities in Country XYZ. In a few months, as demand increases, the PS products will be offered as PG (Performance- General) products of mass manufacture in Countries LMN, PQR, etc. The PSPG Ratio calibrates CC. To achieve CC, Malaysia has to decide whether, emulating the experience of developed countries, the share of manufacturing in GDP should be 30%, instead of the 38.4% projected for the year 2005. Similarly, Malaysia has to decide whether the Services Sector should be 48.4% of GDP as it is projected to be in the year 2005. Even Don Tapscott who swears by the inexorable convergence of what we have called 3C (computer, communication, content) industries, says that Services are not the source of income: “The planet, and even the Western World, still relies on agricultural and industrial production for the creation of wealth and the meeting of basic human needs. You can't eat or live on information.” If nearly half of Malaysian GDP is going to be not the means of production, but the means of consumption, it behooves us to find a viable means of production. We examine Information Technology (IT) as a candidate means of production. IT Industry is half Products and half Services. What should be the nature and magnitude of Malaysian IT products? If we keep the manufacturing share of GDP at the norm of 30% experienced by developed countries, that would release 8.4 percentage points of GDP from the current projection for the year 2005. Similarly, if we reduce the GDP share of Malaysian Services Sector to 40%, that would release another 8.4 percentage points. If we assign the former to IT Products, and the latter to IT Services, each should have a value of RM 36.2076 million in current prices in the year 2005. The RM 36.207 million in IT Products should generate RM 128.4 billion in IT exports in the year 2005, or each RM worth of IT products should generate RM 3.55 in exports. If domestic consumption is to be a third as much as the exports, each RM of IT products should generate RM 1.18 for domestic consumption. Each RM of IT should thus produce (3.55 + 1.18=) RM 4.73 for exports and domestic consumption. IT is also expected to be the engine of development. Based on the growth of GDP between 1995 and 2005 in the IMP2, the IT Sector should generate 50 sens in the rest of the economy for each RM of IT. Thus, each RM in IT Products should generate (4.73 + 0.50=( RM 5.23 (rounded to RM 5.00) in the year 2005. We are talking of new machine-producing (cloning) IT machines worth 60% of 1995 Malaysian exports of semi-conductors, computers/peripherals, and consumer electronics as the necessary stock of IT capital in the year 2005, each unit of which is to produce five times its value in output in the year, for a start. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""
"Chapter 9 IT Technology Transfer: Corporate and Country Empirical Experience - UMI, Taipower, Samsung; Taiwan, Korea, Singapore","1997","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931088614&doi=10.1108%2feb010286&partnerID=40&md5=ff02cf2c26854a9128c6714ac7988d14","The glitter of techtransfer agreements often tends to be a camouflage and the number of trainees is no substitute for genuine techtransfer: the self-sustained duplication of foreign technology. We study techtransfer in Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore to develop the ethos of successful IT techtransfer. (1) Taiwan: In 1976 a US technology company, RCA, transferred CMOS technology which is foundational to semiconductors, not to a private company in Taiwan, but a public government agency. RCA could not trust Taiwan to honor Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) because of its piracy image. At home, RCA was accustomed to America's respect of its public institutions to do the honorable thing. So, RCA opted for a private-to-public techtransfer. Even after 16 years, another private company would not trust Taiwan private sector; General Physics of Columbia, Maryland, would transfer nuclear reactor simulation technology not to a private company, but to a government support organization, Institute for Information Industry. (2) South Korea: In the mid-60s, US firms (Motorola, Signetics, Fairchild) began to assemble chips, followed by Japanese firms and 27 Japanese-Korean Joint ventures (Samsung-Sanyo; Crown Radio; Toshiba and Goldstar-Alps Electronics). In 1975, Samsung acquired the only locally-owned chip company (Korea Semiconductor) which manu-factured CMOS chips for watches. (We recall that Taiwan imported CMOS technology from RCA in 1976). During 1983–84 Samsung ac-quired DRAM technology and the ethnic Korean and Chinese employees succeeded in producing 64 and 256 k-bit chips. CEO Lee took significant risks, time and again, to let Samsung join the race to design and manufacture successive generations of semiconductor technology. Much of the cumulative US$800 million investment in semiconductors was recouped in 1987 with the market upturn, and higher prices for 256 k-bit chips. From 1989 onwards, Samsung pushed ahead to achieve design leadership by aggressively involving engineers in all phases of technology transfer and application, as well as by forging new joint ventures with foreign industry leaders which gave Samsung a more dominant role. 3. Singapore: Contrary to the leapfrogging advanced in the litera-ture since 1982, suggesting that NICs leap over technology generations, Singapore electronics industry supports a model of incremental learning under which TNCs [Trans-National Corporations] transferred technology gradually. Much of the advance was in pre-electronic activities such as mechanical, electro-mechanical and precision engineering, rather than in software or R&D, as would be expected under leapfrogging. As the subsidiaries advanced technologically, they formed forward links with customers, and backward links with local suppliers of capital goods. The government built up the appropriate infrastructure. We develop three Desiderata (desired conditions) for techtransfer: (1) A Pre-determined Sequence of Technology by Type and Level, (2) A Pre-determined Sequence of Intellectual Property Rights Protection, and (3) A Pre-determined Sequence of Upgrading of Transferee's Technical Skills. Why should the transferor engage in any techtransfer? Because leading US corporations use only about 5 percent of their process inventions (Rank 100, 99,…,96) to improve/invent products. To protect the market of these five products, process inventions with Ranks 95, 94,…, 1 have to be denied to competition; they have to be literally locked up. If any NIC is at technology level say, 15, techtransfer of technology level 45 would instantaneously increase the transferee's technology level by (45–15÷15 =) 200% with no risks of R&D, no investment in facilities, no investment in personnel. That transfer would not threaten the transferor's latest products embodying Ranks 100, 99,…, 96. However, it would threaten the transferor's products embodying Rank 45. New technology leadtime is 6–18 months. If the transferee stays out of the main markets of the transferor (e.g. USA, Europe) for that leadtime, the transferee can sell in say, Asia and the Middle East, Africa and Australia. The transferee could offer the transferor two types of revenue: (1) licensing fee which is usually about 1–3% of gross revenue generated from products which could not have been produced without the transferred technology; and (2) 1% of revenue from new markets created by the technology. If the transferee observes the letter and the spirit of techtransfer for six months, a higher level technology, say level 60 could be transferred, instantly raising the transferee's technology level by (60–15÷15 =) 300%. This pre-determined sequence of techtransfer is a win-win situation. The transferor receives revenue from what is currently frozen assets; the transferee systematically raises its level of technology by 200%, 300%, etc. without having to risk a single dollar on uncertain R&D. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

Second, FDI appears to shift from the primary sector into the manufacturing and tertiary sectors of the economy as economies grow further. Thus, future FDI in APEC economies will likely be relatively higher in the tertiary sector as the poorer members of APEC continue to grow.

Public statements by the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that the two necessary conditions are virtually absent, making it necessary for CC to be achieved in other ways. To provide a macro-perspective, we identify numerical measures of importance of Electrical & Electronic (E&E) [Industry] to the nation. E&E, the single largest foreign exchange earner, earned 66.0 percent of the export earnings from manufactured goods in 1995. Electronic components earned 42.86 percent, consumer electronics 25.9, and industrial electronics 31.95 percent of E&E exports in 1995. To improve CC, the 1995 share of global exports of semiconductors (9.7%) and consumer electronics (27.9%) should be enhanced. E&E should increase its share of the major markets: Asia, USA, and Europe. We develop three original measures of Export Productivity: (1) per unit of Capital Investment, (2) per unit of Import Input, and (3) per unit of Raw Material Input. Where should capital investment be made to boost E&E exports? In consumer electronics which yield 2.95 times as much exports share as electronic components; and in industrial electronics with a yield of 2.35 times. In 1995, E&E output was RM 71 million, but exports were RM 85 million. We attribute to the Assembly Technology contribution of Multi-national Corporations (MNCs) the majority, if not all, of the RM 14 billion. Southeast Asia's first fully integrated silicon manufacturing facility, expected to start production in Malaysia in 1998, is estimated to increase the value-added from the current 8% for Assembly to 35% for Fabrication. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

Each is an integral component of both specialist texts on new product development (Crawford, 1997; Urban and Hauser, 1993; Hisrich and Peters, 1991; Kuczmarski, 1992) and generalist texts (Kotler, 1996; Stanton et al, 1994; McColl-Kennedy et al, 1994; Kotler et al, 1994; McCarthy and Perrault, 1990). In the specialist texts, the new product development process can vary. For example, Crawford and Kuczmarski emphasise the contextualisation of the new product development process within a broader and preceding strategic or marketing planning emphasis than does Urban and Hauser. At the same time, some generalist work such as Kotler, McColl-Kennedy et al, and Zikmund and d'Amico (1993) place decidely more emphasis on establishing a difference between the idea screening and product development stages. Nevertheless, the specialist texts concur on the general procedure being a linear one that involves eleven key stages. This is discussed in more detail in section 3.6. © 1996, MCB UP Limited","",""

Results of the first study found that certain letters and numbers were considered to be luckier than others. The lucky letters and numbers were A, S, and 8, while the unlucky ones were F, Z, and 4. Reasons for the perceived luckiness of the numbers were based on homonym and phonetics; whilst for the letters, they were based on the association with the educational grade and position in the alphabet. In the second study, the results showed that products with lucky alpha-numeric brand names were perceived to be luckier, and have better quality and success than those with unlucky brand names. Additionally, brand names with a lucky number were perceived more favourably than those with a lucky letter even though the accompanying letter/number was unlucky.

To fulfill this central role, what should be the value of IT Products and IT Services? We have computed the necessary capital stock of IT Products at RM21.556 billion in 1978 prices, each unit of which is to produce five times its value in output in the year 2005, for a start. The targeted output of IT Services would be another RM 21.556 billion in 1978 prices, for a total of RM43.112 billion for IT industry in 2005. Bill Gates, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation, holds that Broadband Network Technology (BNT) indispensable to implement the Information Highway would not be available to most US homes for at least a decade. No matter when BNT arrives, an overriding question is: what will be the UTILIZATION of the exploding multimedia content of the Information Superskyway. How will people USE 1,000 times the current content, arriving 1,000 times as fast? The raison d'etre of the Information Superskyway is the Matrix of Learning, with Content as the rows, Context as the columns, and Learning as the Cells. The user has to identify his (her) context of use (entertain-ment, education, enlightenment, edification). Investment in input (con-tent) will depend on the answer to the question: By how much will the context be impaired by delay or deficiency of the content (data)? As the capacity of chips increases exponentially, the price drops dramatically — already it is down to $0.14 per megabyte! In the future, a holographic memory of the size of one's fists could hold the contents of the entire Library of Congress. With fast and furious developments in transfer and transformation of multi-media content, how should one go about investing in IT to reap the bounty of BNT? We have no guarantee of success; we can increase the probability of success in the long-run using seven IT investment Considerations/Criteria: (1) Choose the “Long-run” that is realistic: Consider the odds against surviving one year, let alone 10 years; and choose wisely. (2) Choose Your Segment of the IT Industry: Are you most competent in: communications, computers, or content industries? What is your primary product: information, education, enlightenment, shopping, or e-mail? (3) Choose Your CONCOL competitor/collaborator in the IT Industry: No matter how powerful you are in your chosen segment of the industry, it is almost mandatory that you collaborate with some other(s) in your own industry, and/or in another of the C3 industries. Bill Gates says: “companies must be able to partner on some projects and compete vigorously in others. Few companies in the computer and communications industries are purely friends or purely foes.” (4) Choose the Technology/Territory Area for CONCOL: How will the CONCOLs be formed and dissolved-in: (1) Technology, (2) Territory? The choice of future technology would depend on the territory: How long would it take for the particular technology to develop a mass market? In IT parlance, should we back advances in: (I) transfer of data, or (2) transformation of data? (5) Choose the Technology Transformation Profile: Visualizing technology say, five generations ahead would indeed be quite hard and hazardous. But we would choose linear extensions of performance characteristics over Quantum jumps. However, PC industry experience suggests that each successive computer generation tended to provide Quantum jumps, little of the earlier models being useable with the new generation. (6) Choose the Technology Transfer Sequence: By establishing a relationship with the techtransferor over the long-term, and scrupulously observing the mutually-agreed conditions of techtransfer, the transferee can steadily increase its technical competence. (7) Fiercely Focus on the UTILIZATION of the Exploding Multime-dia Content: To make IT win in the marketplace, the mere increase in the volume of content or the mere increase in the speed of its transmission is quite inadequate. What will make the difference is the learning that is made possible by the multimedia content and communication. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

The findings suggest that marketers believe some stakeholders with “high” influencing abilities should be involved in the green NPD process, although it appears that in practice, firms use very basic methods to include these stakeholders. It also appears that there is limited formal interaction between the firm and its stakeholders and that respondents are not engaging and learning from others with green product expertise. © 1998, MCB UP Limited","Cross-cultural studies; Green marketing; Learning organizations; New product development",""

During the same time Japan has become one of the world's largest providers of FDI. Japan's share of total FDI outflows increased from about 6 percent during the late 70's to 21 percent in 1990 while its share of the total stock of FDI in the world increased from less than 1 percent in 1960 to more than 13 percent in 1993. Not surprisingly, Japan's role in international business in general and its FDI activities, in particular, have attracted considerable attention from researchers world wide. However, much of this attention has been directed towards the patterns and determinants of Japanese foreign direct investment, in particular to the United States. The impact of changes in the value of the Yen on Japanese FDI has been largely overlooked. Thus, this paper fills an important gap in the literature by focusing on the influence of changes of the exchange rate on Japanese foreign direct investment. A comprehensive simultaneous equa-tion model of Japanese FDI is developed on a regional level to gauge the extent to which currency fluctuations affect Japanese FDI activities. The results suggest that the exchange rate is an effective mechanism through which to influence FDI.

A survey of there perceptions and strategies indicates that while they believe there is no shortage of opportunities and no insurmountable market barriers in the region, it is important to have a well conceived marketing plan and be realistic in the expectations. On the whole, they are satisfied with their experience. Hopefully, this will induce more Canadian industrial companies to explore the Pacific Asia market and in turn help to realize Canada's potential in the region. © 1993, MCB UP Limited.

Finds that the USA has the greatest number of franchisors and franchisees, Japan seems to have a different franchise structure when compared to the other countries studied, and Israel is a franchising novice. Presents a number of tables, accompanied by notes of caution on analysing the statistics. Mentions briefly some examples of franchises. Refers the findings back to the literature review to assess how well they match the theoretical descriptions of innovation diffusion. Discusses some elements of franchising, looking at innovation and replication, maturity, collectivism versus individualism, juridical issues and educational differences.

Observes an interaction between direction of social comparison and respondents’ gender that was considerably different in nature from that of Canadians. Suggests that Canadians had a stronger desire for more and better possessions, willingness to strive for more possessions, together with a high degree of how possessions contribute to self-image. © 2001, MCB UP Limited","Canada; Japan; Materiality; Social economics",""

"Chapter 1 Theory of Continuous Competitiveness: Corporate and Country Empirical Experience-IBM System/360; Japan, Korea, Taiwan","1997","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931086442&doi=10.1108%2feb010278&partnerID=40&md5=d755cbff3558d59f9f3e6ca40bc5fab7","In the era of dramatic developments in technology worldwide, the relative competitiveness of a corporation/country over time has to be continuously calibrated and pro-actively protected. Here, for the first time, we develop two sufficient conditions, and 12 necessary conditions of continuous competitiveness (CC): the ratio of value-added per unit of currency of OUR product (service) to THEIR product (service). In Chapter 1, we apply CC to three corporations (IBM, CEC, API) and to three countries (Japan, Taiwan, Korea). At a time when IBM enjoyed 80 percent of the market, it decided to commit 83 percent of the next four years' TOTAL SALES to build a new generation of computers on the unproven technology of integrated circuits to assure IBM's continuous competitiveness. To the same end, Japan pro-actively selected the growth industry of each decade beginning in the '50s (computers), and nurtured it, taxing other industries. The first year in which the US trade with the Pacific exceeded that of the Atlantic, 1982, is the benchmark of a study of competitiveness of two countries of comparable population and exports, Korea and Taiwan. If Taiwan exports rose in volume but lost in profitability, Taiwan needs to make better products cheaper and faster. If the required technology advances are not fully available domestically, they need to be imported: Which is the rationale of technology transfer (techtransfer). Techtransfer can meet one of the necessary conditions of CC, viz., the desired technological progression-from linear extensions of performance characteristics along the same curve, to quantum jumps from one technology curve to another. The techtransfer over two decades from IBM-Taiwan to Taiwan Manufacturers as a whole progressed from components to complete product: Which could be considered at best as linear extensions of performance characteristics. For a country like Taiwan, whose trade (i.e. exports + imports) is as much as 94.8% of GNP, and which does not have a highly developed R&D base, techtransfer is a prime means of upgrading the technology. We will examine two Taiwan corporations which expanded exports through techtransfer: one, a Taiwan components manufacturer; and two, a Taiwan power supply manufacturer. As vendors to IBM, they aggressively pursued techtransfer from IBM. These empirical applications set the stage to examine Malaysian experience of E&E in Chapter 2. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

Where one of the most knowledgeable authorities on Information Technology (IT) fears to tread, wordsmiths rush in. Don Tapscott, for one, affirms that the dominant economic sector in the Digital Economy is being created by three converging industries and that convergence is becoming the basis of all sectors. Convergence in mathematics is the progressive approach of a function to a pre-specified value(s). If a thousand coins are tossed, the number of heads in a single toss could vary from 0 head to 1,000 heads. If the coins are not loaded, the number of heads in each toss could be high or low, but in successive tosses, the fraction of heads will approach closer and closer to 0.5 (Converge( as n, the number of tosses, tends to infinity. Tapscott provides no measures of convergence — conceptual, theoretical, empirical, or operational — without which we would not know if convergence has indeed descended upon us; what is more, we have no idea if we are/are not progressing toward the consummation of convergence upon which Tapscott's Digital Economy is predicated. Even more damaging to the Tapscott thesis of “three converging industries … becoming the basis of all sectors” is the conspicuous absence of any movement toward convergence on the part of the leading firms in the three industries. On the contrary, we find that each of them is racing on its own Divergent path of high and higher tech. Both the CEOs of IBM and Microsoft believe that high-speed, high-bandwidth is the future; and both swear by the Internet. But they race toward the Information Super Highway in their own separate, individual tracks. Product and service differentiation are the rule of the day; not standardization. Open architecture is a distant dream. Turning from the giant of hardware (IBM) and of software (Microsoft) to the giant of communications (AT&T), what is the story of convergence? AT&T entered the field of computers under the MFJ [Modified Final Judgment] of 1982. It beat a decisive path of retreat from convergence five years later by breaking up on January 1, 1997, into three communications and computer companies. How can the 3Cs converge? Not by their own volition. It is clear from the strategies of IBM, Microsoft, and AT&T that each of them is racing on its own path of high and higher tech. There is little evidence of convergence by default. If we want to achieve convergence by design, we have to emulate Hannibal. Facing the European Alps with his army of elephants, Hannibal said: “I will either find a way or invent one.” We will have to invent an appropriate methodology of convergence. © 1997, MCB UP Limited","",""

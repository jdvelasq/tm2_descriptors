THE CURVILINEAR EFFECTS OF EMPOWERING LEADERSHIP ON PUBLIC EMPLOYEE’S WELL-BEING,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190473040&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.136bp&partnerID=40&md5=25c9cebe7ca0759418e38fc46e449843,"Leaders are encouraged to empower employees in recent public sector management reforms. However, it remains unclear whether the influence of empowering leadership on employee outcomes is linearly favorable. Grounded in the “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect and conservation of resources theory, we develop a model considering a potential curvilinear relationship between empowering leadership and public employees’ well-being. Using data from a multisource, time-lagged survey of 496 employees and their 97 supervisors from a prefecture-level city government in China, we find that (1) empowering leadership has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship with employee well-being; (2) perceived responsibility mediates this relationship; and (3) public service motivation moderates the curvilinear effect of perceived responsibility on employee well-being and the indirect effect of empowering leadership on employee well-being via perceived responsibility. Implications of these findings for public management research and practice are discussed. © 2023, Academy of Management.

AWAKENING TO ALGORITHMIC TRANSGRESSIONS: NON-USER DISCOVERY OF ALGORITHMIC DECISION MAKING,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190466477&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.17bp&partnerID=40&md5=830e3cd3686b0bb515f4fc2849f473bd,"Algorithmic decision-making has become increasingly prevalent in civil society, often without individuals' awareness that decisions targeting them are delegated to machines. There is a growing need to understand how non-users can begin to suspect that they have been targeted by an algorithm and how they can uncover the hidden nature associated with these systems. In resource-scarce environments, such as the public sector, tracing transgressions to the algorithm is crucial to protect social justice and public trust in institutions. Building on the work of von Krogh (2018), this research examines the emotional, abductive, and collective work associated with algorithmic discovery. © 2023, Academy of Management.

INTRODUCING THE SPACEJAM PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGY FOR BUSINESS ETHICS EDUCATION,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190481344&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.150bp&partnerID=40&md5=01b271e2634cd19494b02887aa5a938e,"Teaching business ethics and related soft skills in higher education is critical, but also challenging. This short paper introduces the SpaceJam pedagogical strategy that aims at developing empathic dispositions, a core soft skill that is known to support ethical decision-making and behavior in organizations. Located at the intersection of experiential learning and learning spaces, the SpaceJam pedagogical strategy involves mobilizing arts-based and service-learning experiential pedagogical approaches while situating learnings in multiple spaces. At the center of this strategy is the creation of an analytical, introspective, and artistic portfolio that provides a material anchor for students to make sense and take ownership of the learning done across spaces. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Using qualitative data, I investigate how job-seekers skilled through alternative resources without computer science credentials navigate the U.S. tech labor market. My analysis reveals two distinct job-seeking strategies. These strategies were distributed along existing social inequalities and generated stratified pathways. This study reveals a new mechanism of social inequalities: individual job-seekers’ contrasted perceptions of what a new labor market values unequally shape their labor market entry and thus, exacerbate social inequalities—even when skills-acquisition is open-access and credential barriers are removed. © 2023, Academy of Management.

HOW POLITICAL CONTEXT AFFECTS IMMIGRANTS’ SOCIAL CONTACT DYNAMICS AND MENTAL HEALTH AT WORK,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190467602&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.70bp&partnerID=40&md5=6ad606339ff0ccb55b8814758dafeb33,"International migration has been rising across the globe for decades, making the integration of immigrants into host societies a central challenge for many countries. Although the successful labor market integration of immigrants is considered a key boon to their economic independence and broader social integration, rising political polarization in many western societies with increasing far-right political support might put integration efforts at risk. Challenging core assumptions of intergroup contact theory (Pettigrew, 1998), we propose that strong community support for far-right political parties affects how immigrants are treated by their coworkers when entering a new workplace, thus undermining the potential benefits of social contact between immigrants and natives. Specifically, we propose that immigrants perceive negative social contact with their direct colleagues that increases over time when employed by a company located in a region with high far-right political support. Being confronted with a growing perception of negative contact will then take its toll on employees’ mental health, assessed by their emotional exhaustion at a later time point. We test and find support for our theoretical model in a unique dataset matching 481 trainees in Germany (tracked from day one of their traineeships over a period of 13 weeks) with data from the 2021 German federal election. © 2023, Academy of Management.

This is a fundamental question in strategy, especially in the context of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), where firms aim to do well financially as well as contribute to social and environmental goods. To understand this question, we develop a simulation model that compares the social and financial performance of five “CSR heuristics” used by firms to make CSR decisions. We show that these heuristics differ substantially in the social and financial performance they are likely to achieve even when the underlying preferences are similar. © 2023, Academy of Management.

EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATING HOW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS ADOPTION IMPACTS MERGERS AND SURVIVAL IN THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190472747&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.135bp&partnerID=40&md5=29305201c9281b0aca91f4a77c214c1c,"How does the adoption of enterprise information systems (EIS) affect M&A activity in large organizations? Prior scholarship suggests EIS dramatically increases the agility of the firms and facilitates streamlining the organization around competitive advantages. However, recognizing that EIS is costly, practical considerations would suggest that such systems would incentivize the merging of organizations to distribute fixed costs via economies of scale. We examine whether such systems contribute to the contraction or expansion of organizations by examining M&A activity in the US healthcare system after the adoption of electronic health records (EHR). In doing so, we investigate the effect of EHR adoption on both the survival of hospital systems and their acquisition decisions. Analysis of 699 mergers between 2007 and 2014 suggests that while EHR adoption significantly increases a hospital’s likelihood of survival, it also makes them less desirable acquisition targets. Thus, interested acquirers prefer to target non-EHR adopting hospitals, likely because of the challenges of re-integrating an established EIS. Secondary dyadic analysis shows that if there is a match between vendors of the EHR between the acquirer and acquiree, this increases the likelihood of merging; thus, acquirers prefer hospitals that have not digitized, unless they share vendors. © 2023, Academy of Management.

HOW INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS INFLUENCE VENTURE GROWTH: A FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH TUNISIAN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190478988&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.268bp&partnerID=40&md5=aa27f660960c5c350227bc22ca266e58,"Entrepreneurial training programmes promoting women’s entrepreneurship in low- and middle-income countries command significant global attention and concomitant resources. Despite this broad investment, many ventures in these contexts fail to grow. Prior research suggests that institutionalized patterns of behaviors, in part dictated by institutional logics, may cause this lack of growth. In the context of Tunisian female entrepreneurship, this research explores the effects of community and market logics on entrepreneurial growth outcomes. Using a field experiment, we demonstrate that institutional logics affect the growth aspirations of entrepreneurs through individual empowerment and emotional energy. This research has theoretical implications for institutional logics, entrepreneurial growth, and emotions literatures. Firstly, institutional logics affect entrepreneurial growth outcomes. Secondly, logics are processed by individuals through both cognitive (empowerment) and social (emotions) constructs and we contribute to knowledge of the integrated macro to micro psychological and social processes of institutional logics. Finally, cultural differences explain why logics do not have the expected effects we think they may in the promotion of Western neoliberal entrepreneurial training programs. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We integrate transactional stress theory with the social support literature to propose that gig workers (specifically crowd workers) engage in emotion-and problem-focused coping in reaction to daily gig work-specific demands by seeking social support on informal online platforms. Across two studies, we find that gig work-specific cognitive and emotional demands are positively related to emotional and instrumental support-seeking.

“NOW THE ARMY IS WHO I AM”: SOCIALIZING FOR IDENTITY FUSION IN FRENCH MILITARY CADETS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190471031&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.217bp&partnerID=40&md5=8dd107203345ef524796e0801bb2b7c0,"In this paper, we qualitatively investigate how an organization like the Army strategically employs a broad range of intensive socialization tactics to attain newcomer identity fusion (a visceral feeling of oneness with one’s group) while limiting the disadvantages normally associated with this approach (attrition and ambivalence). We use data collected from 71 longitudinal interviews conducted over two-years during initial three-month training periods with cadets, instructors, and staff members of an Army training camp, supplemented with observation data and archival data. We find that the Army and its instructors engage with cadets with the objective of altering their values (e.g. from individuality to collectiveness; from understanding to obeying), which commonly resulted in identity denial. To combat this outcome, instructors used a specific set of socialization tactics (e.g. extreme physical training; isolation; process standardization) to help newcomers limit their time spent on self-reflection and to instead encourage them to experience identity revealing (i.e. becoming the best version of themselves). In parallel, another set of tactics was used (e.g. constant group interactions; instructor’s unwavering support) to achieve group cohesion and trust in the organization. When successful, this process ultimately resulted in an ideal socialization outcome: identity fusion. We further discuss implications for managers, employees, and organizations. © 2023, Academy of Management.

RISING GEOPOLITICAL RISK AND A FIRM’S CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190472878&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.276bp&partnerID=40&md5=1e18abcf126556dece8aa987b310593c,"This research argues that a firm responds to rising geopolitical risk (GPR) by adjusting its sales strategy. Specifically, in response to rising GPR, a firm lowers the concentration of its sales to customers, i.e., allocates sales revenues more evenly across its customers instead of relying on a few major customers. Analysis of a panel data set of 49,018 firm-year observations of 5,933 U.S. public firms between 2001 and 2021 supports their hypothesis. The firm’s lobbying spending strengthens the effect of GPR on customer concentration. Further, while a firm does not change its corporate customer concentration, it lowers the government customer concentration when GPR rises. Also, in response to rising GPR, an average firm decreases each of its domestic customer concentration and its foreign counterpart, though the effect on domestic customers exceeds that on the foreign customers. Moreover, reducing customer concentration in response to rising GPR hurts firm performance by impeding the firm’s number of new product introductions. The findings contribute to the literature on exogenous shocks in the nonmarket environment impact a firm’s strategic decisions. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In this article, we build on moral and organizational psychology to refine our understanding of the contingency of the emergence of solidarity at work. We distinguish conceptually solidaristic feelings and solidaristic actions and theorize that solidarity is contingent on the interactive construction of collective identity and perception of injustice.

Despite the many external and organizational antecedents of work engagement that have been studied, personal level antecedents may also play an important role. Using an approach of moderated mediation, this study examines how self-control and frugality as antecedents of subjective financial well-being influence employee work engagement. A total of 297 valid responses were collected from full-time employees working in diversified industries. The results show that both self-control and frugality positively influence subjective financial wellbeing and work engagement, and subjective financial wellbeing partially mediates the relationship between both self-control and frugality on work engagement. Moreover, the positive effect of self-control on work engagement is moderated by mindfulness. Furthermore, the study confirmed the moderating role of mindfulness on the indirect effect of self-control and frugality on work engagement through subjective financial well-being when the level of mindfulness is higher. The findings of the study enhance the literature on work engagement by suggesting person-level characteristics as antecedents of work engagement. Furthermore, the findings provide actionable insights for managers in various industries to understand that employees’ traits and financial wellbeing can be considered as indicators of employees’ outlook and behavior towards work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

I investigate how the technological paradigm shift from rule-based systems towards connectionist AI (i.e., neural network models) has led this occupational community out of an era of creative depression and into an era of strategic innovation; and show that this development is driven by changes in human-AI interaction. Drawing on grounded theory, I conduct interviews with world-elite chess players and machine learning engineers developing chess programs. I find that the developments in AI have subjected chess grandmasters to increased occupational complexity stemming from analytical ambiguity, technological diversity, and game-theoretic uncertainty. Members of the occupation have responded by instantiating new occupational identities as machine-behavior specialists, meta-experts, and domain scientists that are interrelated in a holistic network of identities. Resolving dissonance between networked identities depends on the human’s and the technology’s characteristics, as well as second-order effects in the socio-economic environment. I theorize that identity work to achieve consonance between identities determines the degree of conjoined agency of human-AI ensembles and meaningfulness in knowledge work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

WHEN TRUMP SAID JUMP: POLITICAL DIRECTORS AND THE RECRUITMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190458150&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.153bp&partnerID=40&md5=1a9b8f8f320c57a39a1a03a85638579c,"Immigration has become a contentious political topic. We examine how politicians on the board influence recruitment strategies aimed at attracting foreign workers. Empirically, we utilize former President Trump’s election to estimate the effect of political directors on recruitment strategies. Using the near-universe of job advertisements in the U.S., we create novel firm-level measures of employment barriers for foreign workers. We find that political directors affect a firm’s recruitment efforts by increasing the employment barriers for foreign workers. We then argue that other directors on the board as well as governance structures moderate political influences on firms’ recruitment strategies. © 2023, Academy of Management.

DOES EMOTIONAL VARIABILITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO ADS FOSTER USER ENGAGEMENT?,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190480996&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.160bp&partnerID=40&md5=2a0f6248fecbc8b0ee4868ad82abdee9,"How can firms increase the success of their social media (SM) video advertisements (video ads) in terms of higher viewership and engagement? With growing SM advertising expenditures, understanding how SM users can be motivated to watch video ads and engage with them actively will be of value to both research and practice. Given the salience of emotional cues in SM content for attracting and retaining attention of SM users, we build on the tenets of Emotion Dynamics and Capacity Theory of Attention to examine how the extent of “emotional variability” in the “initial” and “overall” phases of video ads influence the number of “views” and “likes” that videos receive. Employing novel video analysis techniques, our study leverages publicly available data of video ads curated by 71 active brands of Fortune 500 companies on Instagram. We find that the extent of emotional variability in the initial phase of the video ad fosters higher viewership. However, higher extent of emotional variability in the entire duration of the video has a negative impact on the active engagement of the SM users indicated by the number of ‘likes’ the video receives. The contrasting influence of emotional variability in the initial and overall phases of video ads on user engagement has important and interesting theoretical and practical implications. Through our study, we build on and complement prior literature on user engagement in SM video ads and make important theoretical contributions. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Entrepreneurship Training and Founders’ Perceptions of Ability: A Randomized Control Trial with Entrepreneurs in Tanzania,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190460597&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.202bp&partnerID=40&md5=83e486557307c6e9d173b9ac561c0128,"This paper studies the effects of training entrepreneurs in low-income countries to apply different approaches to strategic decision-making under uncertainty on their subjective perceptions of ability to cope with different challenges that can affect the development of new ventures. While entrepreneurs in these settings operate under extreme uncertainty and resource constraints, interventions to help them cope with those challenges are largely limited to short courses on basic business skills. Conversely, we use a field experiment with entrepreneurs in three regions of Tanzania to show that strategy-based training has important effects on their perceived ability to cope with different sources of uncertainty that can hinder the development of new ventures. Our findings suggest that training entrepreneurs in low-income countries to apply a theory-based approach to strategic decision-making increases their perceived ability to deal with uncertainty stemming from the development of a viable business model, and that this can have positive implications for business outcomes. We elaborate on the mechanisms behind these results and discuss the implications for current and future research. © 2023, Academy of Management.

At the firm-dyad level, to account for the multifaceted nature of search, we further dimensionalize technological convergence and differentiate the effects of exploration convergence, exploitation convergence and mixed convergence on alliance formation. We test our predictions on a sample of horizontal alliances in the U.S. semiconductor industry, showing clear and robust evidence that technological convergence exerts a strong influence on alliance formation, above and beyond the nonlinear effect of technological overlap that has been commonly reported in the literature. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Examining two samples of small-business entrepreneurs in the UK, we find that (i) dehumanizing childhood experiences boost entrepreneurs’ individual EO; (ii) this positive effect is the net result of a decrease in prevention focus and an increase in self-dehumanization. Moreover, the positive impact of dehumanizing childhood experiences on EO is stronger for entrepreneurs who uphold a good moral character. © 2023, Academy of Management.

While prior work has extensively analyzed benefits and antecedents of ambidexterity for incumbent firms, we lack equivalent understanding of potential drivers for exploration and exploitation in a new venture context. Hence, the purpose of this study is to provide first insights into the emergence of organizational ambidexterity by analyzing new venture-specific antecedents, such as the new venture’s financial setup and investor or mentor monitoring. By leveraging a dataset of 190 entrepreneurs, we show that investor or mentor monitoring positively relates to exploration and exploitation. We also confirm the positive, indirect impact of the number of funding rounds on exploration and exploitation mediated through monitoring. However, the corresponding mediation hypothesis for the number of investors, predicting a negative impact, is not supported. Our findings contribute to extant ambidexterity literature by adding new ventures as additional research object and, thereby, extending current antecedent research. We also add to entrepreneurship research by transferring the well-established Stakeholder and Agency Theory into the entrepreneurial context. Practically, we provide valuable insights for new venture leaders on potential consequences of their funding decisions as well as investor or mentor involvement. © 2023, Academy of Management.

This completely ignores the dynamic nature of the leadership process. Drawing on entrainment theory, we put forth that distinct patterns of leadership claiming and granting are likely to unfold throughout a manager-employee interaction. To this end, we use interaction coding to capture verbal leadership claiming and granting behaviors of both interaction partners (manager and employee) in 103 workplace meetings (37,011 interaction points) and compute a relational influence index that reflects the development of the conversational dynamics. Graphical analysis of our data reveals five clearly distinguishable entrainment types, i.e., distinct entrainment patterns of how leadership between managers and employees evolves over time. We discuss how our research advances theoretical perspectives on patterns of behavioral leadership dynamics as well as the power distribution between managers and employees. We end with future research suggestions such as further validating the five entrainment types. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We further propose that these impacts of empowering leadership on leaders tend to be stronger when the leader has higher self-reflection. We conducted two studies to examine this model. A field experiment with 65 leaders (Study 1) provided causal evidence on how empowering leadership manipulation influenced leaders’ experienced meaningfulness and burnout through leaders’ self-concordance. A three-wave field survey (Study 2) with 79 leaders and their 518 subordinates not only replicated the findings in Study 1, but also corroborated the moderating role of leaders’ self-reflection.

Understanding respondents’ memory processing plays an important role in enhancing response process validity and facilitating better alignment between theory and measurement in leadership research. However, we have limited understanding in terms of leadership item-level factors that may influence respondents’ memory processing. Moreover, extant research has largely focused on the impact of the cognitive (vs. affective) aspect of memory processing on leadership measurement. This study fills the void by elucidating the effect of emotional tone embedded in leadership items on memory processing as well as how the permutation of leadership items and their response scale format (i.e., Likert versus binary) may moderate this relationship. The episodic versus semantic memory paradigm and the parallel remember versus know judgment are employed to capture memory processing. The counterintuitive findings from the mixed-effects model shed light on alternative mechanisms that may be at play in memory processing and bear important implications for future research. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Such divergent findings could be related to the search processes of groups, both entailing the opportunity to imitate the behavior of others yet also allowing a diversity of approaches to unfold since particular designs of group interaction could shape the dynamics of search in groups. In order to further investigate this organizational search design challenge, we set out to compare the search dynamics of individuals compared to groups that were driven by a common incentive-based goal. In an online experiment, we compared the search behavior and performance of 253 individuals and 253 groups (N = 1265) across simple and complex landscapes. We find that groups in both kinds of landscapes initially explore more than individuals and then exploit more than individuals at the end of the search process. Groups outperform individuals on both simple and complex landscapes as a switch from exploration to exploitation is a favorable strategy. We contribute to the organizational search literature by highlighting how the difference in search behavior and performance of individuals vs. groups is driven by the role of heterogeneous search behaviors in groups driven by a common goal. © 2023, Academy of Management.

To answer this question, I adopt an abductive approach and leverage matched employee-employer data from the U.S. Census Bureau between 2000-2014. Results show that higher knowledge interdependence is negatively associated with employee entrepreneurship, and the negative effect is even stronger, not weaker, among the highest-performing individuals. This indicates that knowledge interdependence does not merely raise the bar of entry. Instead, firms implement better pay-for-performance compensation schemes to retain valuable human assets, which also leads to greater compensation dispersion within firms with higher knowledge interdependence. Together, these create a strong selection on the quality of spin-outs being formed especially by individuals ranked highest on the human capital distribution. I use an economic model to summarize these empirical insights and show that knowledge interdependence could also raise between-firm income inequality when it generates large enough profits on the product market. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite blockchains’ promise of decentralized governance and full automation, the underlying algorithmic protocols are often insufficient to align incentives, regulate behavior, and ensure trust. As a result, organizations typically introduce additional centralized governance structures to fill the gaps in the algorithmic governance layer, but this can lead to serious governance conflicts in complex network constellations with many stakeholders and divergent interests. Using an imprinting lens, we examine such complex governance issues in three interorganizational blockchain networks that differed dramatically in terms of success despite similar goals and founding conditions, with one network shutting down, one stagnating, and another continuing to operate. Drawing on extensive qualitative evidence from 56 interviews and comprehensive internal and external records, we found that the initial imprints from the shared technology provider played a significant role in the initial governance choices, maladaptation problems, and ultimately the success of these blockchain networks. By introducing imprinting theory into governance research, we can explain subconscious, latent, and persistent mechanisms that influence governance decisions at a profound level, often without the actors involved being aware of it. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Some firms choose to retain the knowledge regarding their outsourced core component while others do not. This study examines the effect of firm in house knowledge related to the outsourced core component (i.e., retaining the related knowledge while outsourcing the core component) on product performance during such radical technological change. Drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm, we hypothesize that, before a dominant technology of the core component emerges, firms operate under a high technological uncertainty, and the firms' in-house knowledge related to the outsourced core component can predispose the firms to cognitive biases in the solution search process. Thus, their eventual product performance is compromised. We also hypothesize that prior exploratory experience in a technologically related but outside domain and the external knowledge about the core component from suppliers can moderate such negative influence of the firms' in-house knowledge on product performance during the pre-dominant technology phase. After a dominant technology has emerged, the clarity of key technological features arguably become established. The firms' in-house knowledge related the outsourced core component is hypothesized to have a positive effect on their product performance as it enables the firms to advance the development of their unique firm-specific features in differentiating their products from those of the rivals. We further hypothesize that the moderating effects of prior exploratory technological area experience and external knowledge about the core component from suppliers are fading away after the dominant technology has emerged. We empirically test our hypotheses in the context of U.S. Hybrid Electric Vehicles market, and our hypotheses are largely supported. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite this quick adoption, there is a lack of studies seeking a better understanding of the changes that an organization needs to carry out for agile implementation at the organizational level. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to organize and synthesize knowledge in this field. In this study, 492 papers were identified in the first step. These were then rigorously analyzed, resulting in a final sample of 59 primary studies. As a result, a model was created, summarizing all the organizational changes implemented by the organizations that adopted agile approaches. Gaps in the literature were also identified, and recommendations were provided for future studies. In addition to contributing to the theory of agile approaches with a consolidated view of the changes that organizations need to undertake to implement the agile philosophy, it is also intended that this model will support the organizations that plan to undertake this journey of transformation, helping them plan the actions needed to achieve the desired results more consistently. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Yet, rarely has collective identity construction been understood with regards to its moral-emotional forces, given the heavily skewed attention of extant literature towards cognitive mechanisms. Drawing upon Brown et al.’s (2012) theorization on rhetoric justification, we investigate how institutional entrepreneurs deploy logos-ethos-pathos with their dynamics to mobilize potential followers to take on new collective identities for action and change. We do so by exploring the entrepreneurial discourse of French New Wave in Cahiers du Cinéma. Our findings lay bare three distinctive but intertwined layers of discursivity underpinning New Wave entrepreneurs’ collective identity construction, including two-kind textual relation (intratextuality and intertextuality), six-type discursive work (characterizing, interweaving, deconstructing, canonizing, alliancing, and antagonizing), and three-element rhetorical justification (logs, ethos, and pathos underpinning discursive work). In particular, we illustrate the indispensability and inseparability of ethos-pathos to identity-based movement mobilization and institutional change. Our research makes two contributions. First, our study contributes to the identity movements literature by foregrounding the significance of morality and emotionality to the mobilizing mechanism of collective identity construction. Second, our study builds on but goes beyond existing rhetorical research by unpacking the dynamics among logos-ethos-pathos, especially the adrenalizing effects of negative aesthetic-affective power, which ultimately constitute the attractiveness of an anti-institutional “we.” © 2023, Academy of Management.

This study examines the impact of birth order on entrepreneurial behavior, combining birth order theory with entrepreneurial networking. It is suggested that firstborn vs. laterborn entrepreneurs show different networking and entrepreneurial behavior when faced with entrepreneurial obstacles. Laterborn entrepreneurs are expected to build, seek, and use external networks more strongly and consequently act more entrepreneurially than firstborn entrepreneurs. Three empirical studies are conducted with more than 900 entrepreneurs. Study 1 shows that laterborn (but not firstborn) entrepreneurs intensify their networking efforts and consequently their entrepreneurial behavior when facing entrepreneurial obstacles. Study 2 does not find an interaction effect, yet, reveals that being firstborn is directly linked with fewer networking and fewer entrepreneurial behavior. Study 3 extends these findings, showing that laterborn established entrepreneurs seek more emotional social support in the face of obstacles, while firstborns avoid doing so. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We develop a conceptual model for understanding such SOI in the context of socio-ecological systems (SES) and operationalize it with a set of components for assessing SOI’s system-level impact. Taking a configurational approach, we empirically study the impact of innovations from 14 firms in eight countries using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Our analysis uncovers two configurations of stakeholder collaboration associated with system-level sustainability impacts and makes the case for a high level of openness to external influence as a recipe for system-level impact. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In three experiments with racial minority participants from the United States (total N = 1069), find that Latinx participants’ entrepreneurial intentions are stronger when entrepreneurship is portrayed as associated with White individuals, while Black participants’ entrepreneurial intentions are stronger when entrepreneurship is associated with ingroup peers.

We test a two-stage moderated mediation model in which self-serving motives serve as an explanatory mechanism translating OP into helping at work, and servant leadership and help visibility serve as two boundary conditions that, respectively, modify the relationship between OP and self-serving motives, and between self-serving motives and helping. In two studies, we found support for a positive link between OP and self-serving motives, but also an unexpected amplifying (rather than dampening) role of servant leadership. Additionally, Study 2 offered mixed support for the hypothesized second-stage moderation, in that the relationship between self-serving motives and helping was negative when help visibility was low, but did not become positive when help visibility was high. Overall, the indirect relationship between OP and helping via self-serving motives was negative only when servant leadership was high and help visibility was low, and did not become positive at high levels of servant leadership and help visibility as predicted. The findings offer a more nuanced view of OP and helping than expected, and we discuss their conceptual and practical implications. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Our inductive approach uncovered key tournament socialization elements, their effects, and new politicians’ reputational strategies for survival. Thus, we shed light on key socialization challenges posed by the neglected tournament tactic in the context of senior newcomers.

We demonstrate this using Instagram data, LDA topic modeling, and a natural experiment based on an Instagram policy change in July 2019. Findings stress that network effect’s draw can be competition-based and suggest that the platform owner can benefit from intra-platform competition as a source of platform growth. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Most research considers that external technological assets and capabilities can be bought or accessed collaboratively. This paper introduces Contracting Development Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) as a distinctive form of outsourcing specialized R&D assets and capabilities on a per-use rental basis instead of collaborating or directly controlling them. Such outsourcing allows firms to control downstream development processes and retain control of the rents that accrue after successful commercialization. This division of labor allows firms to focus on their inventive internal process and simultaneously access diverse CDMO capabilities, enabling them to generate destabilizing innovations. However, excessive CDMO outsourcing will harm a firm’s ability to develop path-breaking innovations. We theorize and find empirical support for the idea that the reliance on CDMOs has an inverted U-shaped relationship with a firm’s ability to produce destabilizing innovation. We then examine three absorptive capacity-related contingencies, namely R&D centralization, intrafirm R&D collaboration, and the average R&D workforce experience as relevant moderators for this baseline relationship. We test our arguments in the context of the Biopharmaceutical industry and find overall support for our hypotheses. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, we lack clarity on the underlying mechanism and the temporal processes that lead to the feeling state of MiL across the tripartite aspects of coherence, purpose, and significance. This study aims to bridge this apparent gap in the literature by studying Quantum career movers (QCMers), i.e., individuals who have left successful careers and opted for novel paths in search of MiL. The quantum career moves (QCM) indicate a precondition of 'lacking meaning' and a postcondition of 'experiencing meaning.' Through multiple rounds of interviews with forty-two QCMers, we found that QCMers encountered an existential vacuum as the pre-QCM work failed to provide a larger purpose and the flexibility to maneuver life goals, referred to by us as career volition. In contrast, the QCM careers offered opportunities for career volition and a sense of ""existential vitality,"" characterized by coherence, purpose, and significance, through immersive experiences. Existential vitality further invigorated existential narrativity acclaimed through narratives concerning the prosocial impact of work, imbuing an external sense of coherence, purpose, and significance. Together, the QCM journey fostered MiL across the internal and external manifestations of the tripartite aspects, with the internal feelings facilitating the external ones. Further studies analyzing QCMers over a longer term or based on individuals who derive meaning in their current career without seeking QCM can revalidate our findings and offer newer insights into the search for meaning from work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

While much of the literature on social movements focuses on how these external forces influence change within organizations, less is known about how external social movements merge with internal worker demands to drive radical unplanned change. This paper focuses on marginalized workers trapped in an outsourced contract in an emerging market context, highlighting conditions that forced an organization into an unplanned change. Institutional logics was used to understand how different types of activism and power tactics influenced changes in the organization’s outsourcing of labor. Through a case study of a large urban university, using a grounded theory approach, we present a non-linear process model to explain how forced unplanned organizational change occurs within a turbulent macro-socio political and economic context. Theoretically, the research provides a greater understanding of how radical unplanned change is forced onto an organization due to power tactics of their internal workforce and external social activism. Practically, it suggests managers must ensure a voice for all stakeholders to mitigate coercive forms of power tactics against the organization. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Society views the individuals who perform this work as if they personify their work’s negative qualities and stigmatize them as dirty workers. Over the years, the scholarly interest in understanding different facets of dirty work has increased. Scholars have tried to uncover the features of dirty occupations, the challenges faced by dirty workers, and the strategies they utilize to manage the taint. These studies assume that dirty work is an occupational-level threat. Consequently, dirty workers collectively perceive, experience, and respond to this threat. As a result, dirty work’s embodied aspects, including how the differences in the meanings ascribed to the dirty workers’ bodies influence how they encounter their work, have been overlooked. In our qualitative study, we attempt to fill this void by exploring the influence of caste dynamics on dirty workers’ perceptions and work experiences. Based on the grounded theory approach, we interviewed 55 dirty workers. The findings from our study reveal that workers have distinct beliefs regarding the extent to which they consider a dirty occupation to be “theirs” versus “others,” and these beliefs, in turn, guide their choice of strategy for navigating the stigmatization surrounding them and their work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Specifically, we hypothesize that PLB, which entails contrasting behaviors aimed at fostering cohesion and conformity on the one hand, and empowerment and flexibility on the other hand, positively influences two seemingly opposing, yet ultimately complementary socio-cognitive processes in teams: team members’ mental model convergence and mental model adaptation. In line with paradox theory, we argue that both processes are needed to achieve peak performance: We hypothesize a positive interaction between team mental model convergence and mental model adaptation on team performance captured via customer satisfaction ratings. Results from latent moderated structural equation modeling of multi-wave and multi-source data supported these hypotheses. PLB was positively associated with both team mental model convergence and mental model adaptation. We also found evidence for a positive interaction effect between these variables, such that team mental model convergence was only positively associated when team mental model adaptation was higher. In turn, the effect of PLB on team performance was mediated via this interactive effect.

Building on 27 interviews and unique archival data, we show how teleorthodontics companies first engaged in competitive boundary work, then shifted to collaborative and eventually ended up with blurring and embedding boundary work with the profession. We find that the process resulted in the shifting boundaries between the dentistry and orthodontics, where the lower-status profession of dentistry increasingly took over orthodontic tasks which was enabled by MedTech platforms. Our analysis explains that this outcome emerged as an unintentional and ironic consequence of the boundary work efforts by the orthodontics professional association to shut down teleorthodontics.

One of the largest groups, East Asians, are found to face drawbacks (e.g., bamboo ceiling) in their prospect in the United States, yet it is unclear how gender, another prominent status characteristic, plays a role in their status calculus and migration decision. Taking heritage culture as an important context into the intersectional analyses, we propose that compared to East Asian women, East Asian men can expect more social privileges in heritage countries and more social penalties from incongruence with the agentic norm in the United States. The expected status differentials in heritage countries and the host country may motivate East Asian women rather than East Asian men to stay. As the visible representation of a group in public fields can be one source of the expected social status, in Study 1a-1b, we found that the male advantages in Congress positions and Netflix exposures disappeared or became reversed among East Asians in the United States. In Study 2, by analyzing global MBA job placement records from an elite business school across five years, we found actual rates of staying in the United States differ sharply by gender, especially among East Asians. In Study 3, a survey on another MBA cohort, we found that the greater rate of female stayers is explained by their social status expectancy differential in their heritage countries and the United States. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Additionally, we advocate the importance of technological alliances to resist de-globalization and maintain CMNEs’ innovation achievements. By examining the bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) between Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and China, our empirical results based on country-level and firm-level analyses suggest that after 2016, CMNEs’ inward internationalization improves innovation performance rather than outward internationalization.

It highlights potential benefits of co-investment with similar investors, such as smoother coordination, effective information exchange and enhanced trust, as antecedents of the co-investment. This study hypothesizes that angel investors sharing the same gender or ethnicity are more likely to co-invest in a startup, i.e., ascribed homophily, and angel investors sharing the same education or career background are also more likely to co-invest in a startup, i.e., achieved homophily. Further, it suggests that investors’ personal characteristics and status difference jointly directs the formation of such a homophilous tie. It argues that similarity in ascribed characteristics including gender and ethnicity mitigates concern about dysfunctional tensions that often arise from status difference, whereas similarity in achieved characteristics including education and career background amplifies it. Findings from a study of U.S. angel investors support the hypotheses. A supplementary analysis uses local angel investors’ ascribed and achieved characteristics similarity as instrumental variables to establish causality and finds that both ascribed and achieved homophily enhances investment performance. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In a longitudinal study (four-waves), using self-report measures, we collected data from recently unemployed individuals (N=413) actively looking for a new job. The hypotheses were tested in structural equation modeling (SEM).Our findings revealed that economic hardship is negatively related to focused job search strategy and positively related to haphazard job search strategy. The association between focused strategy and reemployment outcomes was positive whereas the relationship of haphazard strategy and reemployment outcomes was negative. Further, the job strategies mediated the relationship between economic hardship and reemployment outcomes.

However, companies must consider multiple stakeholders’ needs when making strategic decisions. Since not all stakeholder groups can be served equally, this leads to necessary trade-offs. Corporate hypocrisy, understood as a lack of integrity, is defined as a negative evaluation that is caused by a perceived distance between the claimed standards and observed actions of an organization. With this study, we try to shed more light on the question of when employees evaluate the actions of their employers as hypocritical and how they react to this. Drawing from social identity theory and social exchange theory, we postulate that once employees perceive their employers’ CSR efforts as inconsistent between different stakeholder groups, they will evaluate this as corporate hypocrisy, and their affective organizational commitment (AOC) will decrease. To test our hypotheses, we based our research model on survey responses from 901 German middle managers. Our analyses were executed via structural equation modeling due to the nature of the mediation model. Our research contributes to the micro-CSR realm, giving novel empirical evidence on potential negative outcomes of CSR and a more in-depth view of the interplay of different CSR stakeholder groups. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite this underrepresentation, we observe an increase in the number of women appointed to the Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO). While this potentially holds promise for top management gender diversity, we do not know much about how women have been appointed to this position especially after a male predecessor. We thus examine the competing forces of social role perception and social categorization on a gender shift in the CHRO position. Social role theory predicts that the appointment of a female CHRO would be promoted due to gender stereotypes, while social categorization theory predicts that the appointment of a female executive including the CHRO would be avoided due to the outsider status of women. We find that the firm is less likely to appoint a female CHRO following a male predecessor, consistent with social categorization theory. However, our results further show that CEOs’ board position in a firm with a female CHRO and the industry-level diffusion of a female CHRO facilitate a change from a male CHRO to a female CHRO. These results suggest that the effect of social role perception is triggered under some circumstances. © 2023, Academy of Management.

People analytics is becoming ever more extensive and invasive - from cameras checking if workers are at their desk to wearables reporting on worker wellness. We know little, however, on how such technologies of control are supporting management in making well informed decisions about their workers. Drawing from insights from a 16 month ethnographic study, we address this shortcoming through exploring how biometric data is being used to manage people in an elite sports organisation. Our study sheds light on a new form of control enacted through the use of biometric data - a shared control of the body - which calls for a closer relationship between managers and workers as they together attempt to control the body as the main subject of work performance. In particular, we follow the ways in which managers and workers negotiate towards a shared control of the body. Encompassing our findings as part of a theoretical model, we highlight how our findings have implications for theory on organisation control and resistance as well as for people analytics. © 2023, Academy of Management.

A BEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE ON GENERAL MANAGER SUCCESSION IN UNDERPERFORMING FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190432067&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.229bp&partnerID=40&md5=8e96c1811e0523bbd0b07cb949e75631,"Underperformance is one of the most salient drivers of managerial succession. Yet, its role in influencing general manager (GM) succession in foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs) has received limited attention and remains poorly understood. This is despite the fact that subsidiary management is critical to MNE success. To fill this important gap, we draw on the performance feedback perspective to argue that MNE decision makers interpret subsidiary performance against aspirations to make subsidiary GM succession decisions. Specifically, we hypothesize that a greater performance attainment discrepancy (a) between the focal subsidiary’s performance and its historical aspiration and (b) between the focal subsidiary’s performance and its social aspiration increases the likelihood of GM succession. However, as a critical contingency factor, we expect that cultural distance between parent home country and the subsidiary host country obfuscates MNE decision makers’ interpretations of performance feedback signals, weakening the relationship between subsidiary underperformance relative to its historical and social aspirations and GM succession. Using Toyo Keizai Needs Merged Database from 1991 to 2020, we find empirical support for our predictions. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest directions for future research. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Previous micro-CSR research has found that employees' perceived Corporate Social Responsibility (PCSR) influences positive behaviors and attitudes. However, there is a lack of awareness of the subtle influences of CSR as a contextual corporate factor on the psychological state of individual beneficiaries beyond the directly intended effects. We draw on social exchange and deontic justice theories to analyze the relationship between PCSR and employees’ Psychological Capital (PsyCap). We also account for the under-researched nuances of CSR by distinguishing between perceptions of internally and externally oriented CSR. At a time when employees are increasingly demanding, we examine the moderating influence of their level of psychological entitlement (PE). Survey data from 1,079 employees in over 400 firms in Germany confirm the significant effect of PCSR on PsyCap, which PE moderates significantly. Contrary to our hypothesis, perceptions of externally oriented CSR influence PsyCap more than internally oriented CSR. Our results do not only contribute a part to closing research gaps. We provide practitioners with the awareness to actively use the positive side effects of CSR. Otherwise, companies lose out on the subtle, less obvious benefits associated with CSR activities. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In contrast to employees, who benefit from a positive stress mindset (i.e., believing in the positive outcomes of stress), we propose that the relationship between stress mindset and well-being is more complex in entrepreneurs. In this research, we address whether and how a positive stress mindset can help or harm entrepreneurs’ well-being. Theoretically grounded in self-determination theory and the dualistic model of passion, we examine a dual-pathway model in which the relationship between stress mindset and well-being (vigor and emotional exhaustion) in entrepreneurs is mediated by two forms of passion: an adaptive form (harmonious passion) and a maladaptive form (obsessive passion). We conducted a time-lagged and an experimental study with more than 300 entrepreneurs in total. The combined results support the dual-pathway model and indicate that the effects of a positive stress mindset on well-being in entrepreneurs can be positive (via harmonious passion) or negative (via obsessive passion). The beliefs that entrepreneurs hold about stress carry important implications for how they deal with their passion and well-being. © 2023, Academy of Management.

According to conventional wisdom, people cannot have both a calling and a job orientation to their work—working for both the meaningfulness and the money. But despite its prevalence in the literature, this claim is supported by remarkably little empirical evidence. We conducted a three-year longitudinal qualitative study that challenged this assumption: the teachers we interviewed were highly motivated by both their pay and their passion to make a positive difference to the lives of their students. Yet they also experienced a tension between their prosocial and financial motivations, going to lengths to explain and justify their choices. We identified two processes through which they resolved this tension: the first, balancing, involves affirming a tension between prosocial and financial motivations in general, while explaining why it does not apply in this case. The second, integrating, involves rejecting a tension between prosocial and financial motivations by making financial reward part of what makes their work meaningful. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Across seven phases with eight independent samples, and using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, our results suggest that crisis leadership could be a reflective and multidimensional construct (including sensitivity to context, responsibility shouldering, empathic consideration, adaptation to change, and reflective learning) and could positively influence employees’ work attitude, performance, adaptability, and resilience. Moreover, we find that crisis leadership has configural invariance across Chinese and American contexts.

The challenge, therefore, is to simplify basic concepts from a pedagogic perspective, while at the same time maintaining and “conveying their subtlety and ambiguity” (Dehler & Welsh, 1993, p. 80). Experiential learning has been credited with enhancing student engagement to combat “creeping passivity” and the belief among students that they are not “intellectually responsible for themselves” (Cutler, 2007, p. 6; Donovan & Hood, 2021). However, while experiential learning approaches offer a route towards teaching complexity, the implementation of experiential teaching itself may be difficult in the modern school of business where class size, particularly at undergraduate level, must be a factor in curriculum development and delivery (Cullen, 2011; Lyons & Buckley, 2021).

Using a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms, we provide empirical evidence that multitechnology firms have a more intense search for suppliers’ knowledge in the context of emerging technologies in contrast to mature technologies. Moreover, reabsorption of spilled over knowledge from suppliers is only positively associated with innovation success in the context of emerging technologies.

This article describes the first meta- analytic review of the criterion-related validity of interview-based assessments of specific constructs. As such, this study explores the suitability of the interview for assessing specific forms of performance, and furthermore, how interviews should be designed to inform the assessment of distinct forms of performance. A comprehensive search process identified k = 37 studies comprising N = 30,646 participants (N = 4,449 with the removal of one study). Results suggest that all forms of performance are assessed with similar levels of criterion-related validity (r = .26-.29) but that, with respect to construct validity, assessments of contextual and leadership performance are more precise than assessments of task and communication performance. We found no evidence that tailoring the design of the interview improved the assessment of any specific form of performance. However, we expect that future analyses may amend this finding and we point to critical gaps in our current body of literature on employment interviews.

"NESTED LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND GLOBAL IDENTITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF EXISTENTIAL THREAT",2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190430066&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.121bp&partnerID=40&md5=f3904e82df8a50f8b88d3bc14ef17cfb,"Although various theories on identity exist, each with its own vast literature, the extant research does not fully address change in nested identities in the presence of an existential threat – one that threatens both sub- and superordinate identity groups. Further, the identity literature lacks attention to workplace consequences of nested identity in the context of existential threat. We conducted a mixed-methods investigation to address these gaps. All data were collected in the presence of sub- and superordinate identity group threatening forces including Covid-19, supply chain disruptions, and social protests. In Study 1, we asked 27 adults working in the United States about their identification with their local community, nation, and world as a whole both pre-Covid and during the Summer of 2020. Their responses allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of how these nested identities changed in response to threat. In Study 2, we tested workplace implications of identification at each level by administering two surveys (separated by one month) to 337 adults working in Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States. Results supported global identification as a useful tool for coping with existential threat, as it showed a positive influence on both satisfaction and performance. © 2023, Academy of Management.

USING INNOVATION CONTESTS TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE VOICE: A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190435236&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.59bp&partnerID=40&md5=4941ea14fb44fcc71b6ba03ca975fd16,"By definition, employee voice is informal, discretionary, and status-quo challenging; speaking up entails sharing unsolicited improvement-oriented suggestions face-to-face or using direct communication mechanisms, rather than formal ones. Because of this definition, the attention given to studying social antecedents and consequences of voice has far outweighed the attention given to studying the role of formal, structured channels on voice behavior. This begs the question: Can formal structures and processes that invite employee input cultivate informal voice behaviors? Addressing this question is important as employees likely use both formal and informal channels to voice ideas. This study presents findings from a field experiment which examined the causal effect of implementing innovation contests, a formal channel and opportunity for employees to voice ideas, on employees’ informal voice behavior. For this experiment, I recruited 54 community health centers (CHCs), which are primary care clinics that serve an underserved area in the United States. Half of the randomly assigned CHCs implemented innovation contests as an organizational intervention. Based on my analytic sample of 3,343 employees, I find that innovation contests increased informal voice behaviors (reported by supervisors) by 9%. This effect was more pronounced among support staff (e.g., medical assistants, nurses, receptionists), as they may find speaking up to be especially difficult and risky. These findings advance new perspectives on voice that simultaneously examine formal and informal mechanisms for soliciting employee input and also on open innovation that considers downstream, spillover effects of opening up the innovation process on employee behaviors in organizations. © 2023, Academy of Management.

BUDGET UPLIFTING IN CAPITAL PROJECTS: A THEORETICAL MODEL OF JOINT VALUE PRODUCTION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190427739&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.56bp&partnerID=40&md5=5710f237025e284459ee2d4e46a559dc,"This study develops the rudiments of a contingent perspective on the value of budget uplifts in capital projects. Budget uplifting is a policy to endow capital projects with unallocated funds to tackle unquantifiable uncertainties, creating a budget reserve that can be mobilized ex-post project approval to encourage nonmarket stakeholders to collaborate. Using a formal model, we propose this form of financial ‘slack’ can be advantageous, but only up to a point. We examine how the slack thresholds vary with the organizational purpose of the project sponsors, the bargaining power of nonmarket stakeholders, and the subjective value of stakeholder benefits. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In a series of meta-analyses including 439 effects from 265 independent studies, we considered whether similar research questions resulted in different results due to research setting effects. Laboratory and field studies were coded and matched based on theory-driven predictors (Dinh et al., 2014) and the type of outcome examined (Avolio et al., 2009). Further, we coded for the threat of endogeneity in each study design (Antonakis et al., 2010) and included that measure as a covariate moderator in order to account for methodological differences between studies and determine its influence on driving divergence in results. The overwhelming majority of relationships tested did not significantly differ as a product of research setting alone, suggesting broad generalizability between lab and field research. Endogeneity risk was found to significantly moderate meta-analytic effects in several cases, occasionally explaining enough variance in effects to make research setting a significant moderator when endogeneity was controlled for. Given the relevance of these findings to the study of leadership and social sciences more generally, additional implications are discussed. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We conduct a nineteen-month ethnographic case study of an Energy Company (EnCo) in Germany to understand why the climate crisis has not been perceived as a corporate crisis, and what we can learn from organizations' engagement with other socio-environmental corporate crises in terms of risk management. Through analysis of observational, interview, and documentary data we explore the engagement with three socio-environmental corporate crises and corporate actors’ risk perception. We develop a theoretical model of corporate climate risk perception (PANNIC model) explaining socio-psychological factors that prevent organizational actors in their everyday risk work from perceiving the climate crisis as an unprecedented risk. We also show how sustainability-related risk tensions dissolve over time due to emerging risk translations.

To address this deficiency, our study is situated in the European Union (EU), where political scientists have noted information strategies to be central to achieving lobbying success; the EU also provides a context of global norm-setting activities, especially with its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Aided by recent advances in the field of unsupervised machine learning, we performed a structural topic model analysis of the entire set of lobby documents submitted during two GDPR consultations, which were obtained via a freedom of information request. Our analysis of the substance of information strategies reveals that the two policy phases reveal ‘shifting battlegrounds’, where firms first seek to influence what is included and excluded in the legislation, after which they engage the interests of other stakeholders. We thus identify two distinct information (sub)strategies, and point at the need for more attention for institutional procedures and for the role of other stakeholders’ lobbying activities in CPA research. © 2023, Academy of Management.

The technological path can be described as an evolutionary, organization-level process of innovation, which is characterized by both the path-dependent and path-creating natures that build on each other. We draw on a topic modeling approach to distinguish between path dependence and path creation, and to discern into their different effects on the structuring of technological path inside a firm. Two different strategies were identified in the two firms – technology blending (in UMC) and technology deepening (in TSMC), serving as generative mechanisms for spawning a diversity in sources of technological advance that characterize distinctive technological paths, accounting for path difference across the two focal firms. Overall, our central contribution is a strategic structuring view of technological paths, whereby actions create structures. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Framing refers to the use of language and phrasing in a contract, and whereas prior research has mainly considered the regulatory focus of contractual framing, we rely on social identity theory to highlight collective identity framing as an alternative framing dimension, which is likely to influence trust perceptions and behaviors in alliances. We hypothesize that the presence of a collective identity contract frame can help to maintain trust in the setting of an alliance disruption. We also expect that the strength of this relationship is contingent on the alliance actor’s propensity to trust. In a first vignette study, we show that, after an alliance disruption, the presence of a collective identity frame triggers higher trust perceptions only when the alliance actor has a low propensity to trust. A second behavioral experiment replicates these results. Jointly, these findings provide a richer understanding of how contractual framing, in combination with actors’ personality traits, shape trust in challenging alliance settings such as disruptions. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Leveraging institutional theory, we elaborate how populist governments change the overall institutional environment for firms and thereby affect their operations. Thereby, populism breaks the notion of a quasi-static institutional environment, making the mechanisms and consequences of change visible. We also investigate what role the experience of MNEs plays in this relationship, building on organizational learning theory. Taking a sample of 5,036 FDI observations from 2007 to 2019 as a basis, we perform a long-run event study with the FDI as the main event, followed by a three year event window. We find that the overall performance in terms of buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHAR) is more negatively affected, the more power a populist government has amassed in the host-country of the FDI. We cannot find any support for a moderating effect of (relevant) experience in this regard. Our results highlight the need to dig deeper into the implications of populism for MNEs and their (international) operations. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite manifold ambidexterity research on related organizational benefits, to date, it remains unclear what (negative) consequences can be caused for teams and individuals working in such a context. While prior work has conceptually related the existence of tensions with ambidexterity, we particularly lack empirical evidence measuring such effects on individuals. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between organizational ambidexterity and conflicts within the founding team, i.e., task and relationship conflicts, as well as perceived stress for entrepreneurs. By leveraging a dataset of 193 entrepreneurs, we show a two-fold effect of organizational ambidexterity: On the one hand, ambidexterity offers benefits by mitigating relationship conflict and perceived stress, which, both, can be harmful to founding teams and entrepreneurs. On the other hand, we find ambidexterity to also decrease task conflicts, a type of conflict that can be beneficial for teams. Our findings contribute to extant ambidexterity literature by analyzing consequences following organizational ambidexterity. Also, we provide valuable insights for new venture leaders to anticipate positive and negative effects of their new venture’s strategic focus. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Scholars and practitioners are increasingly interested in how such data can be valuable to organizations. Adopting an attention-based view lens, we explore this question by asking how data shape, direct, and sustain attention in strategic decision making. Our 25-month case study of an Innovation Lab where multiple firms that span a supply chain in the heavy manufacturing industry collaborate to experiment with sensor data to innovate maintenance processes shows that data is not per-se valuable. Instead, we see that data have a strategic value in directing strategic problem solving by steering middle and operational managers’ attention and by providing them with something concrete to engage over. This makes two theoretical contributions at the intersection of information systems and strategic management theory: First, this contributes to the attention-based view by showing the importance of middle and operational managers’ attention dynamics for driving digital transformation in industrial organizations. Second, it explores the power of data to remake organizational processes by describing how datafication data guide strategic decision making, where data interpretation focuses attention by engaging managers in-depth with specific problems and solutions, and data observation widens the scope of managers’ attention by opening up analysis for re-evaluation, or moving from one problem or solution to the next. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Although information quality control is conducive to bolstering the credibility of information on platforms, it may encourage sellers to pursue multihoming strategy on other platforms, thereby undermining the attractiveness of the platform implementing information quality control (“focal platform” thereafter). Building on coping theory, this study aims to investigate how sellers cope with information quality control imposed by platforms by observing their information withholding and multihoming strategy. The moderating influence of multihoming experience is further considered in this research. To validate our hypotheses, we collected data from two dominant e-marketplace platforms in China. Based on quasi-experimental design, this we employed propensity score matching and difference-in-difference methods to analyze our data. We discovered that platform information quality control culminates in sellers’ information withholding and service-related multihoming strategy but has no impact on product-related multihoming strategy. Additionally, we revealed that sellers tend to react differently to the platform information quality control depending on their multihoming experiences.

These separate structural units combine organizational tasks and objectives commonly inherent in IT units (ITUs) and research and development (R&D), namely digitalization and (product) innovation. Despite their omnipresence across industries, their overall value is still a point of debate in numerous organizations as many DIUs seemingly do not deliver on their promised benefits or attain their goals. This might partly be due to the fact that a DIU’s novelty and obscurity hinders their integration and legitimation within the organization they serve, especially in the eyes of ITU and R&D as the more established and traditional core units. Despite their indisputable presence, there is an evident lack of knowledge on what makes a DIU a successful and legitimate organizational unit. Research on the legitimation of new entities and optimal distinctiveness theory would suggest that for DIUs to be successful and perceived as legitimate, they need to meet two opposing needs, namely the need for (intra-group) inclusion as well as (inter- group) differentiation from R&D and ITU. Yet, this might not be enough. Building on belief-congruence theory, I suggest that for DIUs to be successful, they need to further encompass a value-based congruence to R&D and ITU. Following a multi-source study design, I conduct a Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) that empirically tests the necessity of inclusion and distinctiveness conditions for a DIUs’ success in terms of their goal attainment. I discuss the findings, their implications for theory and practice, and point to interesting opportunities for future research. © 2023, Academy of Management.

COMMON GOOD HRM PRACTICES AND EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY: A SOCIAL EXCHANGE PERSPECTIVE,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190430364&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.64bp&partnerID=40&md5=4a5e92924caa300533499744565fd6d1,"Existing literature provides limited understanding of how organizational level factors translate into more sustainable employee behaviors. Integrating institutional theory and social exchange theory, this study proposes a cross-level serial mediation model that links firm perceived institutional pressures for sustainability and employee involvement in organizational sustainability behaviors. Specifically, we propose that firm perceived institutional pressures is the main driver for firms to adopt common good human resource management practices, which initiates a micro social exchange mechanism that affects employee perceived organizational support and the subsequent employee efforts toward organizational sustainability. Empirical results based on time-lagged multi-source survey data collected from 96 firms in China support our theoretical model. With its theoretical and practical implications, this study contributes to both organizational sustainability and human resource management literature. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Our four-wave and three-source study sample comprised 303 firefighters nested in 45 fire stations. Multilevel Structural Equation Model analyses results indicate that, at the individual level, servant leadership significantly predicts high adaptivity, and low emotional exhaustion through the mediating influence of firefighters’ felt trust and trust climate.

In this study, we suggest that changes in technological generations are a critical source of misalignment among complementary firms by focusing on the entry decisions of complementary firms. Using a unique dataset drawn from the computer printer industry, we found that firms in a specific product complementary market, vis-à-vis a generic market, have a higher likelihood of market entry into the focal industry characterized by multiple discontinuous technological generations. More importantly, the empirical analyses suggest that acquiring recombinant capabilities facilitates market entry by allowing the firm to utilize the relevant knowledge associated with complementarity. In addition, we show evidence that entrepreneurial start-ups are quicker than diversifiers in new market entry, suggesting the importance of entrant types in market entry. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Through an analysis of members of an occupational category in which the ethnoracial background and experiences of workers are considered an intrinsic part of the expertise necessary to fulfill the job tasks—diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) workers, I develop the concept of racialized expertise. Organizational actors gave different racial and social meanings to the ethnoracial background of workers in relation to their expertise in DEI issues. The differences in attributions of expertise given to white and non-white DEI workers led to differences in task allocation and, consequently, in the job content of DEI workers. An unexpected but valuable finding is that the racialized differences in perceptions of expertise seem to have influenced how non-white DEI workers presented their ethnoracial background as a type of expertise.

We further argue that organizational and community embeddedness impact the relationship between career adaptability and expatriate adjustment, and then the serially mediated relationship, differently. We assert that organizational embeddedness strengthens the likelihood of a positive relationship between MIL and taking charge behavior via career adaptability and expatriate adjustment, whereas community embeddedness reduces the positive association between the two via career adaptability and expatriate adjustment.

We situate our research in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan and study three most popular female influencers and their followers. We question existing dominant and universalist Western feminist frameworks (post-feminist and neoliberal) of reading women’s roles in influencer cultures and their imbrications in the market. Deploying theories of decoloniality and epistemic reconstitutions, this paper uncovers underlying forms of imperialism in knowledge construction. This epistemic reconstitution is necessitated by our respondents’ ambivalent identification and disidentification with feminism, which our respondents see as Western, neo-colonialist and imperialist. Instead, they choose to use the idea of the modern woman, which is a complex amalgam of their historical legacies and lived realities. Exploring modalities of border thinking, we analyse this category of the modern woman, to think beyond ideas of Anglo-American modernity to better understand the realities and aspirations of Kazakh women within influencer cultures. This paper reads this idea of ‘alternative modernity’ in the light of the construction of the ‘new woman’ in colonial India. To this end, the paper brings together the two discursive fields of post-colonialism and post-socialism to decolonize Western feminist theoretical paradigms of reading women dominated influencer cultures. Thus, this paper contributes to widening the notions of transnational intersectionality in constructions of gendered influencer culture. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Drawing from the institutional logics perspective, we posit that informal entrepreneurship may be a consequence of the social structure that shapes prevailing logics. Specifically, ethnic fractionalization in society undermines social cohesion by casting ethnic identity as an alternative institutional logic to that of the bureaucratic state, increasing the likelihood that entrepreneurs will not register their ventures. However, we further argue that the effect of ethnic fractionalization is mitigated by the entrepreneur’s ties with lawyers or individuals with business experience because such ties introduce legal and market institutional logics, respectively, to founders’ cognition, emphasizing both the benefits of legal registration and the potential costs of not registering. We find support for these arguments using a sample of over 5,000 entrepreneurs operating in 29 countries. Our study explicates a novel socio-cultural antecedent of informal entrepreneurship, pinpointing ethnic embeddedness as a critical mechanism underlying critical business formation decisions. Further, by explicating that multiple embeddedness through social ties can shape the salience of particular logics in business registration decisions, we advance research on how entrepreneurs interact with the larger institutional environment. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite the importance of this concept, it is surprising that findings surrounding family firm professionalization are scattered and contradictory. We argue that these pitfalls stem from the lack of theoretical foundation of the concept and from the implicit assumption of professionalization as a natural transformation. Our manuscript builds on institutional theory and research on institutional pressures to reconceptualize the process of professionalization in family firms and provide a cohesive theoretical framework. We theorize four types of professionalization and argue under which conditions (non-)professionalization is beneficial for family firms. Consequently, our theorizing contributes to family firm professionalization research by drawing attention to the concepts of legitimacy and decoupling, thus highlighting that family firms, under certain conditions, might profit from non-professionalization and suffer from professionalization. Moreover, we contribute to institutional discourse by introducing the concept of reference dimensions, thereby shedding light on how family firms discretionarily—instead of isomorphically—react to institutional pressures as well as on a novel explanation of why means-ends-decoupling unfolds in organizations. © 2023, Academy of Management.

It turns out that a high level of perceived CSR relates to felt obligation among employees that is positively associated with the risk of workaholism. These findings have important implications for both theory and practice. © 2023, Academy of Management.

INVESTING OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE: THE EFFECT OF CATEGORIZATION BREADTH AND GRANULARITY ON CORPORATE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTENT,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190440337&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.7bp&partnerID=40&md5=56eb0bec942cf7f9bd0ef436eb58aa39,"This study theorizes how managerial categorization influences firms’ external search. First, the categorization breadth by top managers leads them to scan the periphery of the competitive environment and increase the firm’s proclivity for corporate venture capital (CVC) investment. Second, the categorization granularity by top managers leads to more caution and decreases the firm’s proclivity for CVC investment. I analyzed US banks’ firms’ CVC investment in fintech start-ups from 2013 through 2021 and found that categorization breadth increases the level of a firm’s CVC investment in fintechs, and categorization granularity decreases the level of a firm’s CVC investment in fintechs. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Through two studies, a longitudinal repeated measures study of independent scientists and an interview study of gig and organizational workers paired in a variety of occupations, we examine how work relationships shape workers’ well-being in the gig economy and develop theory about how gig workers build relational infrastructure. Analysis of the longitudinal data reveals how relational challenges affect gig workers’ well-being. Analysis of the rich interview data shows that while organizational workers can rely on stable relationships, gig workers intentionally craft interactions with a variety of relational partners, including imagined interactions, to support their well-being. Mobilizing theory of social interaction and rituals, we demonstrate how these interactions, which we characterize as reaching out or reaching in, create positive energy and emotions that form the building blocks of gig workers’ relational infrastructure, ultimately helping workers cope with relational challenges.

In theory, performance appraisals aim to reflect an employee’s performance over a certain period of time. However, recent research shows that appraisals fall short in reaching this goal. Although many studies acknowledge the benefits of open-ended performance comments over closed-ended ratings on a scale, research has paid little attention to the potential of performance comments in achieving higher accuracy in performance evaluations. To approach this issue, we conducted a laboratory experiment and collected objective performance data as well as closed- and open-ended performance appraisals. In particular, we compile numerical ratings, written comments, and spoken comments on performance. To make the numbers and the texts comparable, we applied a Random Forest algorithm to transfer the comments into numerical ratings. Additionally, we conducted our analyses between and within teams to examine the evaluation behavior on different levels. By analyzing each rating (assigned and text-based) in relation to the performance, we find preliminary evidence that open-ended formats reflect performance most accurately within a team. Between teams, no appraisal format reflects performance accurately. Our results provide essential implications for conducting performance appraisals with informative value in terms of objective performance. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In this study, we examine how disruptors improve the diffusion of disruptive innovation by managing the complementor bottleneck.

However, the concept of Schumpeter's creative destruction, which suggests that value is created through the destruction of the old, conflicts with the idea of preserving a legacy. Additionally, intergenerational exchange is primarily viewed as a locus of conflict and resistance during succession rather than a means of transmitting the family's legacy. To address these contradictions between preserving a legacy and creative destruction, and between transmitive and resistive intergenerational exchange, we propose a model that combines life course theory and social exchange theory and distinguishes between two overlapping periods of life stages in which dyadic exchanges occur. Our model highlights the micro-mechanisms that shape the transmission of a legacy and the regulatory role of intergenerational reciprocity in influencing the legacy to become more creative or destructive. Our model offers a new perspective on how intergenerational exchange can allow a legacy to flow across multiple generations, and that such exchange can enable a family to engage in both creative and destructive behavior to foster their legacy's value. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, while a fair amount of coping literature both in psychology and management focuses on discrete adverse events (for example, bereavement, job loss, COVID, etc.), there is little research on how everyday actors cope with chronic conditions of adversity like intergenerational trauma. Our qualitative study studies the context of Indigenous entrepreneurs in the Canadian Prairies and endeavors to answer the question – How do everyday actors (specifically, everyday entrepreneurs) cope with intergenerational trauma? We find that Indigenous entrepreneurs in the Canadian Prairies experience everyday (chronic) emotional hurt by virtue of intergenerational trauma. This necessitates deployment of everyday coping strategies which would help mitigate this hurt. Notwithstanding instances of maladaptive coping (e.g., addictions and alcoholism), we find that Indigenous entrepreneurs predominantly leverage two broad categories of adaptive intra-personal coping mechanisms – subversive humor and restorative storytelling – that “undo” some of the negative effects of chronic emotional hurt. In addition to intra-personal coping strategies, we also find a set of inter-personal communal coping strategies which implicate family and community members (for example, cultural ceremonies and storytelling). As we analyzed these strategies, we came to realize that these coping strategies serve as micro-processes which underpin both emotion-work and institutional-work, i.e. not only help with emotional work but also help with routine disruption and (re)-creation of alternative institutions. Consequently our findings have implications for both coping literature as well as social symbolic work literature © 2023, Academy of Management.

Drawing on a social identity approach to leadership, we highlight that nonfamily leaders are key for advancing, creating, and embedding a shared sense of their followers with the family business after a succession. Based upon the concept of identity work, we are interested in the resources that nonfamily leader use to reflect and make sense of the successor’s novel leadership expectations and how identity work shapes their sense of self after a succession. Exploring the leadership succession in a German family business, we identify physical, behavioral and discursive resources as well as interactional work spaces of identity work. These resources carry projections of a desired self and expectations about the leadership behavior and help the leaders to develop their new leader identity. We contribute by theorizing how nonfamily leader identity work links identity leadership and the transmission of succession in family businesses. © 2023, Academy of Management.

The first is to describe and differentiate two distinct ways of valuing things: as exchangeable and as irreplaceable. We value something as exchangeable when we are prepared in principle to relinquish it for something else of sufficient value. By contrast, we value something as irreplaceable when we do not recognize relinquishing it as an option. The second is to provide a normative critique of business practices that commodify entities valued as irreplaceable by stakeholders. In particular, I argue that when a company’s stakeholders value something as irreplaceable, the company has a duty to avoid violating it (such as by destroying or damaging it, otherwise altering it, or withholding it from stakeholders, depending on what it is about the entity that the stakeholders value as irreplaceable). © 2023, Academy of Management.

In this research, we investigate how public employee make sense of these threatening events that may call into question organization’s core attributes and status and how it affects their attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on social identity theory and appraisal theory of emotions, we develop and test a model in which organizational identity induced by negative media coverage threat provokes shame which then results in exemplification as a constructive strategy to protect the threaten self. We further explain the role of public service motivation, that represent a close connection between the self and an organizational threat, as a moderator of the proposed mediated relationships. We tested our predictions across two studies: an experimental vignette study (Study 1) and a field study (Study 2) involving French police officers. Our results show that shame mediated the positive effect of organizational identity threat on police officers’ exemplification behaviors. We demonstrate that when public service motivation is high, police officers are more likely to engage in exemplification as a constructive response to cope with organizational identity threat compared to when it’s low because they are more likely to interpret the organizational threat as personally threatening.

However, the high turnover of migrant workers poses a threat to their productivity and imposes substantial costs on the supply chain. The current study aims to investigate the psychological processes underlying migrant workers’ turnover decisions. Based on the multiphase data of 512 Chinese migrants working in one of two factories, this study adopts a “push-pull” perspective to clarify how migrant workers make turnover decisions. This study finds that the organizational embeddedness of migrant workers is positively related to their retention decision satisfaction and negatively related to their turnover intention. Moreover, it is the retention decision satisfaction of migrant workers, rather than their turnover intention, that mediates the negative relationship between organizational embeddedness and voluntary turnover. Furthermore, migrant workers with jobs closer to home have higher levels of general adjustment and are subsequently more likely to have enhanced retention decision satisfaction and reduced turnover intention as a result of high levels of organizational embeddedness than those working in distant host cities. Overall, this study highlights how retention decision satisfaction arising from organizational embeddedness explains why migrant workers make retention decisions and how geographic distance weakens the effects of organizational embeddedness on retention decision satisfaction and turnover intention through general adjustment. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Our empirical analysis of 908 HF activism campaigns in the U.S. from 2010-2017 demonstrates that gender-diverse HFs face greater resistance from managers, get less support from other shareholders, and achieve lower activism returns. © 2023, Academy of Management.

TWO ROUTES TO TREBLE INNOVATION: FOCUSED OPEN INNOVATION OR EMERGENT DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190422812&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.125bp&partnerID=40&md5=8f05363371afcd65df0cf0e42cbee10c,"Service innovation is gaining traction and combined with more traditional product and process innovation is forming a triad of technological innovations. Firms that possess this triad simultaneously are known as treble innovation firms. Our study aims to analyse the antecedents of treble innovation. We draw on the complementary perspective and emergent strategy theoretical realms to propose two routes towards treble innovation. We argue that both open innovation and differentiation focus will increase the likelihood of becoming treble innovation in a subsequent period, but the effect of open innovation will be stronger for dual innovation firms, whereas the effect of differentiation focus will be stronger for non-innovators. We test our conceptual model using data from repeated Community Innovation Surveys administered to 1,081 Portuguese manufacturing SMEs in 2016 and 2018. We constraint our analysis to firms that were not treble innovators in 2016, so we could infer causal relationships between independent variables measured in 2016 and the probability to adopt treble innovation in 2018. The results advance our understanding on how technological innovation develops in manufacturing industry, including the relative importance of open innovation and differentiation strategies to complete a treble innovation portfolio in the future depending on their current innovation portfolio. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, the rate of innovation and technological change also depends on the ability of would-be innovators to generate new ideas. The social context in which people are located shapes the ways they can conceive of such opportunities. This paper analyzes how changes in a local social environment that increase openness and tolerance to diversity affect local innovation rates. I use historical patent data to identify county-level patent rates based on the location of inventors. I match this to data on the location of U.S. civil rights protests from 1960 to 1964 inclusive, during which time public participation in, and attention to, the Civil Rights Movement peaked. Prior research has found that local protests increased liberal social attitudes among the proximate population. In this paper, I show that areas in which there were local civil rights protests in the early-1960s subsequently experienced higher rates of innovation. I control for a range of demographic variables and use local precipitation as an instrument for protests to support a causal interpretation of my results. While the primary social value of the Civil Rights Movement is its hard-won gains for marginalized groups, my findings suggest that the changes brought about in local social context by the movement also led to increased innovation. The results demonstrate the importance of social norms and values to innovation. © 2023, Academy of Management.

GIG WORK AND ITS IMPACTS ON EXISTING HR AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE STRATEGIC ROLE OF HRM,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190403330&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.199bp&partnerID=40&md5=34548a9d63c9700312fd5008acca1d65,"Gig work describes a growing part of the labor market where workers are hired to do small, temporary jobs called ""gigs"" mostly using online digital platforms to manage supply and demand. It requires changes in the way we organize and manage work. The existing literature sheds light on the reasons why companies use Gig work and highlights the legal complexity due to the lack of classification of Gig workers. However, the organizational perspective, which examines the challenges and changes for HRM and other organizational actors have been largely neglected. The impact of Gig work is reflected in the organization of work, with the use of online platforms and algorithms, accompanied by numerous changes in terms of processes and systems. A key question is how this affects the day-to-day work and organizational HR responsibilities of the actors involved in the organization of work? To answer this complex question, we examined how Gig work changes HR practices and responsibilities, focusing on the role of not just the HR department but various internal and external organizational actors. Our analysis shows that the introduction of Gig work brings fundamental changes to the people management process, as the HR department has no longer the sole or even primary responsibility for carrying out HR practices. While technology is removing some of the tasks originally performed by HR, the role of the line manager is becoming more central and other actors such as procurement and, in some cases, dedicated platform managers get involved. Our research provides a detailed analysis of responsibility shifts, outlines new responsibilities arising with Gig work and highlights theoretical and practical recommendations for organizations introducing Gig work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL AS A METACOGNITIVE SKILL: AN ENTREPRENEURSHIP PERSPECTIVE,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190410433&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.10bp&partnerID=40&md5=3954da6b32d510492794614c9b77d530,"While the importance of households to entrepreneurship has long been acknowledged, little is known about how household members support the cognitive development of entrepreneurs. Based on a longitudinal, qualitative study, we find that household members help entrepreneurs challenge unproductive thought processes and instead develop psychological capital by practicing self-efficacious, optimistic, hopeful and resilient ways of thinking. In contrast to the prevailing view that these psychological assets are ‘state-like’, we reveal them to be higher-level cognitive capabilities. In focusing on the antecedents of psychological capital as a set of metacognitive skills, we demonstrate that its development is an agentic, interactive process, rather than a passively experienced condition. Our study also highlights the everyday and affective nature of this process by demonstrating that the cultivation of psychological capital relies upon daily interaction and emotional co-regulation within emotionally intimate relationships. Thus, our findings help articulate the socio-emotional foundations of entrepreneurial cognition and portray these as positive and stabilising, rather than encumbering. Furthermore, our study highlights how household members are uniquely positioned to help develop the cognitive capabilities of entrepreneurs. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Yet, this literature has largely ignored the return of industrial policies—i.e., governmental plans and activities to allocate public resources to private firms aligned with national objectives—as a new avenue for political activities. In this article, we redress this oversight from an IB perspective by examining Finnish industrial policy-making concerning export-oriented shipbuilding from 1952 to 2014. Drawing from neo-institutional theory, the empirical findings challenge the idea that the current rise of industrial policy is a temporary triumph of state interventionism over market ideology. Instead, the findings show the persistence of the operation over time although it occasionally took more hidden forms. We identify the industry’s multi-generational political strategy to work with political leaders to legitimize and coordinate industrial policy-making under the influence of multiple institutional pressures (geopolitics, supranational institutions, local society). Our primary contribution is to unpack the corporate political activity nature of industrial policy-making from an IB perspective. Moreover, the study responds to calls for incorporating historical methods in IB scholarship and demonstrates a key methodological potential: Exposing biases in current research paradigms. © 2023, Academy of Management.

To date, research on family firms in general and employment practices in particular has largely ignored this topic. Extant theory suggests that family firms do not to exhibit such practices, as they are guided by non-financial considerations and value relationships with their employees. However, we can show how family CEOs overcome family firm related constraints and ultimately decide to dismiss long-term employees. Building primarily on 62 interviews collected over 15 months, we map their sensemaking. First, we determine two sensemaking paths that differ in their underlying mechanisms and result. While one path is governed by an emotional mechanism leading to a fast and clear decision to dismiss, the other relies mainly on cognitive mechanisms causing a delayed and difficult dismissal decision through adaptive sensemaking. Second, we identify the four cognitive mechanisms that drive the adaptive sensemaking of family CEOs and let them overcome the constraints. These mechanisms are: exaggerate, redefine, rationalize and separate. We contribute to a better understanding of how family firm CEOs dismiss long-term employees, and also make transparent how the process of updating in adaptive sensemaking works. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, so far, our understanding of how shareholders shape divestitures is still limited as prior literature tends to neglect shareholders’ non-financial interests and does not provide detailed insights into the mechanisms through which shareholders affect a firm’s mode of divestiture. To address these shortcomings, we draw on a comparative case study of the four largest electric utility companies in Germany to investigate whether, how, and how fast they divested their coal business. We show that differences in firms’ divestiture strategies can be explained through differences in shareholders’ financial and non-financial interests, which, in turn, were closely related to the geographic distance between shareholders and firms’ operations. Specifically, we find that firms with geographically proximate shareholders had formed close supply, economic, philanthropic, and cultural ties with their shareholders that prevented radical divestitures. By developing a framework that explicates the detailed mechanisms through which shareholder ties hinder firm divestitures, we contribute to the growing body of literature dealing with non-financial motives in divestitures, research on strategic change and inertia, as well as the literature on grand challenges. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We augment previous methodological approaches with a novel method: matching successful and unsuccessful acquisition bids using the perceived risk of deal failure by using deal arbitrage spreads. Consistent with this argument, we find that bidding firms make more divestitures in sectors proximal to the target after a failed bid. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Therefore, we take a processual perspective on professionalization, studying it as a transformation toward a more rationalized, managerialized, and formalized organization through multiple practice adoption. Relying on a longitudinal single case study of a Swedish family firm that professionalized its business and family ownership domains, our processual analysis reveals unique types of professionalization and four practice interaction mechanisms through which organizations deal with tensions in the professionalization process. We contribute by conceptualizing a process model of professionalization, casting light on practice interaction mechanisms, and outlining implications of professionalization for organizational goals. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, how intractable conflicts are transformed has received little attention in the stakeholder engagement literature.

While prior research suggests a positive relationship between female board representation and LGBT-inclusive workplaces, it may not be easy for female directors who are underrepresented in most boards to influence the provision of trans-inclusive health benefits, a socially contested issue. We theorize that external factors like state-level trans-inclusive health laws and internal factors like proportion of young directors contribute to the ability of female directors to influence a firm’s decision to provide trans-inclusive health benefits. We use a hand-constructed dataset of Fortune 500 firms from 2008-2020 to investigate whether, and under what circumstances, female directors influence the provision of trans-inclusive health benefits. We find no association between the proportion of female directors and a firm’s likelihood to provide trans-inclusive health benefits. However, firms with a higher proportion of female directors are more likely to provide trans-inclusive health benefits when they are headquartered in states with higher number of trans-inclusive health laws and when they have more young directors on their boards. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of corporate boards in providing trans-inclusive health benefits. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Thus, it may be in the interest of organizations to ensure proactive employees’ promotability, because it gives proactive employees a sense of advancement and the intention to stay in their organizations. Relatedly, the relational perspective of proactivity suggests that proactive employees establish high-quality relationships with their leaders, which is conducive to their promotability. However, the proactivity literature also suggests that leaders may regard employees’ proactivity as a threat to their status at work, in which case the quality of leader-proactive employee relationships and, correspondingly, proactive employees’ promotability get damaged. In this research, we resolve this controversy by considering the role of leaders’ social dominance orientation (SDO). Building upon dominance complementarity theory and the literature on SDO, we suggest that proactive employees are unlikely to build high-quality relationships with high SDO leaders, which in turn negatively impacts proactive employees’ promotability. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a field study with three time separations and two data sources (employees and supervisors). Our findings provide support for our contentions. Overall, our research offers an alert to organizations that they need to be concerned with their leaders’ dispositional ideological perspectives such as SDO. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Social capital is an emerging concept in the management field. However, most of the research so far has focused on organization-level studies, viewed social capital as an end result, and emphasized its benefits. The study contributes to social capital theory by delving into the origin of social capital and understanding how it is formed at the workplace from an employee perspective. In-depth employee interviews were conducted, post which an inductive approach was used to analyse transcripts and identify novel themes. The study substantiates Dittrich & Seidl’s (2018) perspective on intentionality and highlights “purposeful” and “purposive” as the two ends of the intentionality spectrum that guide employee behaviours and actions toward building social capital at the workplace. While all employees recognized the benefits of social capital and admitted that it helps them, however, their actions toward building social capital have a varied sense of purpose. On one hand, employees with an orientation towards purposeful intentionality have clear, specific, and pre-established goals, and their actions are directed in anticipation of achieving these apriori goals such as career growth, project outcomes, favourable decisions, etc. These result in social ties with a mutual understanding of reciprocity. On the other hand, employees steered by purposive intentionality are guided by what they ought to do in a particular context by engaging in spontaneous and authentic acts of kindness such as offering help, giving advice, etc. These result in long-lasting relationships glued by the trust. Also, findings from the study suggest that virtual communication and negative asymmetry in relationships may intervene in the process of social capital formation. These perspectives open new avenues for further investigation and future research in social capital. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Drawing insights from cognitive dissonance theory, we suggest that firms must attend to their moral expectations to attract stakeholders’ contributions. If a firm violates these expectations even in unrelated activities, stakeholders will withdraw the engagement. The disengagement is greater if the stakeholders are less embedded in the community or they can find substitute projects. However, if stakeholders continue their engagement, we theorize that they will cognitively justify their decision and counterintuitively increase their engagement.

This, in turn, requires extending the analysis of EI to the system of actors and institutions that generate those resources. We use China’s venture financing system as a case to elucidate the process and find that it was “built” through multiple agency-emergence cycles. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In this study we try to overcome this limitation by studying whether nationality influences the evaluation of workers at time of hiring using data collected on all newly hired assistant professors of management and business administration in research-intensive (R1) universities in the Unites States between 2010 and 2021 (N = 452). We focus on the quality of the university into which recently graduated Ph.D. are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia (Asian nationals henceforth). We coded the publication record of assistant professor at time of hiring as well as a set of demographic characteristics of these hires. As expected, the ranking of the Ph.D. granting institution and the quality and quantity of the publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement. In addition, we find that conditional on Ph.D. granting institution and publication record, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. We also find that applicants who are Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a paper to narrow the placement gap. Overall, our results are best explained by a combination of direct discrimination against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance “burden of proof” from these applicants, compared to other applicants. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, when the tasks performed by humans are interrelated, there could be complementarities between tasks through the spillover of productivity. This paper investigates how the allocation of tasks between machines and humans changes when there are interdependencies between tasks performed by incumbent workers. I argue that human workers are likely to continue performing tasks that could get automated if those tasks act as a source of complementarities in the overall portfolio of tasks performed by the workers. I test my theory in the context of sell-side analysts in brokerage firms. I find that analysts are, on average, likely to drop coverage of stocks that are covered by Robo analysts. However, the probability that they drop coverage is lower when they cover a broader portfolio of stocks, measured by the number of industries covered by them. Further tests on the mechanism indicate that the coverage drop is driven largely by low-skill analysts. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Spanning over more than four decades of research, the concept and its dimensions have been deeply investigated. However, no meta-analysis has examined the psychometric properties of EO (reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, predictive validity) so far. This is particularly important given the popularity of EO in general and its most prominent measurement scale (Miller, 1983; Covin & Slevin, 1989) in particular. Hence, it is unknown under which circumstances this scale performs better or worse. Using 40 samples from 26 studies that capture over 12,000 responses, the present meta-analysis thus aims to fill this void by systematically investigating the psychometric properties of this scale and exploring multiple moderators. Combining the strength of meta-analysis with structural equation modelling, this study reveals in three steps that all properties are highly contextual. Based on these findings, we discuss consequences for scale development and point at further investigations needed to understand EO measurement. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We contend that stakeholders in the local community do not react only with resistance and boycotts and explore their positive agency. Through a qualitative single case study, we study how stakeholders from different institutions in the local community orchestrate collective resilience to cope with challenges that arise from a post-acquisition restructuring. Our study shows that the quality of their pre-existing relationships is a precursor to the initiation of non-contractual inter-organizational collaboration. Stakeholders form a common interest despite their different institutional affiliations and view their agency as crucial to overcome the restructuring. They coordinate tasks and actions by mobilizing each other’s prerogatives (knowledge, economic and political). We find that their agency has positive consequences on an array of stakeholders such as employees, higher education institutions and businesses. Our findings advance our understanding of the agency of local community stakeholders by illuminating the power of collective resilience.

Our interviews with women entrepreneurs in London (UK) show two forms that the ‘illusio’ manifests: ‘illusio of work-life balance’, and ‘illusio of meritocracy’ and illustrate the conditions of possibility and the various trade-off mechanisms through which gender inequality in entrepreneurship is reproduced or contested. © 2023, Academy of Management.

This option bundle contains several options awaiting recognition, which they call shadow options. In the technology space, these options are ‘shadow’ because they refer to alternative uses of those resources that were unknown when the resources were acquired or created. Despite a few examples and some anecdotal evidence highlighting the role of shadow options, there is no systematic discussion of how they emerge, how can be identified and managed. Our objective in this paper is twofold: first, we present a case study of an organization that has based its innovation strategy on a systematic use of shadow options. Second, drawing on the case study results, exaptation theory, Simon’s artifact model and Brian Arthur’s conceptualization of technology, we build a theory that links exaptation and shadow options. © 2023, Academy of Management.

More recently, managerial research has turned to AIM's linguistic attributes, showing that not only the content but also linguistics influence stakeholder perception. We add to this evolving stream by incorporating strategic linguistic tone, the difference between firms’ baseline tone and their strategic announcement tone, into the AIM literature. While linguistic disclosure tone has been investigated widely in management-adjacent disciplines, both its role as an AIM tactic and its effect on investors’ evaluation of strategic announcements is underexplored. We develop and test theory on a sample of 1859 acquisition announcements conducted by S&P500 companies between 2010 and 2019. Our results show that firms’ linguistic disclosure tone in acquisition announcements is higher than the firm’s regular baseline tone. These findings indicate that firms expecting negative reactions to acquisition announcements, increase their linguistic disclosure tone to attenuate negative repercussions. However, higher tone levels tend to negatively affect investor evaluation of acquisitions unless the linguistic disclosure tone can be bolstered by more substantive signals of acquisition success. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Innovations from developing markets that find application in advanced markets are defined as Reverse Innovations (RIs) as they flow against the direction assumed in traditional innovation theory. In the meantime, researchers have awarded important benefits to the pursuit of RI. Namely, from the commercialisation of RIs in advanced markets and the innovative contributions that developing economy-based R&D activities can hold for MNEs. Despite the increasing theoretical and practical relevance of RI, academic literature has failed to provide systematic approaches that MNEs can adopt to effectively manage the inversion of the flow of innovative knowledge. This paper fills that gap by adopting a knowledge-based view of the firm. Specifically, we investigate how MNEs manage their knowledge-sharing across developing and advanced economies to strategically enable explorative and exploitative RI. We do so through an abductive research approach based on interview data collected from thirty R&D executives of MNEs that operate in both developing and advanced economies. In correspondence to each phase of the RI process (von Zedtwitz et al., 2015), our study contributes to the RI literature by identifying the processes that are crucial for the systematic execution of RI.

However, the impact of workforce age diversity on organisational outcomes is yet to be fully understood. In this study, we focus on the link between workforce age diversity and innovation performance, owing to the importance of innovation for organisations and society. We argue that the distribution type of workforce age diversity (that is, variety and polarisation) guides when and why workforce age diversity's positive and negative innovation effects materialise. More specifically, the heterogeneity of age groups in age-varying workforces leads to positive innovation effects because it augments the amount of idiosyncratic knowledge, skills, and networks available to organisations. Age differences as a basis for social categorisation and fragmentation are maximised in age-polarised workforces, thus generating negative innovation effects. We also introduce societal tolerance as a force that should switch ""on"" the positive effects of workforce age variety and ""off"" the negative effects of workforce age polarisation. Drawing on UK higher education as the empirical setting, we find full support for our theoretical framework. We use our findings in order to devise practical implications. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Yet relatively little is known about the manner in which scientific and technological knowledge develop and coalesce into larger structures that enable or constrain future breakthroughs. Network science has recently emerged as a framework for measuring the structure and dynamics of knowledge. While helpful, existing approaches struggle to capture the global properties of the underlying networks, leading to conflicting observations about the nature of scientific and technological progress. We bridge this methodological gap using tools from algebraic topology to characterize the higher-order structure of knowledge networks in science and technology across scale. We observe rapid growth in the higher-order structure of knowledge in many scientific and technological fields. This growth is not observable using traditional network measures. We further demonstrate that the emergence of higher-order structure coincides with decline in lower-order structure, and has historically far outpaced the corresponding emergence of higher-order structure in scientific and technological collaboration networks. Up to a point, increases in higher-order structure are associated with better outcomes, as measured by the novelty and impact of papers and patents. However, the nature of science and technology produced under higher-order regimes also appears to be qualitatively different from that produced under lower-order ones, with the former exhibiting greater linguistic abstractness and greater tendencies for building upon prior streams of knowledge. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Crowd-based digital platforms have been touted as an avenue to address this informational challenge. However, there remains a fundamentally unsubstantiated assumption regarding the efficacy of such platforms to capture and aggregate crowd information in a way that enhances product innovation success. We examine the extent to which innovation crowdsourcing communities enable firms to gauge demand preferences and unmet needs as manifested in two key ideation outputs: idea popularity and novelty. We theorize and empirically test the implications of these two attributes for product innovation performance. Our findings shed light on the role of digital platforms as a useful aggregator of market information and shift the emphasis from the ideation phase of crowds’ knowledge engagement to their value proposition in the market. © 2023, Academy of Management.

THE HIDDEN VALUE OF EXPOSURE IN CROWDSOURCING: SOLVER PARTICIPATION AND POST-CONTEST RETRIBUTIONS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190410863&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.82bp&partnerID=40&md5=d40e50f7f812c882fd2115c8dcd4956b,"Solver participation is crucial for the success of crowdsourcing. However, what happens to participants after the contest ends? Drawing upon research on stimulus recognition, we theorize that solver participation heightens exposure, generating post-contest retributions. We also analyze how the solver strategy and professional status influence this effect. Drawing upon over 20,000 healthcare contests, we find that solvers’ participation results in post-contest paid retributions, especially when submitting multiple solutions over multiple periods and distributing them over several days. Surprisingly, status factors have only a weak moderating effect. These findings reveal the hidden effect of solver participation in post-contest crowdsourcing rewards. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We use a formal model to develop our hypotheses, which we test on a sample of the largest US-listed pharmaceutical firms between 1999 and 2021.

This is relevant because it could allow entrepreneurs to focus on the few elements that are really meaningful to develop their ventures, rather than on too many elements which create unmanageable complexity and waste.

‘NOT MY CEO’: EMPLOYEE REACTIONS TO THE THREAT OF FEMALE LEADERSHIP,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190418755&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.103bp&partnerID=40&md5=77a7854db8431522128d948f0d0b37bb,"We explore the impact of gender on a CEO’s ability to garner the support of their employees. Employing the lens of group competition theory to understand the female leadership penalty, we theorize that negative reactions toward women in senior positions are motivated in part by the perceived threat these women pose to the existing gender hierarchy. As women increasingly move into positions previously held by men, and as diversity programs lead to shifts in the balance of power, gender is likely to become more salient and trigger negative reactions. Exploiting data from close to a million employee reviews of U.S. listed firms from Glassdoor.com, we show that female CEOs receive lower employee approval ratings compared to male CEOs, and that this is driven primarily by male employees. Our results are robust to controls for firm performance, reviewer ratings of employment conditions, as well as indicators of managerial quality as measured by educational credentials, board memberships, and other achievements. We further find that the organization’s diversity ratings moderate the relationship between CEO gender and employee approval, such that female CEOs are especially penalized among firms that have made substantial progress in promoting women and minorities.

Willamson’s canonical definition of self-interest seeking with guile contains a broad range of opportunistic behaviors. We argue that opportunism is a multi-dimensional concept and study which aspects of the different opportunistic behaviors have the most harmful consequences in inter-organizational relationships. We combine qualitative content analysis with meta-analysis and investigate the survey data of 178 primary studies at the item level. In the first step, we synthesize a taxonomy of the dimensions of opportunism. In the second step, we meta-analytically test the dimensions’ moderating effects on the relationships between opportunism-performance and opportunism-trust. The results show that certain aspects of behaviors – the type of claim violation, the degree of activity, the disclosure certainty, and the behavioral medium – determine how strongly opportunism harms performance and trust. Our study offers a taxonomy of the dimensionality of inter-organizational opportunism and compares the aspects of organizational behaviors that have the most harmful consequences. It further provides an empirical synthesis of the consequences of opportunism.

Positioning our research in a postfeminist sensibility, we explore implicit and explicit expectations and obligations through psychological contracts (PC) theory. We conducted interviews across two semi-professional sport leagues, with 30 athletes, 20 coaches and managers and two league level representatives. Three themes emerged: 1. Obligations, commitment, and choice: whereby athletes felt obliged to deliver a professional product while not receiving commensurate remuneration; while employers noted they expected time and effort commitments to increase in line with salary. 2. Expectations of conformity: Rules of the game: athletes felt obligated to be positive role models and grateful for the chance to play for pay; and employers wanted athletes to ‘act’ professionally. 3. Fulfilling organisational goals: athletes took on emotional responsibility for the league’s success; correspondingly employers placed accountability on athletes for fan and community engagement. Many athletes struggled to balance their time commitments and power imbalances in the PC were evidenced as employers relied on athletes’ desire to play at almost any cost. Athletes felt they had little choice but to accept the current state of employment, endure sacrifices and hope for a future when they could reach their potential through viable career pathways and a living wage. Our research provides a better understanding of the PC employment relationship. Greater knowledge about PC’s could be used to develop work practices and relations that enhance and benefit both athlete and employer. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Drawing on an inductive field study situated at the interface between the organization operating one of the world's largest digital labor platforms and (prospective) clients, we show that firms can follow different pathways to platform adoption. Our study provides more nuanced findings than previous literature on B2B platform adoption, showing how the potential changes in organizational roles and power relations create trade-offs, with no outcome being the ‘perfect one’ as intended by the platform provider. Our findings thus uncover the interplay and tensions between organizational roles and power dynamics in the face of new technology adoption, showing how B2B platforms—intended to help certain occupational groups in organizations—‘get stuck’ in the adopting organization in different ways depending on their locus of entry and the subsequent power battles they create.

We maintain that an MNC can mobilize its political resources and capabilities in the home country through their CDAs to increase the host government’s bargaining power vis-à-vis the home country and, in return, obtain business benefits in the host country. The MNC’s CDAs, however, can also become a source of risk: the host government can use the MNC’s political resources at home to increase its bargaining power vis-à-vis the host government by taking “hostage” the MNC’s sunk investments in the host country to compel the MNC to work on its behalf in the home country and, in this way, outsource foreign policy to a powerful actor in the home country.

In turn, the bottom-up-driven processes in which the constituents are in authority and their interplay with the government and the social movements remains poorly understood. We perform an inductive case study of the Swiss Responsible Business Initiative, through which a movement sought to incorporate the principal’s liability legal norm into national law with the aim to increase the MNCs’ accountability for irresponsible conduct. We develop novel theory on the critical role of the government’s authority spillover for shaping whom the constituents accept as an authority. Because it provoked the constituents’ adoption of the countermovement’s (and not the movement’s) framing of the legal norm, the constituents eventually failed to adopt the legal norm into national law. Our study contributes to the literatures on the hardening of business responsibility, policy diffusion, and social movements. © 2023, Academy of Management.

By integrating research on organizational impression management and online customer service recovery, our research adds insight into different types of responses and their effects on potential job seekers. We employed text mining techniques to first identify distinct types of employer responses to positive and negative reviews observed on a major social media platform. Findings from our experiment based on vignettes created from topic modeling suggest that responding to reviews had significant positive effects on organizational attraction, and responding to negative reviews specifically resulted in additional significant positive effects on intentions to apply and employer reputation. Drawing on signaling theory, we further uncover that such responses improved perceptions of organizational competence, warmth, and sincerity when potential applicants read reviews with an employer response (versus no response). Warmth, in particular, mediated the effect of responses on both attraction and application intentions. We also found apologies to be the most effective response to negative reviews and exemplification to be the most effective response to positive reviews. Taken as a whole, our study suggests that organizations should invest in responding strategically to online reviews by employees, past and present. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Our county-level fixed effects survival analysis identifies three mechanisms explaining human service nonprofits’ dissolution, using 2007-2018 data from multiple sources - National Center for Charitable Statistics, Census, American Community Survey, MIT Election Lab, and Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates. We clarify how ecological selection processes relate to nonprofit dissolution occur within communities over time. Specifically, first, at the macro-level, an improving political environment and worsening economic and social environments within communities associate with a greater likelihood of nonprofit dissolution. Second, at the meso-level, as the environment becomes increasingly competitive, nonprofits are more likely to dissolve. Third, at the micro-level, nonprofits’ resource management competencies still relate to a lower likelihood of dissolution. These findings extend research on nonprofit organizations’ life and death by showing turbulent and multi-level relationships of ecological and organizational factors constituting the human service delivery system with human service nonprofit dissolution in the United States. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Emotional labor, where individuals must regulate their emotions for a wage, is common to these jobs but shows mixed effects on alcohol use. We seek to remedy these mixed findings by testing predictions from the process model of depletion, along with felt inauthenticity as an additional mechanism based on the social interaction model of emotional labor. Results from a two-week experience sampling study of customer service workers indicated that both depletion and inauthenticity explained the link between surface acting and problematic drinking. We also explored boundary conditions, finding that trait dominance buffered the inauthenticity pathway consistent with the social interaction model, while trait self-control did not moderate the depletion pathway contrary to regulatory depletion predictions. These findings advance the emotional labor literature by highlighting the importance of motivational shifts in line with the process model of depletion, and the role of felt inauthenticity as an important but often ignored mechanism explaining the link between surface acting and health. © 2023, Academy of Management.

While a wealth of literature has explored the employee experience, scholars have paid much less attention to the management of meaning, particularly prior to an employee joining an organization. Further, scholarship attending to the normative considerations of meaningful work is typically relegated to the philosophical. In this study, we discuss the impact of not attending to the “worth” of the work in assessments of meaningful work. This discussion leads to our examination of how companies engaged in normatively non-meaningful work portray themselves as subjectively meaningful places to work to potential (and current) employees. Specifically, we use a grounded theory approach to categorize the meaning portrayal efforts of 34 publicly-traded companies in sin industries (tobacco, alcohol, and gaming). Our findings highlight nine second-order themes reflective of two aggregate dimensions – meaning from role characteristics and meaning from organizational characteristics. Implications for the management of meaning, the continued assessment of meaningful work through a normative lens, and individual applicant assessment of companies are discussed. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, its uncertainty can also put great pressure on entrepreneurs to try to obtain success at all costs, even behaving unethically.

In this qualitative study incorporating 92 interviews of entrepreneurs and investors, we delve into entrepreneurs’ perception of the ethical line in entrepreneurship, the factors affecting that perception, and how entrepreneurs navigate entrepreneurial gray areas. In doing so, we develop a process model of entrepreneurial ethical discernment, contributing to the literature on entrepreneurship, ethics, and decision-making. © 2023, Academy of Management.

RELATIONAL WORK – INDIAN WOMEN DOMESTIC WORKERS NAVIGATING QUOTIDIAN WORK CHALLENGES,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190422192&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.269bp&partnerID=40&md5=a9414e1c19e37591fd62b34e7944fff6,"This article uses the lens of relational work to explore the work-related challenges faced by women domestic workers in India and understand how they navigate through them. Based on the relational dynamics with their household employers, two types of domestic workers were identified – first the Servile Appeasers and second the Tactful Assertors. We noted that the servile appeasers ended up working on more tasks than required, without necessarily gaining from the relational ties and/or pecuniary benefits. Moreover, tactful assertors when compared with servile appeasers, did not face the burden of enhanced expectations of their employers. In the context of informal work arrangement, our study helps to gain insights into understanding Relational work leading to Internal Segmentation and Material Supplementation. Internal segmentation denotes the division created by domestic workers amongst themselves, on the basis of the household tasks they perform and the social status of the household employers they serve. Material supplementation involves gaining materialistically from household employers and peers. Conceptually, we introduce a deeper insight on how the relational work dynamics, prevalent in the informal sector of the Global South, enable or constrain women domestic workers in navigating through the challenges in their routine work. © 2023, Academy of Management.

How Social Exchange Theory Privileges Men Leaders,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190410405&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.285bp&partnerID=40&md5=379b32af9342da61f07d9fe502d3d9f7,"Social exchange theory has become synonymous with leadership research seeking to explain why positive leader behaviors elicit positive follower behavior. This is based on an argument that when leaders display positive behaviors to the followers, followers reciprocate in return due to feelings of obligation. Yet, leadership research continuously overlooks how gender role expectations may influence followers’ perceptions of leader behavior. Given its widespread use within leadership research, and organizational studies more broadly, such oversight may negatively influence the fields progression. Against this backdrop, this study examines how gender (dichotomized due to the sample as women or men) differences in helping expectations may disrupt leader-follower social exchange relationships. Drawing on data from a multi time-point survey (n = 171), we hypothesize and find that men leaders who engage in helping behaviors elicit follower reciprocation in the form of felt obligation and task helping, but not women leaders. Our findings illuminate how organizational research reliance on older theories may be insufficient to understand today’s workforce and highlight the need to reimagine existing theoretical frameworks within leadership research for a more inclusive workforce. © 2023, Academy of Management.

We exploit migration patterns of primary care physicians in Massachusetts over a span of eight years by tracking physician migrations to practice sites comprised of new peers. We examined whether a patient’s likelihood of receiving an inappropriate referral for diagnostic imaging, specifically an MRI, was associated with a change in a physician’s work environment. Study results indicate that migrating physicians did change their practice style for imaging soon after migration in conformance with the prevailing practice style of their new peer group, which directly influenced a patient’s likelihood of receiving an inappropriate MRI. Physician practice style appeared malleable in either direction – more or less likely to deviate from evidence-based standards based on the new prevailing practice style of their new peer group. The effect did diminish with greater variability within the new peer group for inappropriate MRI referral rates. The results suggest that healthcare managers can influence physician behavior in the direction of evidence-based practice by adopting strategies directed towards developing strong peer influence in physicians’ work environments. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Drawing on social learning theory, we further predict that family firm leaders’ engagement in UPB increases the likelihood that their subordinates will also engage in group-level UPB. We find support for these predictions, except for the trickle-down effects of SEWe. Theoretical and practice implications are discussed. © 2023, Academy of Management.

To address this gap, we conducted longitudinal case studies of eight U.S. health care organizations adjusting operations through successive phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discovered these adjustments demonstrated considerable variety during different phases of the pandemic, even when made by the same leaders in similar situations. We explain this variety through an inductively derived process model of organizing for resilience that traces how the enactment of different adverse situations leads to alternative modes of adjustment that target different resilience outcomes. In contrast to definitions that imply resilience entails both absorbing strain and preserving functioning, our study shows these, along with a third resilience outcome of anticipating and preparing for immanent threat, exist in three-way tension. Leaders must trade off one in pursuit of others. How leaders perceive the relative adversity of conditions and the alignment of organizational capabilities with those conditions shapes this trade-off and modes of adjustment made in pursuit of one, or at most a mix of two, of these three resilience outcomes. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Breadth moves change the goal or the description of the context, barriers, and path to solution; depth moves link goal planes and description planes.

We find a number of contingencies and progress catalysts that facilitate the productive convergence on the venture’s business case as well as contribute to the build-up of entrepreneurial capital. A major intake contingency is technology readiness, which impacts to what extent lean principles can be beneficially applied in their original prescriptions. We find that specific creative method adaptations and judgement-supporting coaching interventions are furthermore key to increase program engagement and learning. Our insights contribute to practical concerns of accelerator program design but also offer new insights for the theorising on lean startup and entrepreneurial experimentation. © 2023, Academy of Management.

In this paper, I argue that organizational members engage in temporal work to shape and change their organization discursively. I adopt an abductive approach aiming at theory elaboration. An empirical material consists of organizational members' change talk on the corporation's internal social media discussion board when the organization went through significant changes. The study explores how organizational members address organizational goals by constructing different future narratives. The findings illustrate how organizational members provide solutions to change an unsatisfactory present and create 'if-then' plans to achieve the organizational goals and aim to have a controllable future during organizational transformation. I argue that participation in online conversations reflects organizational members' proactivity in goal-striving. Therefore, they engage in future-making. © 2023, Academy of Management.

PARTICIPATORY STRATEGY MAKING AS DUAL SENSEMAKING PROCESS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190406577&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.116bp&partnerID=40&md5=7b217779f1315682d69b680d0fc019b2,"Existing studies on strategic sensemaking have focused on traditional top-down strategy-development processes where senior managers select cues and apply their knowledge frames during activities of strategy formulation (i.e. sensemaking) and later attempt to impose this sense on others during activities of strategy implementation (i.e. sensegiving). Over the last few years, we can observe a trend towards increasing participation of change recipients in the strategy-development process, often also referred to as “Open Strategy”, which is likely to have profound implications for the strategic sensemaking process. Thus, we will focus on the following exploratory research question: How does strategic sensemaking unfold in participatory strategy processes? To address this research question, we draw on data from a 13-month longitudinal, in-depth case study of an international financial company, which introduced Open Strategy by including 20 lower-level employees throughout the strategy process. We report three main findings which contribute to both the strategic sensemaking as well as the Open Strategy literature: First, we find that strategic sensemaking is a dual process which consists of two distinct types of sensemaking, sensemaking of the strategy content and sensemaking of the strategy process, and we reveal how these two sensemaking types are interrelated. Second, we identify different sensemaking patterns (i.e. (re-)framing participation, displacing cues, aligning cues) which strategy actors initiate to align the two sensemaking processes and enable strategy work. Third, we show that resistance in strategic sensemaking is not only related to sensemaking of the strategy content, as extensively discussed by previous literature, but also to sensemaking of the strategy process. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Recently, studies focused on the cognition of chief executive officers (CEOs) and top management team (TMT) members to explain incumbents’ innovativeness. However, less attention has been paid to the shared cognition at the CEO-TMT interface, even though, the entire top management is essential in implementing radical strategic initiatives. Relying on a social-interactionism view of the CEO-TMT interface, we study the effects of CEO-TMT shared cognition on incumbents’ attainment of radical technological innovation. We test our hypothesis on 411 S&P500 firms between 2006 and 2017. We hypothesize and find that CEO-TMT shared cognition positively affects incumbents’ pursuit of radical innovation, up to a certain point, at which shared cognition negatively affects incumbents’ pursuit of radical innovation. We posit that the positive effect persists due to increasing CEO-TMT cohesion and concomitant confidence in pursuing high-risk business endeavors such as radical innovation. After a certain point, these positive effects become outweighed by the negative effect of groupthink, which limits divergent thinking and creativity, which are paramount for radical innovation. Our study develops the understanding of radical innovation within incumbent firms and contributes to the literature on shared leadership at the CEO-TMT interface. © 2023, Academy of Management.

However, firms’ mental representations—their perception of which domains are appropriate for their capabilities—can be incomplete. I examine a scenario where firms receive an external representation of knowledge landscape by a public scientific map. I propose that the external representation reveals cross-domain similarities based on a new dimension, informing firms that some unexplored domains previously deemed distant may, in fact, be local to their existing domains. I hypothesize that firms will enter these new local domains because transferring existing technologies is less costly than developing new technologies to enter distant domains where other firms may be advantageous. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a public initiative that comprehensively mapped genomes of 32 cancers, I find that likelihood of entering a domain ex-post TCGA increases for firms whose existing domains are revealed local to that domain due to genetic similarities. I also find that this increase varies by the number of new local domains and potential entrants. This work extends our understanding of search by showing how distant search in one representation may be local search in another, informing how firms’ mental representations shape search. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Some studies even suggest enriching effects from multiple jobholding. We draw on role theory and identity theory to suggest that it is the level of identification with each job which determines whether multiple jobholders and their romantic partners will experience depleting or enriching outcomes from this job arrangement. The results from our multi-source data suggest that higher identification across multiple jobs (“plural identification”) is positively associated with the multiple jobholder’s job satisfaction, engagement, and well-being, and negatively associated with emotional exhaustion. Experienced enrichment across jobs mediates the relationship between plural identification and these outcomes, while conflict does not. Moreover, we found that plural identification has a positive association with romantic partners’ perceptions of social support, also mediated through enrichment. However, plural identification had simultaneous and opposite effects on partners’ perceptions of relationship quality. Specifically, plural identification was positively associated with relationship quality through enrichment, but it also had a negative direct effect.

We then leverage an empirical exercise to show how not properly accounting for undetected misconduct can bias interpretation. In so doing, we illustrate that conventional methods can lead to problematic results and show how to overcome this issue using alternative estimation methods.

To redress these problematic assumptions, we advance the Normative Schema Theory of Leadership Functions. We empirically demonstrate normative schemata significantly influence leadership perceptions and are distinct from existing constructs.

We reveal a set of dynamic capabilities, underlying two meta-capabilities, strategic sensitivity and resource fluidity, which underpin the skills-matching process and enable strategic agility. In doing so, we shift the focus of talent management towards skills acquisition and development, and emphasise the need to look beyond traditional learning and development to alignment across the wider talent function. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Building on ideo-attribution effect, we develop an explanation concerning the role of CEO political ideology in determining target resistance. We argue that the more liberal (versus conservative) the target CEOs are, the more likely they will attribute the causes of HFA to contextual factors over which they may perceive little control and personal responsibility, which then leads to the target firms’ higher level of resistance to activists. This impact of CEOs’ political ideology is contingent on their perceived activism uncertainty and managerial discretion. In a sample of U.S. public firms from 2009 to 2020, we find support for our contentions.

We show how multiple actors engage in contradictory yet interrelated practices that fuel paradoxical dynamics and finally create a non-optimal but stable equilibrium that inhibits system change. We explore this process through a longitudinal ethnography study on the implementation of the “Forecast-based-Financing” approach in Uganda; an approach that shall initiate early action in anticipation of disasters. Our findings reveal how stakeholders’ implementation practices drive paradoxical dynamics that constitute self-reinforcing dynamics. Drawing on these insights, we develop a process model that explains how paradoxical dynamics not only hinder the tackling of the grand challenge but stabilize each other, contributing to a path dependent development. We contribute to theory in at least two ways: first, we theorize how addressing grand challenges instigates an interplay of paradoxical dynamics which create non-optimal but stable, path dependent equilibria on a system level which are difficult to change. Second, we introduce a dynamic perspective on paradoxes, thereby moving beyond the perspective of stable paradox poles that can be embraced. © 2023, Academy of Management.

The dominant explanation has been grounded in a gender-role incongruity perspective, which assumes that women internalize stereotypes about the incongruity between women’s attributes and those of entrepreneurs. We question this assumption and propose a markedly distinct account centering on the gender difference in gender egalitarian (GE) ideology. GE ideology refers to the belief and value systems that support equal rights, roles, and responsibilities for men and women, and oppose the notion that men and women have innately different roles. Our key contention is that women tend to hold higher GE ideology than men, which makes them more likely to reject entrepreneurship as they disapprove the gender inequality inherent in entrepreneurship. We further build on intersectionality research to theorize the boundary condition that the gender gap in entrepreneurship via GE ideology is contingent upon other social category attributes (e.g., social class, race). Two studies—Study 1 based on secondary data of 14,030 individuals from 25 provinces in China, and Study 2 based on primary data of 1,084 individuals from 16 countries—together support our theory and its generalizability. © 2023, Academy of Management.

This study assesses how managers integrate selection information produced by algorithms into assessments of job candidates’ qualifications to make the hiring decisions. To assess how algorithm-based decision aids are used, we first investigate how individual characteristics of managers influence their perceived usefulness of algorithm selection information. We then examine how managers rate applicant employability when they are given different types of jobs (HR Assistant vs. Data Engineer) and algorithm-based selection information. Results showed that younger managers and managers with experience using these systems perceived algorithm-based decision aids useful. The same relationships were found when managers rated employability of applicants using information from both resumes and algorithm-based decision aids. Managers were less likely to see algorithm-based information as useful if they reported algorithm aversion, but no less likely to use the information when assessing candidates. Finally, we found that applicant information from algorithm-based decision aids had more influence on manager ratings of employability when the job requires more technical skills than when the job requires more soft skills.

CULTURE-RELATED LINGUISTIC SKILLS AND SKILLED MIGRANTS’ INTEGRATION IN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,2023,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188422043&doi=10.5465%2fAMPROC.2023.94bp&partnerID=40&md5=d980d764749c4259947cce57a78b8267,"International business (IB) research suggests that employees with high corporate language proficiency are more integrated into workplaces in multinational corporations (MNCs). Yet, culture-related language skills have received less attention in IB research. This study uses the language attitude perspective and interviews with 168 skilled migrants (SMs) to examine how and why culture-related language differences affect SMs’ workplace integration in local MNCs in Japan. Our analysis shows that three culture-related language differences – honorifics, indirect expressions, and empathic expressions – increased SMs’ categorization as outgroup members by local employees and negative evaluations in terms of their professional and managerial abilities. Despite having high general local language proficiency, the disadvantaged positions of SMs were sustained in MNCs due to negative evaluations of actual/perceived differences in cultural-related language skills by local employees. © 2023, Academy of Management.

Despite the prevalence of anti-work sentiments among real workers, little extant research has investigated if “anti-work” is just a pop culture label applied to workers who are dissatisfied with present economic and working conditions, or if it is a new, meaningful construct. In this paper, I address this problem by conceptualizing anti-work orientation as a new construct with strong normative traditions, defined as a contentious rejection of the belief that work is foundational to one’s self-worth or worth to society. I differentiate anti-work orientation from related concepts (e.g., alienation, work centrality, anti-capitalism) and identify its unique relationships with antecedents (low status, work beliefs, and repeated justice violations) and outcomes (counterproductive and organizational citizenship behavior). In a two-part mixed-method study, Study 1 uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to code a qualitative dataset of 189,436 posts from the Reddit anti-work community and reveal themes of status, injustice, work and meaning. Study 2 validates a new scale of anti-work orientation, finding across two independent samples that this orientation is common in full-time working US adults, distinct from related constructs, and holds unique relationships. © 2023, Academy of Management.

The Perils of Pay Variability: Determinants of Worker Aversion to Variable Compensation in Low and Middle Wage Jobs,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188136010&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.111&partnerID=40&md5=41a1fb83e08dda20ab48ce2cca573eff,"As employers sought to abdicate their role as the primary risk bearer in employment relationships, they increasingly relied upon variable compensation systems to shift market risks onto individual workers. In doing so, a substantial proportion of the current labor force became prone to experiencing paycheck dispersion, defined as variance in earnings from paycheck to paycheck. Here, we combine multiple sources of qualitative and quantitative data to explore the organizational consequences of paycheck dispersion. Exploratory interviews and surveys from a sample of ride-hailing drivers (N = 63) revealed that workers are broadly averse to paycheck dispersion and constantly look for strategies that could effectively mitigate it. Combining the insights from this data with cognitive appraisal theory, we subsequently proposed that paycheck dispersion will increase voluntary turnover, but only to the extent that workers appraise it as a threat to their welfare. Accordingly, we anticipated two boundary conditions to this relationship: (a) workers’ perceived ability to manipulate their earnings through their own actions and (b) the economic composition of their household. Using matched individual-level survey and archival data from a sample of truck drivers (N = 711) employed by a national transportation company, we found that paycheck dispersion is positively associated with the likelihood of turnover, though this relationship varied along the predicted boundary conditions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that shifting market risk onto workers through variable compensation can compromise organizations by jeopardizing the retention of human capital. © 2022, Academy of Management.

THE HIDDEN COST OF FLAT HIERARCHIES ON APPLICANT POOL DIVERSITY: EVIDENCE FROM EXPERIMENTS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188128467&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.4&partnerID=40&md5=c81300339da1f6bb2425e9a24630a7af,"This paper investigates how an organization's formal hierarchy affects the gender composition of its applicant pool. One perspective based on theories of gendered organizations suggests that, because women may perceive ""flat"" organizational structures with few hierarchical levels as egalitarian alternatives to traditional tall hierarchies that reinforce male dominance, these flat structures may disproportionately attract female applicants and thus ameliorate workplace gender segregation and inequality. However, we argue that flat hierarchies may reduce the gender diversity in the applicant pool because, compared to men, women will perceive flat hierarchies to offer fewer career advancement opportunities, to be more difficult to fit into, and to saddle them with more work. Using a field experiment with 8,400 job candidates, we show that job postings featuring a flat hierarchy decrease female representation in the applicant pool by 25%. Our follow-up survey experiment with 9,000 subjects suggests that this decrease in female attraction corresponds with cross-gender differences in perceived career advancement opportunities, fit, and workload. These results imply that the growing trend of flat hierarchies could inadvertently exacerbate workplace inequality and gender segregation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Based on impression management and psycholinguistic literature, we conduct interviews and hypothesize on four distinct strategies employed in the financial communication of firms. We test their use in a sample of German firms, half of them found to misrepresent their accounts. The results document manipulations through contents, language, and visualizations of shareholder letters. Misrepresenting firms omit financial topics, increase the complexity of their communication, and use pictures more frequently. Unexpectedly, we find shareholder letters of misrepresenting firms also to reveal strong psycholinguistic leakages of emotional discomfort and self-distancing that even permeate carefully crafted artifacts of corporate communication. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The research hypotheses are tested based on a sample of 333 Russian SMEs. The results suggest that CEOs whose personal identities are rooted in objectivism values, are less likely to develop social responsibility within their firms.

Using semi-structured interviews with diverse stakeholders, a national survey on 525 corporate activist statements, and two pre-registered experiments, we find that the public generally supports corporate activism, but that a firm’s type and moral authenticity substitute each other in shaping both attitudes (support for and intention to join) and behaviors (donation and writing letters of support). We contribute to social movement theory by bringing in organizational theories of authenticity to add nuance to our expectations about public support for corporate activism, and we extend research on organizational authenticity by showing an interaction between type and moral authenticity. © 2022, Academy of Management.

A historical case study of ServiceMaster was conducted, examining the leadership of C. William Pollard, who was known for promoting the purpose of the company to include honoring God and helping people to develop. Documents, such as lectures and books by or about Pollard, were analyzed and codified, and two interviews were conducted. Our findings resulted in three propositions: First, an emphasis on an inclusive workplace spirituality decreases the tension between profit and developing people and can even encourage synergy between the two. Second, despite the importance of metrics, the intense pressures for short-term results can decrease the focus on people, but an emphasis on an inclusive workplace spirituality, undertaken with transparency and humility, can minimize the problem. Finally, when workplaces encourage people to engage their whole selves, including their spirituality at work, employees experience significance and satisfaction in their work, regardless of the nature of the job. These workplace experiences positively affect service excellence and, consequently, profit.

Leveraging a longitudinal dataset of more than 11,000 manufacturing facilities in the US in which I match the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) facility toxic emissions data with the location’s census immigration data, I document the negative impact of local immigrant populations on a facility’s environmental performance, which strengthens as heterogeneity among immigrant increases. I argue that this is because a more heterogeneous community is less cohesive and hence less capable of organizing effective pressures against pollution. Further, I show that because co-nationality links create unique bonds between the facility and local immigrants, the negative relationship declines as more immigrants originate from the same home country as a facility’s parent firm. These results are robust to the use of an instrumental variable approach and a wide variety of alternative specifications and subsamples. These findings suggest that local community pressures may be limited in driving better environmental outcomes. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We further argue that the strength of this relationship depends on the likelihood of conflict across faultlines, the availability of an alternative impartial leader on the board, and the salience of pressures from outside the board.

To understand this uncertain process, we zoom-in on anticipation work, that is how (top)managers use narratives to shape actors' digital technology understandings and expectations for the future. While current literature focus on the efforts by top managers in articulating appealing visions in the earliest stages of the transformation process, we provide a processual account revealing anticipation work as an ongoing activity. To develop our argument, we report from a digital transformation initiative in a Danish local government organization that involved high hopes, delays, and emerging conflicts. We show how anticipation work unfolded and altered over time and infer three types of forward-looking narratives: prognostic, setback and persisting narratives. This focus helps understand why digital transformation leadership in public organizations is a complex endeavor requiring ongoing anticipation work in which narratives need to be adapted to emerging and unforeseen situations. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In general, scholars have viewed time pressure as a characteristic intrinsic to the job which-in isolation or jointly with other job facets—relates to employees’ strain. This common operationalization of time pressure, however, is misaligned with time pressure’s core definition to constitute an outcome (not a dimension) of job demands. Combining a subjective time lens with job demands-resources theory, we propose that time pressure transfers the effects of quantitative job demands on employee strain. Furthermore, we add insights from temporal personality theory to this model to hypothesize that employees’ present temporal focus (i.e., the extent to which individuals pay attention to the present) strengthens this indirect relationship. We test this model in a three-wave, longitudinal study of 515 German employees. Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrate that for moderately to highly present-focused employees (but not for less present-focused individuals), job demands relate to increased time pressure and, by extension, increased strain. These findings indicate that enriching the literature on job demands and time pressure with a subjective time lens provides critical insights into how and when time pressure emerges and decreases employee well-being. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In recent years, we are increasingly seeing corporations take a public stance on social, political, and environmental issues. It is an activism that aims at influencing political, industrial, commercial or cultural agendas and takes place in social arenas such as the media instead of parliamentary institutions. This paper approaches corporate activism as a manifestation of the logic described as PCSR. It draws on advertising spots as an example of corporate activism in the media to illustrate the ways in which corporations adopt responsibilities of societal critique from social movements. On the basis of this, it argues that a new version of a politics of the self emerges. This is a commercial politics of the self to be fulfilled through consumer loyalty to the company, which decouples values from formal structures of governance and, instead, construe their realization as an individualized consumer responsibility. This may not remove the potential of corporate activism for social change.

RECIPROCAL SUBCONTRACTING IN GLOBAL FACTORIES: A PENROSEAN GROWTH PERSPECTIVE,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188131970&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.28&partnerID=40&md5=4034bbf8f3408df307ff5b89462e1029,"Scholars commonly assume contract manufacturers must grow to achieve minimum viable scale. This study of contract manufacturers in global factories reveals how “reciprocal subcontracting” enables SMEs to sustain competitiveness while also remaining small. Taking the Penrosean growth perspective in the context of the global factory framework, we explore how SME contract manufacturers achieve competitive advantage. We find lead firms largely conform to established theory, but small contract manufacturers achieve “borrowed growth” external to the firm. This externalization of production capacity growth supports our call for theoretical extension to the Penrosean growth perspective. © 2022, Academy of Management.

CLOSING THE GENDER GAP IN PATENTING: EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL AT THE USPTO,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188129780&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.197&partnerID=40&md5=5b32e88e86b8c74ce39ac207c75eda6b,"Using a randomized control trial at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we identify the heterogeneous causal impacts across gender and technologies of increased patent examination assistance on the probability of obtaining patent rights. Women applicants were 11 percentage points more likely than men to benefit from this assistance, and the benefits were largest for new inventors and in areas of technology where women had the worst relative outcomes. Our results suggest that a portion of the gender patenting gap could be eliminated through the provision of additional resources and assistance during patent prosecution. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Empirical evidence of their implications for management research, however, is scarce. Using primary survey data collected from 1,087 business owners in seven developing and emerging economies between February and August 2021, combined with secondary national data, we take a cross-cultural approach to examine spiritual capital and happiness as explanatory variables for entrepreneurial passion, as well as the moderating effect of the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance. Our results provide empirical evidence that both spiritual capital and happiness are positive determinants of entrepreneurial passion. Moreover, we find that the relationship between happiness and harmonious passion is less pronounced among business owners living in societies with high levels of uncertainty avoidance. Following Self-Determination Theory, we theoretically discuss why entrepreneurs with high spiritual capital appear to be agnostic to some of the cultural influences of the societies they live in. Because these findings go beyond traditional understandings of religion, they are relevant to researchers and practitioners such as individual business owners, investors, and policymakers alike, and open up avenues for conversations about the question how diversity with regard to culture, beliefs, norms, and values may contribute to building better management teams and work environments. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Based on construal level research, we theorize that the construal level of change messaging (that is, how abstract or concrete change messaging is) determines how effectively people can bridge distances. We suggest that when change is frame-breaking, more abstract change messaging provides a strategic worldview and thus reduces uncertainty and elicits more favorable attitudes toward change than concrete messaging. When change is more incremental, concrete change messaging facilitates behavioral change. Two field experiments manipulating the construal level (i.e., abstractness or concreteness) of collective change communication demonstrate support for our hypotheses. In particular, more abstract change communication increases the favorability of attitudes about frame-breaking organizational change relative to more concrete communication, and employees’ perception of the positive impact of change mediates this relationship. Conversely, for incremental change, more concrete change communication facilitates behavioral change more than abstract communication, and by increasing the perceived feasibility of change. Implications for research on the communication of change, collective-level interventions shaping recipient sensemaking about change, and the application of construal level theory to organizational change contexts are discussed. © 2022, Academy of Management.

To isolate the effects of language on attention, we exploit a novel quasi-experiment where pairs of tweets are posted by the same organization on the same topic within a short time. Our analysis focuses on how using sentiment vocabularies affects two aspects of attentional engagement. We find that within a tweet pair, the tweet using more positive vocabularies receives greater selective attention (likes), and the tweet using more negative vocabularies receives greater selective attention and intensive attention (retweets). Whereas increased use of positive vocabularies attracts greater selective attention than intensive attention, increased use of negative vocabularies attracts greater intensive attention than selective attention. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Current literature predominantly frames unknowability as a problem for alienating human actors from how knowledge is constructed and applied with these algorithms. By focusing on the context of development rather than use, and by expanding the concept of unknowability beyond the opaque link between input and output, however, we found that actors engaged in various knowing practices vis-à-vis the unknowable algorithm. These knowing practices enabled them to cope with unknowability and gradually shape the algorithm by responding to emerging issues and defining concrete actions to take among others. In this sense, our findings suggest that unknowability of algorithms is not necessarily a problem to solve, but can be a generative condition that allows actors to traverse conventional divides between expertise, which is yet to receive scholarly attention. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Despite decades of research on inclusion in workplaces, we know surprisingly little about how to identify and measure individuals’ capability to relate and work in inclusive ways. Drawing on optimal distinctiveness theory and building a bridge between research in the fields of inclusion and intercultural management, by considering the concept of cultural intelligence, we introduce a definition and conceptualization of ‘inclusion competence’. We build on this conceptualization by developing and validating a 20-item inclusion competence scale, using three interlocking studies with five samples (total N = 2051) across four countries (UK, Sweden, Australia, USA). We confirm the scale’s dimensionality and measurement invariance as well as provide evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. We contribute to scholarship across the fields of inclusion and capability development by offering a theory-driven construct and scale that assesses individual capability for inclusion at work. Our scale could be applied in many organizational settings as a diagnostic tool or for self-reflection.

Researchers have begun to explore how political ideologies of organizational members affect corporate outcomes, but they have focused primarily on the effect of the firm’s dominant ideology. Showing that the workplace can expose individuals to dissimilar political beliefs, I introduce the concept of organizational political diversity as heterogeneity in members’ political ideologies. Building on research on political polarization from political science, I propose that firms with greater political diversity are less innovative. Negative sentiments toward individuals with opposing ideologies hinder the willingness to cooperate and the coordination needed to foster innovation. This negative effect prevails over the benefits of having access to multiple perspectives, and it is stronger the more salient politics is in the workplace. I test my theory using data on the political affiliation of employees of 394 publicly traded companies and their corporate patenting activity for the period 2008–2015 in the United States and find a negative relationship between political diversity and innovation. These results inform research on political ideologies in organizational theory and on diversity and innovation, suggesting that political polarization in society might directly affect corporate innovation, a central driver of value creation in the economy. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Building on the current literature, I argue that affective relations are a central to understanding the tension ridden negotiations of collaborative relations in temporary organizing. I draw upon the notion of affective practices to conceptualize how collaborative relations are shaped through joyful and sad affects in organizational practices. These affective practices are then analyzed based on an affective ethnography of an artistic enterprise and one of its long-term participative art projects which creates a modular growing picnic blanket in public space with the support of a shifting configuration of partners, collaborators, volunteers and participants. The analysis carves out enticing, articulating, attuning and opposing as four affective practices that are used in the collaborative process to mobilize support and address resistance in temporary organizing and shows how these practices work with affecto-material presences to inflect collaborators affectively towards the collaborative process. With this study I advance the literature on temporary organizing, by theorizing how affective practices shape and sustain and collaborative relations through forging affective coalitions, and by discussing how affect theory creates inroads to a more embodied understanding of how temporary organizing is negotiated towards transformation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

To do so, we combine a standard NK simulation with a differentiated duopoly competition game to model firms simultaneously engaging in an internal search for superior technical proficiency and an external search for horizontally differentiated competitive positions. We show that such ‘strategic search’ limits innovation in low complexity environments, as firms sacrifice technical proficiency in order to differentiate from each other, but boosts it in high complexity environments, and examine the implications of this pattern for competitive advantage and consumer welfare. We also explore how these findings are moderated by the extent of demand heterogeneity, as well as asymmetric exposure to competition among firms.

Instead, the successful digital platform entrant focused on competing with other digital entrant rivals to capture a larger user base by transcending focal industry boundaries to enter and transform multiple industries through a digital superapp business model.

In this paper we provide empirical evidence on a negative impact of strategic patenting on a firm’s competitors. Consistent with theoretical implications of strategic patenting, we find that when firms strategically patent to defend their market position, overall market competition declines, as shown by the increase in HHI and significant drop in market entry. Additionally, we observe that strategic patenting reduces total factor productivity and patenting activity of firm competitors, especially in more technological and product-similar cases. Our results thus confirm that strategic patenting helps protect a firm's market niche by preventing competitors’ entry. These findings in turn lend further support to the theories regarding a generalized impact of strategic patenting on competition. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We identify three distinct types of target resources - technical, commercial, and social resources - and examine their influences on the acquiring firm’s subsequent alliance formation. We hypothesize that these resources increase the acquiring firm’s subsequent alliance formation. We expect that the positive effects of the target’s resources on the firm’s subsequent alliance formation are stronger when the firm and the target have cooperated prior to the acquisition, while these effects are weaker when the acquisition is cross-border.

This includes immediate access to food, shelter, and medical assistance. These services are supported by, and eventually fully transitioned to, local infrastructure, such as grocery stores. We test for differences in the prices paid for grocery products between low-income and high-income communities in the months following three large Atlantic hurricanes. We identify impacted communities using major disaster declarations by the United States federal government, and marry this information to U.S. Census Bureau data on household income, and third-party data on grocery store sales. Using a triple difference regression specification, we isolate the percentage change in prices paid by low-income versus high-income communities in disaster affected versus unaffected areas, before and after the disasters. Across the events we study, a common outcome is that low-income communities in the disaster-zones endure higher average percentage price increases within grocery categories compared to high-income communities. Such differences can sap the purchasing power of those communities that are least able to absorb it. We establish the presence of several mechanisms that contribute to these results. Compared to high-income communities, low-income communities experience a larger drop in price promotions, higher unit percent price increases, a larger decrease in offer sets of low-priced products, and a larger increase in substitution from low-priced products to high-priced products. The latter two mechanisms are consistent with more stock-outs of low-priced products in low-income communities. Our results highlight how companies and emergency response agencies can make use of readily available, cross-organizational data to facilitate more targeted and equitable operational interventions in the aftermath of a disaster, such as improved forecasting of substitution patterns after disasters and flexible vouchers that respond to local changes in paid prices. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, our understanding of the conditions under which HPWS are used is limited. This opens the question of what external and internal factors are related to HPWS use in firms. In the current study, we (a) identify and classify essential antecedents of HPWS use based on the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) perspective and (b) conduct a comprehensive narrative and meta-analytic review of previous studies. After controlling for common method/source variance, our meta-analytic results show that past operational performance and past financial performance are the two strongest ability-related antecedents of the use of HPWS. Management’s emphasis on the HR function and management’s emphasis on the HR are the two strongest motivation-related antecedents; and industry complexity is the strongest opportunity-related antecedent. Furthermore, our second- order meta-analysis indicates that the motivation-related category has the strongest association with HPWS use, followed by the ability- and opportunity-related categories.

MANIPULATING PERCEPTIONS OF ASSET SPECIFICITY IN ALLIANCES: A MICROFOUNDATIONAL APPROACH,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188137414&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.279&partnerID=40&md5=67982de648d0aacfdd0ac62836d545c4,"In interfirm exchanges such as alliances and joint ventures, transaction cost economics theory (TCE) argues that asset specificity, a key contracting hazard, largely determines specific attributes of hybrid governance, namely control mechanisms. Despite the importance of this concept, asset specificity is often unobservable. Instead, governance decisions largely rely on negotiator perceptions of asset specificity. While traditional TCE assumes negotiators are intendedly accurate to mitigate transaction costs, they are motivated to manipulate perceptions to maximize value capture for their firm. Thus, theory does not incorporate the impact of manipulated perceptions on governance attributes. Taking a microfoundational approach, we explore the impact of suppliers manipulating buyer managers’ perception of task characteristics to inflate their perceived asset specificity, on hybrid governance attributes. We offer a theoretical framework to predict the direction of asset specificity perception manipulation and when perceptions are most malleable. As a result, we incorporate negotiator cognitions and motives (maximize their firm’s value captured), leading to a more complete understanding of hybrid governance design. © 2022, Academy of Management.

GOOD SOLDIERS AND GOOD GENERALS: ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIORS IN STARTUPS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188143771&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.42&partnerID=40&md5=9620f2a7172d65034e4451ef77ad4155,"The first three years after launch are critical to the existence of startups. This is a turbulent period in which startups, as new and small organizations with limited resources, must compete under conditions of uncertainty and complexity against larger and established firms with already deployed resources. In this context, startups need employees who are willing to go beyond the call of duty. Management researchers have largely focused on the relationship between organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and performance outcomes in established firms, and entrepreneurship scholars have mostly studied the characteristics and functions of entrepreneurs. However, little attention has been paid to the role of employees and OCB in startups. To fill this gap, this paper assesses OCB within a specific organizational setting to propose a conceptual framework that explains why nascent startups require early employees who demonstrate high levels of OCB and how these emerging organizations, through higher OCB levels, can increase their likelihood of survival. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Focusing on the resource seeker-side, we argue that individuals’ seeking behavior is influenced by (a) intangible, psychological costs, and (b) tangible, economic considerations, and suggest that both types of costs are linked to the provision of information on seekers’ identity. By conducting a lab experiment, we alter participants’ costs when seeking resources on a platform. We find that both type of costs reduce individuals’ seeking behavior. While men are chiefly discouraged by economic consequences, females place relatively more emphasis on psychological costs.

THE IMPACT OF PROTECTIVE TAKEOVER REGULATION ON ACQUIRING FIRMS: EVIDENCE FROM THE NEW BID REGIME IN CANADA,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188128286&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.306&partnerID=40&md5=07ecbe47e9a2e8eaf09f55c8919285b3,"This study explores how protective takeover regulations indirectly affect acquiring firms. Protective takeover regulations, such as the new bid regime introduced in Canada in 2016, provide targets more time to respond to takeover offers and offer greater protection to minority shareholders. Yet, such strategies could also influence acquiring firms to change their strategies over time. Using a sample of Canadian manufacturing firms that operated between 2012-2020 we find that the new bid regime had no impact on reducing hostile acquisitions, but that it increased the tendency of acquiring firms to undertake unrelated and cross-border acquisitions. In turn, it indirectly reduced the ability of acquiring firms to successfully complete their acquisitions. The findings suggest that protective takeover regulations may have broader and unintended effects by driving acquiring firms to undertake riskier acquisitions and experience poorer acquisition outcomes. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In addition, we also test, in an exploratory fashion, how the effects of daily social sharing extend beyond same-day family outcomes to affect employees’ psychological well-being at work on the following day.

In particular, scholars have not yet studied how differences in the perceived intensity of paradoxes influence the development of paradox knots. We draw on a longitudinal qualitative case study of a German development NGO operating in Uganda to elucidate and elaborate upon the knotted nature of two paradoxes faced by this NGO, namely a means-end paradox and an identity elasticity paradox. Our analysis shows how the intensity of these two knotted paradoxes developed inversely, with the NGO’s response to the means-end paradox amplifying the identity elasticity paradox and its response to the identity elasticity paradox mitigating the means-end paradox. Based on these findings, we extend the literature on paradox knots in two ways. First, we show how knotted paradoxes can be asymmetrically aligned, with each alternately amplifying or mitigating the intensity of the other over time. Second, we show that paradox knots need to be understood as temporary and unstable phenomena that can both emerge and decline – or “fade in” and “fade out” – in their effects. © 2022, Academy of Management.

CEO communication specificity is important for analysts as it substantially facilitates their work. However, CEOs might have little incentive to communicate with high specificity as it narrows CEOs’ strategic discretion. We argue that flattery-a ubiquitous social influencing behavior-enables analysts to render CEOs more likely to overcome their preference for vague communication because it invokes norms of reciprocity in the CEO and enhances the CEO’s self-esteem. Ultimately, the more an analyst flatters a CEO, the greater that CEO’s communication specificity. Moreover, integrating CEO narcissism research, we argue that analyst flattery provides “narcissistic supply” such that the positive effect of analyst flattery on CEO communication specificity increases to the extent of the focal CEO’s narcissism. Data from 2,159 dyads of analyst questions and CEO answers in quarterly earnings calls of U.S. hard- and software as well as pharmaceutical firms preliminarily support our hypotheses. Our theorizing and findings introduce a novel outside-in perspective of social influencing mechanisms-particularly flattery-at the executives/capital-markets interface. It also answers strategic leadership scholars’ calls to illuminate the “relational black box” of CEOs’ interactions with external stakeholders. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We interpret our findings with institutional theory, comparing the institutional ismorphisms driving change in each organisational form, and examining the extent to which there is rhetorical decoupling between them. Our findings suggest a disconnect between public commitment to diversity and Indigenous engagement, and the practice of appointing non-white corporate leaders. A lack of regulation surrounding diversity reports has contributed to this uneven disclosure and practice, with different outcomes for gender and ethnic diversity the result of different institutional isomorphisms. These finding can inform policymakers and corporations, highlighting the importance of a range of institutional pressures for encouraging both disclosure and practice regarding ethnic diversity in corporate leadership. © 2022, Academy of Management.

An examination of the timing of CVC investments can offer new insights on this contention. Previous studies showed that the timing of ventures’ resource acquisition is crucial for venture outcomes. However, these studies have overlooked the role of incumbents as a resource channel and the tradeoffs associated with timing. Building on resource dependence theory (RDT), we explore how the timing of CVC investments alters the power balance between investors and backed ventures, significantly influencing ventures’ commercial performance. We further examine how the timing of venture board seats obtained by CVC investors affects this relationship. Using a dataset of 294 Norwegian ventures active in knowledge-intensive industries from 2004 to 2015, we offer evidence for a differential effect of early- vs. late-stage CVC investments, showing that late-stage investments significantly increase commercial performance. We also find that associating a venture board seat with a CVC investment moderates this effect; ventures are associated with greater commercial performance when late-stage investments come without board seats. We suggest that board seats prevent ventures from forming investment ties with additional CVC investors, limiting ventures’ external ties crucial for market success. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Our study examines qualitative interview data using grounded theory analysis to understand how entrepreneurs of color experience and navigate racial discrimination that could potentially impact the survival and growth of their businesses. Those entrepreneurs of color who narrate persistence and growth demonstrate the ability to invisibilize, camouflage, and leverage their race in adaptive response to the socio-ecological context within which opportunities arise. We also illustrate how social movements can play a role in beginning to shift unequal structures of power within the business world by creating emergent opportunities for POC entrepreneurs that allow them to be open, and even forward, about their racial-ethnic identity.

DOUBLE STANDARDS IN STATUS BENEFITS FOR PAY: HOW EDUCATIONAL STATUS WIDENS AND CLOSES THE GENDER PAY GAP*,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188131783&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.252&partnerID=40&md5=d5cdfb7f5df4f1fb9c78cb5e5e13ee9a,"Gender is commonly thought to factor into evaluations, leading to worse outcomes for women. Even when objective performance information is available, women often face double standards whereby they are disadvantaged relative to similarly performing men. While most research on double standards has focused on performance metrics, we advance this research by examining whether similar gender-based double standards emerge in assessments of attained status. Using data from a digital platform that collects compensation information from a diverse set of professionals, we find that women must cross a higher threshold of educational status than men to receive status benefits, even within the same firms and positions. Because men begin receiving status benefits at a lower point in the status hierarchy, the gender gap widens among men and women at this level of attained status. An implication of this differential threshold is that men, overall, realize a larger cumulative advantage to status than women. Further, this differential threshold is only for non-salary compensation (e.g., bonuses), highlighting the importance of considering the structure of evaluation processes. Our research reveals how attained status serves as a lever that may both exacerbate and reduce gender inequities at different points of the status hierarchy. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Although prior KSTE studies have examined the impact of a country’s entire knowledge stock on its total entrepreneurial activities, it remains unclear how national EVBs are influenced by knowledge creation and knowledge exploitation at the national level and how such influences vary across nations with differing entrepreneurial values (NEVs) that include innovative, proactive, and risk-taking values. By analyzing a multi-source dataset from 52 countries ranging from 2011 to 2017, this study reveals that knowledge creation positively influences knowledge exploitation at the national level with a diminishing marginal effect, while the latter negatively affects national EVBs. Additionally, knowledge creation has a U-shape relationship with EVBs at the national level, and this U-shape relationship is strengthened by national entrepreneurial values. This article is among the first to conduct a cross-country study on national EVBs by elaborating on the different driving effects of knowledge creation and knowledge exploitation and specifying national entrepreneurial values as important boundaries of these driving effects. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We hypothesized and found that prevailing (Study 1) and induced (Study 2) growth mindsets are associated with giving less weight to GMA than training when predicting prospective employees’ future performance. Against the backdrop of hundreds of studies lauding the merits of growth mindsets, the present results suggest the imperative for the mindsets literature to adopt a more contingent conception of when holding a growth mindset may be (dys)functional. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We argue that the extent to which managers respond to gender equity pressures will depend on their subordinates’ gender dissimilarity from the workgroup. Specifically, we theorize that women who are more dissimilar from their workgroups will receive higher pay. We further theorize that this positive effect will be stronger for women in technical roles and is driven by managers’ impression management concerns and perceptions of women’s work-related capabilities. Using a multi-method approach, we find support for our hypotheses. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Although brand equity is a valuable resource which could create competitive advantages for firms, it could hinder the benefits of related product diversification if a focal firm’s brand equity in its existing product is strong, or rival firms’ brand equity in its new product is strong. Both would prevent customers from establishing a new association between a focal firm and its new product in customers’ minds, and thus influence their intention to buy the new product and dampen the potential benefits of related product diversification. Particularly, we perform complementary studies with different methods (secondary data analysis of 183 listed firms in China from 2004 to 2019 and lab experiments). We reveal that brand equity of a focal firm in its existing product and that of rival firms in its new product attenuate the relationship between related product diversification and firm performance. © 2022, Academy of Management.

BREAKING DOWN REMOTE SILOS: HOW WORKER CHARACTERISTICS AFFECT REMOTE INTERACTIONS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE (OSS) COMMUNITIES,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188096942&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.130&partnerID=40&md5=6d0f955ab869e1be4b3762b1f736c427,"Remote work creates communication silos within organizations. Overcoming these silos is an important problem for organizations to solve as it is rarely feasible to perfectly organize interdependencies within them. In this paper, we focus on the individual level and ask: what worker-level characteristics are associated with a higher frequency of cross-silo distant interactions? We explore answers by leveraging open-source software (OSS) communities as the context. OSS communities are standards of all-remote globally-dispersed organizations, where a mix of unpaid volunteers and paid firm-sponsored employees undertake software development. Based on a problemistic-search decision model, we argue that volunteers undertake a higher degree of exploratory remote interactions as they are motivated by an individual-level need for recognition and knowledge. Moreover, the lower the accomplishment of their goals, relative to social aspirations, the higher the level of exploration they are likely to undertake. On the contrary, for firm-sponsored contributors, the presence of firm-level commercial motives and pecuniary benefits is expected to lower returns to exploration. We test and find supportive evidence for our theory using email metadata and text from the Linux-kernel project that spans 3,734 contributors, 25 timezones, and 130 months of software development work from January 2010 to October 2020.

Yet, due to the risk of information leakage or opportunistic behavior, suppliers are reluctant to share certain (sensitive) information. We apply a sequential multi-method research design, including a qualitative study followed by a supplier survey and a scenario-based experiment to investigate how firms do and should collaborate with suppliers to increase transparency in the relationship. Building on the social exchange and resource theory, the qualitative study suggests that various information is perceived sensitive, antecedents of “transparent” and “opaque” suppliers, and tactics to induce the sharing of sensitive information. The later studies show that commitment and relationship length are significant antecedents of transparent suppliers. In line with resource theory, we also show that the counterparts of buyers prefer to be reciprocated with information, money, or status incentives when being asked for sensitive information. This study contributes to research in buyer-supplier exchanges and transparency by studying sensitive information sharing and providing valuable insights to practitioners on improving collaboration with their suppliers. © 2022, Academy of Management.

This oversight seems surprising, given the polarized political landscapes in many Western societies that may significantly alter organizational behavior. During the 2020 United States presidential election, we conducted an experience sampling study on 147 employees across ten consecutive workdays. We examined the relationships between political dissimilarity and trajectories of experienced interpersonal conflict at work using a discontinuous growth curve modeling approach. The findings revealed that an individual’s perceived political dissimilarity had no significant impact on interpersonal conflict before the election day. However, the effect became significant on the election day, and remained present for six days of the observed post-election period. Moreover, post hoc analysis revealed that interpersonal conflict harmed next-day work engagement only when leaders were not perceived as collaborative in their conflict response. This indicates ways of mitigating the negative consequences of politics-induced conflict. Taken together, our study reveals political identity as a critical but under-explored dimension of workplace dissimilarity that becomes salient with political macro events. We also demonstrate spillover effects of political macro events on organizational behavior and advance dissimilarity research from a multilevel-dynamic perspective. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In the past decade, Corporate Accelerator (CA) programs have increasingly been adopted across industries as a more radical CV form of corporate experimentation. Yet, academic research on CAs is in its infancy, with a nascent but growing body of work only emerging over the past 5-6 years. This aims to accelerate CA research in academia by understanding the roots, and evolution of extant literature, and drawing a path for the future. We examine the scholar origins of CV research tracing the way from its roots to the nascence of CAs in 2016 and beyond. Along this track, we map the core literature, identifying main academic contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes across CV intermediaries so as to provide an organizing framework for the emerging field of CA. We do this by applying a structured mixed method literature review from 1981-2021, combining bibliometric analyses (co-citation and citation analysis) with a subsequent detailed qualitative analysis, following a CIMO (context, intermediary, mechanism, outcome) inductive framework. Through this process, we offer a framework and agenda with specific topics for future CA research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Finally, looking to the post-pandemic future, we discuss whether the practice of managers working at home will likely be ‘extended’, ‘ended’ or ‘hybridised’ by employers in the coming years. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The research analysis demonstrated that the R&D units followed two different evolution paths. The first evolution path identified was very conventional, involving adaptation and tropicalization of the R&D subsidiaries to local products. This traditional R&D evolution path was found in Brazil's, Mexico's, and Czech Republic's R&D Volkswagen subsidiaries. The second R&D evolution path was presented in China and India R&D subsidiaries, demonstrating a unique trajectory based on the abundance of qualified labor at low cost and specific knowledge of that particular site.

In contrast to conventional strategies, such as lobbying and campaign contributions involving direct interactions with policymakers, constituency-building expands the scope of conflict by mobilizing stakeholders to pressure policymakers. Although prior studies of constituency-building have highlighted how enlisting stakeholders in political battles creates unique opportunities and risks, what has often been overlooked is the importance of blending “strange bedfellows” of economically- and morally-motivated constituents, sometimes called bootlegger-and-Baptist coalitions. Drawing on theories developed in political science, regulatory economics, and corporate political strategy, we advance a theoretical framework to examine (a) the motivations of policymakers and stakeholders, which constitute the theoretical basis for constituency-building strategies; (b) the tradeoffs of creating blended coalitions consisting of parties who have distinct motives for moral legitimacy or economic interest; and (c) how blended coalitions may take distinct overt, covert, or tacit forms. We also differentiate between campaigns that take place at the firm- versus industry-level. We develop propositions to advance theory development on constituency-building, linked to stakeholder mobilization and social movement approaches. We offer wide-ranging real-world examples to provide guidance to empirical research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Using an interpretivist grounded theory approach, we examined the experience of 32 SCLs in a wide range of geographies, industries, and change contexts, to develop a process model of their reactions. The findings reveal that SCLs perceive their roles to be stressful, but the type of stress they experience depends on their appraisal of their situation. If they perceive their stress to result from challenges that can be addressed, they experience positive emotions, which can lead to a self-reinforcing ‘gain loop’. However, if SCLs appraise their stress to be the result of hindrances outside their control, they experience negative emotions and may enter a self-reinforcing ‘doom loop’. Throughout the implementation of change, SCLs continually reappraise the demands of their role, available resources and the value of the change to the organization and themselves. Accordingly, the type of stress they experience can shift over time and lead to different reactions. Our study findings offer novel insight into the study and practice of change leadership that can lead to higher levels of leader and organizational change effectiveness. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We argue that CQ tends to lead to beneficial outcomes, yet, under certain circumstances, it can be associated with adverse consequences. First, individuals might become overconfident in their ability to interact effectively with members of other cultures, which can foster poor decision-making and reduced learning. Second, they might over-adjust to their cultural environment, which can lead to a perceived inauthenticity and lack of integrity. Third, individuals might develop a morally and culturally relativistic worldview, due to which they can lose their sense of cultural belongingness and which can motivate them to behave unethically. Subsequently, we discuss the differential role of the CQ facets in the proposed mechanisms, suggest various boundary conditions, and develop an agenda for future research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

This generalized trust replaces, fully or partially, the need for traditional coordination and control mechanisms, such as formal contracts, authority, and relational trust. Blockchain, a novel form of organizing that entwines its organizational architecture with technology, renders extreme forms of decentralization and autonomy. We conceptualize how blockchain enables generalized trust without hierarchy based on two key boundary design decisions—permeability and transparency. Taking an architectural view with a focus on information processing, we propose a typology of boundary decisions of blockchain systems and formulate propositions linking boundary decisions with the extent of generalized trust in blockchain systems. Further, we propose that complementarity among activities performed in the blockchain system amplifies a trust-enabling organization’s ability to generate generalized trust. Finally, based on the alignment of boundary decisions with goals of adoption, we present two heterogeneous and contrasting modes of adoption—actor-centric vs. technology-centric. Taken together, these two modes form the opposite ends of a continuum, offering potential adopters the flexibility of choosing from a wide range of hybrid modes. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The value of the firm depends on the interaction between such overlapping resources and the outcome of resource combinations. Prior research has often emphasized additivity or super-additivity in resource combinations–the value of combined resources is equal to or larger than the sum of the values of the individual resources. Fungibility and scale-free properties are integral to the argument of super-additivity in the corporate strategy literature and resource-based view. This study offers a new mechanism underlying sub-additivity, i.e., the value of combined resources is smaller than the sum of the values of the individual resources, and shows how fungibility and scale-free property can, under certain conditions, substantially diminish the value in resource combinations. Using a computational modeling approach, we show that super-and sub-additive interactions coexist in resource combinations, and which effect is dominant depends on other factors that determine the value of resources at resource, firm-dyad, and industry levels. Our study identifies boundary conditions for super-additivity or sub-additivity to occur in resource combinations. We discuss implications for the resource-based view, internally competing resources, and corporate strategies. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We develop a comprehensive model explaining how firms revert to their usual self after committing environmental disasters. Our in-depth abductive analysis of the Kalamazoo River Oil Spill illustrates that forgetting work allows corporations to protect their image and maintain legitimacy in the shareholder and state’s eyes, attenuate institutional pressures, and co-opt external stakeholders, communities, and the society while continuing irresponsible behaviors. While forgetting work’s success relies on the corporation’s political activities, the success of corporate social responsibility is less clear. Corporate social responsibility fails when it contributes to the marginalization of involved communities, making it ineffective and unethical. Our research contributes to the forgetting work literature by showing how irresponsible corporations engage in short and long-term social forgetting after stimulating environmental disasters. We highlight the plurality of voices and interpretations in the mnemonic processes involved in narratives regarding corporate irresponsibility. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The alternative strategic entrepreneurship perspective implies that where firms are acquired to invest in growth opportunities for sustainable expansion, trust may be maintained, or even enhanced. Developing this argument, we propose an Innovation-Participation-Trust (IPT) model within which LBOs introduce operational innovation, which enhances workforce participation, thus increasing workforce trust in management. Empirical analysis of nationally representative matched data supports the model, thus suggesting that LBOs enhance the ability of firms to contract efficiently with the workforce. © 2022, Academy of Management.

SPANNING BOUNDARIES ACROSS TWO WORLDS: HOW ACCELERATORS SOURCE STARTUPS FOR CHANGING CORPORATES,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188123196&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.232&partnerID=40&md5=9f8a7024e98e499cfb7fc29a1f1c44b8,"Collaborating with innovative startups can be beneficial for large established corporates. However, sourcing attractive startups that fit the corporates strategically is challenging. To overcome this challenge, more recently a new type of accelerator emerged that offers a startup sourcing process that matches corporates with applicant startups for specific collaboration projects once the accelerator’s cohort starts. This platform accelerator is different from internal corporate accelerators since it works as an independent legal entity and sources startups for multiple changing corporate sponsors at the same time. But how can an accelerator – that is external to both worlds and faces changing partners – match corporates with applicant startups for collaboration projects? To develop theory about how platform accelerators match multiple changing corporates and startups, we draw on a boundary spanning perspective and an inductive study based on a six-month in-depth single-case study of a platform accelerator matching four corporate partners with initially ~1500 scouted startups. Our process model shows how the accelerator established and re-positioned itself as a boundary organization and reveals the sequence of three key mechanisms (anticipating, structuring, fostering) applied by the accelerator during matchmaking. Our study extends previous research on accelerator design, entrepreneurial support organizations, boundary spanning, and boundary organizations. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Delegation of Decision Rights and Inertia in Capital Reallocation,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188109418&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.134&partnerID=40&md5=ee78f6934c4abd0592815a261680b60e,"In this paper, we investigate the antecedents of inertia in capital allocation decisions in organizations. Despite the importance of flexible capital reallocation, empirical evidence points to remarkably high levels of stability in these decisions. Adopting a behavioral perspective, we focus on information processing demands faced by boundedly rational decision makers as a driver of such inertia. In particular, we argue that centralization of decision rights, which increases the information processing demands on relevant decision makers, results in an increased inertia in capital reallocations. To empirically test our proposition and explore the causal effect of centralization on reallocation flexibility, we take advantage of an exogenous variation in decision rights among municipalities located in the state of Illinois in the US. Our findings indicate that the delegation of decision rights for capital allocation significantly decreases inertia in reallocation decisions. Additional analyses further provide evidence that a likely mechanism explaining our findings is that of decentralization reducing information processing load on relevant decision makers. © 2022, Academy of Management.

This study examines how communities of experts in a single occupation settle their practice differences and converge (or not) on common practices following a hospital merger. We conducted a two-year ethnographic study of how two neonatal intensive care units belonging to Canada's largest hospital network synchronized their care practices in a merger. Contrary to expectation, we find that novices, a group that usually has the lowest power and status in an organization, may play a pivotal role in challenging differences and enhancing an organization’s ability to improve expert practices in the context of a merger. Successfully standardizing practice may entail the enactment of rules that reflect best practices and accepted scientific evidence in the occupation's explicit body of knowledge; however, while scientific knowledge provides a foundation for settling differences, experts often push back against rules because working to them diverges from the established and tacit ways by which experts perform their work (i.e., through intuition and judgement based on experiential knowledge). Thus, managers may need a complex repertoire of interventions to facilitate practice convergence, but in the process, ironically, experts may have to regress to working according to rules, much as novices do in their quest to become an expert. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We highlight the crucial role of managers as diffusers of practices at the interorganizational boundary and suggest that they have incentives to exert asymmetrical effort on nontargeted units to increase aggregate organizational performance. We examine this dilemma in the context of a nonprofit partner transferring management practices to public schools with the support of civil servants (boundary managers). We gauge the ability of managers to diffuse practices and find that increased diffusion ability benefits the nontargeted units, leading to a severe underestimation of the transferring-side partner contribution.

The purpose of this study is to address this research gap. We conducted a multiple-case study with entrepreneurial teams that faced the adversities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative data, we developed a process model of the entrepreneurial team resilience process. The model differentiates this process in stages of (1) adversity perception and evaluation, (2) information search and acquisition, (3) coping with adversity, and (4) resilience outcomes. With our study we add to theory development on psychological resilience in entrepreneurship. Specifically, we enrich the nascent research on entrepreneurial team resilience and shed light on the collective cognitive, affective, and social dynamics that enable entrepreneurial teams to develop team resilience in the face of adversity. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We find that while diversifying entrants generally have superior initial performance, they are also limited in their ability to adapt to new markets, and only retain their advantage over time if they come from highly related markets and can realize strong economies of scope. Absent these conditions, entrepreneurial spinouts from moderately related markets dominate, especially if complexity is moderate to high, because they have both an adaptation advantage relative to diversifying entrants and a learning advantage relative to other startups. Our study thus offers a contingent theory of new entrant advantage, while highlighting the unique advantage of entrepreneurial spinouts in new markets. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Here we examine the effectiveness of a different class of search strategies - namely, hedonic search strategies that are guided by the positivity or negativity of information used in the search process. We show that one particular type of hedonic search - positive search, i.e., the systematic overweighting of positive information - outperforms rival exploratory search strategies in a complex environment. Not only does positive search confer an adaptive advantage over other hedonic search strategies but it also outperforms a standard, neutral search without resorting to lengthier search process. We confirm this result in a series of computational experiments where boundedly rational agents seeking to improve their positions in complex environments search among local alternatives using different hedonic search strategies.

LEGITIMATING ILLEGITIMATE PRACTICES TO SCALE EXPERTISE,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188112846&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.246&partnerID=40&md5=5202db31d69755b711b0bb7546f4827b,"In this study, we examine the work that an occupation did to legitimate their expertise by legitimating practices they considered illegitimate. We report findings from our 20-month ethnography of data analysts. Analysts constantly encountered or were asked to provide illegitimate data analysis practices. In response, they sometimes resisted but more often reconciled themselves to the requests because they were so reliant on collaborators’ cooperation. They also explicitly lowered their stated standards and then worked to broadly legitimate those now illegitimate versions of their expert practices. Our findings articulate why and how experts work to legitimate illegitimate practices. © 2022, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,Data analysts

We tested these counter-factual insights by using panel data covering the trading histories of 2,255 entrepreneurs who lived and traded in Kenya’s informal settlements. The results confirmed that paying-it-forward expands entrepreneurial functioning through two contrasting network interaction effects that either amplify or attenuate the pro-social impact of paying-it-forward on others’ welfare during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. © 2022, Academy of Management.

THE EFFECTS OF PAST TRANSGRESSORS’ STATUS AND CATEGORICAL PROXIMITY ON SCANDALIZATION OF MISCONDUCT,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188110025&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.16&partnerID=40&md5=5f74435b1f2d20b5aada145e9a8c6106,"While transgressors’ status has long been considered a key antecedent to scandals, we have a limited understanding of how others’ status bounds the relationship. We examine how past transgressors’ status inside and outside an industry affects the scandalization of a focal firm’s misconduct. We argue that past transgressions by high-status firms within the industry lead journalists to scrutinize the misconduct more, amplifying the effect of the focal firm’s status by highlighting its commonalities with past transgressors. In contrast, the status of past transgressors from outside the industry attenuates the effect of firm status on scandalization by directing media attention outside the industry, thereby limiting the depth of information that can be inferred from the firm’s status. We focus on the media coverage data breaches receive, and find that past transgressors’ status and their categorical proximity to current transgressors serve as important boundary conditions for the effect of status in scandals. This study deepens our understanding of how status and categorical proximity influence scandalization. © 2022, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,'current; Media attention; Media coverage
TALENT RETENTION AND OSTRACISM: EXAMINING A MODERATED MEDIATION MODEL,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188102929&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.110&partnerID=40&md5=4cdece72ea2ad51e540f071e53e22cd8,"Based on social identity theory, we hypothesize that exclusive talent programs–which facilitate upward organizational mobility for a select subset of employees–divide employees into two distinct groups and create a setting where ostracism is likely to occur. We use an innovative study design–experimental 360-video vignettes–to recreate a fictional organization and empirically tested a moderated mediation model (N = 184). We found that employees identified as a talent exhibit lower intentions to leave their organization, partially suppressed by their anticipation of being ostracized by out-group members. Furthermore, the emotional responses of ‘non-talent’ co-workers moderate anticipated ostracism, with non-talents’ negative emotional responses to the talent program causing talents to anticipate being more ostracized by them. The present study addresses researchers’ and practitioners’ concerns about talent retention, and provides important theoretical and practical implications for the field of talent management, social identity theory, and intergroup conflicts on the work floor. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, we propose that exposing undesirable qualities (i.e., flaws) can sometimes enhance entrepreneurs’ ability to acquire funding. Specifically, building on theories of similarity-attraction and identification, we suggest that entrepreneur flaws attract investors who share the same flaw. Further, drawing on insights from social comparison theory, we distinguish between “bridging flaws” that highlight a deficit in a desirable trait (e.g., insecurity, or a lack of self-confidence) and “distancing flaws” that indicate an excess of a desirable trait (e.g., arrogance, or an excess of self-confidence), and theorize that sharing bridging flaws increases investors’ identification with entrepreneurs and thus financial contributions, whereas sharing distancing flaws fails to increase identification and investment. Two experiments and externally valid archival data from the reality television show Shark Tank provide support for our theory. We conclude that while entrepreneurs may benefit from exceptionalism, some succeed not despite but because of their flaws. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Study 1 examined how recruiters’ perceived power and offers are influenced by candidates’ likelihood of obtaining a phantom alternative offer. We found that candidates who have no alternative or an unlikely alternative received significantly lower offers than those with a likely or certain alternative, and power mediated the relationships. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1 and further tested circumstances when recruiters received disconfirming information about the likelihood associated with the alternative. We found that truthful and understated statements were least likely to suffer from recruiters’ decision to rescind or lower the offer. Misrepresentation (describing the alternative as likely when it is unlikely to materialize), deception (stating facts that lead the recruiter to believe an alternative offer is in hand), and falsification (lying about an alternative offer in hand) move from lower to higher levels of impropriety.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic household panel (SOEP) between 1995 and 2018, we investigate the success of this strategy, by studying wage earnings and the labor force status of mothers seven years after childbirth, once the child reaches school age. Taking account of self-selection into self-employment, we find that the consequences of self-employment experience in the early years after childbirth are no different from being inactive in terms of hourly wage for mothers who return to wage employment, while each additional month of wage employment after childbirth increases this wage by 0.4%. However, each additional month of self-employment experience does increase the odds of being active in the labor market by 22%, compared to inactivity. Analogously, for each additional month of wage employment, the odds of being employed increase by 6%. Self-employment in the early years after child birth thereby seems to keep mothers attached to the labor market to a greater degree than does wage-employment. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We endorse an approximation between the neo-Gramscian Political Discourse Theory (PDT) and decolonial epistemology for a deeper understanding of unquestioned norms in the periphery of the modern capitalist world-system. Through a longitudinal analysis of the formation and perpetuation of GMO hegemony in Brazil throughout the past decades, we identify that the hegemony is based on the dyad: a) ‘The expected role of GMO and Brazil in the international geopolitics’ and b) ‘The Western civilizing knowledge’. This analysis provides two main contributions to Management and Organization Studies: it promotes a deeper comprehension of how hegemonies consolidate over time in peripherical states and fosters the approximation between PDT and decolonial epistemology applied to unveil dynamics of in- and exclusion in political rural settings. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We find that three organizational characteristics shape employees’ perceptions towards negative feedback: accountability for performance, feedback reinforcement, and relational norm of politeness. We discover how the interplay between these organizational characteristics shapes individual perception of negative feedback as a risk of damaging relationships or as an opportunity to improve performance. Specifically, we find that feedback reinforcement alone is not sufficient to outweigh the perception of negative feedback as a risk to relationships in organizations where individuals perceive the relational norm of high politeness with each other and low accountability for performance. With this, we contribute to the literature on negative feedback and the context of feedback by empirically identifying how organizational characteristics coexist to shape employees’ perceptions towards negative feedback, which helps explain the wide heterogeneity in the way employees give feedback across organizations. © 2022, Academy of Management.

More precisely, we predict that interactional remote monitoring will be appraised as a challenge, which will subsequently increase employees’ voice, whereas observational remote monitoring will be appraised as a hindrance, which will subsequently increase employees’ silence. Additionally, we argue that the complexity of one’s job will intensify the relationships on the interactional monitoring path and diminish the relationships on the observational monitoring path.

THE SOCIAL EXCHANGE NATURE OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RACIAL MINORITY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS: EVIDENCE FROM A QUALITATIVE STUDY,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188110688&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.207&partnerID=40&md5=47de969f3c2f54538f6b745ad6fd9d90,"Small business owners provide needed economic growth to their communities while fulfilling their own desires for financial and personal success by pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. Often, small business owners seek help from business support organizations, entering into relationship with the support organization. Over the past 2 years due to the pandemic and racial and social injustices witnessed around the globe, many organizations are focused on how to better serve minority clients. Although social exchange theory (SET) has been a dominant paradigm for organizational behavior (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005) that explores the economic and social nature of transactions and relationships between parties, little research has explored the theory within the context of race. That is, how do we address the issues of racial and social justice within the paradigm of SET, why is this important, and what does it mean in the specific context of racial minority small business owners and small business support organizations? We conduct a qualitative study to answer this research question, interviewing staff members, clients, and nonclients of a federal support organization in the U.S. Although we interviewed and analyzed data of small business owners of varying racial backgrounds, this paper focuses on the findings specific to racial minority small business owners because they are at the center of the research question proposed as well as the practical interest of the support organization that we teamed with. We contribute to SET by extending the conversation to include how race influences social exchanges. © 2022, Academy of Management.

PATCHING MEANINGFULNESS: HOW EARLY CAREER SCHOLARS CONSTRUCT MEANING IN A PLURALISTIC WORK CONTEXT,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188104170&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.117&partnerID=40&md5=bc9555ebc3a12df68c0224039b17c63f,"Despite an increasing interest in the concept of meaningfulness at work, so far, relatively little research has been conducted on how the construction of meaningfulness evolves in pluralistic work contexts. We explore the construction of meaningfulness in pluralistic contexts by drawing on the case of academia, particularly the experiences of early career scholars (ECS) in Germany. We found that ECS draw on three competing discourses about legitimate academic work: the “performance discourse”, the “intellectual discourse” and the “engagement discourse”. The competing nature of these discourses generates tensions for ECS and the need to engage in a practice that we label patching meaningfulness. Our study contributes to the emerging stream of research that conceptualizes meaningfulness as a constant tension between the “self” and “others”. We show that work roles pose an important channel enabling scholars to perpetuate multiple valued self-definitions in a context of conflicting ideals about academic work. Similarly, we contribute to the literature that understands meaningfulness as inherently temporal and episodic. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We also study the impact on firm performance of the appointment of a daughter or a son when they take over the CEO position. Our empirical findings support the argument that daughters are less likely than sons to be appointed to the CEO position. However, this effect is weaker in family firms where the mother holds the CEO position. The difference-in-difference approach shows that family firms where a daughter takes over as CEO outperform family firms where a son takes over. Our findings reveal an important but hitherto not studied gendered dimension of the succession in family firms—sons are favored, but daughters do better. This way our study offers a more nuanced view of the implications of within family CEO succession in family businesses which is important for both research and practice. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Despite the immense technological potential and rapid developments, finding effective roles for the technological agents and forms of human-technology collaborations in decision-making remains challenging. Prior research shows in parts irrational rejection of superior algorithms (algorithm aversion) and only rare situations in which people prefer algorithmic over human decision-makers (algorithm appreciation). We show that severe negative consequences of decisions dominate people’s perceptions of the decision-maker, whereas technological anxiety and the decision-maker’s nature matter for the acceptance of positive decision outcomes (study 1). Expert decision-makers, while emphasizing a strong negative attitude towards AI-enabled decision-makers, do acknowledge the opportunities and potentials of the technology (study 2). When AI-enabled decision-makers become part of a mixed human-technology decision group, the perceived task-procedure fit fully mediates the negative effect of AI involvement on peoples’ willingness to accept the decision. Algorithm aversion thereby negatively moderates the relationship between AI involvement and task-procedure fit (study 3). The results provide insight into the mixed, but overly negative perceptions of AI-enabled decision agents and reveal how identifying an appropriate task-procedure fit can help to overcome algorithm aversion. © 2022, Academy of Management.

To enhance our understanding of governance via goals in CSPs, I inductively analyze a long-standing disease-elimination CSP and illustrate how the CSP goal became increasingly complex and challenged the CSP’s aspired winding down.

To date, a possible connection between social trust and risk conditions at the country level still remains to be explored. This study aims to fill this research gap by examining the existence of a relationship between social trust and country risk, focusing particularly on financial uncertainty across countries. Using a panel data set consisting of both developing and developed countries over the period 1980-2014, the study conducts a series of empirical tests, and finds that social trust and country financial risk are indeed related: developing countries with a higher level of social trust appear to carry a greater degree of financial uncertainty, as measured by the risk of foreign debt, the risk of currency fluctuation, and the risk of current account deficit, respectively. However, this relationship does not seem to exist among developed countries.

Prior research on collaboration in hackathons has focused on within-team coordination, limiting our understanding of how participating teams might successfully manage their external connections during virtual hackathons. To address this issue, we integrate insights from the attention-based view of the firm with the literature on tie strength and temporal dimensions of communication, and propose three strategies that might help teams effectively manage their external communication during virtual hackathons. Specifically, we suggest that establishing weaker ties, organizing them in a bursty manner, and limiting the overlap between conversations might help teams successfully manage information overload and the attentional strain associated with increased external communication. Results from a study among 69 teams involved in a virtual hackathon supported the usefulness of the second and third strategy. Our findings contribute to the innovation and team literature by pointing to the importance of the appropriate timing and configuration of team external activities, and point to two strategies that teams and managers might use to leverage the innovative performance potential of virtual hackathons.

USING MACHINE LEARNING TO ADVANCE THEORY: PRIDE IN WORK AS A NOVEL ANTECEDENT OF JOB SATISFACTION,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188120252&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.322&partnerID=40&md5=27b101b0c51744fd4b657831896d1846,"Management researchers typically identify new constructs by analyzing existing theories, generalizing from observations, and making connections with neighboring social sciences. We propose that machine learning methods can serve as yet another tool for generating novel hypotheses. We used lasso regression and deep learning to identify potential antecedents of job satisfaction in the World Values Survey. Both models identified pride in work as the top predictor. A literature review revealed that no management research to date has conceptualized pride in work as a construct. A three-wave survey found that pride in work predicted job satisfaction above and beyond meaning in work, a long-known predictor, and pride experienced at work. Further, the effects of skill variety, task identity, and task significance on job satisfaction were simultaneously mediated by pride in work and meaning in work. The findings suggest that pride in work is a missing construct in the literature, both as an antecedent of job satisfaction and as a mechanism through which core job characteristics influences job satisfaction. This research thus demonstrates that machine learning methods can be used to identify novel constructs and to extend theory in the organizational sciences. © 2022, Academy of Management.

OVERCOMING THE LIABILITY OF OUTSIDERSHIP THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188119160&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.85&partnerID=40&md5=3d1329a2c22b111d8f67adfb6ccdbc25,"This study investigates how emerging-market multinationals (EMNEs) overcome the liability of outsidership (LOO). We first argue that the LOO that EMNEs face has two sources: the lack of access to a local network and the lack of access to their preferred position in the global network. We then propose that EMNEs suffer more from LOO than do developed-country multinationals (DMNEs). Next, we argue that allying with different types of partners helps EMNEs overcome different sources of the LOO. We test these arguments with a database consisting of mobile money services provided by EMNEs, DMNEs and local firms in 93 countries in 2001-2015, finding support for most of our hypotheses. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In an instant, the online community took on a social movement nature that brought them comparisons to Occupy Wall Street. While scholars are gaining a growing insight into the life of social movements in online communities, current theory does not explain how a movement can suddenly arise in online communities, leaving us with little knowledge to explain how such action - which had critical social impact - arises. To fill this gap, we studied the Wallstreetbets movement relying on a mixed-methods research design, combining an unsupervised topic model with in-depth qualitative coding. Based on this method, we conceptualize Wallstreetbets as a ‘flash movement’, a movement that arises swiftly without former planning or design, through the imbrication of social activities with affordances and constraints of online communities. Our study contributes to (1) the recent interest in spontaneous action in social movements; (2) how social media affordances and constraints affect social movements, and (3) methodologies for studying digital social movements. © 2022, Academy of Management.

A fresh philosophically-informed perspective on judgment is offered. Specifically, Hannah Arendt’s discussion of judging is outlined, investigated and drawn from to offer a new way of thinking about and considering judgment and its role in OMT. An Arendtian-inspired understanding of judging sees it as a practical, ever-unfolding and affective communicative process that allows for general perspectives to be taken on specific issues. The importance of judgment to managers and leaders is readily accepted, but how it is performed and what difference it makes to how organizing unflolds, is less commonly discussed. It is argued that when actors are interested in something they are judging. To say one must not judge is akin to saying one should be disinterested. Two specific aspects of Arendt’s work on judgment are highlighted: the role of opinion and sensus communis—which presents judging as a relational undertaking. This article aims to stimulate new thinking around judgment and new considerations of its role in how organizing and organization are accomplished. © 2022, Academy of Management.

On the one hand, Critical Management Studies(CMS) scholars have shown the risk of being fooled by truncated project of emancipation in the context of organization, and the particular importance of safeguarding an integral idea of emancipation in management studies. On the other hand, recent research on organization shows the potential of alternative organizations as privileged vehicles for collective action for societal challenges and for emancipation. However, the question of how organizations can promote the emancipation of their beneficiaries remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we integrate CMS insights into an organizational perspective. Using Nancy’s Fraser theory of social justice, we develop a framework for the study of organized emancipation. We apply this framework to a network of alternative organizations: Maisons familiales rurales (MFR). For more than 80 years, MFRs have been successfully delivering professional education to underprivileged youth in rural areas. Through qualitative study based on 69 interviews and 200+ archival documents, allows us to map out challenges of and to propose a three-stage model of organized emancipation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

BEHAVIORAL INCONSISTENCY IN LEADERSHIP ROLE TRANSITION AND ITS EFFECT ON LEADER EFFECTIVENESS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188085252&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.259&partnerID=40&md5=37ea8af130e806f1133165c0e3a6f8e5,"Although leader behavioral adaptability is generally considered a strength, there may be situations where abrupt changes in behavior send the wrong signal to followers, resulting in diminished perceptions of leader effectiveness. We draw on social information processing and signaling theory to argue that within-person behavioral inconsistency following nonleader to leader role transitions will be interpreted negatively by followers. We hypothesize that overt changes in relationship- and task-oriented behaviors when transitioning into a leader role will negatively influence follower perceptions of leader effectiveness and that this effect would be stronger when followers have a heightened behavioral awareness. To test our hypotheses we conducted a randomized controlled experiment with 191 student teams split into a control group and an intervention group. Results from multilevel polynomial regression showed that significant behavioral deviation negatively affected leader effectiveness ratings and that increasing relationship-oriented behaviors as a leader is more detrimental to effectiveness ratings than increasing task-oriented behaviors. Interestingly, behaviors observed prior to taking the leader role were more significant in predicting leader effectiveness ratings once in role, than the person’s behavior while in the role. Implications of these findings for research theory and practice are discussed. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, scholarly focus was mostly allocated to how network ties are interpreted by audiences and to what extent the interpretation affects performance in return. Departing from previous studies, I explore a largely unexplored and often casually assumed process: how are network ties broadcasted by social actors prior to their interpretation by audiences? Leveraging unique data on gaming (League of Legends) YouTubers where players are randomly matched with others, I investigate the effect of status on the selection of which ties to broadcast. This paper contributes to organizational research by theorizing the relationship between two effects of broadcasted network ties–endorsement and attention-grabbing–and discretion in network formation. I find that random network ties with higher status others are broadcasted to attract audience attention. However, the value of broadcasting ties with higher status others is greater for high-status than for low-status actors, which is at odds with the prediction of endorsement effects under full discretion, due to the amplified attention given to multiple high-status actors and the competitive pressure between high-and low-status actors. This paper aims to provide a novel perspective that network ties as signals can be conceived as a source of information which actors can strategically leverage. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Eliciting creative (novel and useful) ideas from patients may enrich innovation with distinct information on experience, emotions, and needs. This research examines the potential of systematically elicited creative ideas to catalyze innovation in ambulatory care. Drawing on literature on creativity and user-based innovation, we developed and tested a survey approach to elicit patients' creative ideas for health care improvement. First, ideas extracted from 600 narratives from a representative sample were categorized thematically and analyzed for impact on closed-ended patient experience scores. Next, 1,053 narratives were collected from patients in one ambulatory care system, and we applied an innovation-focused coding schema. Patients' creative ideas addressed care experiences broadly and were significantly associated with closed-ended patient experience scores, which suggests perceived improvement gaps and idea sharing are correlated. Ideas provided information on solutions, problems, exemplars, and aspirational change, with high levels of specificity. Reframing patient participation at the beginning of the innovation process situates patients in a rare and powerful position of informing agenda setting. This approach expands our view on engagement by reimagining patients as a unique source of expertise to achieve patient-centered care. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We test our hypotheses using panel data of 1,087 listed firms based in 48 countries, with CSI incidents occurring in 150 host countries during 2007-2018. We find that both stronger home and host institutions are negatively associated with CSI occurring in the host markets, but the mitigating effect of host (home) institutions on CSI will be weaker when home (host) institutions are stronger. We further find that as institutional distance between home and host countries increases, MNEs’ involvement in CSI incidents in the host countries grows. We contribute to CSI research and ‘distance’ literatures by offering theoretical mechanisms and empirical evidence on whether and when MNEs respond to varied stakeholder and institutional pressures in their CSI engagements. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In this paper, we argue that adaptation is a moral issue for many firms because a failure to do so now might not affect their own operations but will have detrimental impacts for others. We develop the argument that emotions can change the influence of cognitive biases in the decision-making process on firms’ climate adaptation. Emotions modify how decision makers act on the issue’s moral intensity and ultimately the decision to adapt to climate events. We develop a conceptual framework that examines how decision makers’ emotions and cognitive biases interact and influence their decision making on climate adaptation. We draw on research on climate adaptation, (social) psychology, and managerial cognition and focus on three forms biases: Availability heuristic, framing, and anchoring. We explain how each bias influences decision making on adaptation and theorize how emotions of different valence and arousal influence this process. We shed light on the underlying mechanisms that explain how emotions influence the role of cognitive biases in this decision-making process. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the ways in which decision makers come to decisions on how to act on the moral issue of climate change adaptation by considering both cognitive and emotional cognition. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We argue that the organizational design—specifically the diversity of human capital—can create HC complementarities. These complementarities as well as characteristics of employees expertise, their tenure, and differences in expertise between firms affect who leaves post-acquisition. Thus, who leaves post-acquisition can be, at least partially, explained by the characteristics of the target’s human capital prior to acquisition.

KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVER AND KNOWLEDGE SPILLBACK IN ALLIANCES,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188058960&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.76&partnerID=40&md5=709cd143fa13afc83ed8b36f7fcda99c,"Research on alliances suggests that exposing knowledge to partners can restrict a firm’s appropriation of value from that knowledge. The current study examines the possibility that knowledge spillover to a partner can instead provide opportunities for the firm to learn from the partner’s inventions that build upon the spilled knowledge, thereby enabling the firm to regain value that would otherwise be lost. This is termed “knowledge spillback.” Analyses of 1,089 alliances formed during the period 2000–2015 by 323 firms in the global electronics and machinery industries show that knowledge spillover to a partner induces subsequent knowledge spillback, yet knowledge spillback diminishes as knowledge spillover intensifies. I demonstrate that the positive association of knowledge spillback with spillover is reinforced by the cumulativeness of the firm’s knowledge. In turn, this positive association is weakened by the firm’s reliance on prior industry knowledge and by the relatedness of the firm’s and partner’s knowledge bases. Exploratory post- hoc analyses also show that knowledge spillback from partners increases the technological value of the firm’s inventions, and thus can contribute to the firm's value gain from its alliances. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The established task assignment system delegates tasks directly to workers and should optimize productivity, assuming that workers act fully rational. However, the production faces challenges that are rooted in human agency and lack of autonomy. Combining theories on operational transparency and self-determination, we alter the production system to stop “pushing” work to employees but enabling them to “pull” work independently from a pool of work tasks. We find that the combination of increased transparency and autonomy improves workers’ effectiveness and operational performance. © 2022, Academy of Management.

HOW IMMIGRANT CEOS INFLUENCE CORPORATE SOCIAL IRRESPONSIBILITY,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188067031&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.132&partnerID=40&md5=88a31bd49b7ea83ce6586a53365a6808,"Drawing insights from the place attachment theory and the upper echelons perspective, this study establishes a link between CEO immigration background and the geography of firms’ corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) incidents. We theorize that immigrant CEOs tend to develop a psychological bonding with their homeland countries, which consequently stimulates place-protective behaviors towards their homelands, leading to fewer CSI incidents in the CEOs’ homeland countries than others. We then explore two boundary conditions—rootedness and reinforcement—that can further enhance immigrant CEOs’ attachment to their homelands and moderate the relationship between CEO immigration background and the geography of their firms’ CSI incidents. With a longitudinal dataset of S&P 500 firms during the period of 2007-2020, we find that a firm led by an immigrant CEO tends to have fewer CSI incidents in the CEO’s homeland country compared to other countries, and such effect is stronger for CEOs who immigrated as an adult rather than as a child and when homeland countries become more important (i.e., having greater sales growth) to the companies. Our findings provide important extensions to the migration research, the upper echelons theory, and the CSI research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In this paper we propose a formal framework to examine how a strategist (e.g., a founder) can get others (e.g., an investor) to agree on his view of the future by communicating parts of his theory (e.g., convince him that the business model is scalable). Because his theory may be in conflict with others' theories getting them to agree may require them to give up beliefs. We use our framework to derive formal results about the difficulty to get agreement. Our framework builds on established assumptions about forward-looking reasoning, augmented with the assumption that strategists give up weakest premises of their theories first when faced with contradictions. Our results provide insights on how strategists can create “cognitive buy-in” on their views from others and thus shape organizations and markets to tap into new opportunities. © 2022, Academy of Management.

COMPARING WHAT TO WHOM?

The effect of social comparisons that result from the experience of stratification have typically been measured with respect only to pay. However, the workplace is a core site of stratification, and research has shown that workers consider a wide variety of job characteristics beyond pay in evaluating their jobs. This paper evaluates work schedule quality in low-wage foodservice and retail as a job characteristic that workers draw upon as a source of comparison, by analyzing an original employer-identified survey of 1,049 respondents from 10 large, national companies. I first establish through free-text responses that frontline workers have multiple pathways to access information regarding coworkers' schedules. Next, I find that frontline workers are more likely to compare schedule quality to their coworkers, and compare wages between employers. I hypothesize that this difference may be in part due to the visibility of schedules in the workplace, and develop a theoretical distinction between context-specific and context-agnostic positional goods. Further, I find evidence of steep declines in schedule satisfaction, overall job satisfaction, and increases in turnover intentions when frontline workers feel they have worse schedules than their coworkers. In contrast, I find limited evidence for small to modest improvements when workers feel they are treated better than average. These findings demonstrate a clear inflection point around feelings of being treated worse than the average coworker, rather than the linear, incremental effect that is typically assumed in measurements of relative deprivation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We find evidence for this proposition for a sample of US-headquartered Information and Communications Technology firms that went public between 2000 and 2015. Specifically, we find that firms with an immigrant CEO have a lower likelihood of financial misrepresentation than native-led firms, particularly when immigrant CEOs are also their firm’s founders.

This is puzzling, given that Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies enable machines to analyze problems and search for solutions under conditions of uncertainty. Our paper addresses this lacuna by introducing a framework that conceptualizes the key types of technology-based search that organizations use. We advance that organizations engage in hybrid problem solving by drawing on both AI-based machines and humans in the search process. Our theoretical model unpacks these hybrid problem-solving processes for three technology-based search types: Automated (i.e., machines search independently, humans select from the machines’ solutions), augmented (i.e., machines and humans search sequentially), and interactive search (i.e., machines and humans search jointly). We further identify how these processes affect organizations’ search outcomes and specify that time and expertise availability moderate these effects. Together, our conceptualizations reveal how hybrid problem solving changes organizations’ search processes and outcomes. We discuss these insights’ implications for a range of perspectives on how organizations conduct search, paying special attention to technology-based search’s potential for reducing organizations’ traditional search constraints. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The findings of the field study of this case are that cross-department communication operation structure has an effect on organizational performance and digital innovation.

Without the voice at their center, many of these entrepreneurial situations would be inconceivable. Research in diverse academic disciplines – ranging from psychology, linguistics, and communications to evolutionary biology – has revealed that the human voice itself and independently from the literal content elicits strong effects on the perceptions of listeners. Counterintuitively, however, and in sharp contrast to its potential relevance, the role of the human voice has thus far been neglected in entrepreneurship research. In the present paper, we introduce a conceptual model of the role of the voice in entrepreneurship.

A key challenge for ecosystem orchestrators involves coordinating complementors and their contributions through a technical architecture and interfaces. Existing research emphasizes that technological architectures are critical for implementing ecosystem strategies because architectures determine how components offered by different organizations may function together to have complementary value. Interfaces determine how ecosystem value is generated. They come into being as firms open up stable architectures to integrate complementors. But how do firms create ecosystems in the absence of stable technical architectures? Drawing on a longitudinal field study of the emergence of the professional 3D printing industry, we distinguishing two processes—internalizing and externalizing. Through internalizing, firms generate knowledge about the nature of complementarity within an ecosystem that is instructive for defining exactly how complementors can be aligned to create value for customers. Externalizing imbues an ecosystem with flexibility so it can accommodate a new architecture that amplifies the complementarity of complements. © 2022, Academy of Management.

This study, specifically, looked at a form of alternative work arrangement–multiple job holding (MJH)–involving individuals engaged in independent work, gig work, part-time work, freelancing, or entrepreneurship, along with holding full-time employment, which challenges the traditional assumption of “sequential career transitions” by combining multiple work roles and identities at the same time. Through the case of MJH, we explore the role of organizations in contemporary careers, which are characterized by non-linearity, non-hierarchical and multi-directionality. Our analysis of semi-structured interviews with 25 multiple job holders and 15 organizational stakeholders revealed an ambivalence towards MJH arrangements. While the formal policies denied the existence of MJH arrangements within the organization, the informal culture and practices appeared to support and encourage parallel career opportunities for individuals. An unsaid conditional acceptance of MJH was observed, with the acknowledgment of its potential benefits in enriching individual careers and ultimately, their contribution to organizational goals.

While prior studies have investigated the role of improvisation in organisations, there have been few, if any, studies that have systematically examined the relationship between intuition, creativity, and bricolage, three degrees of improvisation (minor, bounded and structural) and three levels of application (individual, interpersonal and organizational). In this research, we developed and explored a matrix model with these elements which lead to the identification of three organisational focuses, namely the constructivist, structuralist, and behavioural focus. The model was then applied to a proof-of-concept carried out over two years in the Chinese subsidiary of a German industrial group. Data from twelve semi structured interviews, three focus groups and internal documents have been triangulated. The study focuses on the post-implementation period of SAP and on the determinant factors that lead to different types of improvisations which were instrumental for the success of SAP in the organisation. We found that the improvisations performed in the post-implementation context of SAP have a clear correspondence with a constructivist organizational focus in terms of organizational coexistence and institutional legitimization. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the following: management tools to channel improvisations, organisational implication in terms of selection and development of the potential of workers according to their capacities and their attitudes toward the organisation’s focus, strategic alignment between organisational focus, performance, and resource allocation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Audit studies and experiments have modelled demographic disparities as conditional on a given or fixed evaluation process, but evaluation practices can vary across investment organizations, which could affect outcomes. To reduce demographic disparities, investment organizations face a tension between structuring evaluation to enable equitable comparison across novel ideas by all evaluators and founders, and leveraging evaluator intuition, which can improve decision-making in uncertain environments. I conducted a multimethod field study leveraging interviews, observation data, and two field experiments with 69 trainee investors making over 510 $20,000 investment decisions. I theorize that by structuring intuition – providing organization-level evaluation tools to encourage individual investors to systematically seek and report data gathered through intuition – organizations could reduce demographic disparities in outcomes. I provide causal evidence that when investment organizations structure evaluation they can reduce gender disparities in evaluation, with meaningful implications for startups with female founders. I discuss the implications for investment organizations, and any organization managing the tension between using structured data and leveraging employee intuition when making decisions in innovation settings. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, while studies have focused on tensions of different value contributions, there have been few studies examining tensions with regard to the adoption and retention of new HR roles. Although the HR literature emphasizes that role transformation, for example, to a more strategic or even hybrid form is associated with challenges for HR professionals, it remains largely unknown how and why tensions emerge and how they are managed. Drawing on the hybrid literature on tensions and their management, this article aims to address this gap by means of a single-case study conducted in a nonprofit organization. The findings show that role transformation tensions emerge due to a low cognitive flexibility of HR professionals and at the same time and a high structural flexibility with regard to organizational strategy, structures, and processes.

THE DYNAMICS OF CAREER SUSTAINABILITY: A LATENT TRANSITION ANALYSIS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188074053&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.191&partnerID=40&md5=8f4a123359b50f030304dd3ca5f443d3,"As individuals are facing more and more uncertainties and challenges in their career development, building up sustainable careers with balanced health, happiness, and productivity is important for both employers and employees. In the field of career management, however, there are few empirical investigations on career sustainability and its dynamics. Integrating the theoretical framework of sustainable career and person-environment fit theory, the current study uses two-wave longitudinal data (N = 529) to empirically identify the profiles of employees’ career sustainability and further examine the effect of person-environment fit on profile transitions. For each wave of data, Latent Profile Analyses (LPAs) consistently revealed four latent profile classes of employee career sustainability: highly sustainable, health-oriented, performance-oriented, and unsustainable. Moreover, a Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) model indicated that employees with higher person-environment fit were more likely to go through positive transitions in career sustainability; on the contrary, employees with lower person-environment fit were more likely to go through negative transitions in career sustainability. This study enriches the literature on employees’ sustainable careers and further deepens the understanding of career dynamics and sustainability transitions from the perspective of person-environment fit. Also, this study provides practical implications for career management. © 2022, Academy of Management.

LOSS AVERSION NUDGES TO IMPROVE HEATING BEHAVIOR AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188077166&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.172&partnerID=40&md5=6714adfa816c3861fd5262a0e8644ebe,"Residential heating is a major source of carbon emissions and, at the same time, represents a significant cost factor for households. Thus, reducing heating costs through sustainable heating behaviors is of great individual and societal interest. However, the consequences of heating behaviors are complex and delayed, so most people are unaware of them. To address this problem, we designed two loss aversion nudges, using (i) a cost salience and (ii) a health risk framing to induce more sustainable heating and ventilation behaviors. We evaluated them against a no-intervention control group in a field experiment at a major German real estate company. While the cost salience nudge was found to improve heating behaviors and became more effective over time, the health risk nudge did not show an effect. Finally, our findings have implications for research on nudging and loss aversion and for practitioners, namely housing providers and more generalized entities aiming to nudge for pro-environmental behaviors. © 2022, Academy of Management.

One of the tactics deployed by the governments related to slowing down the spread of the virus by tracing the contacts of individuals who were in proximity with those people that have been tested positive for COVID-19. Countries showed uneven success. The variety in responses was not only related to the extent to which the countries were impacted by the pandemic, but also by the way in which the governments decided to intervene in the management of this crisis. Hence, in this article, we analyze the variation in contact tracing technologies across countries. We propose that the type and quality of government intervention drive the differences in the rates of diffusion and adoption of contact tracing apps across countries. We explain this as an outcome of the complex signaling problems and institutional drivers related to the nature of governments’ intervention. We test our hypotheses on a unique, self-assembled dataset of contact tracing apps and their governments’ characteristics across a large number of countries. The signaling mechanisms deployed by the governments seem to have varying effects on the success of contact tracing technologies, with trust and privacy being the major drivers in adoption by citizens of such technologies. We find that the success of tracking strategies is inversely related to the quality of institutions–state capitalist countries fared better than less interventionist, more liberal economies. © 2022, Academy of Management.

THE VENTURE IS CALLING: UNDERSTANDING ENTREPRENEURIAL CALLINGS AND THEIR EFFECT ON ACTION,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188057974&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.48&partnerID=40&md5=271888f6111f53c531477e577e085d4b,"Being an entrepreneur is a uniquely hard job riddled with uncertainty, long working hours and low pay. Yet, many choose to become entrepreneurs. To understand why people choose such hard jobs, organizational psychologists have drawn on the concept of ‘callings’, arguing that people feel a deep connection between their personal identity and their chosen job. However, little is known about entrepreneurial callings. To improve knowledge here, I analyzed 100 podcast interviews with leading entrepreneurs to understand why they feel called to become entrepreneurs, why they feel passion for being an entrepreneur and how it affects their entrepreneurial journey. I find four archetypes of entrepreneurial callings narratives: predestined (becoming an entrepreneur to realize oneself), discoverers (becoming an entrepreneur to work with something they love), fighters (becoming an entrepreneur to transform as a person) and Samaritans (becoming an entrepreneur to help others). These callings differ in overall motivation for becoming an entrepreneur, what the entrepreneur feels passion for and shapes entrepreneurial action in different ways. By unpacking these different entrepreneurial callings narratives, my study challenges and extends work on entrepreneurial identity and passion, as well as providing new insights into the nature of callings. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We theorize in the context of the bio-pharmaceutical industry where firms engage in uncertain and costly R&D to develop and commercialize the next “blockbuster” drug. We relate financial market scrutiny to a strategic choice firms face: whether to develop R&D projects in-house or license out their technologies to earn short-term returns. To develop and explicate the mechanism underlying our central argument, we first undertake a qualitative analysis of analyst reports, which reveals that analysts not only have strong preferences for the blockbuster drug model, but also have clear reservations against the out-licensing model. We then use a robust empirical design that addresses both the endogeneity of analyst coverage and the challenges in measuring a firm’s licensing intent, to test this mechanism in a large multi-year panel of bio-pharmaceutical firms. Overall, we contribute to research that examines how institutional pressures shape firms’ innovation strategies, and provide important implications for scholars and practitioners focusing on interfirm collaborations and markets for technology. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Research on organizational stigma has made large strides in the past two decades, yet intra-organizational processes that condition the lived experience of those who are stigmatized have remained black-boxed. We examine how intra-organizational dynamics affect the process of organizational stigmatization through an empirical case of a public broadcaster that initially experienced episodic stigmatization. We demonstrate how internal contention in the organization favored those who opposed the stigma, leading to an organizational response characterized by defiance and denial. This reinforced audience disapproval of the broadcaster, leading to core stigmatization—the discounting of the organization as a whole based on a core identity. Our study contributes to understanding stigma not as an attribute but as a process, where the nature of stigma is susceptible to change not only due to environmental factors but also as a result of the actions (and inactions) of the stigmatized organization. Additionally, we shed light on the intra- organizational processes that generate organizational responses to stigma. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We theorize that organizations’ continuous crowdsourcing initiatives are characterized by an interplay between organizations’ selection of ideas and contributors’ submission of ideas that narrows the kind of ideas organizations gain access to. Specifically, organizations select a subset of the crowdsourced ideas for implementation. Contributors–who strive to see their ideas implemented–then submit ideas similar to those already chosen by organizations. We suggest that this “co-evolutionary lockin” where the variety of ideas narrows is strengthened the more consistent an organization’s selection is because it then provides a clearer signal for contributors regarding the type of knowledge the organization is looking for. By contrast, the co-evolutionary lock is attenuated if contributors are less aware of or pay less attention to the organizations’ selection. We examine our theory by creating a novel dataset that includes the crowdsourcing initiatives of 70,159 organizations. Using text analysis, we measure a variety of ideas at the community level and examine its intertemporal dynamics.

Our findings, drawn from a multisource and multilevel dataset, indicate that flexibility-enhancing reforms lead to higher growth ambitions particularly for established and for imitative entrepreneurs.

Importantly, heterogeneity assessments can cause confusion without accurate reporting and interpretation. To advance our understanding of heterogeneity assessments, we conduct a brief overview of the particular statistics that are used to assess the presence of heterogeneity and quantify its amount. Then, we examine the degree to which meta-analytic studies have reported assessments of heterogeneity and interpreted the results. We coded heterogeneity-related information from all meta-analytic studies published in five leading management and applied psychology journals that regularly publish meta-analytic reviews between 2010 and 2011 as well as 2018 and 2019. By sampling from different time periods, we were able to assess temporal trends. Overall, we found that most meta-analytic studies report several heterogeneity statistics. At the same time, however, there tends to be a lack of rigor in the interpretation of heterogeneity-related information in most meta-analytic studies. This situation is relatively stable over the past decade and is not affected by the general research area or the level of analysis. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for practice and provide recommendations for how heterogeneity assessments should be conducted and interpreted in future research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In addition, the trickle-down effect of supervisors’ job insecurity via abusive supervision is contingent upon supervisors’ communion striving, such that supervisors’ high-level communion striving weakens the positive indirect effect via abusive supervision. Our study extends the job insecurity literature by explaining how, why, and when supervisors’ job insecurity trickles down to their subordinates, which opens avenues for future research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Physicians’ leadership and active involvement in the governance as a result of integration, can direct resource usage, EHR implementation, price negotiation, better coordination and continuity of services for patients. All of the above can impact hospitals’ quality and financial performance. A longitudinal study design was used to analyze the association between physician hospital integration and its impact on hospital performance. The independent variable explored three different dimensions of integration- high, low, and overall integration. The dependent variables consisted of quality outcomes (readmission rates) and financial outcomes (total and operating margins). Our dataset comprised of hospital level data from 2014 to 2018, and contained 6,000 U.S. hospital year observations. Findings showed no impact of physician hospital integration on quality outcomes and financial performance. High integration hospitals did not show any significant relationships with quality outcomes and financial performance as compared to hospitals that did not have high integration. Physician hospital integration may not have the potential to bring clinical integration even though vertical integration is present. A commitment to improving quality as a strategic priority may be key in impacting quality outcomes, followed by financial performance. A culture of safety needs to be fostered in hospitals, for quality and patient safety to improve. Organizational culture and mindset of quality and safety need to be nurtured through physician involvement in hospitals’ decision-making. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Through an analysis of 109 country-level industries for the innovative product of clean cookstoves between 2013 and 2018, it is found that entrepreneurial entry into the industry is predicted by the number of organizations that operated both in these countries and in countries where an infrastructure-building intermediary also operated. It is argued that the cross-border effects of the intermediary occur through the development of institutional carriers. These institutional carriers take part in a process of inter-organizational evangelism, as they are attracted to the industry-supporting institutional infrastructure established by the intermediary, grow in their acceptance of this institutional infrastructure, and extend elements of this institutional infrastructure to other places where they operate. Empirical analyses additionally show that the effectiveness of institutional carriers on entrepreneurial entry in the nascent industry depends on the carriers’ size and activities, as well as the culture of the countries that receives these carriers. The findings of this research shed new light on institutional carriers and the intermediaries that develop them, and they carry implications for how the growth of industries promoting innovations - especially those that generate health, social, and/or environmental benefits - can be supported globally. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Our research delivers one clear message: firms engage in investment activities that enable them to avoid direct factor market competition. Within the domestic country, we conjecture that firms facing competition will increase their investment in riskier activities in pursuit of resources. Beyond the domestic country, firms are likely to escape competition by looking for opportunities abroad: yet they selectively do so by entering low-risk countries in search for resources. Once they enter low-risk countries, firms further engage in less international risk-taking activities. Empirical analyses testing our hypotheses corroborate our ideas. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Limited attention has been paid to the competency development impact of work related to a student major career interest. To address this void, we analyze the direct and mediating effects of ESC competencies on innovative behavior. Results from a sample of university students demonstrate that sandwich work placements (long-term, full-time internship) help developing ESCs; that higher levels of ESC competencies predict innovative behavior; and that sandwich work placement also directly promote innovative behavior.

Information cues can affect their propriety beliefs, which is the micro-level component of legitimacy, but it remains unclear how evaluators use various information cues related to corporate environmental responsibility. To shed light on the development of propriety beliefs, according to different information cues, this study presents a vignette experiment (n = 1,000) that distinguishes corporate information cues and validity information cues. The former indicate same- or cross-sector partnerships, in combination with substantive or symbolic collaborative actions; the latter instead feature a third-party rating. Our results suggest that evaluators react differently to corporate information cues, and pre-existing attitudes (i.e., attitudes towards greenwashing) affect the formation of propriety beliefs. In contrast, participants were generally responsive to validity cues. These theoretical insights suggest that evaluators establish an information hierarchy, such that they focus on seemingly reliable validity cues, and only a subsample of them incorporate more ambiguous corporate information cues. Thus, audience heterogeneity is critical information for understanding the formation of propriety beliefs. The results also warn businesses that they have limited opportunities to increase their legitimacy through self-initiated communications, so they need to pursue collective-level validity. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Drawn from a panel of nonprofits in three Upstate New York cities from 1998 to 2014, the analysis shows that chief executive officers (CEOs) compensation is significantly and positively related to interlocking directorships of CEOs and boards of directors. The results reveal that CEOs enjoy more compensation when he or she serves on the boards in other nonprofit organizations, and when the nonprofits are served by busy boards where a majority of members in the boardroom serve on boards of multiple nonprofits. The analysis further shows that financial rewards offered to executives are contingent upon monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors measured as gender diversity in the boardroom. These findings suggest that board composition plays a critical role in executive compensation setting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Combining resilience and upper echelons research, we argue that CEOs prepare for and adjust to unexpected events in their environment based on their temporal orientation. We argue that CEOs’ long-term orientation fosters organizational resilience during crises, which is reflected in their firms’ lower severity of loss and time to recovery. We suggest that this relationship is moderated by TMT diversity. Studying 745 CEOs of S&P500 firms during the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that firms led by long-term oriented CEOs face less severe economic losses but take longer time to recover from adversity. Yet, these firms recover more quickly when long-term oriented CEOs can draw on a diverse TMT. Our paper contributes to the research on organizational resilience by uncovering its microfoundations. We also contribute to the upper echelons research by unveiling CEOs’ role in preparing for and adjusting to adversity.

Since #MeToo, companies have been innovating to increase the effectiveness of SH training by incorporating new content (e.g., bystander intervention skills) and new technology (e.g., virtual reality, hereafter VR). However, research has yet to determine the best practices or the effectiveness of these new innovations. The current study hypothesizes that SH bystander intervention training will be more effective when VR practice scenarios are used rather than 2D video practice scenarios. We argue that the increased presence (i.e., the perception that people and places in a virtual simulation are real) afforded by VR should better replicate bystander experiences in real SH situations, thereby allowing trainees to develop bystander skills in a more realistic practice experience than 2D video provides. We experimentally test our hypothesis in a laboratory setting (N = 100). Our results show that the VR practice condition outperformed the 2D video condition by increasing trainees’ intentions to engage in indirect, non-confrontational, and widely applicable interventions (e.g., intervene by removing the target from the situation, approach the target to offer support later). However, our manipulation showed a negative effect on practice engagement (i.e., those in the VR condition explored fewer response options) and no effect on other operationalizations of training effectiveness (e.g., motivation to learn, knowledge, attitudes toward the training, intentions to directly confront the harasser, and intentions to formally report the harassment).

In contrast to previous research which largely focused on the isolated effects of individual CEO characteristics, we argue that CEOs each represent a specific configuration of demographic, personality, and network attributes, and suggest that it is the conjunction of those attributes that explains managerial attention. Based on multi-source data from 126 industrial firms, we conduct exploratory fsQCA and reveal three major configurational patterns linked to high levels of managerial attention, and four patterns linked to low attention. Subsuming the gained insight, we develop a comprehensive typology of CEOs and interpret each configurational profile in light of previous top management research. On the one hand, our findings replicate and refine the results of past works, e.g., by demonstrating that the combination of personal need for acclaim and intra-industry social contacts consistently result in high levels of attention. On the other hand, we expand existing theories by uncovering attention-inducing CEO attribute configurations that were not previously discussed in the literature. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In contrast, organizations with performance below social aspirations are more likely to employ high performers with misconduct records as a cheap and quick solution to their performance strains. Evidence from transfers of professional cyclists after their suspension due to doping accusations supports these arguments, which suggests that the underlying process of interpreting social aspirations and historical aspirations may be distinct in misconduct context. © 2022, Academy of Management.

CONSEQUENCES OF THE UNEQUAL DIVISION OF COGNITIVE LABOR ON WOMEN’S WORK OUTCOMES DURING THE PANDEMIC,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188074535&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.271&partnerID=40&md5=478198970c077e33c04a2dbaa9cc58ad,"The unequal division of unpaid labor between working women and their male partners remains a barrier to achieving workplace gender equality; women consistently bear responsibility for this “second shift” and suffer career consequences as a result. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities. In addition to managing their current work and household demands, women may be disproportionately engaged in a less visible form of labor – cognitive labor – during the pandemic, which constitutes a hidden “third shift” and may have consequences for women’s work outcomes. Integrating theories of gender roles and conservation of resources, we theorize that women (vs. men) are responsible for a greater proportion of cognitive labor within their households during the pandemic, leading to increased emotional exhaustion and undermining work outcomes. Data (N = 263) from our main study collected weekly for eight weeks near the beginning of the pandemic reveals that women (vs. men) reported engaging in a disproportionate amount of cognitive labor, which led to increased emotional exhaustion. In turn, emotional exhaustion was related to greater turnover intentions and undermined career resilience. Further, results of a follow-up study provide additional insights into daily experiences of cognitive labor. Our findings suggest that women’s heavy second and third shifts during the pandemic threaten to set back progress toward workplace gender equality. © 2022, Academy of Management.

This view presupposes the flow of novel information among potential entrepreneurs. Yet, we know comparatively little on how localized social structures (e.g., collective social capital and residential segregation) that affect information flows condition this effect. We build on the sociological literature to theorize how the interplay between collective social capital and residential segregation moderates the ethnic diversity-entrepreneurship relationship. We test, and find empirical support for, our hypotheses among all new ventures started in the United States between 1990 and 2018. © 2022, Academy of Management.

THE SURPRISING UNDERPERFORMANCE OF EAST ASIANS IN US LAW AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS: THE LIABILITY OF LOW ASSERTIVENESS AND THE AMELIORATIVE POTENTIAL OF ONLINE CLASSROOMS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188058464&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.22&partnerID=40&md5=6b9da4753f9fdbca7b65c8954b825a1a,"In the US, Asians are commonly assumed to excel across all educational stages. We challenge this assumption by revealing the underperformance of ethnic East Asians in US law schools and business schools, two prevalent professional schools that are consequential gateways to societal influence. Whereas most educational and governmental statistics lump all Asians together, we distinguish culturally between East Asians (e.g., ethnic Chinese) and South Asians (e.g., ethnic Indians), the two largest Asian groups in the US. We propose that East Asians—but not South Asians—underperform academically because their low verbal assertiveness is culturally incongruent with the assertive class participation prized by US law schools and business schools. Across six large studies (N = 19,194), East Asians had lower grades than South Asians and Whites despite performing well on admission tests (i.e., LSAT, GMAT, GRE). East Asians’ underperformance was not explained by academic motivation, but by lower assertiveness (whether assessed by self-ratings, peer-ratings, or class participation scores) —after controlling for factors such as birth country and English proficiency. Consistent with the assertiveness mechanism, East Asians’ underperformance was more pronounced in social courses emphasizing class participation (e.g., leadership, strategy) than in quantitative courses (e.g., accounting, finance). Notably, we found that East Asians’ underperformance was mitigated in online classes conducted via Zoom, a communication medium characterized by lower social presence than in-person classes. By revealing a “Bamboo Ceiling” in the classroom, this research highlights the importance of fostering an inclusive classroom for students from diverse cultural backgrounds. © 2022, Academy of Management.

MEANS VERSUS ENDS IN BUSINESS ETHICS: A BEHAVIOURAL TRADE-OFF BETWEEN COMPLIANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAMMES,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188080099&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.121&partnerID=40&md5=16f48c77f8b5c8ad4c6bd1fe829bb521,"This paper discusses the compliance-achievement trade-off of corporate ethics programmes. To bridge gaps between moral intentions and actual choices of employees, ethics officers commonly emphasise compliance with a narrow subset of enforceable rules. However, compliance inducement might hinder an organisation’s broader value-oriented ethics goals. This trade-off prevails especially in complex organisational settings that are prone to trigger ethical fading, whereby the moral intentions of ethically-bounded humans become opaque. I define conditions for a corporate ethics approach under which the trade-off can be reduced and explore the behavioural concept of nudging as one possible approach that could fulfil the defined conditions. © 2022, Academy of Management.

PROBLEMATIZING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT: INSIGHTS FROM A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER NETWORK,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188080376&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.274&partnerID=40&md5=d7718b9d6d8b405655e2f5976d01b2f6,"This paper problematizes the overall positivity of stakeholder engagement literature and analyses its grey area. We discuss the bright and the dark side of stakeholder engagement and identify the grey area in between these two sides. Based on a qualitative content analysis of 26 interviews collected from circular economy stakeholders in Finland, we identify three sources of the grey area of stakeholder engagement: the individual stakeholder, stakeholder relationships and the institutional context. According to our analysis, the grey area consists of challenges caused by individual resistance and individual inability, collaboration challenges, complexity caused by the diversity of perspectives, unpredictability caused by the political and legislative context and insecurity caused by environmental unpredictability. We argue that particularly in the context of a multi-stakeholder network, the grey area is a natural and unavoidable part of stakeholder engagement and thus, should also be explicitly recognized and discussed in the literature. © 2022, Academy of Management.

"FORGIVING, FAST AND SLOWER: WHEN FORGIVENESS LEADS TO THIRD-PARTY MORAL OUTRAGE",2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188089624&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.5&partnerID=40&md5=b70948879f242a52d36366494332b774,"Although forgiveness is deemed a virtue in social and organizational life, little is known about how third parties react to forgiveness. Drawing on deonance theory, we explore when third parties can judge the forgiver negatively—when it occurs too easily (i.e., too quick in time)—in the context of interpersonal mistreatment among co-workers. Across three studies (N = 624) (one within-subjects [preregistered] and two between-subjects design [one preregistered]), we find that fast (i.e., immediate) forgiveness leads to higher third-party moral outrage toward the forgiver than forgiveness provided more slowly (later in time 1 week to several months). This effect is mediated by third parties’ perceptions of deservingness—that the transgressor did not deserve to be forgiven this early—and is more pronounced when the offense is more versus less severe. Study 2 results show that immediate forgiveness can lead third parties to view the forgiver as less likable, less competent, and even tend to avoid the forgiver compared to when the forgiveness occurs later. Study 3 reveals that third parties can demonstrate “moral hypocrisy” such that their negative reactions toward immediate forgiving are more lenient when they can personally benefit from such actions. We advance deonance theory by exploring how moral outrage can arise from expressing forgiveness, triggering negative impressions of the forgiver, and consider boundary conditions when this effect is weaker versus stronger. From a practical perspective, our research has the potential to inform how forgiveness can occur in ways that, at a minimum, do not erode its benefits. © 2022, Academy of Management.

"WHY FIRMS HIDE THEIR LIGHT: BROWNWASH, SILENCE, AND BIFURCATED STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION",2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188092518&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.26&partnerID=40&md5=aff1408dffa7221d0145131c8717a050,"In the face of rapidly increasing public pressure, numerous firms are rushing to trumpet their environmental and social achievements on net-zero, ESG metrics, and justice and inequality commitments to anyone who will listen. While claims of greenwashing abound and are the subject of increasing scrutiny, many firms making real changes have, paradoxically, chosen to downplay and understate their accomplishments. In this paper we draw on emerging literature on brownwashing and silence to offer a comprehensive study of why and how firms undertake such activities, linking extant insights as well as offering a novel model and reconceptualization. Our rich qualitative study with leaders at over 50 North American wineries allows us to offer in depth and in situ insights. Our findings, first, highlight new mechanisms of non-communication not yet identified in this emerging literature. Second, our analysis offers the important insight that firms don’t simply hide their achievements in a reactive manner to avoid negative stakeholder pressures, as in current theory, but also do so when their practices are leading or more proactive than those of stakeholders. Finally, we examine three strategies by which firms divide and conquer through what we term bifurcated stakeholder communications: locational, channel, and temporal. This study also has important practical implications as society, policymakers, and NGOs seek to drive industry change on social and environmental grand challenges, and strive to engage firms publicly in leading change and addressing these challenges. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, aspiring entrepreneurs might also experience uncertainty within these spaces, because of the lack of structured mechanisms to leverage resources.

We explore these practices within Fablabs (fabrication laboratories). We contribute to research on uncertainty in the context of unconventional entrepreneurship and on collaborative spaces. We specifically identify three practices to manage uncertainty: community shaping, knowledge shaping and entrepreneurial culture shaping. Through an inductive qualitative research, we show how they shape the space by setting boundaries to it, allowing uncertainty to be managed and unconventional entrepreneurship to flourish. © 2022, Academy of Management.

FROM UNDER-INSTITUTIONALIZED TO SELF-GUIDED LIMINALITY: THE ROLE OF SITUATIONAL MEANING-MAKING,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188074027&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.113&partnerID=40&md5=185c75884463fe9721b042bb99f8bad8,"Liminality, defined as an uncertain and ambiguous state of being betwixt and between, has become more and more prevalent in contemporary career landscapes. So far, scholars have suggested that liminality in the contemporary precarious and fluctuating careers differs from its original highly-institutionalized anthropological focus; liminality could become under-institutionalized and unfold in a self-guided manner. However, the connection between under-institutionalized and self-guided liminality is not self-evident and remains unclear. To examine this theoretical void, we conduct qualitative research to examine the mechanism that bridges under-institutionalized and self-guided liminality. Our findings suggest that self-guidance in under-institutionalized liminality emerges via situational meaning-making. Moreover, we identify two varied forms of situational meaning-making— open-ended and closed-ended justifications—that pave different but equally purposeful meanings for liminal workers to enact, and in turn, feed individuals with different lived experiences to shape their identities. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Stakeholder requests are not necessarily authentic, which presents a challenge for firms. Firms need to commit resources to a response while being uncertain whether the stakeholder will commit resources to reward or sanction the response in the future. In the context of sustainable investing, we study how firms evaluate the authenticity of investor’s requests. We find that firms evaluate authenticity by examining investor’s underlying resource commitments. We contribute to stakeholder theory by suggesting that authenticity is an additional factor in deciding how and whether to respond to stakeholder requests. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We addressed these challenges by conducting a conceptual and meta-analytic review that synthesizes research on work effort. First, we reviewed conceptualizations of effort and provided an integrated definition that builds upon and subsumes existing ones. Second, we developed a taxonomy of operationalizations of effort that clarifies different measures and their nature. Third, we developed a nomological network to gain a better understanding of antecedents and outcomes of effort, as well as constructs that overlap with effort. Fourth, we conducted a meta-analysis that provides information regarding the nature and size of relations between effort and its proposed antecedents (e.g., conscientiousness, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, goal-setting) and outcomes (i.e., performance and results), as well as overlapping constructs (i.e., work engagement and grit). Finally, we delineated an agenda for future research on the measurement and effects of effort. We hope our work will be useful to researchers, as well as to organizations interested in implementing interventions aimed at enhancing work effort. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the strategies that raise the mobility constraints of the employees by either making employees' knowledge less appropriable by the competitors or by reducing the employee's motivation of mobility through pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives. While most of the studies focus on employee-level strategies that constrain the employee's pursuit of outside options, surprisingly little research focuses on the strategies that involve constraining the outside options provided by the competitors in the first place. In this study, we show that firms strategically reduce the employees' outside options by limiting competitors’ ability to observe value created by an employee. Specifically, we propose that employers will strategically reduce their employee visibility in the external labor market when faced with the threat of human capital loss to competitors. We test our predictions using data from the mutual fund industry between 1991 and 2007 and an exogenous state-level variation in the intensity of non-compete agreements, which indicate barriers to inter-firm mobility. We find strong support for our predictions in our difference-in-difference estimators exploiting state-level non-compete abandonments and adoptions. Our study contributes to theories of retention and strategic human capital, more broadly. © 2022, Academy of Management.

THREE TYPES OF CHANGE IN CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENT,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188075195&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.278&partnerID=40&md5=ab0528bde6ee37025ca95f25221fc18c,"Increasing globalization and cultural diversity have accentuated the importance of developing cross-cultural competencies like cultural intelligence (CQ). Typically, scholars and professionals have viewed and operationalized CQ development as a quantitative change in mean CQ scores over time. This work argues that research and practice will benefit from expanding the operationalization of CQ development to include CQ reconceptualization and CQ measures' recalibration because these types of change are also integral to the CQ development process. This work highlights that by not examining the presence of CQ reconceptualization and CQ measures' recalibration before examining changes in mean CQ scores over time, scholars and practitioners could fail to recognize the presence of CQ development when it happens and create a threat to the substantive interpretation of findings leading to inconsistent and conflicting results. Methodologies for assessing different types of change in CQ development are discussed with implications for improving cross-cultural competence research and practice. The main contribution of this work lies in providing ways for improving the rigor of CQ development studies to enhance the quality of CQ development research and practice. © 2022, Academy of Management.

A considerable body of work has unveiled how workplace inequality is perpetuated through existing organizational processes and structures that are difficult to change. We argue that structural reconfiguration associated with a non-incremental innovation adoption—one that requires the development of new capabilities—may dismantle such inertia and create an opportunity to increase workplace diversity significantly. Using a sample of 2,991 retail establishments from 2004 to 2015, supported by qualitative research, we found that a retailer’s adoption of e-commerce is associated with a significant increase of female and minority managers. After the adoption, the proportions of Black and women managers increased by 22 percent and 17 percent, respectively. This effect is more substantial in retailers subject to affirmative action requirements and in geographic areas where diversity practices are more normatively accepted. Our study offers one distinct pathway through which organizations can bolster workplace gender and racial diversity and invites future research that examines how various opportunities to advance diversity are created and exploited (or not) in the organization. © 2022, Academy of Management.

KNOWLEDGE SIMILARITY AMONG FOUNDERS AND JOINERS: IMPACT ON VENTURE SCALEUP IN FINTECH AND LAWTECH,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188048502&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.261&partnerID=40&md5=fec0614444576bb611038e1ea8a6a899,"In what ways does knowledge similarity among co-founders contribute to venture scaleup? This paper addresses this question by taking account of knowledge domains among early employees and in founders’ social networks. We build a theoretical framework to predict which knowledge combinations are likely to lead to venture growth at different stages. We test our theory using a database of 315 fintech and lawtech startups (with a total of 600 founders and 328 early joiners) in three locations (London, New York City, and San Francisco Bay Area) during the period 2009-2020. Our central finding is that venture growth is explained by knowledge-similar founding teams, founders’ social ties to other founders whose knowledge domains are different from their own, and knowledge-dissimilar employees. Moreover, the positive impact of knowledge similarity in founding teams on venture growth is stronger for older ventures than young ventures, and for mature than nascent ecosystems. These findings highlight the importance of simultaneously studying knowledge domains in founding teams, their social networks, and early employees. Just as important is to analyze the impact of knowledge similarity at different stages in the entrepreneurial process from ideas generation, choice of strategy, and strategy implementation. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Based on crossover and conservation of resources theories, this study examines how cognitive empathy serves as a resource that increases the recipient partner’s wellbeing and performance outcomes. The study further investigated the mediating role of psychological capital in the crossover process. Data from 140 copreneurs in Australia were analyzed using an actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM). Results showed that female cognitive empathy was positively related to male psychological wellbeing and job performance. Furthermore, psychological capital mediated the positive crossover effect of cognitive empathy on outcomes. Both female and male cognitive empathy indirectly enhanced their partner’s wellbeing and job performance by increasing their partner’s psychological capital.

THE IMPACT OF PAST UNDERDOG EXPERIENCES ON MAKING HIRING DECISIONS: A CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188048867&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.106&partnerID=40&md5=5b4cf0b5defd7a035eecad9075a61d6d,"People often react positively towards underdog stories, in which individuals who were expected to fail overcome odds and unexpectedly achieve success. Because of the widespread popularity of underdog stories, people who have a successful and desirable present state may strategically signal their past underdog experiences to improve their interpersonal standings. While some research indeed suggests that those who overcome an undesirable past to achieve current success are viewed more positively, the present research documents and examines potential downsides of having past underdog experiences. Across two studies, we found that in an instrumental context (i.e., workplace), holding the same desirable present state, people display decision-making biases (i.e., hiring decisions) against successful individuals who have past underdog experiences compared to those who consistently do well and are always expected to succeed. These effects are driven by ascribed future performance expectations. We furthermore investigate the potential role of cultural tightness-looseness in altering these relationships, such that people from tight (versus loose) cultures display greater aversion towards those who have past underdog experiences despite their present success. © 2022, Academy of Management.

The Elephant in the Room: How Workers Infer and Disclose Political Beliefs in the Workplace,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188055690&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.74&partnerID=40&md5=e035b776ad53782a4fbb4d325c80c6f7,"In the US, workers across industries are trying to resolve the new norms for discussing national-level politics with coworkers, especially when they are in the political minority in their organization. While existing research has focused on the negative outcomes of differences in political ideology at work, it has not yet examined how workers deal with the risk of such outcomes. By conceptualizing minority political ideology status as a situationally determined form of stigma, I argue that its nature allows workers to be strategic in how they disclose their beliefs to others. Through interviews with workers in the political minority within their workplace, I find that workers first use a practice of “ascertaining” to infer the political beliefs of others through use of statistical stereotypes or probing questions. Ascertaining the political ideology of their coworkers enables them to use disclosure practices I term “thresholding,” which can involve mitigating the political context, establishing common ground, and acknowledging the other side of the debate to share their own position. This serves to project a roughly accurate image of their political ideology to their coworkers, while avoiding the harsher consequences of revealing more objectionable parts of their beliefs. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We extend explorations of the ghostly into the domain of long-lived multinationals. Departed leaders highlight the capacity for temporal interplay, representing a ‘shorthand’ for members to understand the organization’s past, present, and future. It is their persistence and mutability that makes them ghostly, reaffirming the past yet remaining open to re-interpretation.

This paper applies a cultural anthropology perspective to provide explanations on the origins and dynamics of informal institutions and their effects on informal business performance. We posit that informal institutions originate from the traditions embedded in family systems, and we consider endogamy - the practice of marrying within a specific social group or local community - as a key dimension of family traditions relevant for performance of informal entrepreneurs. First, endogamy can make bridging trust more difficult to establish, limiting wider market opportunities for informal businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa and lowering their performance. Second, the evolution of informal institutions can be driven by external cultural interventions that are antipathetic to the pre-existing family systems. For example, the effect of endogamy might be attenuated by specific experiences of Africa’s colonial past, especially if the colonial powers were characterised by individualistic cultures. Our hypotheses are supported by the empirical analysis based on surveys of informal entrepreneurs in multiple regions of eight African countries. © 2022, Academy of Management.

I take an ethnomethodological approach to investigate the institutional deliberation of emerging technologies in U.S. congressional hearings and records.

Specifically, I discover that the legislators and experts engage with three discursive practices to resolve challenges in the sensemaking of emerging technologies: 1) the communicative use of culture resources in science fiction to evoke the shared memory of concepts, prototypes, scenarios, emotions about new technology; 2) the diametric use of science fiction to emphasize the accountability and rationality of institutional context and and to justify the perceived “appropriateness” policy timing and time horizon; 3) the analytical use of science fiction to juxtapose science fiction with practical reasoning to establish the perceived “rationality” of the risk and benefit evaluation for emerging technologies. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We focus on how political ideology polarization in the board influences the resolution of social activism targeting the organization. Contrary to what we observe in the political realm and society at large, where political ideology polarization acts as a source of division, our theory suggests that political ideology polarization among directors will enhance the board’s information-processing capacity and increase its ability to respond to social activism. To provide additional evidence for our proposed mechanism, we examine the moderating effect of three variables central to the ability of boards to effectively process information: CEO-to-board relative power, organizational diversification, and the competitive intensity of the organization’s industry. Overall, we find support for our arguments; political ideology polarization in boards seems to improve information processing and strategic decisions, as reflected in resolving social activism. However, the positive effects of polarization are also subject to the influence of important contextual factors. Our study contributes to organizational research by considering the important influence of political ideology polarization in corporate leadership and its implications for understanding strategic leadership and governance dynamics, strategic decision making, stakeholder management, and other organizational outcomes. © 2022, Academy of Management.

A common theme in this research is that a fall in rank can lead to unfavorable evaluations by external audiences and negative organizational outcomes. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence suggests that rankings sometimes have little effect on audience assessments and organizational outcomes, which calls into question the power of rankings. To reconcile these contradictory views, this study theorizes the conditions under which falls in rank influence organizational outcomes. I hypothesize that a fall in rank affects organizational outcomes to the extent that the fall has information value, which depends on three factors: the availability of information from alternative sources, the sophistication of the audience, and whether the slip in rank led to a fall from a prominent ranking category (i.e., tier). Exploiting a change in the Fortune 500’s ranking methodology as a natural experiment, I examined how falls in rank affected firms’ stock prices and found evidence for these predictions. This paper develops an informational theory of declines in rank and illuminates their contingent effects on organizational outcomes, with implications for research on rankings, categories, and impression management. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In particular, they vary systematically in the extent to which the founder, or lead founder, decides to be a solo entrepreneur, undertaking the full scope of the founder role, or rather decides to share the role with cofounders. In this paper, we argue that a lead founder’s personal identity is a key antecedent to the choice of adopting a broad or rather narrow founder role, as the choice of founder role scope shares meanings with one’s more fundamental personal dispositions. In order to test this hypothesis, we have examined a sample of 170 high tech new ventures founded in Flanders between 2006 and 2011, and studied how lead founders’ aspects of their personal identities, here their ‘sociability’, ‘structuring’, and ‘explorative’ dispositions, affect the likelihood of (1) sharing the founder role, hence starting alone or with others, and conditional on sharing the role, (2) retaining a broad or narrow lead founder role (hence specializing into a narrow set of tasks). We find general support for our hypotheses, suggesting that personal identity affects the scope of the founder role chosen by the lead founder. Specifically, our theorizing suggests that personal identity infuses key initial choices that delineate the lead founder role and conditions how the founder role is conceived and performed. © 2022, Academy of Management.

A SCHEMA THEORY PERSPECTIVE ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTING PROCESSES OF INTERNS OVER TIME,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188052083&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.89&partnerID=40&md5=f6fa90a61ac62155729f9040216d77bd,"This study explores the evolving expectations of undergraduate interns from a psychological contract schema theory perspective over time. Psychological contracts have been conceptualised as a type of schema, which is a mental model or construct through which individuals filter and understand social life. Scholarly endeavours have focused heavily on the negative effects of mismanaged psychological contracts. Less insight is available on the process through which a psychological contract is constructed, formed, and becomes impactful over time. Researching this process is vital to understanding and managing the evolution of the employment relationship. Taking a process methodological approach, we interviewed 30 interns from an Irish university between three to five times each over a 12-15 month period. We also collected written reflective accounts once they returned to the final year of study. Our findings reveal the importance of antecedents, such as normative expectations and goals, and the anticipated psychological contract on the psychological contracting process. We provide an empirically informed process model of the psychological contracting process of undergraduate interns. Our model incorporates factors such as the antecedents influencing the construction of the psychological contract, the formation and development of employment schemata, affective events, the role of agency, and the influence of internships on learners who return to the final year of undergraduate studies. We contribute to scholarly work on schema theory, the psychological contract as a dynamic process, and undergraduate internships.

We propose and found that individuals perceived a decision-making process arranged in human-AI order as having less AI ability-power fit (i.e., the fit between the abilities of AI and the power it is granted) than when the process was arranged in AI-human order, which led to less procedural justice. Furthermore, perceived AI ability buffered the indirect effect of the order of decision makers (i.e., AI-human order vs. human-AI order) on procedural justice via AI ability-power fit. Together, our findings suggest that the position of AI in collaborations with humans has profound impacts on individuals’ justice perceptions regarding their decision making. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Extant research has theorized the significance of emotions for such events. Missing from the existing scholarship is a deeper understanding of the mechanism through which those emotions are triggered and effectively and strategically managed. Drawing on data from an ethnographic study of change implementation in the English National Health Service, this study advances theory on emotion and organizational change in two ways. First, it complements existing research by suggesting that change recipients’ emotional response towards change can be triggered by their distinctive personal, organizational, and professional aspects. Second, it argues that change agents’ emotion management practice, based on professional embeddedness and proactive engagement, manifested by framing and tailoring, has important implications for managing emotions towards change. In particular, by illustrating change agents’ emotion identification and emotion management strategies, this paper highlights the role of professions in change management. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Drawing from a novel Janusian-thinking lens, we integrate another growing research stream in entrepreneurship—multicultural experience—to probe how the creative, social, and practical cognitive schemas underpinning entrepreneurial imaginativeness can be cultivated through dimensions of perhaps the most distinctive form of cultural exposure: living abroad. We find evidence across two studies that depth and breadth of living abroad experiences relate to imaginativeness facets differentially, which in turn, can help us understand the extent to which entrepreneurs attempt to launch ventures. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Given the sparse research of the link between leadership and political CSR in the existing literature, we focus on the motivations of political CSR in family firms amid the leadership transition. From the institutional perspective, we project that nonfamily CEO successors who carry forward business logic tend to participate in political CSR to increase legitimacy; however, family CEO successors who inherit family logic are less likely to undertake political CSR. Based on the longitudinal data from China’s targeted poverty alleviation and listed family firms, we find a higher likelihood of nonfamily CEO successors involved in political CSR than family ones. We also find that firm-hold political capital weakens the relationship between family (vs. nonfamily) CEO successors and political CSR, while financial outperformance strengthens the relationship. The findings respond to the call for the further exploration of leadership factors and political CSR, and contributes to the family succession and political CSR literature. © 2022, Academy of Management.

TOWARDS MULTISPECIES INEQUALITY REGIMES THROUGH THE CASE OF HORSE SHOWJUMPING,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188046780&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.196&partnerID=40&md5=3141bf4e593a5ed400a1ad243a93f063,"The idea that a ‘single category’-focus in the study of workplace inequality leads to oversimplification and obscures its complex nature is now generally accepted. Yet little concerns have been raised with regard to the ‘single species’-focus of inequalities in the context of management and organizations. Through the case study of professional show jumpers, I shed light on the complex interplay of multispecies inequalities in the equestrian field, a sector celebrated for its sex integration. Indeed, beliefs of gender equality are typically high in this sector as horses are believed to ‘mediate’ the sex-performance relationship, levelling the playing field for male and female riders. An Ackerian analysis however reveals the persistence of gendered patterns despite women’s ‘theoretically’ improved chances of identifying with the ideal worker, following changed breeding preferences and an organizational logic of ‘passion-merit’. Rather, female showjumpers needed to provide proof and reassurance of being ‘unconventional’ indicating an incomplete acceptance of femininity in the field. Popular imageries of horses paradoxically reveal the lack of agency awarded to animals and the instrumental nature of the human-horse bond. This study adds to the literature on gender in organizations by integrating non-humans into a number of core feminist organizational concepts, looking at organizational logics through an interspecies lens. It thereby gives a post-humanistic flavor to earlier claims of how different forms of inequality overlap and interact with each other, producing often-surprising outcomes. Indeed, although sex-based discrimination was deemed unacceptable in the field, such reservations were reserved only to humans, not horses. Similarly, class privilege was only problematized when critiquing showpiece ‘daughters of’ Jobs, Springsteen and Gates but never for men. This study concludes that more-than-human analyses can enrich existing knowledge about inequality regimes in professional fields. Embracing post-humanist perspectives within the study of inequality regimes may thus open up new and challenging ethical, theoretical, methodological and practical issues. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Sharpen Your Sword: The Reaction Of Branded Pharmaceutical Firms To The Threat Of Generic Entry,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188047115&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.104&partnerID=40&md5=769cb3001558f19b37858cc58ce6045e,"Pharmaceutical firms produce patents related to existing drugs even after approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We investigate the reasons behind this strategy and relate them to generic entry threats. Estimating difference-in-differences models saturated with fixed effects, we show that the threat of generic entry via Paragraph IV challenges induces pharmaceutical firms to increase the number of produced patents they add to an FDA-approved drug application. This strategy is aimed at fencing the firms’ existing drugs as we find no evidence that firms generate new drugs or modifications to the existing drugs after a Paragraph IV challenge. Additionally, we provide evidence showing that the added patents help pharmaceutical firms to delay generic entry when there is litigation. Consistent with patents being a double-edged sword, which protects drugs but reveals information to competitors, we find that listing all patents at the filing of a drug application is not as effective against generic entry as adding them later on. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Drawing on three years of fieldwork at a Human Resources (HR) department that built an AI hiring tool, this study develops a new perspective for understanding the tensions that surface in the process of procuring data for AI tools. We show how these “data tensions” can be better understood by unpacking the divergent interests of data scientists and users that persist throughout the tool’s development, implementation, and ongoing use. Our analysis of the tensions focused on the emergent practices of boundary spanners who stepped up to negotiate divergent interests and paved the way for the tool to be developed and adopted by the organization. We found that these practices did not only shape the data used to feed the AI tool but also inadvertently transformed existing organizational practices beyond the goal and scope of implementing a particular AI solution. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for studies of AI in organizations. © 2022, Academy of Management.

HOW NEW CEOS USE STRATEGIC TOPIC SETTING TO MANAGE CAPITAL MAR- KET REACTIONS TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188055195&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.184&partnerID=40&md5=c2a306f083c4fc50f938737b57b20b65,"In this study, we examine new CEOs’ use of strategic topic setting as an impression management tactic in response to legitimation pressure from the capital market. We propose that the dismissal of the predecessor CEO represents a distinct opportunity for the new CEO to gain legitimacy by departing from the predecessor’s strategic agenda (i.e., strategic dissimilarity). Building on impression management literature, we argue that negative capital market reactions to CEO appointments can drive strategic topic setting in two opposing ways: (1) to strengthen the mandate, or (2) to deviate from the mandate. By drawing on a sample of U.S. companies listed in the S&P 1500 between 2003 and 2018, we use textual analysis in quarterly earnings conference calls transcripts to assess the use of strategic topic setting by new CEOs. We find that while new CEOs engage in mandate-oriented strategic topic setting, high pressure from negative capital market feedback can result in coping mechanisms that lead to non-role conforming CEO communication. Accordingly, our study makes important contributions to both the CEO succession literature and the impression management literature. © 2022, Academy of Management.

In this study, I explore how the involvement of AICTs in communication activities shapes how principals engage in impression management and how their communication partners form impressions of them. Through an inductive, comparative field study of users of two AI scheduling technologies, I uncover three communicative practices through which principals engaged in impression management when AICTs communicate on their behalf: interpretation, diplomacy, and staging politeness. I also uncover three processes through which communication partners formed impressions of principals when communicating with them via AICTs: confirmation, transference, and compartmentalization. I show that communication partners can transfer impressions of AICTs to principals themselves and outline the conditions under which such transference is and is not likely. I discuss the implications of these findings for the study of technological mediation of impression management in the age of artificial intelligence and present propositions to guide future empirical research. © 2022, Academy of Management.

However, there is limited research on how they use their unique positioning to navigate the political landscape. To examine how middle managers leverage different power relations in the organization’s hierarchy to gain greater power, we focus on Machiavellian middle managers due to their tendency to be power-focused, flexible, and responsive to situational demands. Drawing from the Machiavellianism literature and power dependence theory, we theorize and test how and when Machiavellian middle managers “kick down” and “kiss up” to effectively gain power from below and above. Specifically, we theorize that Machiavellian middle managers exhibit abusive supervision towards their subordinates to gain coercive power, while building close guanxi (i.e., interpersonal connection) with their senior manager to obtain relational empowerment. Moreover, we theorize that these parallel positive indirect effects are strengthened when Machiavellian middle managers perceive high threat to hierarchy. Results from a lab experiment and a three-wave, three-source, three-level field study largely provide support for our theoretical model. Overall, our study demonstrates how Machiavellian middle managers are capable of effectively using different forms of social exchange to harness middle power. © 2022, Academy of Management.

We take stock of the last decade of research on red tape and administrative burden using the meta-narrative review approach. We identify 5 narratives within the 2 research traditions, each guided by common research questions, theoretical mechanisms, privileged actors, and rule assumptions. We inspect these narratives and discuss their complementary strengths and weakness.

VALUE OF ESG IN THE TIME OF COVID-19 CRISIS: HOW CORPORATE ESG PROMOTES EMPLOYEE INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR,2022,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188052895&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2022.43&partnerID=40&md5=d5b86c48031e3a594ea425c47a83cbf1,"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has emerged as an important pillar in integrating corporate business and social responsibility. However, as existing studies have focused on external stakeholders or corporate-level performance, we have a very limited understanding of the impact of corporate ESG performance on organizational members, important internal stakeholders of companies. In addition, the role that corporate ESG can play in uncertain crisis situations such as COVID-19 remains largely unexamined. To fill the gaps, this study explores the effect of corporate ESG on employees in crisis situations. Specifically, based on corporate reputation and the conservation of resources theory (hereafter, COR), this study investigates whether corporate ESG evaluation can act as a positive reputation of a company during the COVID-19 crisis, lowering psychological stress of members and promoting their innovative behavior. Furthermore, this study examines whether team cohesiveness can act as a social resource for employees in a crisis and interact with corporate ESG to reduce their stress. Data were collected from 980 employees of 51 companies in Korea and analyzed through multilevel structural equation modeling. Results showed that employees with high corporate ESG evaluation experienced less psychological stress during the COVID-19 crisis, and as a result, they put more effort into workplace innovation. In addition, the effect of ESG evaluation on lowering employee stress was stronger for employees who perceived high levels of team cohesion. These results suggest that a company's pursuit of social values through ESG can increase employees' well-being and innovation efforts in crisis situations, ultimately increasing the company's likelihood of overcoming the challenges of a crisis. © 2022, Academy of Management.

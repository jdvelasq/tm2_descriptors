Internet censorship in China: Examining user awareness and attitudes,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954240017&doi=10.1145%2f2818997&partnerID=40&md5=c4b02d469b2aca90fe06d70a857785d7,"Internet censorship has been a popular topic both in academia and in the popular press. A fundamental question that has not been fully addressed is how censorship is perceived by people who experience it. A person may exhibit pro- or anti-censorship attitudes, but it is possible that (s)he may not even be aware of its existence. In this study, we report results of a large-scale survey on Chinese Internet users' experiences with Internet censorship. The results show that users' demographic backgrounds, Internet usage experience, and personality influence their attitudes toward censorship. Those who score high on authoritarian personality measures tend to support censorship. Attitudes toward censorship change so that over time it is viewed as more normal, which suggests a ""normalization"" process. We discuss how these findings can generalize beyond the Chinese context to other societies in which Internet censorship can exist. © 2015 ACM.",Authoritarian personality; Awareness and attitude; China; Internet censorship; Networked authoritarianism; Normalization,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Authoritarian personality; Awareness and attitude; China; Internet censorship; Networked authoritarianism; Normalization; Internet

"Self-care technologies in HCI: Trends, tensions, and opportunities",2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954118592&doi=10.1145%2f2803173&partnerID=40&md5=bdad4dbf997fb84367cfe76e45f317a8,"Many studies show that self-care technologies can support patients with chronic conditions and their carers in understanding the ill body and increasing control of their condition. However, many of these studies have largely privileged a medical perspective and thus overlooked how patients and carers integrate selfcare into their daily lives and mediate their conditions through technology. In this review, we focus on how patients and carers use and experience self-care technology through a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lens. We analyse studies of self-care published in key HCI journals and conferences using the Grounded Theory Literature Review (GTLR) method and identify research trends and design tensions. We then draw out opportunities for advancing HCI research in self-care, namely, focusing further on patients' everyday life experience, considering existing collaborations in self-care, and increasing the influence on medical research and practice around self-care technology.

Mapping user preference to privacy default settings,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954320973&doi=10.1145%2f2811257&partnerID=40&md5=f5bc12ef5038c561de1e6f6db644d2a8,"Managing the privacy of online information can be a complex task often involving the configuration of a variety of settings. For example, Facebook users determine which audiences have access to their profile information and posts, how friends can interact with them through tagging, and how others can search for them-and many more privacy tasks. In most cases, the default privacy settings are permissive and appear to be designed to promote information sharing rather than privacy. Managing privacy online can be complex and often users do not change defaults or use granular privacy settings. In this article, we investigate whether default privacy settings on social network sites could be more customized to the preferences of users. We survey users' privacy attitudes and sharing preferences for common SNS profile items. From these data, we explore using audience characterizations of profile items to quantify fit scores that indicate how well default privacy settings represent user privacy preferences. We then explore the fit of various schemes, including examining whether privacy attitude segmentation can be used to improve default settings. Our results suggest that using audience characterizations from community data to create default privacy settings can better match users' desired privacy settings.

Action-transferred navigation technique design approach supporting human spatial learning,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942762189&doi=10.1145%2f2811258&partnerID=40&md5=001c0b4264e04d6d02042790adee9d3b,"We propose a new action-transferred design approach by which the benefits of embodied cognition and activity can be realized to enhance spatial learning and usability for navigating virtual spaces. The action-transferred design approach is supported by theories of learning, action-perception, and neuropsychology. These theories help us understand how human action can be transferred to different body parts for improving the usability of interaction techniques and why the acquired spatial knowledge using the transferred action may remain the same independent of the used body parts. The finger-walking-in-place (FWIP) navigation technique is used as a design example to demonstrate the concept of the action-transferred design approach. Leveraging 3D immersive virtual reality technology, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique in terms of spatial knowledge acquisition. The FWIP navigation technique was compared with a full-body-based walking-like (sensor-fusion walking in-place; SF-WIP) navigation technique and a well-known, convenient (Joystick) navigation technique using a common input device, that is, a wand with a joystick. Both the action-transferred and the full-body-based navigation techniques were more effective for spatial learning than the navigation technique using the common input device. However, only the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique can provide users with the convenience of navigating with their fingers. These results suggest that the action-transferred design approach is useful in designing a navigation technique supporting users' spatial learning performance more effectively and conveniently. Possible design implications for broader applications are discussed and indicate that the action-transferred design approach is worth further study. © 2015 ACM.",Action-transfer; Cognitive learning; Gesture; Interaction technique; Motor equivalence; Navigation technique; Spatial learning; Virtual environment,Design; Knobs; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Navigation; Transfer learning; Virtual reality; Action-transfer; Cognitive learning; Gesture; Interaction techniques; Navigation techniques; Spatial learning; Air navigation
Visualizing sets with linear diagrams,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942775943&doi=10.1145%2f2810012&partnerID=40&md5=cd2abd812c0447e489771b82ec8a709a,"This paper presents the first design principles that optimize the visualization of sets using linear diagrams. These principles are justified through empirical studies that evaluate the impact of graphical features on task performance. Linear diagrams represent sets using straight line segments, with line overlaps corresponding to set intersections. This study builds on recent empirical research, which establishes that linear diagrams can be superior to prominent set visualization techniques, namely Euler and Venn diagrams. We address the problem of how to best visualize overlapping sets using linear diagrams. To solve the problem, we investigate which graphical features of linear diagrams significantly impact user task performance. To this end, we conducted seven crowdsourced empirical studies involving a total of 1,760 participants. These studies allowed us to identify the following design principles, which significantly aid task performance: use a minimal number of line segments, use guidelines where overlaps start and end, and draw lines that are thin as opposed to thick bars. We also evaluated the following graphical properties that did not significantly impact task performance: color, orientation, and set order. The results are brought to life through a freely available software implementation that automatically draws linear diagrams with user-controlled graphical choices. An important consequence of our research is that users are now able to create effective visualizations of sets automatically, thus improving human-computer interaction. © 2015 ACM.",Linear diagrams; Sets; Visualization,Flow visualization; Human computer interaction; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Freely available software; Graphical features; Linear diagrams; Sets; Straight-line segments; Visualization technique; Visualization
Deterring cheating in online environments,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942770987&doi=10.1145%2f2810239&partnerID=40&md5=bcd1df2a68e64892b503112bdb8a939c,"Many Internet services depend on the integrity of their users, even when these users have strong incentives to behave dishonestly. Drawing on experiments in two different online contexts, this study measures the prevalence of cheating and evaluates two different methods for deterring it. Our first experiment investigates cheating behavior in a pair of online exams spanning 632 students in India. Our second experiment examines dishonest behavior on Mechanical Turk through an online task with 2,378 total participants. Using direct measurements that are not dependent on self-reports, we detect significant rates of cheating in both environments. We confirm that honor codes-despite frequent use in massive open online courses (MOOCs)-lead to only a small and insignificant reduction in online cheating behaviors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new intervention: a stern warning that spells out the potential consequences of cheating. We show that the warning leads to a significant (about twofold) reduction in cheating, consistent across experiments. We also characterize the demographic correlates of cheating on Mechanical Turk. Our findings advance the understanding of cheating in online environments, and suggest that replacing traditional honor codes with warnings could be a simple and effective way to deter cheating in online courses and online labor marketplaces. © 2015 ACM.",Cheating; Crowdsourcing; Honey pot; Honor code; Massive open online course (MOOC); Mechanical Turk; Warning,Crowdsourcing; Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Cheating; Honeypots; Honor code; Massive open online course; Mechanical turks; Warning; E-learning
Reciprocal drag-and-drop,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942770695&doi=10.1145%2f2785670&partnerID=40&md5=61431d54bbde0d038bc0d6e2e09d489a,"Drag-and-drop has become ubiquitous, both on desktop computers and touch-sensitive surfaces. It is used to move and edit the geometry of elements in graphics editors, to adjust parameters using controllers such as sliders, or to manage views (e.g., moving and resizing windows, panning maps). Reverting changes made via a drag-and-drop usually entails performing the reciprocal drag-and-drop action. This can be costly as users have to remember the previous position of the object and put it back precisely. We introduce the DND-1 model that handles all past locations of graphical objects. We redesign the Dwell-and-Spring widget to interact with this history, and explain how applications can implement DND-1 to enable users to perform reciprocal drag-and-drop to any past location for both individual objects and groups of objects. We report on two user studies, whose results show that users understand DND-1, and that Dwell-and-Spring enables them to interact with this model effectively. © 2015 ACM.",Direct manipulation; Dwell-and-Spring; Undo model,Drops; Personal computers; Springs (components); Direct manipulation; Drag and drop; Graphical objects; Graphics editors; Individual objects; User study; Drag

Crucially, they constitute the means by which we include or exclude individuals and groups in terms of access to goods, services or information - yet few developments in this space embrace an inclusive or value sensitive design philosophy. We describe a rigorous exercise in which we source scenarios that capture new research in the identity space and use these as probes in an inclusive design process.Workshops were held with six marginalized community groups: young people, older adults, refugees, black minority ethnic (BME) women, people with disabilities, and mental health service users.

The ethical implications of HCI's turn to the cultural,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941560036&doi=10.1145%2f2775107&partnerID=40&md5=6afdfe936e083f50d8cc2c597367df71,"We explore the ethical implications of HCI's turn to the 'cultural'. This is motivated by an awareness of how cultural applications, in our case interactive performances, raise ethical issues that may challenge established research ethics processes. We review research ethics, HCI's engagement with ethics and the ethics of theatrical performance. Following an approach grounded in Responsible Research Innovation, we present the findings from a workshop in which artists, curators, commissioners, and researchers explored ethical challenges revealed by four case studies. We identify six ethical challenges for HCI's engagement with cultural applications: transgression, boundaries, consent, withdrawal, data, and integrity. We discuss two broader implications of these: managing tensions between multiple overlapping ethical frames; and the importance of managing ethical challenges during and after an experience as well as beforehand. Finally, we discuss how our findings extend previous discussions of Value Sensitive Design in HCI. © 2015 ACM.",Active Ingredient; Art; Blast Theory; Boundaries; Consent; Discomfort; Ethics; Integrity; Performance; Research in the wild; Thrill Laboratory; Transgression; Uncomfortable interactions; Urban Angel; Withdrawal,Ethical aspects; Human computer interaction; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Ubiquitous computing; Active ingredients; Consent; Discomfort; Integrity; Performance; Transgression; Urban Angel; Withdrawal; Philosophical aspects
Conceptual priming for in-game BCI training,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946035309&doi=10.1145%2f2808228&partnerID=40&md5=f4d94843b7acbf5661f2a9592d5bf4cb,"Using Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) as a control modality for games is popular. However BCIs require prior training before playing, which is hurtful to immersion and player experience in the game. For this reason, we propose an explicit integration of the training protocol in game by a modification of the game environment to enforce the synchronicity with the BCI system and to provide appropriate instructions to user. We then dissimulate the synchronicity in the game mechanics by using priming to mask the training instruction (implicit stimuli). We conduct an evaluation of the effects on game experience compared to standard BCI training on 36 subjects. We use the game experience questionnaire (GEQ) coupled with reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha). The integration does not change the feeling of competence (3/4). However, flow and immersion increase sizably with explicit training integration (2.78 and 2.67/4 from 1.79/4 and 1.52/4) and even more with the implicit training integration (3.27/4 and 3.12/4). © 2015 ACM 1073-0516/2015/10-ART26 $15.00.",Interactive machine learning,Computer games; Integration; Interfaces (computer); Learning systems; Reliability analysis; Cronbach's alphas; Explicit integration; Game environment; Game experience; Implicit training; Interactive machine learning; Interface system; Player experience; Standard brain; Brain computer interface

We then explore solutions to improve mid-air pointing efficiency: a tunable acceleration function and a framework for dual-precision (DP) techniques, both with precise tuning guidelines. We designed novel pointing techniques following these guidelines, several of which outperform existing techniques in controlled experiments that involve pointing difficulties never tested prior to this work.

We adapt Herzberg's methodology to analyze 303 events where users felt good or bad about their smartphone and derive factors that may work as hygienes or motivators. We identified technical quality and price as hygienes, and utility and convenience as motivators. These factors do not correspond to those mentioned as typical examples of hygienes and motivators in the UX literature (i.e., instrumental qualities such as usability for hygienes and non-instrumental qualities such as beauty for motivators).

To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education-such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice-and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

Based on this novel capability, JITL enables a complete infrastructure for collecting, storing, sharing, and delivering website translations, which invokes a number of exciting scenarios. Our studies show that JITL leads to significant savings in terms of user effort and, in consequence, money. With JITL, now it is possible to localize what is needed, when it is needed. © 2015 ACM.",D.2.2 [design tools and techniques]: user interfaces; Design; H.5.2 [user interfaces]: prototyping; H.5.3 [group and organization interfaces]: web-based interaction; Human factors; i18n; Internationalization; JIT; L10n; Languages; Localization; Translation,Application programs; Design; Human engineering; Just in time production; Query languages; Translation (languages); Websites; Design tools and techniques; H.5.2 [user interfaces]; i18n; Internationalization; L10n; Localization; Web based; User interfaces
Sustainable making?

Through our analysis, we make several contributions. First, we provide a general overview of the structure and common framings within research on makers. We discuss how these statements reconfigure themes of empowerment and progress that have been central to HCI rhetoric since the field's inception. In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID. © 2015 ACM.","Design; Discourse analysis; DIY; H.5m [information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)]: miscellaneous; Human factors; K.4.m [computers and society]: miscellaneous; Maker culture; Sustainability; Theory",Design; Human engineering; Personal computing; Sustainable development; Computers and societies; Discourse analysis; Information interfaces and presentations; Research problems; Sustainable interactions; Theory; Obsolescence
Adding human learning in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Towards a practical control modality,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930862542&doi=10.1145%2f2723162&partnerID=40&md5=ffc12cbabd8537e3ced255f1a9272450,"In this article, we introduce CLBCI (Co-Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces), a BCI architecture based on co-learning in which users can give explicit feedback to the system rather than just receiving feedback. CLBCI is based on minimum distance classification with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and allows for shorter training times compared to classical BCIs, as well as faster learning in users and a good performance progression. We further propose a new scheme for real-time two-dimensional visualization of classification outcomes using Wachspress coordinate interpolation. It allows us to represent classification outcomes for n classes in simple regular polygons. Our objective is to devise a BCI system that constitutes a practical interaction modality that can be deployed rapidly and used on a regular basis. We apply our system to an event-based control task in the form of a simple shooter game in which we evaluate the learning effect induced by our architecture compared to a classical approach. We also evaluate how much user feedback and our visualization method contribute to the performance of the system. © 2015 ACM.",Brain-Computer Interfaces; Co-learning; H.5.2 [user interfaces]: input devices and strategies; I.5.5 [implementation]: interface system; Interactive machine learning; Visualization; Wachspress coordinates,Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Flow visualization; Independent component analysis; Interfaces (computer); Learning systems; User interfaces; Visualization; Co-learning; Input devices and strategies; Interactive machine learning; Interface system; Wachspress coordinates; Brain computer interface

Drawing on ethnographic studies of two major advertising campaigns, we highlight key concerns for integrating sensors and sensor data into film production. Our findings address the perceived benefits of using biodata within narratives; the nature of different on-screen representations of biodata; and the challenges presented when integrating biodata into production processes. Drawing on this, we reconsider the nature of information visualization in the filmmaking context. Further implications from our case studies provide recommendations for human-computer interaction (HCI) collaborations with filmmaking and broadcast industries, focusing both on the practical matters of fitting sensor technologies into and handling data within production workflows, as well as discussing the broader implications for managing the veracity of that data within professional media production. © 2015 ACM.","Advertising; Biodata; Design; Film; H.5 [information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)]; Human factors; Information visualization; Narrative; Physiological sensing; Production; Television; Veracity",Data handling; Design; Films; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Information analysis; Information science; Information systems; Marketing; Motion pictures; Physiology; Production; Television; Visualization; Biodata; Information interfaces and presentations; Information visualization; Narrative; Physiological sensing; Veracity; Interfaces (materials)
Teaching recommender systems at large scale: Evaluation and lessons learned from a hybrid MOOC,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929224287&doi=10.1145%2f2728171&partnerID=40&md5=d7520ff7107b5f79e615f6fc8d61e4c8,"In the fall of 2013, we offered an open online Introduction to Recommender Systems through Coursera, while simultaneously offering a for-credit version of the course on-campus using the Coursera platform and a flipped classroom instruction model. As the goal of offering this course was to experiment with this type of instruction, we performed extensive evaluation including surveys of demographics, self-assessed skills, and learning intent; we also designed a knowledge-assessment tool specifically for the subject matter in this course, administering it before and after the course to measure learning, and again 5 months later to measure retention. We also tracked students through the course, including separating out students enrolled for credit from those enrolled only for the free, open course. Students had significant knowledge gains across all levels of prior knowledge and across all demographic categories. The main predictor of knowledge gain was effort expended in the course. Students also had significant knowledge retention after the course. Both of these results are limited to the sample of students who chose to complete our knowledge tests. Student completion of the course was hard to predict, with few factors contributing predictive power; the main predictor of completion was intent to complete. Students who chose a concepts-only track with hand exercises achieved the same level of knowledge of recommender systems concepts as those who chose a programming track and its added assignments, though the programming students gained additional programming knowledge. Based on the limited data we were able to gather, face-to-face students performed as well as the online-only students or better; they preferred this format to traditional lecture for reasons ranging from pure convenience to the desire to watch videos at a different pace (slower for English language learners; faster for some native English speakers).

How can automatic feedback help students construct automata?,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925292884&doi=10.1145%2f2723163&partnerID=40&md5=c9865bea3eec3f14942f8e7c6486cb7d,"In computer-aided education, the goal of automatic feedback is to provide a meaningful explanation of students' mistakes. We focus on providing feedback for constructing a deterministic finite automaton that accepts strings that match a described pattern. Natural choices for feedback are binary feedback (correct/wrong) and a counterexample of a string that is processed incorrectly. Such feedback is easy to compute but might not provide the student enough help. Our first contribution is a novel way to automatically compute alternative conceptual hints. Our second contribution is a rigorous evaluation of feedback with 377 students. We find that providing either counterexamples or hints is judged as helpful, increases student perseverance, and can improve problem completion time. However, both strategies have particular strengths and weaknesses. Since our feedback is completely automatic, it can be deployed at scale and integrated into existing massive open online courses. © 2015 ACM 1073-0516/2015/03-ART915.00.",A/B study; Autograding; Automata; Feedback,Automata theory; Computer aided instruction; Feedback; Robots; A/B study; Autograding; Automata; Automatic feedback; Computer-aided education; Deterministic finite automata; Massive open online course; Rigorous evaluation; Students

These are designed to generate media coverage and lend themselves nicely to collaborative or competitive goals, thus potentially leveraging social effects and community excitement to increase engagement and reach students who otherwise would not participate. In this article, we present a case study of three such campaigns that we ran to encourage students to play an algebra game-DragonBox Adaptive: the Washington, Norway, and Minnesota Algebra Challenges.

Motivation as a lens to understand online learners: Toward data-driven design with the OLEI scale,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925295725&doi=10.1145%2f2699735&partnerID=40&md5=f7654563c2cd264acfe27f488422dcc0,"Open online learning environments attract an audience with diverse motivations who interact with structured courses in several ways. To systematically describe the motivations of these learners, we developed the Online Learning Enrollment Intentions (OLEI) scale, a 13-item questionnaire derived from open-ended responses to capture learners' authentic perspectives. Although motivations varied across courses, we found that each motivation predicted key behavioral outcomes for learners (N = 71,475 across 14 courses). From learners' motivational and behavioral patterns, we infer a variety of needs that they seek to gratify by engaging with the courses, such as meeting new people and learning English. To meet these needs, we propose multiple design directions, including virtual social spaces outside any particular course, improved support for local groups of learners, and modularization to promote accessibility and organization of course content. Motivations thus provide a lens for understanding online learners and designing online courses to better support their needs. © 2015 ACM 1073-0516/2015/03-ART615.00.",Massive open online courses; MOOCs; Motivation; OLEI scale; Online course design; Online Learning Enrollment Intentions; Open online learning environments; Success metrics,Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Modular construction; Motivation; Massive open online course; MOOCs; OLEI scale; Online course; Online learning; Online learning environment; Success metrics; E-learning

We present OverCode, a system for visualizing and exploring thousands of programming solutions. OverCode uses both static and dynamic analysis to cluster similar solutions, and lets teachers further filter and cluster solutions based on different criteria.

We found that patterns in these calls (numbers, names, interrogative adverbs), as well as some contextual parameters, are better indicators of annotation needs than the callers' profile or call quality. Callers highlight information in both parties' turns (caller and callee) more often than highlighting solely information provided by the callee, which is mostly due to annotating questions with contextual information for the highlights in the callee's turns. We discuss how this behavior changes according to call purpose. Finally, we found that annotation needs change over time: whereas some annotations might not be considered relevant after weeks, others originally considered irrelevant might become important archival notes. We present implications of these findings for the design of mobile phone annotation tools. © 2015 ACM.",,Mobile phones; Telephone sets; Annotation tool; Behavior change; Call quality; Contextual information; Information shared; Mobile phone calls; Research questions; Cellular telephones
Technological and organizational adaptation of EMR implementation in an Emergency Department,2015,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923649746&doi=10.1145%2f2656213&partnerID=40&md5=587e01b1a491bd3c8aed4790d802abf5,"Implementation of large Health Information Technology (HIT) systems is critical to healthcare organizations and has seen heavy investment. However, research has not fully explored the adaptation of HIT systems, particularly the tensions between individual flexibility and organizational needs in the adaptation process. This study analyzes how Emergency Department (ED) clinicians adapted to a new hospital-wide Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. We present four adaptation cases revealing two interrelated types of adaptations-technical and organizational-as responses to the new system in use. First, individual clinicians respond to the immediate alteration in workflows caused by the EMR, while the organizational adaptations later mitigate the changes in healthcare quality control resulting from the clinicians' initial adaptation. Our analysis reflects the critical nature and value of both adaptation types, with an emphasis on the triggers and process of organizational adaptation, for the successful implementation of a socio-technicalpolitical system in a healthcare organization. © 2015 ACM.",Adaptation; Clinical practices; Design; Electronic Medical Record (EMR); Implementations; Workaround,Design; Emergency rooms; Health care; Medical computing; Adaptation; Clinical practices; Electronic medical record; Implementations; Workaround; Quality control

We describe and reflect on studies of long-distance couples, teenagers, and major life events, along with design research focused on new video communication systems - the Family Window, Family Portals, and Perch - that explicitly support ""always-on video"" for awareness and communication. Overall, our findings show that people highly value long-term video connections and have appropriated them in a number of different ways.

Discourse analysis of the content of 644 archival papers highlights how ageing is typically framed as a ""problem"" that can be managed by technology. We highlight how ageing is typically defined through an emphasis on the economic and societal impact of health and care needs of older people, concerns around socialisation as people age, and declines in abilities and associated reductions in performance when using technology. We draw from research within the fields of social and critical gerontology to highlight how these discourses in SIGCHI literature represent common stereotypes around old age that have also prevailed in the wider literature in gerontology. We conclude by proposing strategies for future research at the intersection of ageing and HCI. © 2015 ACM.",Ageing; Critical reflection; Discourse analysis; Older people; Social gerontology,Geriatrics; Human computer interaction; Ageing; Critical reflections; Discourse analysis; Older People; Social gerontology; Economic and social effects

Following this quantifiable decision making, users are allowed to refine several decision factors in order tomake decisions of high quality and with low difficulty levels. A case study of driving route selection is used to set up an experiment to test our hypotheses. In this study, GSR features exhibit the best performance in indexing decision quality.

We present pilot studies that inspect the ability of users to control spatial and temporal variations of 2D shapes and that use muscle sensing to assess expressive information in gesture execution beyond space and time. This leads us to the design of a study that explores the notion of gesture power in terms of control and sensing. Results give insights to interaction designers to go beyond simplistic gestural interaction, towards the design of interactions that draw on nuances of expressive gesture. © 2015 ACM.",Human factors,Design; Electromyography; Human engineering; Expressive gestures; Gestural interaction; Human bodies; Mechanomyography; Muscle activities; Pilot studies; Space and time; Spatial and temporal variation; Muscle

An assisted photography framework to help visually impaired users properly aim a camera,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84914093919&doi=10.1145%2f2651380&partnerID=40&md5=6eca828b818eec33cd09dff66e931820,"We propose an assisted photography framework to help visually impaired users properly aim a camera and evaluate our implementation in the context of documenting public transportation accessibility. Our framework integrates user interaction during the image capturing process to help users take better pictures in real time.We use an image composition model to evaluate picture quality and suggest providing audiovisual feedback to improve users'aiming position. With our particular framework implementation, blind participants were able to take pictures of similar quality to those taken by low vision participants without assistance. Likewise, our system helped low vision participants take pictures as good as those taken by fully sighted users. Our results also show a positive trend in favor of spoken directions to assist visually impaired users in comparison to tone and silent feedback. Positive usefulness ratings provided by full vision users further suggest that assisted photography has universal appeal. © 2014 ACM.",Accessibility; Photography; Transit; Universal design; Visually impaired,Cameras; Photography; Quality control; Accessibility; Image composition; Public transportation; Transit; Universal Design; Usefulness ratings; Visually impaired; Visually-impaired users; Image enhancement
Exploring and understanding unintended touch during direct pen interaction,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84914097978&doi=10.1145%2f2674915&partnerID=40&md5=b109533135b42d7ed607015d847bb7bf,"The user experience on tablets that support both touch and styli is less than ideal, due in large part to the problem of unintended touch or palm rejection. Devices are often unable to distinguish between intended touch (i.e., interaction on the screen intended for action) and unintended touch (i.e., incidental interaction from the palm, forearm, or fingers). This often results in stray ink strokes and accidental navigation, frustrating users. We present a data collection experiment where participants performed inking tasks, and where natural tablet and stylus behaviors were observed and analyzed from both digitizer and behavioral perspectives. An analysis and comparison of novel and existing unintended touch algorithms revealed that the use of stylus information can greatly reduce unintended touch.

Does distance still matter?

Reporting on a comparative analysis of four ethnographic studies of global software development, this article analyzes the fundamental aspects of distance as depicted in the famous paper ""Distance Matters."" The results suggest that, although while common ground, collaboration readiness, and organizational management are still important aspects for distributed collaboration, the arguments concerning coupling of work and collaboration technology readiness need to be refined. We argue that in working remotely, closely coupled work tasks encourage remote workers to spend the extra effort required in articulation of work to make the collaboration function. Also we find that people in distributed software development have already made collaborative technologies part of their work, and individuals are comfortable with them; thus, collaboration technology readiness takes a different shape in this setting. © 2014 ACM.",Closely coupled work; Collaboration readiness; Collaboration technology readiness; Common ground; Coupling of work,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Closely coupled work; Collaboration readiness; Collaboration technology; Collaborative technologies; Common ground; Distributed software development; Global software development; Organizational management; Software design
Designing interfaces for multiple-goal environments: Experimental insights from in-vehicle speech interfaces,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995633296&doi=10.1145%2f2544066&partnerID=40&md5=e1721c4c2c3a17c7d319956033453264,"Designing computer-human interfaces for multiple-goal environments is challenging because people pursue multiple goals with conflicting priorities. Safety-critical environments, such as driving, aggravate the need for a more nuanced understanding of interfaces that may reconcile conflicting tasks. Speech interfaces are prime examples of such interfaces. In this article, we investigate how design variations of an in-vehicle speech interface influence performance of a primary task (driving safely) and a secondary task (e-mailing). In a controlled experiment, we test the performance implications of using single computer-generated Text-To-Speech (TTS) voice and multiple matching TTS voices while users respond to e-mails with varying levels of complexity during driving. Our results indicate that the number of voices used has a significant effect on both driving performance and handling e-mail-related activities. We discuss potentially unintended consequences of making the interface too naturalistic and too engaging for the driver and conclude with theoretical and practical implications. © 2014 ACM.","Design; Distraction; Driving; Driving simulator; E-mailing; Experimentation; H.5.2 [information interfaces and presentation]: User interfaces - evaluation/methodology, voice I/O; Human factors; In-vehicle speech interfaces; Interface design; J.4 [computer applications]: Social and behavioral sciences - Psychology; Multiple voices; Task prioritization; Text complexity; Text-to-speech; User engagement",Automobile drivers; Design; Electronic mail; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Mail handling; Safety engineering; Speech; User interfaces; Vehicles; Distraction; Driving; Driving simulator; Experimentation; Interface designs; J.4 [computer applications]: social and behavioral sciences - psychologies; Prioritization; Speech interface; Text complexity; Text to speech; User engagement; Voice i/o; Behavioral research
Age differences in credibility judgments of online health information,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995549547&doi=10.1145%2f2534410&partnerID=40&md5=caeaa194289abfd1f77eee68081ac1d0,"Older adults are a notable group among the exponentially growing population of online health information consumers. In order to better support older adults' health-related information seeking on the Internet, it is important to understand how they judge the credibility of such information when compared to younger users. We conducted two laboratory studies to explore how the credibility cues in message contents, website features, and user-generated comments differentially impact younger (19 to 26 years of age) and older adults' (58 to 80 years of age) credibility judgments. Results from the first experiment showed that older adults were less sensitive to the credibility cues in message contents and those in website features than younger adults. Verbal protocol analysis revealed that these differences could be caused by the higher tendency of older adults to passively accept web information, and their lack of deliberation on its quality and attention towards contextual web features (e.g., design look, source identity). In the second experiment, we studied how credibility cues from user reviews might differentially impact older and younger adults' credibility judgments of online health information. Results showed that consistent credibility cues in user reviews and message contents could facilitate older adults' credibility judgments. When the two were inconsistent, older adults, as compared to younger ones, were less swayed by highly appraising user reviews given to low credibility information. These results provided important implications for designing health information technologies that better fit the older population. © 2014 ACM.",Aging; H.1.2 [information systems]: human factors; Health website; User review; Web credibility,Aging of materials; Websites; Health information technologies; Health related informations; Laboratory studies; Online health information; User reviews; Verbal protocol analysis; Web credibility; Website features; Health

Optimistic programming of touch interaction,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906857181&doi=10.1145%2f2631914&partnerID=40&md5=b3a072ed9ed77df7625a73ad2645bdde,"Touch-sensitive surfaces have become a predominant input medium for computing devices. In particular, multitouch capability of these devices has given rise to developing rich interaction vocabularies for ""real"" direct manipulation of user interfaces. However, the richness and flexibility of touch interaction often comes with significant complexity for programming these behaviors. Particularly, finger touches, though intuitive, are imprecise and lead to ambiguity. Touch input often involves coordinated movements of multiple fingers as opposed to the single pointer of a traditional WIMP interface. It is challenging in not only detecting the intended motion carried out by these fingers but also in determining the target objects being manipulated due to multiple focus points. Currently, developers often need to build touch behaviors by dealing with raw touch events that is effort consuming and error-prone. In this article, we present Touch, a tool that allows developers to easily specify their desired touch behaviors by demonstrating them live on a touch-sensitive device or selecting them from a list of common behaviors.Developers can then integrate these touch behaviors into their application as resources and via an API exposed by our runtime framework. The integrated tool support enables developers to think and program optimistically about how these touch interactions should behave, without worrying about underlying complexity and technical details in detecting target behaviors and invoking application logic. We discuss the design of several novel inference algorithms that underlie these tool supports and evaluate them against a multitouch dataset that we collected from end users. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our system via an example application. © 2014 ACM.",Dynamic bayesian networks; Multitouch interaction; Probabilistic inference; Rapid prototyping; Touch gestures; Uncertainty; User interface programming paradigms,Application programs; Bayesian networks; Consumer behavior; Human computer interaction; Inference engines; Rapid prototyping; User interfaces; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Multi-touch interactions; Probabilistic inference; Programming paradigms; Touch gestures; Uncertainty; Application programming interfaces (API)

To explain these findings, we present an inductive analysis of the data through a phenomenological lens to pinpoint what causes such behavior. Our analysis extends our understanding of how to design for social embodied interaction, pointing to how we need to embrace the tension between self-reflection and shared experience, making inward listening and social expression visible acts, accessible to social construction and understanding. It entails experiencing our embodied self as others experience us in order to build a dialogue. © 2014 ACM.",Experience; Interactional; Phenomenology,Ubiquitous computing; Bodily interactions; Embodied interaction; Experience; Interactional; Phenomenology; Reflective experience; Shared experiences; Social constructions; Human computer interaction

The CSI allows researchers to understand not just how well a tool supports creative work overall, but what aspects of creativity support may need attention.

Solutions to these problems used to involve human professionals, who are expensive to hire or difficult to find. Despite significant advances, fully automatic systems still have much room for improvement. Recent research has involved recruiting large crowds of skilled humans (""crowdsourcing""), but crowdsourcing solutions are still restricted by the availability of those skilled human participants.With translation, for example, professional translators incur a high cost and are not always available; machine translation systems have been greatly improved recently but still can only provide passable translation; and crowdsourced translation is limited by the availability of bilingual humans. This article describes crowdsourcedmonolingual translation, wheremonolingual translation is translation performed by monolingual people. Crowdsourced monolingual translation is a collaborative form of translation performed by two crowds of people who speak the source or the target language, respectively, with machine translation as the mediating device. This article describes a general protocol to handle crowdsourced monolingual translation and analyzes three systems that implemented the protocol.

Using metrics of curation to evaluate information-based ideation,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904465622&doi=10.1145%2f2591677&partnerID=40&md5=9f6bb14e49daafd5422822c8aa106d37,"Evaluating creativity support environments is challenging. Some approaches address people's experiences of creativity. The present method measures creativity, across conditions, in the products that people make. This research introduces information-based ideation (IBI), a paradigm for investigating open-ended tasks and activities in which users develop new ideas. IBI tasks span imagining, planning, and reflecting on a weekend, vacation, outfit, makeover, paper, internship, thesis, design, campaign, crisis response, career, or invention. What products do people create through engagement in IBI? Curation of digital media incorporates conceptualization, finding and choosing information objects, annotation, and synthesis. Through engagement in IBI tasks, people create curation products. This article formulates a quantitative methodology for evaluating IBI support tools, building on prior creative cognition research in engineering design to derive a battery of ideation metrics of curation. Elemental ideation metrics evaluate creativity within curated found objects. Holistic ideation metrics evaluate how a curation puts elements together. IBI support environments are characterized by their underlying medium of curation. Curation media include lists, such as listicles, and grids, such as the boards of Pinterest. An in-depth case study investigates information composition, an art-based medium representing a curation as a freeform visual semantic connected whole. We raise two creative cognition challenges for IBI. One challenge is overcoming fixation-for instance, when a person gets stuck in a counterproductive mental set. The other challenge is to bridge information visualization's synthesis gap, by providing support for connecting findings. To address the challenges, we develop mixed-initiative information composition (MI2C), integrating human curation of information composition with automated agents of information retrieval and visualization. We hypothesize that MI2C generates provocative stimuli that help users overcome fixation to become more creative on IBI tasks. We hypothesize that MI2C's integration of curation and visualization bridges the synthesis gap to help users become more creative. To investigate these hypotheses, we apply ideation metrics of curation to interpret results from experiments with 44 and 49 participants. © 2014 ACM.",Creative cognition; Creativity support tools; Digital curation; Exploratory search; Ideation; Information foraging; Information visualization; Interactive information; Sensemaking,Digital storage; Information analysis; Information systems; Semantics; Visualization; Creative cognition; Creativity support tools; Digital curation; Exploratory search; Ideation; Information foraging; Information visualization; Interactive informations; Sensemaking; Research

Despite a consensus that SNS enhance people's social capital, prior studies on SNS have provided inconsistent evidence on this process. In a multipronged study, we analyze personality, social capital, and Facebook data from a cohort of participants to model the extent to which one's SNS reflects aspects of his or personality and affects his bridging social capital. Our empirically validated model shows that empathy and conscientiousness influence the structural holes in one's social network, which in turn affects bridging social capital. These findings highlight the importance of network structure as an intermediary between one's personality and the social benefits one reaps from using SNS. Our work demonstrates how the implicit structural information embedded in users' social networks can provide key insights into users' personality and social capital. © 2014 ACM.",Conscientiousness; Empathy; Facebook; Network structure; Personality; Social capital; Structural holes,Economic and social effects; Conscientiousness; Empathy; Facebook; Network structures; Personality; Social capitals; Structural holes; Social networking (online)

The celebration is across generations, and everyone takes part. We note examples of new and evolving rituals.

This article presents two studies that investigated the effect of visual, auditory, and haptic sensory feedback modalities presented by a virtual button in a 3D environment on task performance (time on task and task errors) and user rating. Although we expected task performance to improve for conditions that combined two or three feedback modalities over a single modality, we instead found a significant emergent behavior that decreased performance in the trimodal condition. We found a significant increase in the number of presses when a user released the button before closing the virtual switch, suggesting that the combined visual, auditory, and haptic feedback led participants to prematurely believe they actuated a button. This suggests that in the design of virtual buttons, considering the effect of each feedback modality independently is not sufficient to predict performance, and unexpected effects may emerge when feedback modalities are combined.© 2014 ACM.",Evaluation; Haptic force feedback; Multimodal feedback; Performance; Virtual buttons,Sensory feedback; Three dimensional; Evaluation; Haptic force; Multimodal feedback; Performance; Virtual buttons; Fasteners

A large-scale study of daily information needs captured in situ,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898051651&doi=10.1145%2f2552193&partnerID=40&md5=f5cdc19bd239e05a8eb28a15f9048a57,"The goal of this work is to provide a fundamental understanding of the daily information needs of people through a large-scale, in-depth, quantitative investigation. To this end, we have conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of information needs to date, spanning a 3-month period and involving more than 100 users. The study employed a contextual experience sampling method, a snippet-based diary technique using SMS technology, and an online Web diary to gather in situ insights into the types of needs that occur from day to day, how those needs are addressed, and how contextual, technological, and demographic factors impact onthose needs. Our results not only complement earlier studies but also provide a new understanding of the intricacies of people's daily information needs. © 2014 ACM 1073-0516/2014/02-ART10 $15.00.",Context; Diary study; ESM; Experience sampling method; Information needs; Mobile computing; Mobile needs; SMS; User behavior,Information science; Mobile computing; Context; Diary study; ESM; Experience sampling method; Information needs; Mobile needs; SMS; User behaviors; Behavioral research
Up close and personal: Collaborative work on a high-resolution multitouch wall display,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898030272&doi=10.1145%2f2576099&partnerID=40&md5=c74e064e8c091d3d2041e569c2db2df5,"Multitouch wall-sized displays afford new forms of collaboration: They can be used up close by several users simultaneously, offer high resolution, and provide sufficient space for intertwining individual and joint work. The difference to displays without these capabilities is not well understood. To better understand the collaboration of groups around high-resolution multitouch wall displays, we conducted an exploratory study. Pairs collaborated on a problem-solving task using a 2.8m × 1.2m multitouch display with 24.8 megapixels. The study examines how participants collaborate; navigate relative to the display and to each other; and interact with and share the display. Participants physically navigated among different parts of the display, switched fluidly between parallel and joint work, and shared the display evenly. The results contrast earlier research that suggests difficulties in sharing and collaborating around wall displays. The study suggests that multitouch wall displays can support different collaboration styles and fluid transitions in group work. © 2014 ACM 1073-0516/2014/02-ART11 $15.00.",Colocated collaboration; Group work; Large high-resolution display; Multi-touch; Proxemics; Territoriality; User study; User tracking; Wall-display,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Co-located collaboration; Group work; High resolution display; Multi-touch; Proxemics; Territoriality; User study; User tracking; Wall-display; Navigation

To establish empirical foundations for building such a system, we designed and conducted two studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk to understand users' comprehension and preferences of composite visualization under different conditions (e.g., data and tasks). In Study 1, we collected more than 1,500 textual descriptions capturing about 500 participants' insights of given information graphics, which resulted in a task-oriented taxonomy of visual insights. In Study 2, we asked 240 participants to rank composite visualizations by their suitability for acquiring a given visual insight identified in Study 1, which resulted in ranked user preferences of visual compositions for acquiring each type of insight. In this article, we report the details of our two studies and discuss the broader implications of our crowdsourced research methodology and results to HCI-driven visualization research.© 2014 ACM.",Chart comprehension; Cognitive semantics; Crowdsourcing; User preference; Visual taxonomy; Visualization composition,Data visualization; Taxonomies; Chart comprehension; Cognitive semantics; Crowdsourcing; User preference; Visualization compositions; Visualization
E-government intermediaries and the challenges of access and trust,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898038864&doi=10.1145%2f2559985&partnerID=40&md5=19232c5ff80317ffd7412799c20b5baa,"In this article, we present the results of a study examining challenges related to access and trust for nutrition assistance outreach workers and suggest design implications for these challenges. Outreach workers are e-government intermediaries who assist clients with accessing and using e-government online applications, systems, and services. E-government intermediaries are not typical end users; they use e-government systems on behalf of clients, and as such their challenges differ from those of primary users. We detail social and technical aspects of these challenges to develop a nuanced understanding of access and trust in the ecosystems surrounding e-government systems. First, we describe how the practical accomplishment of access involves multiple stakeholders, actors, and practices. Second, we highlight how trust emerges through the e-government intermediaries' work to project themselves as professional and competent through their technical practice. Last, we propose design implications sensitive to both the social and technical aspects of these challenges. © 2014 ACM 1073-0516/2014/02-ART13 $15.00.",Access; E-government online application systems; Food stamps; Supplemental nutrition assistance program; Trust,Application programs; Design; Human computer interaction; Nutrition; Online systems; Access; Design implications; E-government systems; Multiple stakeholders; On-line applications; Supplemental nutrition assistance program; Technical aspects; Trust; Government data processing
On the benefits of providing versioning support for end users: An empirical study,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898042836&doi=10.1145%2f2560016&partnerID=40&md5=e0e186ab05855bdfa0f43410c44688a2,"End users with little formal programming background are creating software in many different forms, including spreadsheets, web macros, and web mashups. Web mashups are particularly popular because they are relatively easy to create, and because many programming environments that support their creation are available. These programming environments, however, provide no support for tracking versions or provenance of mashups. We believe that versioning support can help end users create, understand, and debug mashups. To investigate this belief, we have added versioning support to a popular wire-oriented mashup environment, Yahoo! Pipes. Our enhanced environment, which we call ""Pipes Plumber,"" automatically retains versions of pipes and provides an interface with which pipe programmers can browse histories of pipes and retrieve specific versions. We have conducted two studies of this environment: an exploratory study and a larger controlled experiment. Our results provide evidence that versioning helps pipe programmers create and debug mashups. Subsequent qualitative results provide further insights into the barriers faced by pipe programmers, the support for reuse provided by our approach, and the support for debugging provided. © 2014 ACM 1073-0516/2014/02-ART9 $15.00.",Debugging; End-user software engineering; Mashups; Programming barriers; Reuse; Versioning; Yahoo!

Disambiguation of imprecise input with one-dimensional rotational text entry,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896953551&doi=10.1145%2f2542544&partnerID=40&md5=560e2f0a64371baeb08e66f692cf85c6,"We introduce a distinction between disambiguation supporting continuous versus discrete ambiguous text entry. With continuous ambiguous text entry methods, letter selections are treated as ambiguous due to expected imprecision rather than due to discretized letter groupings. We investigate the simple case of a one-dimensional character layout to demonstrate the potential of techniques designed for imprecise entry. Our rotation-based sight-free technique, Rotext, maps device orientation to a layout optimized for disambiguation, motor efficiency, and learnability. We also present an audio feedback system for efficient selection of disambiguated word candidates and explore the role that time spent acknowledging word-level feedback plays in text entry performance. Through a user study, we show that despite missing on average by 2.46- 2.92 character positions, with the aid of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) disambiguation algorithm, users can average a sight-free entry speed of 12.6wpm with 98.9% accuracy within 13 sessions (4.3 hours). In a second study, expert users are found to reach 21wpm with 99.6% accuracy after session 20 (6.7 hours) and continue to grow in performance, with individual phrases entered at up to 37wpm. A final study revisits the learnability of the optimized layout. Our modeling of ultimate performance indicates maximum overall sight-free entry speeds of 29.0wpm with audio feedback, or 40.7wpm if an expert user could operate without relying on audio feedback.© 2014 ACM.",Accelerometer; Alphabet design; Ambiguous text layout; Disambiguation; Gyroscope; HCI; Mobile; Sight free; Text entry,Accelerometers; Gyroscopes; Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Ambiguous text layout; Disambiguation; Mobile; Sight free; Text entry; Optimization
Peer and self assessment in massive online classes,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892872810&doi=10.1145%2f2505057&partnerID=40&md5=bbcd7d65eb2684bd49afcb1a52165648,"Peer and self-assessment offer an opportunity to scale both assessment and learning to global classrooms. This article reports our experiences with two iterations of the first large online class to use peer and selfassessment. In this class, peer grades correlated highly with staff-assigned grades. The second iteration had 42.9% of students' grades within 5% of the staff grade, and 65.5% within 10%. On average, students assessed their work 7% higher than staff did. Students also rated peers' work from their own country 3.6% higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance. After revising rubrics, median grading error decreased from 12.4% to 9.9%. © 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/12-ART33.",Design assessment; Design crit; Massive online classroom; MOOC; Online education; Peer assessment; Qualitative feedback; Self-assessment; Studio-based learning,Distance education; Students; Design assessments; MOOC; On-line education; Online classroom; Peer assessment; Qualitative feedback; Self-assessment; Studio-based learning; Grading

Age differences in credibility judgments of online health information,2014,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896955471&doi=10.1145%2f2568193&partnerID=40&md5=3cf78d6e38c355e231b10c122db0476f,"Older adults are a notable group among the exponentially growing population of online health information consumers. In order to better support older adults' health-related information seeking on the Internet, it is important to understand how they judge the credibility of such information when compared to younger users. We conducted two laboratory studies to explore how the credibility cues in message contents, website features, and user-generated comments differentially impact younger (19 to 26 years of age) and older adults' (58 to 80 years of age) credibility judgments. Results from the first experiment showed that older adults were less sensitive to the credibility cues in message contents and those in website features than younger adults. Verbal protocol analysis revealed that these differences could be caused by the higher tendency of older adults to passively accept web information, and their lack of deliberation on its quality and attention towards contextual web features (e.g., design look, source identity). In the second experiment, we studied how credibility cues from user reviews might differentially impact older and younger adults' credibility judgments of online health information. Results showed that consistent credibility cues in user reviews and message contents could facilitate older adults' credibility judgments. When the two were inconsistent, older adults, as compared to younger ones, were less swayed by highly appraising user reviews given to low credibility information. These results provided important implications for designing health information technologies that better fit the older population.© 2014 ACM.",Health website; User review,Experiments; Information technology; Health information technologies; Information seeking; Laboratory studies; Older population; Online health information; User reviews; Verbal protocol analysis; Website features; Internet protocols
A surrogate competition approach to enhancing game-based learning,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892840117&doi=10.1145%2f2524264&partnerID=40&md5=1167d6b34eec23f2e511b94ab8b8698a,"Competition is useful in game-based learning, although it can also generate negative influences. To expand the potential for competition models in game-based learning, this study proposes the notion of surrogate competition, which eliminates direct competition between students. Such surrogates could be employed as buffers so that the competition between students is more relaxed. To explore the possible benefits of a surrogate approach to competition, the My-Pet-My-Arena system has been developed and evaluated. Two empirical studies were conducted to examine the effects of the surrogate competition. The results revealed that surrogate competition enhanced students' learning achievement as well as increased their motivation. Furthermore, the surrogate competition might also assist students in attributing competitive failures to a lack of effort.Working from the results obtained in these two studies, a general model of surrogate competition is proposed to help designers implement forms of surrogate competition in other systems for game-based learning. © 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/12-ART35.",Attribution; Competition; Game-based learning; Learning achievement; Motivation; Surrogate,Competition; Motivation; Attribution; Competition model; Empirical studies; Game-based Learning; General model; Learning achievement; Surrogate; Surrogate approach; Students

With the increasing number of crowdfunded projects, it is important to understand what drives people to either create or fund these projects. To shed light on this new social phenomenon, we present a grounded theory of motivation informed by the first cross-platform qualitative study of the crowdfunding community. By performing 83 semistructured interviews, we uncover creator motivations, which include the desire to raise funds, expand awareness of work, connect with others, gain approval, maintain control, and learn; and supporter motivations, which include the desire to collect rewards, help others, support causes, and be part of a community.We also explore deterrents to crowdfunding participation, including, among creators, fear of failure, and, for supporters, lack of trust. Based on these findings, we provide three emergent design principles to inform the design of effective crowdfunding platforms and support tools. © 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/12-ART34.",Creative work; Innovation; Psychology,Human computer interaction; Innovation; Ubiquitous computing; Creative work; Cross-platform; Emergent design; Grounded theory; Psychology; Qualitative study; Semi structured interviews; Support tool; Motivation
Complex activity recognition using context-driven activity theory and activity signatures,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892882036&doi=10.1145%2f2490832&partnerID=40&md5=e530c1e5ac1b76088d7525f6f5857427,"In pervasive and ubiquitous computing systems, human activity recognition has immense potential in a large number of application domains. Current activity recognition techniques (i) do not handle variations in sequence, concurrency and interleaving of complex activities; (ii) do not incorporate context; and (iii) require large amounts of training data. There is a lack of a unifying theoretical framework which exploits both domain knowledge and data-driven observations to infer complex activities. In this article, we propose, develop and validate a novel Context-Driven Activity Theory (CDAT) for recognizing complex activities. We develop a mechanism using probabilistic and Markov chain analysis to discover complex activity signatures and generate complex activity definitions. We also develop a Complex Activity Recognition (CAR) algorithm. It achieves an overall accuracy of 95.73% using extensive experimentation with real-life test data. CDAT utilizes context and links complex activities to situations, which reduces inference time by 32.5% and also reduces training data by 66%. © 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/12-ART32.",Activity recognition; Complex activity; Concurrent activities; Context-awareness; Context-driven activity theory; Evaluation; Experimentation; Interleaved activities; Prototype; Test bed,Activity coefficients; Equipment testing; Experiments; Gesture recognition; Intelligent buildings; Markov processes; Activity recognition; Activity Theory; Complex activity; Concurrent activities; Context-awareness; Evaluation; Experimentation; Interleaved activities; Prototype; Pattern recognition

To automatically provide plans, we introduce the Genies workflow that combines benefits of crowd wisdom, collaborative refinement, and automation. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach through the TaskGenies system, and introduce an NLP similarity algorithm for reusing plans.

We present an analysis of relevant research to clarify the meaning of the five-user assumption and to examine the way in which the original research that suggested it has been applied. This includes its blind adoption and application in some studies, and complaints about its inadequacies in others. We argue that the five-user assumption is often misunderstood, not only in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, but also in fields such as medical device design, or in business and information applications. The analysis that we present allows us to define a systematic approach for monitoring the sample discovery likelihood, in formative and summative evaluations, and for gathering information in order to make critical decisions during the interaction testing, while respecting the aim of the evaluation and allotted budget.

A sustainable design fiction: Green practices,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884999224&doi=10.1145%2f2494265&partnerID=40&md5=56fcaa3a8d941b78031ab9add98e2a2e,"In this article, we argue that an approach informed by practice theory coupled with design fiction provides useful insights into the role of interaction design with respect to environmental sustainability. We argue that a practice-oriented approach can help interaction designers step away from models of individual behavior and studies of artifacts towards seeing sustainable behaviors as part of multidimensional and interrelated practices and practice elements. We analyze two previously conducted studies. The first study of everyday repair focuses on how people repair their broken objects. The second study of green-DIY examines how green enthusiasts facilitate their practices of making sustainable DIY (do-it-yourself ) projects. We describe the practices of everyday repairers and green enthusiasts in terms of materials, competences, and meanings, and the interrelations among those elements, using the framework of Shove et al. [2012]. We argue that understanding the dynamics of practice and their unique configurations is a starting point to redefine the roles of sustainable interaction design (SID). We propose that designers design towards resources and tools in ways that reflect on the challenges of intelligibility of their design interventions in practices. In addition to considering SID in the light of practice theories, we reveal how design fictions are readily incorporated into green practices in ways that transform those practices and hold implications for transformations of design as well. We bring forward opportunities for designers to co-design with DIY enthusiasts, targeted as practitioners in their own right, designing toward or within a design fiction. As a result, we conclude with the possibility for sustainable interaction designers to become practice-oriented designers who design with transparent open strategies and accessible materials and competences. © 2013 ACM.",Design; Design fiction; DIY; Everyday practice; Repair; Social practice; Sustainability,Repair; Sustainable development; Design fictions; DIY; Environmental sustainability; Everyday practice; Individual behavior; Interaction design; Social practices; Sustainable interactions; Design
Walking and the social life of solar charging in rural Africa,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885006628&doi=10.1145%2f2493524&partnerID=40&md5=0f8c5fd6fe9d81a1e58661814676fcf5,"We consider practices that sustain social and physical environments beyond those dominating sustainable HCI discourse. We describe links between walking, sociality, and using resources in a case study of community-based, solar, cellphone charging in villages in South Africa's Eastern Cape. Like 360 million rural Africans, inhabitants of these villages are poor and, like 25% and 92% of the world, respectively, do not have domestic electricity or own motor vehicles. We describe nine practices in using the charging stations we deployed. We recorded 700 people using the stations, over a year, some regularly. We suggest that the way we frame practices limits insights about them, and consider various routines in using and sharing local resources to discover relations that might also feature in charging. Specifically, walking interconnects routines in using, storing, sharing and sustaining resources, and contributes to knowing, feeling, wanting and avoiding as well as to different aspects of sociality, social order and perspectives on sustainability. Along the way, bodies acquire literacies that make certain relationalities legible.

Research in many fields argues that contemporary global industrial civilization will not persist indefinitely in its current form, and may, like many past human societies, eventually collapse. Arguments in environmental studies, anthropology, and other fields indicate that this transformation could begin within the next half-century. While imminent collapse is far from certain, it is prudent to consider now how to develop sociotechnical systems for use in these scenarios. We introduce the notion of collapse informatics-the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity. We sketch the design space of collapse informatics and a variety of example projects. We ask how notions of practice-theorized as collective activity in the ""here and now""-can shift to the future since collapse has yet to occur. © 2013 ACM.",Collapse; Mitigation; Practice theory; Sustainability; Sustainable HCI,Design; Industrial research; Information science; Collapse; Design spaces; Environmental studies; Human society; Mitigation; Practice theories; Sociotechnical systems; Sustainable HCI; Sustainable development

Focusing on socially shared practices-e.g. cooking, laundering-has been identified as a promising direction. Building on a growing body of research in sustainable HCI that takes practices as unit of analysis, this article explores what it means to take practices as a unit of design. Drawing on theories of practice, it proposes that practice-oriented design approaches should: involve bodily performance, create crises of routine and generate a variety of performances. These guidelines were integrated into a Generative Improve Performances (GIP) approach, entailing a series of performances by improvisation actors with lowfidelity prototypes in a lab environment. The approach was implemented in an empirical study on bathing. Although the empirical example does not deal with common types of interactive technologies, the guidelines and GIP approach offer sustainable HCI a way to think beyond immediate interactions and to conceptualize change on a practice level. © 2013 ACM.",Bathing; Design; HCI; Improvisation actors; Performances; Practice theory; Research through design; Sustainability,Design; Human computer interaction; Bathing; Design approaches; Empirical studies; Improve performance; Improvisation actors; Interactive technology; Performances; Practice theories; Sustainable development

Given the environmental impact of food waste, there is potential to make a significant difference. To understand everyday domestic practices around food and waste, we took a ""practice"" lens and carried out a study in 14 households that involved interviews, in-home tours and, in five of the households, a FridgeCam technology probe. The analysis highlights that food waste is the unintended result of multiple moments of consumption dispersed in space and time across other integrated practices such as shopping and cooking, which are themselves embedded in broader contextual factors and values. We highlight the importance of respecting the complex negotiations that people make within given structural conditions and competing values and practices, and suggest design strategies to support dispersed as well as integrated food practices, rather than focusing on waste itself.© 2013 ACM.",Design; Everyday practice; Food and waste; Sustainability,Design; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Complex negotiation; Contextual factors; Design strategies; Ecological sustainability; Everyday practice; Integrated practice; Significant differences; Structural condition; Thermal processing (foods)

An important part of this research focuses on motivating energy savings by providing feedback tools which present consumption metrics interactively. In this line of work, the configuration of feedback has been mainly discussed using cognitive or behavioral factors. This narrow focus, however, misses a highly relevant perspective for the design of technology that supports sustainable lifestyles: to investigate the multiplicity of forms in which individuals or collectives actually consume energy. In this article, we broaden this focus, by taking a phenomenological lens to study how people use off-theshelf eco-feedback systems in private households to make energy consumption accountable and explainable. By reconstructing accounting practices, we delineate several constitutive elements of the phenomenon of energy usage in daily life. We complement these elements with a description of the sophisticated methods used by people to organize their energy practices and to give a meaning to their energy consumption. We describe these elements and methods, providing examples coming from the fieldwork and uncovering observed strategies to account for consumption. Based on our results, we provide a critical perspective on existing eco-feedback mechanisms and describe several elements for a design rationale for designing support for responsible energy consumption.We argue that interactive feedback systems should not simply be an end, but rather a resource for the construction of the artful practice of making energy consumption accountable.© 2013 ACM.",Energy; Phenomenology; Sustainability,Design; Global warming; Sustainable development; Accounting practices; Behavioral factors; Critical perspectives; Design rationale; Energy; Interactive feedback; Phenomenology; Private households; Energy utilization

We empirically validate the model with data gathered from 603 customers of a telecommunication operator, and find that: (1) extroversion, conscientiousness, and intellect have a significant impact on customer satisfaction-positively for the first two traits and negatively for the latter; (2) extroversion positively influences mobile phone usage; and (3) extroversion and conscientiousness positively influence the users' perceived usability of mobile services. Interestingly, usability has the strongest positive impact on satisfaction, whereas mobile phone usage has a negative impact on satisfaction.We discuss key findings of this model and propose several implications for the design of mobile phone services.© 2013 ACM.",Big five; Structural equation modeling; Usability,Customer satisfaction; Mobile phones; Big five; Indirect effects; Mobile phone services; Mobile phone usages; Perceived usability; Structural equation modeling; Telecommunication operators; Usability; Cellular telephones

There is a need to understand the key assumptions implicit within it and how these frame approaches to design and engineering in particular ways.

By taking everyday practices as the principal units of analysis, they move towards acknowledging the socially and materially structured nature of human activity. However, to inform sustainable HCI we also need to understand how practices are part of wider experiential environments and flows of practical activity. In this article, we develop an approach rooted in phenomenological anthropology and sensory ethnography.

P-LAYERS - A layered framework addressing the multifaceted issues facing community-supporting public display deployments,2013,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880827764&doi=10.1145%2f2491500.2491505&partnerID=40&md5=9b502893605af8c9dde1d50de13877b7,"The proliferation of digital signage systems has prompted a wealth of research that attempts to use public displays for more than just advertisement or transport schedules, such as their use for supporting communities. However, deploying and maintaining display systems ""in the wild"" that can support communities is challenging. Based on the authors' experiences in designing and fielding a diverse range of community-supporting public display deployments, we identify a large set of challenges and issues that researchers working in this area are likely to encounter. Grouping them into five distinct layers - (1) hardware, (2) system architecture, (3) content, (4) system interaction, and (5) community interaction design - we draw up the P-LAYERS framework to enable a more systematic appreciation of the diverse range of issues associated with the development, the deployment, and the maintenance of such systems. Using three of our own deployments as illustrative examples, we will describe both our experiences within each individual layer, as well as point out interactions between the layers. We believe our framework provides a valuable aid for researchers looking to work in this space, alerting them to the issues they are likely to encounter during their deployments, and help them plan accordingly. © 2013 ACM.",Community interaction; Community needs; Pervasive displays; Public displays,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Community interaction; Community needs; Digital signage systems; Interaction design; Pervasive Displays; Public display; System architectures; System interactions; Display devices
Two-part models capture the impact of gain on pointing performance,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872403325&doi=10.1145%2f2395131.2395135&partnerID=40&md5=c132577f467ab7373fca04fa8f7cbdd2,"We establish that two-part models of pointing performance (Welford's model) describe pointing on a computer display significantly better than traditional one-part models (Fitts's Law). We explore the space of pointing models and describe how independent contributions of movement amplitude and target width to pointing time can be captured in a parameter k. Through a reanalysis of data from related work we demonstrate that one-part formulations are fragile in describing pointing performance, and that this fragility is present for various devices and techniques. We show that this same data can be significantly better described using two-part models. Finally, we demonstrate through further analysis of previous work and new experimental data that k increases linearly with gain. Our primary contribution is the demonstration that Fitts's Law is more limited in applicability than previously appreciated, and that more robust models, such as Welford's formulation, should be adopted in many cases of practical interest. © 2012 ACM.",Fitts; Gain; Interaction techniques; Large displays; Pointing; Welford,Wire pointing; Fitts; Gain; Interaction techniques; Large displays; Welford; Human computer interaction
What does touch tell us about emotions in touchscreen-based gameplay,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872407780&doi=10.1145%2f2395131.2395138&partnerID=40&md5=9dc5629e5d6409706c67bbe6eae20d60,"The increasing number of people playing games on touch-screen mobile phones raises the question of whether touch behaviors reflect players' emotional states. This prospect would not only be a valuable evaluation indicator for game designers, but also for real-time personalization of the game experience. Psychology studies on acted touch behavior show the existence of discriminative affective profiles. In this article, finger-stroke features during gameplay on an iPod were extracted and their discriminative power analyzed. Machine learning algorithms were used to build systems for automatically discriminating between four emotional states (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored), two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. Accuracy reached between 69% and 77% for the four emotional states, and higher results (~89%) were obtained for discriminating between two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. We conclude by discussing the factors relevant to the generalization of the results to applications other than games. © 2012 ACM.",Affective touch; Automatic emotion recognition; Touch behavior; Touch-based computer games,Interactive computer graphics; Learning algorithms; Affective touch; Computer game; Emotion recognition; Emotional state; Evaluation indicators; Game designers; Game experience; Gameplay; Number of peoples; Personalizations; Touch behavior; Touch screens

Because of its design orientation, human-computer interaction (HCI) education is an excellent venue for studio-based instruction. In an HCI course, we have been exploring a studio-based learning activity called the prototype walkthrough, in which a student project team simulates its evolving user interface prototype while a student audience member acts as a test user. The audience is encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback. We have observed that prototype walkthroughs create excellent conditions for learning about user interface design. In order to better understand the educational value of the activity, we performed a content analysis of a video corpus of 16 prototype walkthroughs held in two HCI courses. We found that the prototype walkthrough discussions were dominated by relevant design issues. Moreover, mirroring the justification behavior of the expert instructor, students justified over 80 percent of their design statements and critiques, with nearly one-quarter of those justifications having a theoretical or empirical basis. Our findings suggest that PWs provide valuable opportunities for students to actively learn HCI design by participating in authentic practice, and provide insight into how such opportunities can be best promoted. © 2012 ACM.",Design crit; HCI; Prototype walkthrough; Studio-based learning and instruction; User interface design; Video analysis,Design; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Studios; Teaching; User interfaces; Content analysis; Design issues; Empirical studies; Fine arts; HCI design; Learning Activity; Pedagogical model; Student project; Studio-based learning and instruction; User interface designs; User interface prototypes; Video analysis; Walkthroughs; Students
Physical activity motivating games: Be active and get your own reward,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872411000&doi=10.1145%2f2395131.2395139&partnerID=40&md5=42e44e7014de654b87acb4092d4e41cb,"People's daily lives have become increasingly sedentary, with extended periods of time being spent in front of a host of electronic screens for learning, work, and entertainment. We present research into the use of an adaptive persuasive technology, which introduces bursts of physical activity into a traditionally sedentary activity: computer game playing. Our game design approach leverages the playfulness and addictive nature of computer games to motivate players to engage in mild physical activity. The design allows players to gain virtual in-game rewards in return for performing real physical activity captured by sensory devices. This article presents a two-stage analysis of the activity-motivating game design approach applied to a prototype game. Initially, we detail the overall acceptance of active games discovered when trialing the technology with 135 young players. Results showed that players performed more activity without negatively affecting their perceived enjoyment of the playing experience. The analysis did discover, however, a lack of balance between the amounts of physical activity carried out by players with various gaming skills, which prompted a subsequent investigation into adaptive techniques for balancing the amount of physical activity performed by players. An evaluation of additional 90 players showed that adaptive techniques successfully overcame the gaming skills dependence and achieved more balanced activity levels. Overall, this work positions activity-motivating games as an approach that can potentially change the way players interact with computer games and lead to healthier lifestyles. © 2012 ACM.",Adaptivity in games; Game design approach; Motivation; Physical activity; Player modeling; Serious games; User study,Computer software; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Technology; Adaptivity; Game design; Physical activity; Player modeling; Serious games; User study; Motivation

Information and communication technologies have a great potential to promote a greater awareness and appreciation of cultural heritage. This article presents some findings on how mobile technology can be used to foster a better understanding of an archaeological site by reconstructing the ancient environment and life. Children aged 11-13 years old are the target of our research. To motivate and engage them, a pervasive educational game has been developed and implemented in Explore!, a system aimed at supporting children exploring sites of cultural interest. Special attention has been devoted to the design of a soundscape that may improve players' navigation in degraded physical environments and enrich their overall experience. A field study indicated that children judged their experience both useful and entertaining: not only did they enjoy playing the game, but they also learned historical notions and facts related to ancient Roman life. Contextual sounds were found to have a facilitating effect on space navigation, reducing the need for map reading and improving spatial orientation. This work provides insights into the design of educational games for use with cultural heritage and a model to enrich historical sites through the creation of soundscapes which can help visitors to navigate a site and feel its historical atmosphere. © 2012 ACM.",Cultural heritage; Digital augmentation; Educational game; Field study; User experience,Architecture; Information technology; Maps; Telecommunication equipment; Cultural heritages; Digital augmentation; Educational game; Field studies; User experience; Learning systems

"The impact of interface affordances on human ideation, problem solving, and inferential reasoning",2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869451858&doi=10.1145%2f2362364.2362370&partnerID=40&md5=952091066d71ffb85da2daa99caaf638,"This article presents two studies investigating how computer interface affordances influence basic cognition, including ideational fluency, problem solving, and inferential reasoning. In one study comparing interfaces with different input capabilities, students expressed 56% more nonlinguistic representations (diagrams, symbols, numbers) when using pen interfaces. A linear regression confirmed that nonlinguistic communication directly mediated a substantial increase (38.5%) in students' ability to produce appropriate science ideas. In contrast, students expressed 41% more linguistic content when using a keyboard-based interface, which mediated a drop in science ideation. A follow-up study pursued the question of how interfaces that prime nonlinguistic communication so effectively facilitate cognition. This study examined the relation between students' expression of nonlinguistic representations and their inference accuracy when using analogous digital and non-digital pen tools. Perhaps surprisingly, the digital pen interface stimulated construction of more diagrams, more correct Venn diagrams, and more accurate domain inferences. Students' construction of multiple diagrams to represent a problem also directly suppressed overgeneralization errors, which were the most common inference failure. These research results reveal that computer interfaces have communications affordances which elicit communication patterns that can substantially stimulate or impede basic cognition. Implications are discussed for designing new digital tools for thinking, with an emphasis on nonlinguistic and especially spatial representations that are most poorly supported by current keyboard-based interfaces. © 2012 ACM.",Affordances; Diagrams; Educational interfaces; Ideational fluency; Inferential reasoning; Nonlinguistic representations; Pen interfaces; Problem solving; Thinking tools,Cognitive systems; Communication; Digital devices; Graphic methods; Students; User interfaces; Affordances; Diagrams; Ideational fluency; Inferential reasoning; Nonlinguistic representations; Pen interfaces; Problem solving

A betweensubjects experiment compared the tabletop interface and a desktop multimedia interface with mixed pairs (male Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian-Arab youth).

While prior work in HCI and visualization has proposed a variety of ways of presenting keyphrases, less attention has been paid to selecting the best descriptive terms. In this article, we investigate the statistical and linguistic properties of keyphrases chosen by human judges and determine which features are most predictive of high-quality descriptive phrases. Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges. Crowdsourced ratings of tag cloud visualizations rank our approach above other automatic techniques.

Promising means of providing basic communication abilities to subjects affected by severe motor impairments include brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), that is, systems that directly translate brain signals into device commands, bypassing any muscle or nerve mediation. To date, the use of BCIs for effective verbal communication is yet an open issue, primarily due to the low rates of information transfer that can be achieved with this technology. Still, performance of BCI spelling applications could be considerably improved by a smart user interface design and by the adoption of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text prediction. The objective of this work is to suggest an approach and a user interface for BCI spelling applications combining state-of-the-art BCI and NLP techniques to maximize the overall communication rate of the system. The BCI paradigm adopted is motor imagery, that is, when the subject imagines moving a certain part of the body, he/she produces modifications to specific brain rhythms that are detected in real-time through an electroencephalogram and translated into commands for a spelling application. By maximizing the overall communication rate, our approach is twofold: on one hand, we maximize the information transfer rate from the control signal, on the other hand, we optimize the way this information is employed for the purpose of verbal communication. The achieved results are satisfactory and comparable with the latest works reported in literature on motor-imagery BCI spellers. For the three subjects tested, we obtained a spelling rate of respectively 3 char/min, 2.7 char/min, and 2 char/min. © 2012 ACM.",BCI; BMI; Brain-computer interface; NLP; Speller,Communication; Natural language processing systems; User interfaces; Assistive technology; BCI; BMI; Brain rhythms; Brain signals; Communication rate; Control signal; Information transfer rate; Information transfers; Low rates; Motor imagery; Motor impairments; NAtural language processing; NLP; Speller; Text prediction; User interface designs; Verbal communications; Brain computer interface

To determine the nature of teamwork errors, we conducted an observational study in a trauma center over a two-year period. While eventually successful in treating the patients, trauma teams had problems tracking and integrating information in a longitudinal trajectory, which resulted in inefficiencies and near-miss errors. As an initial step in system design to support trauma teams, we proposed a model of teamwork and a novel classification of team errors. Four types of team errors emerged from our analysis: communication errors, vigilance errors, interpretation errors, and management errors. Based on these findings, we identified key information structures to support team cognition and decision making. We believe that displaying these information structures will support distributed cognition of trauma teams. Our findings have broader applicability to other collaborative and dynamic work settings that are prone to human error. © 2012 ACM.",Collocated teams; Distributed cognition; Healthcare; Medical error; System requirements; Team errors; Trauma resuscitation,Communication; Health care; Resuscitation; Cascading effects; Collocated teams; Communication errors; Distributed cognition; Human errors; Information structures; Integrating information; Medical errors; Observational study; System requirements; Errors

A user survey showed that perceived ease of use significantly affected the intention to continue using only for high-utilitarian functions, whereas pleasure affected the intention to continue using only for high-hedonic functions. The effect of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-utilitarian than for low-utilitarian functions.

The key insight is that interaction breakdowns in creation-oriented applications often manifest themselves in backtracking operations that can be automatically logged (e.g., undo and erase operations). Backtracking analysis synchronizes these events to contextual data such as screen capture video, helping the evaluator to characterize specific usability problems. The results from three experiments demonstrate that backtracking events can be effective indicators of usability problems in creationoriented applications, and can yield a cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory usability testing. © 2012 ACM.",Backtracking analysis; Cost-effectiveness; Undo; Usability testing,Cost effectiveness; Usability engineering; Backtracking analysis; Erase operation; Screen capture; Undo; Usability evaluation methods; Usability problems; Usability testing; User goals; Word processor; Cost benefit analysis
Dimensions of concern: A method to use cognitive dimensions to evaluate interfaces,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866309671&doi=10.1145%2f2240156.2240157&partnerID=40&md5=1d5435f6241c082fdb5795ff64bc2a10,"Producing useful and usable software often requires continuous and iterative evaluation. This paper introduces a novel usability evaluation method based on the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. The target of our evaluation is Herbal a suite of tools designed to simplify agent development by providing a high-level language and maintenance-oriented development environment. The method introduced here uncovers dimensions of concern, which are used to measure the usability of Herbal and to identify areas for improvement in the design. In this article, we demonstrate how we used dimensions of concern to effectively evaluate and improve usability, and we discuss ways in which our method can be adapted, extended, and applied to improving the usability of other interactive systems. © 2012 ACM.",Cognitive dimensions; Evaluating user interfaces; Measuring usability; Notational systems,Usability engineering; User interfaces; Cognitive dimensions; Development environment; Interactive system; Iterative evaluation; Measuring usability; Usability evaluation methods; Cognitive systems
User-experience from an inference perspective,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866307426&doi=10.1145%2f2240156.2240159&partnerID=40&md5=c861443a1b3214447da2b6c5200ae4ee,"In many situations, people make judgments on the basis of incomplete information, inferring unavailable attributes from available ones. These inference processes may also well operate when judgments about a product's user-experience are made. To examine this, an inference model of user-experience, based on Hassenzahl and Monk's [2010], was explored in three studies using Web sites. All studies supported the model's predictions and its stability, with hands-on experience, different products, and different usage modes (action mode versus goal mode). Within a unified framework of judgment as inference [Kruglanski et al. 2007], our approach allows for the integration of the effects of a wide range of information sources on judgments of user-experience. © 2012 ACM.",Aesthetics; Beauty; Inference perspective; Model; User-experience,Models; Aesthetics; Beauty; Hands-on experiences; Incomplete information; Inference models; Inference perspective; Inference process; Information sources; Unified framework; User-experience; Human computer interaction
Are we there yet?: The role of gender on the effectiveness and efficiency of user-robot communication in navigational tasks,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859729526&doi=10.1145%2f2147783.2147787&partnerID=40&md5=6b17f660b1fd5310d339c50c1b8f088f,"Many studies have identified gender differences in communication related to spatial navigation in real and virtual worlds. Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologs), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions. However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogs and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted. This article will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogs between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study. In the experiments discussed in this article, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication. To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however, each had to control a robot based on the user's instructions.While many monologe-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogs highlights a more complex pattern of results. As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication. However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction- the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower)-that has the most significant impact. In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male ""robots""/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks. Moreover, dialoge-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female ""robots""/followers achieved successful communication through ""alignment"" of spatial descriptions. In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female ""robots""/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings). This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female ""disadvantage"" in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms. Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender. © 2012 ACM.",,Navigation systems; Robots; Social sciences; Virtual reality; Complex pattern; Gender differences; Navigation tasks; Significant impacts; Spatial activity; Spatial descriptions; Spatial navigation; Task performance; Virtual worlds; Communication

By focusing upon encounters of coincidence during people's digitalmusic listening, we identified the elements at play, elucidated the properties of the individual elements, their inter-relationships, and an understanding of how coincidences can arise. We also reveal how, under particular conditions, such elements provide people with opportunities to encounter coincidence.

These systems show physical activity information (e.g., step counts, energy expenditure, heart rate) which is sufficient for many self-knowledge needs, but information about the factors that affect physical activity may be needed for deeper self-reflection and increased self-knowledge. We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people's awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness. © 2012 ACM.",Awareness; Context; Field study; Interviews; Monitoring; Personal informatics; Physical activity; Visualizations,Human computer interaction; Monitoring; Awareness; Context; Field studies; Informatics; Interviews; Physical activity; Visualization

WindowScape was intended to provide a more flexible and intuitive grouping model than prior systems. We report on the design process leading up to the system, and alternative designs we explored. We describe a series of formative evaluations that resulted in significant modifications to our initial prototype, as well as a deployment study of the final version, where users lived with WindowScape on a day-to-day basis. Our results from this study reveal how users react to novel aspects of our system, including its particular uses of miniaturization and its approach to grouping. We also discuss the impact of a task-oriented approach to window management on other aspects of user behavior, and the implications of this for future system design. © 2012 ACM.",Activity management; Deployment evaluation; Scaling; Spatial organization,Behavioral research; Management; Alternative designs; Deployment evaluation; Design process; Formative evaluation; Grouping model; Scaling; Spatial organization; User behaviors; Window management; Window manager; Managers
Mechanisms for collaboration: A design and evaluation framework for multi-user interfaces,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859709921&doi=10.1145%2f2147783.2147784&partnerID=40&md5=808f43fbe4994e21e8586d393aee7331,"Multi-user interfaces are said to provide ""natural"" interaction in supporting collaboration, compared to individual and noncolocated technologies. We identify three mechanisms accounting for the success of such interfaces: high awareness of others' actions and intentions, high control over the interface, and high availability of background information. We challenge the idea that interaction over such interfaces is necessarily ""natural"" and argue that everyday interaction involves constraints on awareness, control, and availability. These constraints help people interact more smoothly. We draw from social developmental psychology to characterize the design of multi-user interfaces in terms of how constraints on these mechanisms can be best used to promote collaboration. We use this framework of mechanisms and constraints to explain the successes and failures of existing designs, then apply it to three case studies of design, and finally derive from them a set of questions to consider when designing and analysing multi-user interfaces for collaboration. © 2012 ACM.",Collaboration; Constraints; Multi-user interfaces,Design; Interactive devices; Background information; Collaboration; Constraints; Developmental psychology; Evaluation framework; High availability; Multi-user interfaces; Availability

As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams, and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose Research Networking Systems (RNS) as a new type of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas: foundations, presentation, architecture, and evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institutionand discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers' need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators' desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system interoperability, and integration with the user's primary work context. Lastly, evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods. We hope that this article stimulates the humancomputer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and related communities to pursue a broad and comprehensive agenda for developing research networking systems. © 2012 ACM..",Online knowledge communities; Social networks; Social software; Web 2.0; Web 2.0 applications; Web collaborative software,Groupware; Network architecture; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Collaborative softwares; Knowledge communities; Social Networks; Social software; Web 2.0; Web 2.0 applications; Research
Evaluating and understanding the usability of a pen-based command system for interactive paper,2012,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859720184&doi=10.1145%2f2147783.2147786&partnerID=40&md5=231db8a9676be5403ba804607a494127,"To combine the affordances of paper and computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average new user learn to master the interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao et al. 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With it, people can select sections of printed document and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordances. In addition, our study identifies some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This article contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction. © 2012 ACM.",Command system; Paper-based interface; Pen gesture,Approximation theory; Active reading; Affordances; Affordances of paper; Command systems; Copy-and-paste; Design issues; Digital operation; Dynamic feedback; Empirical experiments; Form factors; Interactive paper; Multimedia playback; Paper documents; Paper interfaces; Paper-based interfaces; PC-based; Pen gesture; Pen-based; Printed documents; Seamless integration; Special properties; User performance; Experiments

Using our study's data, we derived a sensemaking model for end-user debugging and categorized participants' activities and verbalizations according to this model, allowing us to investigate how participants went about debugging. Among the results are identification of the prevalence of information foraging during end-user debugging, two successful strategies for traversing the sensemaking model, potential ties to gender differences in the literature, sensemaking sequences leading to debugging progress, and sequences tied with troublesome points in the debugging process.

However, display servers could be controlled by institutions which may not allow for the control software to be installed. This article introduces the window broker protocol which allows users to carry familiar control techniques on portable personal devices and use the control technique on any display server without installing the control software on the display server.

Such data can be used to make the spaces that we inhabit responsive and interactive. Personal data in its different forms are one important data stream that such spaces are designed to respond to. In turn, one stream of personal data currently attracting high levels of interest in the HCI community is physiological data (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity), but this has seen little consideration in building architecture or the design of responsive environments. In this context, we developed a prototype mapping a single occupant's respiration to its size and form, while it also sonifies their heartbeat. The result is a breathing building prototype, formative trials of which suggested that it triggers behavioral and physiological adaptations in inhabitants without giving them instructions and it is perceived as a relaxing experience. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a controlled study of this prototype, comparing three conditions: the static prototype, regular movement and sonification and a biofeedback condition, where the occupant's physiological data directly drives the prototype and presents this data back to them. The study confirmed that the biofeedback condition does indeed trigger behavioral changes and changes in participants' physiology, resulting in lower respiration rates as well as higher respiration amplitudes, respiration to heart rate coherence and lower frequency heart rate variability. Self-reported state of relaxation is more dependent on inhabitant preferences, their knowledge of physiological data and whether they found space to 'let go'. We conclude with a discussion of ExoBuilding as an immersive but also sharable biofeedback training interface and the wider potential of this approach to making buildings adapt to their inhabitants. © 2012 ACM.",Adaptive architecture; Biofeedback; Physiological data,Architecture; Behavioral research; Biofeedback; Heart; Adaptive architecture; Behavioral changes; Building prototypes; Electrodermal activity; Heart rate variability; Physiological adaptations; Physiological data; Responsive environments; Digital storage

Although the functionality of these systems is generally acceptable, there has been no thorough comparative study to date of how themapping equations affect the final system response. After developing a taxonomic classification of calibration functions, we examined over 400,000 models and evaluated the validity of several conventional assumptions. Our rigorous experimental procedure enabled us to optimize the calibration process for a real VOG gaze-tracking system and halve the calibration time while avoiding a detrimental effect on the accuracy or tolerance to head movement. Finally, a geometry-based method is implemented and tested. The results and performance is compared with those obtained by the general purpose expressions. © 2012 ACM.",Calibration; Eye-tracking; Gaze-tracking; Human computer interaction; Multiple linear regression; Video-oculography,Calibration; Human computer interaction; Linear regression; Video recording; Calibration functions; Comparative studies; Experimental procedure; Gaze tracking; Gaze tracking system; Multiple linear regressions; Polynomial mappings; Video oculography; Eye tracking

Systems that combine the characteristics of highly reliable operations and distributed, virtual organizations are known as highly reliable virtual organizations (HRVOs)-distributed and electronically linked groups of organizations that excel in high-consequence settings. Tsunamiwarning systems (TWS) are one example of virtual organizations that operate under enormous expectations for reliability. Adaptive structuration theory suggests that, in complex systems, technology and organizational structures co-evolve, and users adapt technology to their needs, creating shared meaning about the role and utility of technology in various settings. In this article, we consider how the shared meaning that develops in the social shaping of technology in one HRVO, tsunami warning systems, contributes to reliability enhancement. Following Poole and DeSanctis [2000], this study is a structuration study in a particular context, exploring how structuration occurs, the conditions that influence it, and its consequences or outcomes. We begin by describing HRVOs and the co-adaptive roles that technology and organizational structures play in such organizations. We then describe a global tsunami warning system as an illustrative case of a globally distributed sociotechnical system for which use of technology and distributed organizational structures should enhance reliability. We describe how social media plays a role in adaptive structuration in tsunami warning systems, and then return to consider the nature of HRVOs and their characteristics, en route to identifying challenges in the co-adaptation of technology and organizational structures in highly reliable tsunami warning systems. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/12-ART19$10.00.",Communication; Computerhuman interaction; Crisis management; Disaster management; Disaster response; High reliability organizations; Organizational structures; Technology; Tsunami warning systems; Virtual organizations,Alarm systems; Communication; Disaster prevention; Reliability; Societies and institutions; Technology; Computer Human Interaction; Crisis management; Disaster management; Disaster response; High reliability organizations; Organizational structures; Tsunami warning systems; Virtual organization; Tsunamis

All of these articles demonstrate the socio-technical aspect of crisis management systems involving the interaction of the technical and the social systems in a continuous process of adaptation. Inter-systems operability and compatibility is a major challenge and issue for crisis response systems, as different organizations need to communicate and cooperate to coordinate their actions during a crisis. One of the articles describes how social networks connected by a variety of communication modes enable people to travel, go to work or school, and carry out their everyday activities when they do not feel safe utilizing public transportation, do not trust that the education system will deliver, and do not trust information from official sources.",,Collaborative systems; Communication mode; Continuous process; Crisis management; Crisis management systems; Crisis response systems; Education systems; Public transportation; Social media; Social Networks; Social systems; Sociotechnical; Human computer interaction
Socio-cognitive aspects of interoperability: Understanding communication task environments among different organizations,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856041647&doi=10.1145%2f2063231.2063234&partnerID=40&md5=927b22c8373eb2579a03f48b2a279453,"Emergency communication systems (ECS) are a key element in collaborations among different public safety organizations. The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations. Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown that is possible to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of sociocognitive aspects. Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance. The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semistructured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain. Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups: information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness. Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/12-ART19$10.00.",Emergency communication; Interoperability; Organization; Socio-cognitive,Civil defense; Cognitive systems; Communication; Societies and institutions; Telecommunication systems; Adaptiveness; Communication domain; Communication task; Design collaboration; Emergency communication; Enabling technologies; Environmental variables; Interoperable communications; Key elements; Organization; Public safety; Radio frequencies; Semi structured interviews; Socio-cognitive; Interoperability

Signing on the tactile line: A multimodal system for teaching handwriting to blind children,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051977009&doi=10.1145%2f1993060.1993067h&partnerID=40&md5=019cbaed31d187412ceb6a5112ba0413,"We present McSig, a multimodal system for teaching blind children cursive handwriting so that they can create a personal signature. For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example, to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher's stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen that mimics the teacher's stylus movement; and (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen. McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig's effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig-they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons, two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting.

"Effects of motor scale, visual scale, and quantization on small target acquisition difficulty",2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051970244&doi=10.1145%2f1993060.1993063&partnerID=40&md5=77fed8777ae461e1cec4288c7ec45eef,"Targets of only a few pixels are notoriously difficult to acquire. Despite many attempts at facilitating pointing, the reasons for this difficulty are poorly understood. We confirm a strong departure from Fitts' Law for small target acquisition using a mouse and investigate three potential sources of problems: motor accuracy, legibility, and quantization. We find that quantization is not a problem, but both motor and visual sizes are limiting factors. This suggests that small targets should be magnified in both motor and visual space to facilitate pointing. Since performance degrades exponentially as targets get very small, we further advocate the exploration of uniform, target-agnostic magnification strategies. We also confirm Welford's 1969 proposal that motor inaccuracy can be modeled by subtracting a ""tremor constant"" from target size. We argue for the adoption of this model, rather than Fitts' law, when reflecting on small target acquisition. © 2011 ACM.",C-D gain; Fitts law; Pointing techniques; Quantization; Small targets; Target-agnostic,Mammals; C-D gain; Fitts law; Quantization; Small targets; Target-agnostic; Mergers and acquisitions

Experimental evaluation showed the system effectiveness using variable or one-time passwords. All of these attributes qualify the proposed system to be effectively deployed as a static authentication mechanism. Extensive experimentation was done using 2740 sessions collected from 274 users.

Two-handed marking menus for multitouch devices,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051991362&doi=10.1145%2f1993060.1993066&partnerID=40&md5=0b323c927003854f5289b9cd3ea01d77,"We investigate multistroke marking menus for multitouch devices and we show that using two hands can improve performance. We present two new two-handed multistroke marking menu variants in which users either draw strokes with both hands simultaneously or alternate strokes between hands. In a pair of studies we find that using two hands simultaneously is faster than using a single, dominant-handed marking menu by 10-15%. Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions. For two-handed simultaneous menus, stroke pairs that are bilaterally symmetric or share the same direction are fastest. We conclude with design guidelines and sample applications to aid multitouch application developers interested in using one-and two-handed marking menus. © 2011 ACM.",Multitouch; Two-handed multistroke marking menus,Application developers; Design guidelines; Marking Menu; Menu items; Multi-stroke; Multi-touch; Multi-touch device; One-handed; Two hand; User interfaces

Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms,we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD. This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application command recommendations in actual working environments.

Towards a framework of publics: Re-encountering media sharing and its user,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960766514&doi=10.1145%2f1970378.1970379&partnerID=40&md5=f19769a3043047b10296c33565245fcd,"Design and evaluation of user-generated media production and sharing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often focus on formal and informal media sharing, such as communication within social networks, automatic notifications of activities, and the exchange of digital artifacts. However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of ""publics,"" drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities. Implications that can be drawn from this work concern the role of digital media creation and sharing for the formation of collectives and how people position themselves collectively in relation to larger social groups and societal norms. The analysis suggests fruitful crossovers among HCI, Media Theory and New Media Research by approaching the user as both consumer and producer of digital content. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/06-ART5 $10.00.",Media sharing; Media theory; Photo sharing; Public; Social networking,Digital storage; Knowledge management; Automatic notification; Digital artifacts; Digital content creation; Digital contents; Housing community; Human-computer; Large groups; Media production; Media sharing; Media theory; New media; Photo sharing; Public; Social groups; Social Networks; Technology use; User-generated content; Human computer interaction
Measuring multitasking behavior with activity-based metrics,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960790675&doi=10.1145%2f1970378.1970381&partnerID=40&md5=af3466185f3bd5f155a759d8c8580c54,"Multitasking is the result of time allocation decisions made by individuals faced with multiple tasks. Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/06-ART7 $10.00.",Activity theory; It usage; Metrics; Multitasking; Task switching; User behavior,Activity coefficients; Behavioral research; Activity Theory; It usage; Metrics; Task switching; User behaviors; Multitasking

In this paper, we argue that it is not feasible to design one interface that appeals to all users of an increasingly global audience. Instead, we propose to design culturally adaptive systems, which automatically generate personalized interfaces that correspond to cultural preferences. In an evaluation of one such system, we demonstrate that a majority of international participants preferred their personalized versions over a nonadapted interface of the same Website. Results show that users were 22% faster using the culturally adapted interface, needed fewer clicks, and made fewer errors, in line with subjective results demonstrating that they found the adapted version significantly easier to use.

Extent refers to the size of an environment, whereas scale refers to whether people have to travel through an environment to see the detail necessary for navigation. Each participant was provided with full body-based information (walking through the virtual marketplaces in a large tracking hall or on an omnidirectional treadmill), just the translational component of body-based information (walking on a linear treadmill, but turning with a joystick), just the rotational component (physically turning but using a joystick to translate) or no body-based information (joysticks to translate and rotate). In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants' cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants' navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/06-ART10 $10.00.",Cognitive map; Locomotion; Navigation; Virtual reality,Exercise equipment; Experiments; Navigation; Sporting goods; Cognitive maps; Human navigation; Large spaces; Rotational component; Straight lines; Translational component; Virtual environment applications; Virtual marketplace; Walking through; Virtual reality
Blended interaction spaces for distributed team collaboration,2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955688536&doi=10.1145%2f1959022.1959025&partnerID=40&md5=399ad04969ce28c2f28e0ed84a56651d,"In recent years there has been an introduction of sophisticated new video conferencing technologies (e.g., HP Halo, Cisco Telepresence) that have led to enhancements in the collaborative user experience over traditional video conferencing technologies. Traditional video conferencing set-ups often distort the shared spatial properties of action and communication due to screen and camera orientation disparities and other asymmetries. These distortions affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize action and communication. By contrast, new systems, such as Halo, are physically configured to reduce these asymmetries and orientation disparities, thereby minimizing these spatial distortions. By creating appropriate shared spatial geometries, the distributed spaces become ""blended"" where the spatial geometries of the local space continue coherently across the distributed boundary into the remote site, providing the illusion of a single unified space. Drawing on theories of embodied action and workplace design we discuss the importance of this geometric ""blending"" of space for distributed collaboration and how this is achieved in systems such as Halo. We then extend these arguments to explore the concept of Blended Interaction Spaces: blended spaces in which interactive groupware is incorporated in ways spatially consistent with the physical geometries of the video-mediated set-up. We illustrate this discussion through a system called BISi that introduces interactive horizontal and vertical multipoint surfaces into a blended video-mediated collaboration space. In presenting this system, we highlight some of the particular challenges of creating these systems arising from the spatial consequences of different interaction mechanisms (e.g., direct touch or remote control) and how they affect movement and spatial configuration of people in these spaces. © 2011 ACM.",Collaboration; Media spaces; Telepresence,Blending; Geometry; Groupware; Visual communication; Camera orientation; Collaboration; Collaborative user experiences; Common resources; Distributed collaboration; Distributed teams; Interaction mechanisms; Local spaces; Media spaces; Multipoint; New system; Physical geometry; Remote sites; Set-ups; Spatial configuration; Spatial distortion; Spatial geometry; Spatial properties; Telepresence; Workplace design; Video conferencing

In this article, we take two steps to evaluate and improve the usability of mobile interfaces for such users. First, we offer an ethnographic study of the usability barriers facing 90 low-literacy subjects in India Kenya, the Philippines, and South Africa. Then via two studies involving over 70 subjects in India, we quantitatively compare the usability of different points in the mobile design space. In addition to text interfaces such as electronic forms, SMS, and USSD, we consider three text-free interfaces: a spoken dialog system, a graphical interface, and a live operator. Our results confirm that textual interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users, and error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of healthcare, we find that a live operator is up to ten times more accurate than text-based interfaces, and can also be cost effective in countries such as India. In the context of mobile banking, we find that task completion is highest with a graphical interface, but those who understand the spoken dialog system can use it more quickly due to their comfort and familiarity with speech. We synthesize our findings into a set of design recommendations. © 2011 ACM.",Data accuracy; Data entry; Illiteracy; Mobile banking; Mobile health,Developing countries; Health; Health care; Telecommunication equipment; Usability engineering; Data accuracy; Data entry; Illiteracy; Mobile banking; Mobile health; Cellular telephone systems

In this article, we propose extending the concept of sketching with a pencil on paper to the more generic concept of fluent exploration of interactive materials. We define interactive materials as any piece of software or hardware that represents or simulates a part of the interactive user experience, such as input from sensors, output in the form of sound, video, or image, or interaction with Web services or specialized programs. We have implemented the proposed concept within Sketchify, a tool for sketching user interfaces. Sketchify gives designers the freedom to manipulate interactive materials by combining elements of traditional freehand sketching with functional extensions and end-user programming tools, such as spreadsheets and scripting. We have evaluated Sketchify in the education of interaction designers, identifying both successful aspects and aspects that need further improvements. © 2011 ACM.",Design process; Interaction design; Rapid prototyping; Sketching; User interface software tools,Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Design; Functional programming; Input output programs; Rapid prototyping; Trace elements; Web services; Design process; End user programming; Freehand sketching; Functional extension; Interaction design; Interactive system; Sketching; User experience; User interface software tools; User interfaces
"An exploration of relations between visual appeal, trustworthiness and perceived usability of homepages",2011,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955702392&doi=10.1145%2f1959022.1959023&partnerID=40&md5=19efdec5fd6f1394e9b41fafdfc3354e,"Extremely high correlations between repeated judgments of visual appeal of homepages shown for 50 milliseconds have been interpreted as evidence for a mere exposure effect [Lindgaard et al. 2006]. Continuing that work, the present research had two objectives. First, it investigated the relationship between judgments differing in cognitive demands. Second, it began to identify specific visual attributes that appear to contribute to different judgments. Three experiments are reported. All used the stimuli and viewing time as before. Using a paradigm known to disrupt processing beyond the stimulus offset, Experiment 1 was designed to ensure that the previous findings could not be attributed to such continued processing. Adopting a within-subject design, Experiment 2 investigated the extent to which judgments differing in cognitive demands (visual appeal, perceived usability, trustworthiness) may be driven by the visual characteristics of a Web page. It also enabled analyses of visual attributes that contributed most to the different judgments. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 but using a between-subject design to ensure that no practice effect could occur. The results suggest that all three types of judgments are largely driven by visual appeal, but that cognitively demanding judgments are processed in a qualitatively different manner than visual appeal, and that they rely on somewhat different visual attributes. A model accounting for the results is provided. © 2011 ACM.",Masking effects; Perceived usability; Trustworthiness; Visual appeal,Engineering research; Usability engineering; Cognitive demands; Home page; Masking effect; Mere exposure effect; Perceived usability; Replicated experiment; Trustworthiness; Visual appeal; Visual attributes; Web page; Experiments
Oasis: A framework for linking notification delivery to the perceptual structure of goal-directed tasks,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650744038&doi=10.1145%2f1879831.1879833&partnerID=40&md5=bc7dd0b0044d68b46468fdc97ef94acc,"A notification represents the proactive delivery of information to a user and reduces the need to visually scan or repeatedly check an external information source. At the same time, notifications often interrupt user tasks at inopportune moments, decreasing productivity and increasing frustration. Controlled studies have shown that linking notification delivery to the perceptual structure of a user's tasks can reduce these interruption costs. However, in these studies, the scheduling was always performedmanually, and it was not clear whether it would be possible for a system tomimic similar techniques. This article contributes the design and implementation of a novel system called Oasis that aligns notification scheduling with the perceptual structure of user tasks. We describe the architecture of the system, how it detects task structure on the fly without explicit knowledge of the task itself, and how it layers flexible notification scheduling policies on top of this detection mechanism. The system also includes an offline tool for creating customized statistical models for detecting task structure. The value of our system is that it intelligently schedules notifications, enabling the reductions in interruption costs shown within prior controlled studies to now be realized by users in everyday desktop computing tasks. It also provides a test bed for experimenting with how notification management policies and other system functionalities can be linked to task structure. © 2010 ACM.",Attention; Breakpoints; Interruption; Notification management systems,Equipment testing; Management; Scheduling; Attention; Break-points; Desktop computing; Detection mechanism; Explicit knowledge; In-interruption; Information sources; Interruption; Interruption costs; Management policy; Notification management systems; Offline; On the flies; Scheduling policies; Statistical models; System functionality; Task structure; Cost reduction
Time warp sports for internet television,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650728889&doi=10.1145%2f1879831.1879834&partnerID=40&md5=4a0677fe4843f5e4933ab83ed1998b95,"Internet-based video delivery offers new opportunities for interactive television. The creation and usability of interactive television is very different from desktop or web-based interaction. The concepts of frameworks and genres provides an approach to learnable interaction in an entertainment rather than task-oriented activity. The concept of a framework defines the tools required for both producing and viewing a particular style of interactive video experience. An interactive framework for televised sports is presented. This framework implements a sports television experience that support play-by-play navigation as well as viewer's interactive choice of camera angles. Tools for creating and viewing interactive sports are developed in parallel. In-home and in-lab experiments give indications of how sports fans will use interactive television in the future. The experiments demonstrate that fans will use the interaction rather than passively watching, can easily learn the interactive features and strongly prefer the new features over tradition rewind/fast-forward. The data indicates that many users will use the interactive controls to enrich and prolong their viewing rather than simply skipping as rapidly as possible through a game. However, there is also indication that some viewers will simply skip rapidly. There are also indications that the skip vs. review interaction depends on the interest level of current game play. © 2010 ACM.",Interactive television; Internet television; Sports television,Fans; Internet; Television broadcasting; Interactive control; Interactive features; Interactive television; Interactive video; Interest level; Internet based; Internet television; New opportunities; Sports television; Television experience; Time Warp; Video delivery; Web-based interactions; Digital television
Indexicality: Understanding mobile human-computer interaction in context,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650755236&doi=10.1145%2f1879831.1879832&partnerID=40&md5=0d3b16c52f579fa4f6a4f27adcae1dcd,"A lot of research has been done within the area of mobile computing and context-awareness over the last 15 years, and the idea of systems adapting to their context has produced promising results for overcoming some of the challenges of user interaction with mobile devices within various specialized domains. However, today it is still the case that only a limited body of theoretically grounded knowledge exists that can explain the relationship between users, mobile system user interfaces, and their context. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to elevate learning from the mobile systems we develop and study from a concrete to an abstract level. Consequently, the research field is impeded in its ability to leap forward and is limited to incremental steps from one design to the next. Addressing the problem of this void, this article contributes to the body of knowledge about mobile interaction design by promoting a theoretical approach for describing and understanding the relationship between user interface representations and user context. Specifically, we promote the concept of indexicality derived from semiotics as an analytical concept that can be used to describe and understand a design. We illustrate the value of the indexicality concept through an analysis of empirical data from evaluations of three prototype systems in use. Based on our analytical and empirical work we promote the view that users interpret information in a mobile computer user interface through creation of meaningful indexical signs based on the ensemble of context and system. © 2010 ACM.",Field evaluation; Healthcare; Indexicality; Mobile computing; Physical context; Prototype systems; Public transport; Social context; Sociality; Spatial context,Design; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Field evaluation; Indexicality; Physical context; Prototype system; Public transport; Social context; Sociality; Spatial context; User interfaces
Interaction design for mobile product recommendation agents: Supporting users' decisions in retail stores,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650735905&doi=10.1145%2f1879831.1879835&partnerID=40&md5=29c33593337b6ad7b274eafb9f256141,"Mobile product recommendation agents (RAs) are software systems that operate on mobile handheld devices, using wireless Internet to support users' decisions en route, such as consumers' product choices in retail stores. As the demand for ubiquitous access to the web grows, potential benefits of mobile RAs have been recognized, albeit with little supporting empirical evidence. We investigate whether and how mobile RAs enhance users' decisions in retail stores by reducing the effort to make purchase decisions while augmenting the accuracy of the decisions. In addition, to identify potential design principles for mobile RAs, we compare and evaluate two interaction styles of mobile RAs: alternative-driven (RA-AL) versus attribute-driven (RA-AT) interactions. The results of a laboratory experiment conducted in a simulated store indicate that mobile RAs reduced users' perceived effort and increased accuracy of their decisions. Furthermore, RA-AL users made more accurate decisions than RA-AT users due to the RA-AL's interaction style, which was compatible with the way in which users processed information andmade decisions in the store. These empirical results support the notion that mobile RAs should be designed to fit the user's task undertaken in the particular context. © 2010 ACM.",,Retail stores; Sales; Design Principles; Empirical evidence; Empirical results; En-route; Interaction design; Interaction styles; Laboratory experiments; Mobile handheld devices; Mobile products; Potential benefits; Processed information; Product choice; Purchase decision; Software systems; Ubiquitous access; Wireless internet; Mobile agents
"Parallel prototyping leads to better design results, more divergence, and increased self-efficacy",2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650740726&doi=10.1145%2f1879831.1879836&partnerID=40&md5=d21573f4d4886761222336f87a1b7da4,"Iteration can help people improve ideas. It can also give rise to fixation, continuously refining one option without considering others. Does creating and receiving feedback on multiple prototypes in parallel, as opposed to serially, affect learning, self-efficacy, and design exploration? An experiment manipulated whether independent novice designers created graphic Web advertisements in parallel or in series. Serial participants received descriptive critique directly after each prototype. Parallel participants created multiple prototypes before receiving feedback. As measured by clickthrough data and expert ratings, ads created in the Parallel condition significantly outperformed those from the Serial condition. Moreover, independent raters found Parallel prototypes to be more diverse. Parallel participants also reported a larger increase in task-specific self-confidence. This article outlines a theoretical foundation for why parallel prototyping produces better design results and discusses the implications for design education. © 2010 ACM.",Comparison; Critique; Design; Divergence; Exploration; Feedback; Iteration; Juxtaposition; Prototyping; Self-efficacy,Iterative methods; Comparison; Critique; Divergence; Exploration; Iteration; Juxtaposition; Prototyping; Self efficacy; Design
Semantic imitation in social tagging,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955202383&doi=10.1145%2f1806923.1806926&partnerID=40&md5=0d531ea7b8a2a678cfd7700d022aa7a2,"We present a semantic imitation model of social tagging and exploratory search based on theories of cognitive science. The model assumes that social tags evoke a spontaneous tag-based topic inference process that primes the semantic interpretation of resource contents during exploratory search, and the semantic priming of existing tags in turn influences future tag choices. The model predicts that (1) users who can see tags created by others tend to create tags that are semantically similar to these existing tags, demonstrating the social influence of tag choices; and (2) users who have similar information goals tend to create tags that are semantically similar, but this effect is mediated by the semantic representation and interpretation of social tags. Results from the experiment comparing tagging behavior between a social group (where participants can see tags created by others) and a nominal group (where participants cannot see tags created by others) confirmed these predictions. The current results highlight the critical role of human semantic representations and interpretation processes in the analysis of large-scale social information systems. The model implies that analysis at both the individual and social levels are important for understanding the active, dynamic processes between human knowledge structures and external folksonomies. Implications on how social tagging systems can facilitate exploratory search, interactive information retrievals, knowledge exchange, and other higher-level cognitive and learning activities are discussed. © 2010 ACM.",Experimentation; Human Factors; Theory,Cognitive systems; Human engineering; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Cognitive science; Dynamic process; Exploratory search; Folksonomies; Human factors; Human knowledge; Imitation models; Inference process; Interactive information retrieval; Knowledge exchange; Learning Activity; Semantic interpretation; Semantic representation; Social groups; Social influence; Social information system; Tagging systems; Experiments
A model of novice and expert navigation performance in constrained-input interfaces,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955191132&doi=10.1145%2f1806923.1806927&partnerID=40&md5=2858c7804222d9ae0816672e72628e27,"Many interactive systems require users to navigate through large sets of data and commands using constrained input devices-such as scroll rings, rocker switches, or specialized keypads-that provide less power and flexibility than traditional input devices like mice or touch screens. While performance with more traditional devices has been extensively studied in human-computer interaction, there has been relatively little investigation of human performance with constrained input. As a result, there is little understanding of what factors govern performance in these situations, and how interfaces should be designed to optimize interface actions such as navigation and selection. Since constrained input is now common in a wide variety of interactive systems (such as mobile phones, audio players, in-car navigation systems, and kiosk displays), it is important for designers to understand what factors affect performance. To aid in this understanding, we present the Constrained Input Navigation (CIN) model, a predictive model that allows accurate determination of human navigation and selection performance in constrained-input scenarios. CIN identifies three factors that underlie user efficiency: the performance of the interface type for single-level item selection (where interface type depends on the input and output devices, the interactive behavior, and the data organization), the hierarchical structure of the information space, and the user's experience with the items to be selected. We show through experiments that, after empirical calibration, the model's predictions fit empirical data well, and discuss why and how each of the factors affects performance. Models like CIN can provide valuable theoretical and practical benefits to designers of constrained-input systems, allowing them to explore and compare a much wider variety of alternate interface designs without the need for extensive user studies. © 2010 ACM.",Experimentation; Human Factors; Theory,Audio systems; Channel capacity; Computer crime; Design; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Knobs; Knowledge management; Navigation; Telecommunication equipment; Audio players; Constrained input; Data organization; Empirical calibration; Empirical data; Hierarchical structures; Human factors; Human navigation; Human performance; In-car navigation systems; Information spaces; Input and outputs; Input devices; Input interface; Input systems; Interactive behavior; Interactive system; Interface designs; Item selection; Navigation performance; Predictive models; Rocker switches; Show through; Touch screen; Traditional devices; User study; Experiments

In a provisional evaluation, 12 able-bodied participants each entered 5 blocks of text with the scanning interval decreasing from 1100 ms initially to 700 ms at the end. The average text entry rate in the 5th block was 5.11 wpm with 99% accuracy. One participant performed an additional five blocks of trials and reached an average speed of 9.28 wpm on the 10th block.

In this article we seek to excavate the home archive, exploring those things that people choose to keep rather than simply accumulate. Based on extensive field research in family homes we present an investigation of the kinds of sentimental objects, both physical and digital, to be found in homes, and through in-depth interviews with family members we explore the values behind archiving practices, explaining why and how sentimental artefacts are kept. In doing this we wish to highlight the polysemous nature of things and to argue that archiving practice in the home is not solely concerned with the invocation of memory. In support of this we show how sentimental artifacts are also used to connect with others, to define the self and the family, to fulfill obligations and, quite conversely to efforts of remembering, to safely forget. Such values are fundamental to family life where archiving takes place and consequentlywe explore how home archiving is achieved as a familial practice in the negotiated spaces of the home. From this grounded understanding of existing practices and values, in context, we derive requirements and implications for the design of future forms of domestic archiving technology. © 2010 ACM.",Design; Experimentation; Human Factors,Computer crime; Design; Human engineering; Digital archives; Experimentation; Family life; Field research; Human factors; Human remains; In-depth interviews; Experiments

We portray different views of complexity; we explore not only negative aspects of complexity, but also positive, making a case for the existence of benign complexity. We argue that complex interaction is not necessarily bad, but designers need a deeper understanding of interaction complexity and need to treat it in a more intentional and thoughtful way. We examine interaction complexity as it relates to different loci of complexity: internal, external, and mediated complexity. Our purpose with these analytical exercises is to pave the way for design that is informed by a more focused and precise understanding of interaction complexity. © 2010 ACM.",Benign complexity; Design approach; Design theory; Interaction complexity; Interface design; Product design,Complex interaction; Complexity design; Design theory; Digital artifacts; Explosive growth; Interface designs; Product design
Foundations for designing and evaluating user interfaces based on the crossing paradigm,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952950070&doi=10.1145%2f1746259.1746263&partnerID=40&md5=d8c3879f551a7b466ea39292c5c06aee,"Traditional graphical user interfaces have been designed with the desktop mouse in mind, a device well characterized by Fitts' law. Yet in recent years, hand-held devices and tablet personal computers using a pen (or fingers) as the primary mean of interaction have become more and more popular. These new interaction modalities have pushed the traditional focus on pointing to its limit. In this paper we explore whether a different paradigm-goal crossing-based on pen strokes-may substitute or complement pointing as another fundamental interaction method. First we describe a study in which we establish that goal crossing is dependent on an index of difficulty analogous to Fitts' law, and that in some settings, goal crossing completion time is shorter or comparable to pointing performance under the same index of difficulty. We then demonstrate the expressiveness of the crossing-based interaction paradigm by implementing CrossY, an application which only uses crossing for selecting commands. CrossY demonstrates that crossing-based interactions can be more expressive than the standard point and click approach. We also show how crossing-based interactions encourage the fluid composition of commands. Finally after observing that users' performance could be influenced by the general direction of travel, we report on the results of a study characterizing this effect. These latter results led us to propose a general guideline for dialog box interaction. Together, these results provide the foundation for the design of effective crossing-based interactions. © 2010 ACM.",Command composition; Crossing-based interfaces; Events; Fitts' law; Fluid interaction; Goal crossing; Graphical widgets; Input; Input performance; Pen-computing; Pointing,Hand held computers; Command composition; Completion time; Crossing based interfaces; Dialog box; Fitts' law; Fluid composition; Fluid interactions; Hand-held devices; Interaction methods; Interaction paradigm; Tablet personal computers; Graphical user interfaces
Effects of facial similarity on user responses to embodied agents,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952904914&doi=10.1145%2f1746259.1746261&partnerID=40&md5=4f5e2a09cb499c8fd1f0f367d9acc7e5,"We investigated the effects of facial similarity between users and embodied agents under different experimental conditions. Sixty-four undergraduates interacted with two different embodied agents: in one case the agent was designed to look somewhat similar to the user, and in the other case the agent was designed to look dissimilar. We varied between subjects how helpful the agent was for a given task. Results showed that the facial similarity manipulation sometimes affected participants' responses, even though they did not consciously detect the similarity. Specifically, when the agent was helpful, facial similarity increased participantsi ratings of involvement. However, when exposed to unhelpful agents, male participants had negative responses to the similar-looking agent compared to the dissimilar one. These results suggest that using facially similar embodied agents has a potential large downside if that embodied agent is perceived to be unhelpful. © 2010 ACM.",3D morphing; Engagement with embodied agents; Facial similarity; I-PEFiC model; Use intentions,3D morphing; Embodied agent; Engagement with embodied agents; Experimental conditions; Three dimensional

We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends. © 2010 ACM.",Friendsourcing; Human computation; Social computing; Social tagging,Software prototyping; Visualization; Cloud visualization; Data collection; Design spaces; Facebook; Human computation; Log analysis; Personalizations; Question and answer system; Question Answering; Side effect; Social computing; Social Networks; Survey data; Data visualization

Our application domain is an HCI study aimed at revealing users' strategies in an end-user debugging task and understanding how the strategies relate to gender and to success. We cast this problem as a sequential pattern discovery problem, where user strategies are manifested as sequential behavior patterns. Problematically, we found that the patterns discovered by standard data mining algorithms were difficult to interpret and provided limited information about high-level strategies. To help interpret the patterns as strategies, we examined multiple ways of clustering the patterns into meaningful groups. This collectively led to interesting findings about users' behavior in terms of both gender differences and debugging success. These common behavioral patterns were novel HCI findings about differences in males' and females' behavior with software, and were verified by a parallel study with an independent data set on strategies. As a research endeavor into the interpretability issues faced by data mining techniques, our work also highlights important research directions for making data mining more accessible to non-data-mining experts. © 2010 ACM.",Clustering; Human-computer interaction; Sequential patterns,Complexation; Electric currents; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Problem solving; Application domains; Behavior patterns; Behavioral patterns; Data mining algorithm; Data mining system; Data mining techniques; Data sets; End users; Gender differences; Interpretability; Limited information; Mining problems; Research directions; Sequential patterns; User action; User strategies; Data mining

It identifies hidden relationships, patterns, and interdependencies without leading to a priori hypotheses so predictive rules can be generated and interesting hypotheses found. Data mining has been used in mobile and collaborative applications to analyze users' behavior, demonstrating the way feedback produced by such analysis can change people's behaviors in meetings. Complex social behaviors can be known from analysis of simple data streams, such as recording conversational turns and locations recorded from mobile phones, or RF tags. Interaction explanation and feedback are also important so that people can understand how and why the system created its advice, while data mining can produce useful advice and recommendations for users.",,Complexation; Human computer interaction; Telecommunication equipment; Apriori; Collaborative application; Computer Human Interaction; Data stream; Large amounts of data; Predictive rules; Social behavior; User need; Data mining

We approach the city as a system, with human, physical and digital components and behaviours. In creating effective and usable urban pervasive computing systems, we need to take into account the patterns of movement and encounter amongst people, locations, and mobile and fixed devices in the city. Advances in mobile and wireless communications have enabled us to detect and record the presence and movement of devices through cities. This article makes a number of methodological and empirical contributions. We present a toolkit of algorithms and visualization techniques that we have developed to model and make sense of spatial and temporal patterns of mobility, presence, and encounter. Applying this toolkit, we provide an analysis of urban Bluetooth data based on a longitudinal dataset containing millions of records associated with more than 70000 unique devices in the city of Bath, UK.

Potential for personalization,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950663241&doi=10.1145%2f1721831.1721835&partnerID=40&md5=8402b9901b8723b715a8d8229cb28887,"Current Web search tools do a good job of retrieving documents that satisfy the most common intentions associated with a query, but do not do a very good job of discerning different individuals' unique search goals. We explore the variation in what different people consider relevant to the same query by mining three data sources: (1) explicit relevance judgments, (2) clicks on search results (a behavior-based implicit measure of relevance), and (3) the similarity of desktop content to search results (a content-based implicit measure of relevance). We find that people's explicit judgments for the same queries differ greatly. As a result, there is a large gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. We call this gap the potential for personalization. The two implicit indicators we studied provide complementary value for approximating this variation in result relevance among people. We discuss several uses of our findings, including a personalized search system that takes advantage of the implicit measures by ranking personally relevant results more highly and improving click-through rates. © 2010 ACM.",Individual differences; Personalized search; User modeling; Web search,Information retrieval; Search engines; Behavior-based; Click-through rate; Content-based; Data source; Implicit measures; Individual Differences; Personalizations; Personalized search; Relevance judgment; Search results; User Modeling; Web search tools; Web searches; Websites
Experiments on the preference-based organization interface in recommender systems,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950651002&doi=10.1145%2f1721831.1721836&partnerID=40&md5=9d9c3baa48faa2eecbb0369381362dfa,"As e-commerce has evolved into its second generation, where the available products are becoming more complex and their abundance is almost unlimited, the task of locating a desired choice has become too difficult for the average user. Therefore, more effort has been made in recent years to develop recommender systems that recommend products or services to users so as to assist in their decision-making process. In this article, we describe crucial experimental results about a novel recommender technology, called the preference-based organization (Pref-ORG), which generates critique suggestions in addition to recommendations according to users' preferences. The critique is a form of feedback (""I would like something cheaper than this one"") that users can provide to the currently displayed product, with which the system may better predict what the user truly wants.We compare the preference-based organization technique with related approaches, including the ones that also produce critique candidates, but without the consideration of user preferences. A simulation setup is first presented, that identified Pref-ORG's significantly higher algorithm accuracy in predicting critiques and choices that users should intend to make, followed by a realuser evaluation which practically verified its significant impact on saving users' decision effort. © 2010 ACM.",Association rule mining; Critique suggestion; Preference-based organization; Recommender system; Simulation; User evaluation,Association rules; Associative processing; Association rule mining; Decision making process; E-Commerce; Preference-based; Recommender systems; Second generation; Significant impacts; User evaluations; Decision making
"ICOs: A model-based user interface description technique dedicated to interactive systems addressing usability, reliability and scalability",2009,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71449097044&doi=10.1145%2f1614390.1614393&partnerID=40&md5=c561b0a76dc8d81bb4e97bd985dc098b,"The design of real-life complex systems calls for advanced software engineering models, methods, and tools in order to meet critical requirements such as reliability, dependability, safety, or resilience that will avoid putting the company, the mission, or even human life at stake. When such systems encompass a substantial interactive component, the same level of confidence is required towards the human-computer interface. Conventional empirical or semiformal techniques, although very fruitful, do not provide sufficient insight on the reliability of the human-system cooperation, and offer no easy way to, for example, quantitatively and qualitatively compare two design options with respect to that reliability. The aim of this article is to present a user interface description language (called ICOs) for the engineering and development of usable and reliable user interfaces. The CASE tool supporting the ICOs notation (called Petshop) is a Petri nets-based-tool for the design, specification, prototyping, and validation of interactive software. In that environment models (built with the formal description technique ICOs) of the interactive application can be interactively modified and executed. This is used to support prototyping phases (when the models and the interactive application evolve significantly to meet late user requirements, for instance) as well as the operation phase (after the system is deployed). The use of ICOs and PetShop is presented on several large-scale systems such as a multimodal ground segment application for satellite control, an air traffic control interactive application, and an application for new generation of interactive cockpits in large civil aircraft such as Airbus A380 or Boeing 787. The article emphasizes the demonstration of the expressive power of the notation and how it can support the description of various aspects of user interfaces, namely interaction techniques (both WIMP and post-WIMP), interactive components (such as widgets), and the behavioral part of interactive applications such as the dialog and the functional core. It also demonstrates that PetShop provides dedicated support for prototyping activities of behavioral aspects at the various levels of the architecture of interactive systems. While the focus is on past work done on various large-scale applications, the article also highlights why and how ICOs and Petshop are able to address challenges raised by next-generation user interfaces. © 2009 ACM.",Formal description techniques; Interactive prototyping; Interactive software engineering; Model-based approaches; Safetycritical interactive systems; User interface description language,Air traffic control; Aircraft; Cockpits (aircraft); Computer aided software engineering; Interactive devices; Large scale systems; Linguistics; Machine design; Models; Petri nets; Phase interfaces; Quality assurance; Software reliability; User interfaces; Formal description techniques; Interactive prototyping; Interactive software engineering; Interactive system; Safety-critical; User interface description languages; Software prototyping

Such environments are characterized by a wide set of interactive devices, with interactive applications that exploit a number of functionalities developed beforehand and encapsulated in Web services. In this article, we discuss how a novel model-based UIDL can provide useful support both at design and runtime for these types of applications. Web service annotations can also be exploited for providing hints for user interface development at design time. At runtime the language is exploited to support dynamic generation of user interfaces adapted to the different devices at hand during the user interface migration process, which is particularly important in ubiquitous environments. © 2009 ACM.",Model-based design; Multidevice user interfaces; Ubiquitous applications; User interface description language; Web services,Design; Information services; Interactive devices; Linguistics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Ubiquitous computing; Web services; Model-based design; Multidevice; Multidevice user interfaces; Ubiquitous application; User interface description languages; User interfaces
A specification paradigm for the design and implementation of Tangible user interfaces,2009,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71449126477&doi=10.1145%2f1614390.1614395&partnerID=40&md5=b09c64e98e7bdf969cb16bd6549148f4,"Tangible interaction shows promise to significantly enhance computer-mediated support for activities such as learning, problem solving, and design. However, tangible user interfaces are currently considered challenging to design and build. Designers and developers of these interfaces encounter several conceptual, methodological, and technical difficulties. Among others, these challenges include: the lack of appropriate interaction abstractions, the shortcomings of current user interface software tools to address continuous and parallel interactions, as well as the excessive effort required to integrate novel input and output technologies. To address these challenges, we propose a specification paradigm for designing and implementing Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), that enables TUI developers to specify the structure and behavior of a tangible user interface using high-level constructs which abstract away implementation details. An important benefit of this approach, which is based on User Interface Description Language (UIDL) research, is that these specifications could be automatically or semi-automatically converted into concrete TUI implementations. In addition, such specifications could serve as a common ground for investigating both design and implementation concerns by TUI developers from different disciplines. Thus, the primary contribution of this article is a high-level UIDL that provides developers from different disciplines means for effectively specifying, discussing, and programming a broad range of tangible user interfaces. There are three distinct elements to this contribution: a visual specification technique that is based on Statecharts and Petri nets, an XML-compliant language that extends this visual specification technique, as well as a proof-of-concept prototype of a Tangible User Interface Management System (TUIMS) that semi-automatically translates high-level specifications into a program controlling specific target technologies. © 2009 ACM.",Tangible interaction; Tangible user interfaces; User interface description language; User interface management system,Abstracting; Design; High level languages; Linguistics; Management; Markup languages; Petri nets; Specifications; Common ground; Design and build; Distinct elements; High level specification; Input and outputs; Parallel interactions; Primary contribution; Proof of concept; Statecharts; Tangible interaction; Tangible user interfaces; Target technology; Technical difficulties; User interface description languages; User interface management systems; User interface software; Visual specification; User interfaces

As such, Concept-Oriented Design (COD) was created as a theory of software development for both natural and executable design and development. Instantiated in the toolkit Chasm, Chasm is a natural, tiered, executable User Interface Description Language (UIDL) for 3DUIs resulting in improved understandability, as well as reduced complexity and reuse.

However, such a perspective neglects the practices of access control and the embeddedness of technical mechanisms within situated action. In this article, we reconceptualize the issue of access control on a theoretical, methodological, and practical level. On a theoretical level, we develop a terminology to distinguish between access control practices and the technical support mechanisms. We coin the term Computer Supported Access Control (CSAC) to emphasize this perspective. On a methodological level, we discuss empirical investigations of access control behavior from a situated action perspective. We discovered a differentiated set of social practices around traditional access control systems. By applying these findings to a practical level, we enhance the design space of computer supported access control mechanisms by suggesting a matrix of technical mechanisms which go beyond an ex-ante configuration. © 2009 ACM.",Access control; Computer supported cooperative work field; Coordination mechanism; Critical design; Ethnomethodology; Study,Computer control; Groupware; Interactive computer systems; Machine design; Security systems; Terminology; Access control mechanism; Coordination mechanism; Critical design; Design spaces; Embeddedness; Empirical investigation; Ethnomethodology; matrix; Situated actions; Social practices; Study; Technical support; Access control

However, current network solutions are derived from the world of work (and initially the military) and provide poor support for the needs of the home. We present the key findings to emerge from empirical studies of home networks in the UK and US. The studies reveal two key kinds of work that effective home networking relies upon: one, the technical work of setting up and maintaining the home network, and the other, the collaborative and socially organized work of the home which the network is embedded in and supports. The two are thoroughly intertwined and rely upon one another for their realization, yet neither is adequately supported by current networking technologies and applications. Explication of the work to make the home network work opens up the design space for the continued integration of the home network in domestic life and elaboration of future support. Key issues for development include the development of networking facilities that do not require advanced networking knowledge, that are flexible and support the local social order of the home and the evolution of its routines, and which ultimately make the home network visible and accountable to household members.",Home networking; Human computer interaction,Carrier communication; Domestic appliances; Personal communication systems; Design spaces; Domestic life; Empirical studies; Home networking; Home networks; Household members; Key issues; Multiple computers; Network solutions; Networking technology; Social order; Technical work; Human computer interaction

This article presents a new system, Distract-R, that allows designers to rapidly prototype and evaluate new in-vehicle interfaces. The core engine of the system relies on a rigorous cognitive model of driver behavior which, when integrated with models of task behavior on the prototyped interfaces, generate predictions of driver performance and distraction. Distract-R allows a designer to prototype basic interfaces, demonstrate possible tasks on these interfaces, specify relevant driver characteristics and driving scenarios, and finally simulate, visualize, and analyze the resulting behavior as generated by the cognitive model. The article includes three modeling studies that demonstrate the system's ability to account for various aspects of driver performance for several types of in-vehicle interfaces.

Physical models are frequently created not only to finalize a project but also to demonstrate an idea in early design stages. For such tasks, models can easily be annotated to capture comments, edits, and other forms of feedback. Unfortunately, these annotations remain in the physical world and cannot easily be transferred back to the digital world. Our system, ModelCraft, addresses this problem by augmenting the surface of a model with a traceable pattern. Any sketch drawn on the surface of the model using a digital pen is recovered as part of a digital representation. Sketches can also be interpreted as edit marks that trigger the corresponding operations on the CAD model. ModelCraft supports a wide range of operations on complex models, from editing a model to assembling multiple models, and offers physical tools to capture free-space input. Several interviews and a formal study with the potential users of our system proved the ModelCraft system useful. Our system is inexpensive, requires no tracking infrastructure or per object calibration, and we show how it could be extended seamlessly to use current 3D printing technology. © 2009 ACM.",Pen-based interactions; Rapid prototyping; Tangible interactions,Computer aided design; Concurrent engineering; Drawing (graphics); Job analysis; Laser beam cutting; Models; Printing; Product design; Rapid prototyping; 3-D printing; 3D models; CAD models; Complex model; Digital pens; Digital representations; Digital world; Early design stages; Free space; Industrial design; Laser cutting; Multiple models; Pen-based interactions; Physical model; Physical tool; Physical world; Potential users; Tangible interactions; Three dimensional

Can direct manipulation lower the barriers to computer programming and promote transfer of training?

By constraining syntax and providing concrete visual representations on which to operate, direct manipulation programming environments can potentially lower these barriers. However, what if the ultimate learning goal of the novice is to be able to program in conventional textual languages, as is the case for introductory computer science students? Can direct manipulation programming environments lower the initial barriers to programming, and, at the same time, facilitate positive transfer to textual programming? To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes. Our results show that direct manipulation interfaces can provide novices with a ""way in"" to traditional textual programming. © 2009 ACM.",Direct manipulation; Programming education; Semantic components analysis; Transfer of training; Video analysis,Education; Education computing; Position measurement; Semantics; Syntactics; Direct manipulation; Programming education; Semantic components analysis; Transfer of training; Video analysis; Computer programming

Such codes allow a novice to look up logographs even with no knowledge of the logographic conventions used by native speakers.

We hypothesized that the attentional demands of input devices are intricately linked to whether the device matches the input requirements of the on-screen task. Further, matching task and device should be more important for attentionally reduced groups, such as older adults. Younger and older adults used either a direct (touch screen) or indirect (rotary encoder) input device to perform matched or mismatched input tasks under a spectrum of attention allocation conditions. Input devices required attention-more so for older adults, especially in a mismatch situation. In addition, task performance was influenced by the match between task demands and input device characteristics. Though both groups benefited from a match between input device and task input requirements, older adults benefited more, and this benefit increased as less attention was available. We offer an a priori method to choose an input device for a task by considering the overlap between device attributes and input requirements. This data should affect design decisions concerning input device selection across age groups and task contexts. © 2009 ACM.",Attentional demands; Cognitive translation; Direct manipulation; Human-computer interaction; Indirect manipulation; Older adults,Input output programs; Knobs; Knowledge management; Attentional demands; Cognitive translation; Direct manipulation; Indirect manipulation; Older adults; Human computer interaction

We investigated how body-based information about the translational and rotational components of movement helped participants to perform a navigational search task (finding targets hidden inside boxes in a room-sized space). When participants physically walked around the VE while viewing it on a head-mounted display (HMD), they then performed 90% of trials perfectly, comparable to participants who had performed an equivalent task in the real world during a previous study. By contrast, participants performed less than 50% of trials perfectly if they used a tethered HMD (move by physically turning but pressing a button to translate) or a desktop display (no body-based information). This is the most complex navigational task in which a real-world level of performance has been achieved in a VE.

Shifting the focus from accuracy to recallability: A study of informal note-taking on mobile information technologies,2009,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67949110903&doi=10.1145%2f1502800.1502804&partnerID=40&md5=6806d3ee4d992e8de2892065235b4117,"Mobile information technologies are theoretically well-suited to digitally accomodate informal note-taking, with the notes often recorded quickly and under less than ideal circumstances. Unfortunately, user adoption of mobile support for informal note-taking has been hindered in large part by slow text entry techniques. Building on research confirming people's ability to recognize erroneous text, this study explores two simple modifications to Graffiti-based text entry with the goal of increasing text entry speed: disabling text correction and disabling visual feedback. As expected, both modifications improved text entry speed at the cost of recognizability. To address the decrease in recognizability, a multiapproach text-enhancement algorithm is introduced with the goal of modifying the erroneous note to facilitate the process of recalling the event or activity that originally motivated the note. A study with 75 participants confirmed that the proposed approach of discouraging user-initiated error correction during note-taking, enhancing the resulting erroneous notes, and facilitating recall with enhanced alternative lists, increased note-taking speed by 47% with no negative impact on the participants' ability to recall important details about the scenarios which prompted the note-taking activities. This research highlighs the importance and efficacy of shifting the focus from accuracy to recallability when examining the overall efficacy of informal notes. The proposed modifications and adaptations produce significant benefits and have important implications for how mobile technologies are designed to support both informal note-taking and text entry in general. © 2009 ACM.",Informal notes; Mobile device; Recognition error; Recognition-based text entry,Information technology; Mobile devices; Object recognition; Portable equipment; Visual communication; Enhancement algorithms; Informal notes; Large parts; Mobile Technology; Negative impacts; Note-taking; Recognition error; Recognition-based text entry; Simple modifications; Text entry; Visual feedback; Error correction

Conceptually, our approach uses a set of ""meta-interfaces"" - agreements on how to exchange new behaviors necessary to achieve compatibility at runtime, rather than requiring that communication specifics be built in at development time to allow devices on the network to interact with one another. While this approach to interoperability can remove many of the system-imposed constraints that prevent fluid, ad hoc use of devices now, it imposes its own limitations on the user experience of systems that use it. Most importantly, since devices may be expected to work with peers about which they have no detailed semantic knowledge, it is impossible to achieve the sort of tight semantic integration that can be obtained using other approaches today, despite the fact that these other approaches limit interoperability. Instead, under our model, users must be tasked with performing the sense-making and semantic arbitration necessary to determine how any set of devices will be used together.

By drawing on performance (theater) theory, phenomenology and sociology and with references to recent HCI-work on the relation between the system and the performer/user and the spectator's relation to this dynamic, we show how the user is simultaneously operator, performer and spectator when interacting. By engaging with the system, she continuously acts out these three roles and her awareness of them is crucial in her experience. We argue that this 3-in-1 is always already shaping the user's understanding and perception of her interaction as it is staged through her experience of the object's form and expression. Through examples ranging from everyday technologies utilizing performances of interaction to spatial contemporary artworks, digital as well as analogue, we address the notion of the performative spectator and the spectating performer. We demonstrate how perception is also performative and how focus on this aspect seems to be crucial when designing experience-oriented products, systems and services. © 2008 ACM.",Aesthetics; Art; Experience design; Human-computer interaction; Interaction design; Performance theory,Computers; Design; Knowledge management; Programming theory; Aesthetics; Art; Experience design; Interaction design; Performance theory; Human computer interaction

But without formal models and codified methods, how can we design and evaluate for a phenomenon we aren't sure can be adequately captured In this article, we present a case study of a system for reflection and awareness of emotional presence that was, in a sense, lived into being. Through system design, use, and evaluation we recount how the system evolved into something that enhanced rather than impoverished the sympathetic awareness of another. In discussing the strategies and results of the case study, we examine what it means for the HCI community to not only design for aesthetic experiences but also bring aesthetics into the practice of HCI. © 2008 ACM.",Ambient displays; CSCW; Experience design; Human-computer interaction,Computers; Design; Display devices; Electric currents; Fourier transforms; Groupware; Knowledge management; Ambient displays; CSCW; Experience design; Formal models; System designs; Human computer interaction

Towards a theory of user judgment of aesthetics and user interface quality,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-59449103450&doi=10.1145%2f1460355.1460357&partnerID=40&md5=4bd4035d1066a5b15161814e29cd953d,"The article introduces a framework for users' design quality judgments based on Adaptive Decision Making theory. The framework describes judgment on quality attributes (usability, content/functionality, aesthetics, customisation and engagement) with dependencies on decision making arising from the user's background, task and context. The framework is tested and refined by three experimental studies. The first two assessed judgment of quality attributes of websites with similar content but radically different designs for aesthetics and engagement. Halo effects were demonstrated whereby attribution of good quality on one attribute positively influenced judgment on another, even in the face of objective evidence to the contrary (e.g., usability errors). Users' judgment was also shown to be susceptible to framing effects of the task and their background. These appear to change the importance order of the quality attributes; hence, quality assessment of a design appears to be very context dependent. The third study assessed the influence of customisation by experiments on mobile services applications, and demonstrated that evaluation of customisation depends on the users' needs and motivation. The results are discussed in the context of the literature on aesthetic judgment, user experience and trade-offs between usability and hedonic/ludic design qualities. © 2008 ACM.",Aesthetics; Interaction styles; Judgment and decision-making; Usability,Design; Programming theory; User interfaces; Aesthetics; Context dependents; Customisation; Design qualities; Experimental studies; Framing effects; Halo effects; Interaction styles; Interface qualities; Judgment and decision-making; Mobile services; Quality assessments; Quality attributes; Usability; User experiences; Decision theory

We elaborate this account through a framework for aesthetic experience built around three themes: (1) a holistic approach wherein the person with feelings, emotions, and thoughts is the focus of design; (2) a constructivist stance in which self is seen as continuously engaged and constituted in making sense of experience; and (3) a dialogical ontology in which self, others, and technology are constructed as multiple centers of value. We use this framework to critically reflect on research into the aesthetics of interaction and to suggest sensibilities for designing aesthetic interaction. Finally, a digital jewelery case study is described to demonstrate a design approach that is open to the perspectives presented in the framework and to consider how the framework and sensibilities are reflected in engagement with participants and approach to design. © 2008 ACM.",Aesthetic interaction; Digital jewelery; Experience-centered design; Wearables,Design; Knowledge management; Ontology; Aesthetic interaction; Design approaches; Digital jewelery; Experience-centered design; Holistic approaches; Human-computer interactions; Interaction designs; Wearables; Human computer interaction
Making place for clutter and other ideas of home,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47249119719&doi=10.1145%2f1375761.1375764&partnerID=40&md5=383bff44255988ec462af0b4fe483bc5,"In this article, we examine the containment of clutter in family homes and, from this, outline considerations for design. Selected materials from an ethnographically informed study of home life are used to detail the ways in which families contain their clutter in bowls and drawers. Clutter, within these containers, is found to be made up of a heterogeneous collection of things that, for all manner of reasons, hold an ambiguous status in the home. It is shown that bowls and drawers provide a safe site of containment for clutter, giving the miscellany of content the space to be properly dealt with and classified, or to be left unresolved. The shared but idiosyncratic practices families use to contain their clutter are seen to be one of the ways in which the home, or at least the idea of home, is collectively produced. It is also part of the means by which families come to make their homes distinct and unique. These findings are used to consider what it might mean to design for the home, and to do so in ways that are sensitive to the idiosyncratic systems of household organization. In conclusion, thought is given to how we design for people's ideas of home, and how we might build sites of uncertainty into homes, where physical as well as digital things might coalesce. © 2008 ACM.",Clutter; Domestic technology; Ethnography; Home life; Sacred,Home life; Clutter (information theory)

A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping. © 2008 ACM.",Design; Design space; Human-computer interaction; Prototype; Prototyping,Electric currents; Case studies; Conceptual frameworks; Design activities; Design Exploration; Design spaces; Fundamental characteristics; High Fidelity; Paper prototyping; Prototyping; Systematic (CO); Two dimensions; Wave filters

We discuss the results of an evaluation of the design method to verify its usability, usefulness and effectiveness vis - vis other design methods proposed in the HCI literature to address similar issues. Results suggest that different design methods for privacy highlight different sets of issues and a combination of methods should be employed in a comprehensive design process. We propose to judge design methods based on their overall quantitative and qualitative merits, including the type of application and technology for which they are most fit and their methodological approach. We finally propose to develop a privacy toolbox, that is, a set of heuristic methods that designers can choose from with knowledge and understanding of their relative advantages and limitations. © 2008 ACM.",Design methods; Privacy; Proportionality; Requirements analysis; Risk analysis; Social issues; Ubiquitous computing,Electric currents; Process design; Process engineering; Balance (weighting); Comprehensive designs; Data protection; Design methods; HCI practitioners; IT applications; Heuristic methods

While many cognitive, cultural, and social reasons have been offered to explain this phenomenon, there have been few systematic attempts to address it. This article describes how we identified a framework to organize effective and efficient strategies to use computer applications and used an approach called strategy-based instruction to teach those strategies over five years to almost 400 students. Controlled experiments demonstrated that the instructional approach (1) enables students to learn strategies without harming command knowledge, (2) benefits students from technical and nontechnical majors, and (3) is robust across different instructional contexts and new applications. Real-world classroom experience of teaching strategy-based instruction over several instantiations has enabled the approach to be disseminated to other universities. The lessons learned throughout the process of design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination should allow teaching a large number of users in many organizations to rapidly acquire the strategic knowledge to make more effective and efficient use of computer applications. © 2008 ACM.",Strategies; Strategy-based instruction; Teaching; Training,Learning systems; Spreadsheets; Students; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Strategic knowledge; Strategy-based instruction; Web-authoring tools; Teaching

The emphasis on aspects of cognition was informed by a modeling framework of search engine information-seeking behavior. Participants from two older age groups were recruited: twenty people in a younger-old group (ages 60-70) and twenty people in an older-old group (ages 71-85). Ten younger adults (ages 18-39) served as a comparison group. All participants had at least some Internet search experience. The experimental task consisted of six realistic search problems, all involving information related to health and well-being and which varied in degree of complexity. The results indicated that though necessary, Internet-related knowledge was not sufficient in explaining information-seeking performance, and suggested that a combination of both knowledge and key cognitive abilities is important for successful information seeking. In addition, the cognitive abilities that were found to be critical for task performance depended on the search problem's complexity. Also, significant differences in task performance between the younger and the two older age groups were found on complex, but not on simple problems. Overall, the results from this study have implications for instructing older adults on Internet information seeking and for the design of Web sites. © 2008 ACM.",Health information seeking; Human-computer interaction; Internet; Mental models; Older adults; Pathfinder networks; Search engines,Cognitive systems; Internet; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Search engines; Health information seeking; Mental models; Older adults; Pathfinder networks; Human computer interaction

Therefore, individual differences are key factors for the development of WBI programs. Among various dimensions of individual differences, the study presented in this article focuses on cognitive styles. More specifically, this study investigates how cognitive styles affect students' learning patterns in a WBI program with an integrated approach, utilizing both traditional statistical and data-mining techniques. The former are applied to determine whether cognitive styles significantly affected students' learning patterns. The latter use clustering and classification methods. In terms of clustering, the K-means algorithm has been employed to produce groups of students that share similar learning patterns, and subsequently the corresponding cognitive style for each group is identified. As far as classification is concerned, the students' learning patterns are analyzed using a decision tree with which eight rules are produced for the automatic identification of students' cognitive styles based on their learning patterns. The results from these techniques appear to be consistent and the overall findings suggest that cognitive styles have important effects on students' learning patterns within WBI. The findings are applied to develop a model that can support the development of WBI programs. © 2008 ACM.",Cognitive style; Data mining; Learning patterns; Web-based instruction,Cognitive systems; Data mining; Statistical methods; Students; World Wide Web; Cognitive style; Learning patterns; WBI programs; Web-based instruction (WBI); Learning systems

Comparing usability of one-way and multi-way constraints for diagram editing,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749086463&doi=10.1145%2f1314683.1314687&partnerID=40&md5=8fdc1c225648b20f19171e2cc6e41845,"We investigate the usability of constraint-based alignment and distribution placement tools in diagram editors. Currently one-way constraints are used to provide alignment and distribution tools in many commercial editors. We believe the limitations of these constraints lead to serious usability issues, and thus suggest that such tools be implemented using multi-way constraints. We have conducted two usability studies, the first studies we are aware of that examine the relative usefulness of interactive graphical tools based on one-way and multi-way constraints. They provide strong evidence that multi-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools are more usable than one-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools. © 2008 ACM.",Constraints; Diagram manipulation; Layout tools,Computer graphics; File editors; Diagram manipulation; Layout tools; Constraint theory

However, opportunities for interaction are unevenly distributed among the attendees. We seek to extend the opportunities for interaction among attendees by using technology to enable them to reveal information about their background and interests in different settings. We evaluate a suite of applications that augment three physical social spaces at an academic conference. The applications were designed to augment formal conference paper sessions and informal breaks. A mixture of qualitative observation and survey response data are used to frame the impacts from both individual and group perspectives. Respondents reported on their interactions and serendipitous findings of shared interests with other attendees. However, some respondents also identify distracting aspects of the augmentation. Our discussion relates these results to existing theory of group behavior in public places and how these social space augmentations relate to awareness as well as the problem of shared interaction models. © 2008 ACM.",Augmented social spaces; Awareness; Evaluation; Proactive display,Mathematical models; Problem solving; Social aspects; Technology transfer; Augmented social spaces; Proactive display; Technical presentations
Understanding changes in mental workload during execution of goal-directed tasks and its application for interruption management,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749142911&doi=10.1145%2f1314683.1314689&partnerID=40&md5=7474dfc637341bc0dd56ff7ea19e0e7c,"Notifications can have reduced interruption cost if delivered at moments of lower mental workload during task execution. Cognitive theorists have speculated that these moments occur at subtask boundaries. In this article, we empirically test this speculation by examining how workload changes during execution of goal-directed tasks, focusing on regions between adjacent chunks within the tasks, that is, the subtask boundaries. In a controlled experiment, users performed several interactive tasks while their pupil dilation, a reliable measure of workload, was continuously measured using an eye tracking system. The workload data was extracted from the pupil data, precisely aligned to the corresponding task models, and analyzed. Our principal findings include (i) workload changes throughout the execution of goal-directed tasks; (ii) workload exhibits transient decreases at subtask boundaries relative to the preceding subtasks; (iii) the amount of decrease tends to be greater at boundaries corresponding to the completion of larger chunks of the task; and (iv) different types of subtasks induce different amounts of workload. We situate these findings within resource theories of attention and discuss important implications for interruption management systems. © 2008 ACM.",Attention; Interruption; Pupil size; Task models; User studies; Workload,Cognitive systems; Job analysis; Management information systems; Cognitive theorists; Task models; User studies; Human computer interaction
"Subjunctive interfaces: Extending applications to support parallel setup, viewing and control of alternative scenarios",2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749094828&doi=10.1145%2f1314683.1314685&partnerID=40&md5=573eeb452f61c3a28a59d3243124fcbb,"Many applications require exploration of alternative scenarios; most support it poorly. Subjunctive interfaces provide mechanisms for the parallel setup, viewing and control of scenarios, aiming to support users' thinking about and interaction with their choices. We illustrate how applications for information access, real-time simulation, and document design may be extended with these mechanisms. To investigate the usability of this form of extension, we compare a simple census browser against a version with a subjunctive interface. In the first of three studies, subjects reported higher satisfaction with the subjunctive interface, and relied less on interim marks on paper. No reduction in task completion time was found, however, mainly because some subjects encountered problems in setting up and controlling scenarios. At the end of a second, five-session study, users of a redesigned interface completed tasks 27% more quickly than with the simple interface. In the third study we examined how subjects reasoned about multiple-scenario setups in pursuing complex, open-ended data explorations. Our main observation was that subjects treated scenarios as information holders, using them creatively in various ways to facilitate task completion. © 2008 ACM.",Information exploration; Multiple views; Subjunctive interfaces; User study,Data reduction; Information analysis; Information systems; Parallel processing systems; Information exploration; Multiple views; Subjunctive interfaces; User study; Interfaces (computer)
Papiercraft: A gesture-based command system for interactive paper,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749122071&doi=10.1145%2f1314683.1314686&partnerID=40&md5=2b57f15bb2fc0576a26708682a67dc0c,"Paper persists as an integral component of active reading and other knowledge-worker tasks because it provides ease of use unmatched by digital alternatives. Paper documents are light to carry, easy to annotate, rapid to navigate, flexible to manipulate, and robust to use in varied environments. Interactions with paper documents create rich webs of annotation, cross reference, and spatial organization. Unfortunately, the resulting webs are confined to the physical world of paper and, as they accumulate, become increasingly difficult to store, search, and access. XLibris [Schilit et al. 1998] and similar systems address these difficulties by simulating paper with tablet PCs. While this approach is promising, it suffers not only from limitations of current tablet computers (e.g., limited screen space) but also from loss of invaluable paper affordances. In this article, we describe PapierCraft, a gesture-based command system that allows users to manipulate digital documents using paper printouts as proxies. Using an Anoto [Anoto 2002] digital pen, users can draw command gestures on paper to tag a paragraph, e-mail a selected area, copy selections to a notepad, or create links to related documents. Upon pen synchronization, PapierCraft executes the commands and presents the results in a digital document viewer. Users can then search the tagged information and navigate the web of annotated digital documents resulting from interactions with the paper proxies. PapierCraft also supports real time interactions across mix-media, for example, letting users copy information from paper to a Tablet PC screen. This article presents the design and implementation of the PapierCraft system and describes user feedback from initial use. © 2008 ACM.",Distributed systems; Gesture-based interfaces; Marking interfaces; Paper interfaces; Paper-augmented digital documents; Tablet computers; Ubiquitous computing,Interfaces (computer); Personal computers; Program documentation; Ubiquitous computing; Marking interfaces; Paper interfaces; Paper-augmented digital documents; Tablet computers; Distributed computer systems
Metaphors of human thinking for usability inspection and design,2008,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38749113354&doi=10.1145%2f1314683.1314688&partnerID=40&md5=47fac586e393cae16f8d669c34f2aacd,"Usability inspection techniques are widely used, but few focus on users' thinking and many are appropriate only for particular devices and use contexts. We present a new technique (MOT) that guides inspection by metaphors of human thinking. The metaphors concern habit, the stream of thought, awareness and associations, the relation between utterances and thought, and knowing. The main novelty of MOT is its psychological basis combined with its use of metaphors to stimulate inspection. The first of three experiments shows that usability problems uncovered with MOT are more serious and more complex to repair than problems found with heuristic evaluation. Problems found with MOT are also judged more likely to persist for expert users. The second experiment shows that MOT finds more problems than cognitive walkthrough, and has a wider coverage of a reference collection of usability problems. Participants prefer using MOT over cognitive walkthrough; an important reason being the wider scope of MOT. The third experiment compares MOT, cognitive walkthrough, and think aloud testing, in the context of nontraditional user interfaces. Participants prefer using think aloud testing, but identify few problems with that technique that are not found also with MOT or cognitive walkthrough. MOT identifies more problems than the other techniques. Across experiments and measures of usability problems' utility in systems design, MOT performs better than existing inspection techniques and is comparable to think aloud testing. © 2008 ACM.",Cognitive walkthrough; Heuristic evaluation; Metaphors of human thinking; Think aloud testing; Usability evaluation; Usability inspection,Computer aided design; Problem solving; Psychology computing; User interfaces; Cognitive walkthrough; Heuristic evaluation; Usability evaluation; Usability inspection; Human computer interaction

"Constructing reality: A study of remote, hands-on, and simulated laboratories",2007,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548393100&doi=10.1145%2f1275511.1275513&partnerID=40&md5=3bc558585ffba1e17aaeb766ff13d86b,"Laboratories play a crucial role in the education of future scientists and engineers, yet there is disagreement among science and engineering educators about whether and which types of technology-enabled labs should be used. This debate could be advanced by large-scale randomized studies addressing the critical issue of whether remotely operated or simulation-based labs are as effective as the traditional hands-on lab format. The present article describes the results of a large-scale (N = 306) study comparing learning outcomes and student preferences for several different lab formats in an undergraduate engineering course. The lab formats that were evaluated included traditional hands-on labs, remotely operated labs, and simulations. Learning outcomes were assessed by a test of the specific concepts taught in each lab. These knowledge scores were as high or higher (depending on topic) after performing remote and simulated laboratories versus performing hands-on laboratories. In their responses to survey items, many students saw advantages to technology-enabled lab formats in terms of such attributes as convenience and reliability, but still expressed preference for hands-on labs. Also, differences in lab formats led to changes in group functions across the plan-experiment-analyze process: For example, students did less face-to-face work when engaged in remote or simulated laboratories, as opposed to hands-on laboratories. © 2007 ACM.",Coordination; Distance learning; Experimentation; Remote laboratories; Simulation; Tele-operation,Computer simulation; Distance education; Engineering education; Engineers; Knowledge engineering; Experimentation; Remote laboratories; Tele-operation; Laboratories
Web accessibility for individuals with cognitive deficits: A comparative study between an existing commercial Web and its cognitively accessible equivalent,2007,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34948871572&doi=10.1145%2f1279700.1279702&partnerID=40&md5=5a19de6d637490fff1d31642c99b9b5c,"Tim Berners-Lee claimed in 2001 that the power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. A considerable amount of work has been done to make the web accessible to those with sensory or motor disability, with an increasing number of government and enterprise intranet webs being accessible, and also with some consortiums and groups seriously approaching this commitment. Some authors, such as Harrysson, have already highlighted the need for a cognitively accessible web. However, in spite of good intentions, there has been little work to date that has tackled this task. At least until now, the existing WAI and NI4 recommendations about cognitive disability are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to test, as they are only general recommendations. This article explains an alternative Web that has been constructed and tested on a sample of participants with cognitive disabilities (N = 20) with positive results encouraging us to dedicate more effort to fine tune their requirements regarding specific cognitive deficits and automating the process of creating and testing cognitively accessible web content. This alternative web implies the use of a simplified web browser and an adequate web design. Discussion of the need to have several levels of cognitive accessibility, equivalent (although not identical) content for this collective and the need for testable protocols of accessibility that support these people's needs is also included. This article finishes with conclusions about the potential impact of accessible pages in the daily life of people suffering from cognitive deficits, outlining the features to be considered within a user profile specification that support cognitive difficulties and with reflections about the suitability of Semantic Web Technologies for future developments in this field.",Accessibility; Annotation; Cognitive disabilities; Complex socio-technical systems; Design for all; Ontology; Self-determination; TEACCH; Universal design; Visualization ontology; Wrapper,Cognitive systems; Intranets; Ontology; User interfaces; Accessibility; Annotation; Cognitive disabilities; Complex socio-technical systems; Design for all; Self-determination; TEACCH; Universal design; Visualization ontology; Wrappers; World Wide Web

While many studies have applied the TAM, none has examined the model's behavior over its entire value range. We conducted two surveys to examine the values of BI over the two-dimensional boundary space formed by PU and PEOU. Contrary to current understanding, we find that the effects of PU and PEOU vary over the boundary space. © 2007 ACM.",Behavioral intention; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance model,Boundary conditions; Mathematical models; Two dimensional; Behavioral intention; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance models (TAM); Information systems
Untangling the usability of fisheye menus,2007,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548444971&doi=10.1145%2f1275511.1275512&partnerID=40&md5=68a1decf4fcab2e05fac00a2b5c1b140,"Fisheye menus have become a prominent example of fisheye interfaces, yet contain several nonfisheye elements and have not been systematically evaluated. This study investigates whether fisheye menus are useful, and tries to untangle the impact on usability of the following properties of fisheye menus: use of distortion, index of letters for coarse navigation, and the focus-lock mode for accurate movement. Twelve participants took part in an experiment comparing fisheye menus with three alternative menu designs across known-item and browsing tasks, as well as across alphabetical and categorical menu structures. The results show that for finding known items, conventional hierarchical menus are the most accurate and by far the fastest. In addition, participants rate the hierarchical menu as more satisfying than fisheye and multifocus menus, but do not consistently prefer any one menu. For browsing tasks, the menus neither differ with respect to accuracy nor selection time. Eye-movement data show that participants make little use of nonfocus regions of the fisheye menu, though these are a defining feature of fisheye interfaces. Nonfocus regions are used more with the multifocus menu, which enlarges important menu items in these regions. With the hierarchical menu, participants make shorter fixations and have shorter scanpaths, suggesting lower requirements for mental activity and visual search. We conclude by discussing why fisheye menus are inferior to the hierarchical menu and how both may be improved. © 2007 ACM.",Fisheye menus; Focus+context interfaces; Hierarchical menus; Information visualization; Menu selection,Human computer interaction; Information systems; Visualization; Web browsers; Context interfaces; Fisheye menus; Hierarchical menus; Information visualization; Menu selection; Usability engineering

However, the dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages.",Evaluation; Semantic Web; Transcoding; Travel; Visual impairment,Encoding (symbols); Information dissemination; Problem solving; Semantic Web; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Semantic transcoding; Visual design; Visual impairment; Visually disabled users; Handicapped persons

These approaches use various metrics to measure the Web's accessibility. Ease of navigation (navigability) is one of the crucial factors for blind usability, especially for complicated webpages used in portals and online shopping sites. However, it is difficult for automatic checking tools to evaluate the navigation capabilities even for a single webpage. Navigability issues for complete Web applications are still far beyond their capabilities. This study aims at obtaining quantitative results about the current accessibility status of real world Web applications, and analyzes real users' behavior on such websites. In Study 1, an automatic analysis method for webpage navigability is introduced, and then a broad survey using this method for 30 international online shopping sites is described. The next study (Study 2) focuses on a fine-grained analysis of real users' behavior on some of these online shopping sites. We modified a voice browser to record each user's actions and the information presented to that user. We conducted user testing on existing sites with this tool. We also developed an analysis and visualization method for the recorded information. The results showed us that users strongly depend on scanning navigation instead of logical navigation. A landmark-oriented navigation model was proposed based on the results. Finally, we discuss future possibilities for improving navigability, including proposals for voice browsers.",Accessibility; Online shopping; Usability testing; Voice browsers; Web accessibility,Computer aided software engineering; Online systems; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Accessibility; Online shopping; Voice browsers; Web accessibility; Websites

They can be used for many purposes, from teleconferencing to training people to perform assembly tasks. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of CVEs is compromised by one major problem: the delay that exists in the networks linking users together. Whilst we have a good understanding, especially in the visual modality, of how users are affected by delayed feedback from their own actions, little research has systematically examined how users are affected by delayed feedback from other people, particularly in environments that support haptic (force) feedback. The current study addresses this issue by quantifying how increasing levels of latency affect visual and haptic feedback in a collaborative target acquisition task. Our results demonstrate that haptic feedback in particular is very sensitive to low levels of delay. Whilst latency affects visual feedback from 50 ms, it impacts on haptic task performance 25 ms earlier, and causes the haptic measures of performance deterioration to rise far more steeply than visual. The ""impact-perceive-adapt"" model of user performance, which considers the interaction between performance measures, perception of latency, and the breakdown of perception of immediate causality, is proposed as an explanation for the observed pattern of performance. © 2007 ACM.",Distributed collaboration; Haptics; Latency; Virtual environments,Deterioration; Feedback; Haptic interfaces; Problem solving; Teleconferencing; Distributed collaboration; Haptics; Latency; Visual modality; Virtual reality

A visually impaired user's information and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user's. These requirements can become problems in that the web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order/layout. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to alleviate these problems. Our approach can be loosely described as follows. For a particular cascading stylesheet (CSS), we provide an extension to an upper-level ontology which represents the interface between web documents and the programmatic transformation mechanism. This extension gives the particular characteristics of the elements appearing in that specific CSS. We can consider this extension to be an annotation of the CSS elements implicitly encoded into the web document. This means that one ontology can be used to accuratly transform every web document that references the CSS used to generate that ontology. Simply one ontology accuratly transforms an entire site using a generalized programmatic machinery able to cope with all sites using CSS. Here we describe our method, implementation, and technical evaluation. © 2007 ACM.",Semantic web; Transcoding; Visual impairment; Web accessibility,Human computer interaction; Ontology; Semantic Web; User interfaces; Cascading stylesheet (CSS); Electronic information; Transcoding; Visual impairment; Web accessibility; Semantics

Contact negotiation is especially problematic for distributed group members who are separated by distance and thus do not share many of the cues needed to help mediate interaction. An understanding of what resources and cues people use to negotiate making contact when face-to-face identifies ways to design support for contact negotiation in new technology to support remote collaboration. This perspective is used to analyze the design and use experiences with three communication prototypes: Desktop Conferencing Prototype, Montage, and Awarenex. These prototypes use text, video, and graphic indicators to share the cues needed to gracefully start and end conversations. Experiences with using these prototypes focused on how these designs support the interactional commitment of the participants - -when they have to commit their attention to an interaction and how flexibly that can be negotiated. Reviewing what we learned from these research experiences identifies directions for future research in supporting contact negotiation in computer-mediated communication. © 2007 ACM.",Awareness; Computer-mediated communication; Human-computer interaction; Instant messaging; Interaction design; User research,Data communication systems; Distributed computer systems; Research and development management; Resource allocation; Software prototyping; Computer-mediated communication; Instant messaging; Interaction design; User research; Human computer interaction

The design allows the user to easily customize a personalized interface, and also supports quick access to the default interface with all of the standard features. This design was prototyped as a front-end to a commercial word processor. A field experiment investigated users' personalizing behavior and tested the effects of different interface designs on users' satisfaction and their perceived ability to navigate, control, and learn the software. There were two conditions: a commercial word processor with adaptive menus and our prototype with adaptable menus for the same word processor. Our evaluation shows: (1) when provided with a flexible, easy-to-use and easy-to-understand customization mechanism, the majority of users do effectively personalize their interface; and (2) user-controlled interface adaptation with our adaptable menus results in better navigation and learnability, and allows for the adoption of different personalization strategies, as compared to a particular system-controlled adaptive menu system that implements a single strategy.

Practical implications and a framework for measurement are presented. © 2007 ACM.",Human-computer interaction; Interaction mechanism; Likert scale; Online questionnaires; Psychometrics; Questionnaire layout; Response format; Screen design; Visual analogue scale; Web site,Computer aided design; Computer systems; Human computer interaction; Parameter estimation; Interaction mechanism; Likert scale; Online questionnaires; Questionnaire layout; Websites

We present an empirical study of user performance on five simple tasks of menu traversal on an example cell phone. Two of the models applied to these tasks, based on GOMS and ACT-R, give good predictions of behavior. We use the empirically supported models to create an effective evaluation and improvement process for menu hierarchies. Our work makes three main contributions: a novel and timely study of a new, very common HCI task; new versions of existing models for accurately predicting performance; and a search procedure to generate menu hierarchies that reduce traversal time, in simulation studies, by about a third. © 2007 ACM.",,Hierarchical systems; Man machine systems; Mathematical models; Mobile phones; Optimization; Cell phone menu interaction; Easy-to-use optimization techniques; Cognitive systems
The reification of metaphor as a design tool,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845993641&doi=10.1145%2f1188816.1188820&partnerID=40&md5=874dc0aad4c18d7413646f8669c907ac,"Despite causing many debates in human-computer interaction (HCI), the term metaphor remains a central element of design practice. This article investigates the history of ideas behind user-interface (UI) metaphor, not only technical developments, but also less familiar perspectives from education, philosophy, and the sociology of science. The historical analysis is complemented by a study of attitudes toward metaphor among HCI researchers 30 years later. Working from these two streams of evidence, we find new insights into the way that theories in HCI are related to interface design, and offer recommendations regarding approaches to future UI design research. © 2006 ACM.",Design research; History of HCI; UI metaphor,Computer aided software engineering; Education; History; Human computer interaction; Social sciences; User interfaces; Attitudes; Design research; Historical analysis; Metaphors; Computer aided design
Navigating on handheld displays: Dynamic versus static peephole navigation,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846015881&doi=10.1145%2f1188816.1188818&partnerID=40&md5=1108f0b7891fc69441f3d9ecf7d25b04,"Handheld displays leave little space for the visualization and navigation of spatial layouts representing rich information spaces. The most common navigation method for handheld displays is static peephole navigation: The peephole is static and we move the spatial layout behind it (scrolling). A more natural method is dynamic peephole navigation: here, the spatial layout is static and we move the peephole across it. In the experiment reported here, we compared dynamic and static peephole navigation in otherwise similar conditions. Subjects viewed a spatial layout containing two lines on a static display screen. Only a part of the screen - -the peephole - -was visible. Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic peephole across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static peephole. In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the peephole or the lines.Results show significant differences in discrimination performance between conditions when lines are larger than the size of the peephole. Discrimination thresholds for static peephole navigation were 50 - 75% higher than for dynamic peephole navigation. Furthermore, static peephole navigation took 24% more time than dynamic peephole navigation. © 2006 ACM.",Handheld displays; Human-computer interaction; Navigation; Visual perception,Display devices; Human computer interaction; Navigation systems; Vision; Discrimination thresholds; Handheld displays; Static peephole navigation; Visual perception; Hand held computers
Chatting with teenagers: Considering the place of chat technologies in teen life,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846019288&doi=10.1145%2f1188816.1188817&partnerID=40&md5=1e53dc06e00b647e68bbc867bfc9b84f,"In the last few years, teenagers have been on the forefront of adopting short message service (SMS), a mobile phone-based text messaging system, and instant messaging (IM), a computer-based text chat system. However, while teenage adoption of SMS had led to a series of studies examining the reasons for its popularity, IM use in the teenage population remains understudied. This omission becomes significant given the increasing interest in domestic computing among human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) researchers. Further, because of the dearth of empirical work on teenage use of IM, we find that IM and SMS are sometimes incorrectly assumed to share the same features of use. To address these concerns, we revisit our own studies of SMS and IM use and reexamine them in tandem with other published studies on teenage chat. We consider similarities and differences in styles of SMS and IM use and how chat technologies enable the pursuit of teenage independence. We examine how differences are born out of technological differences and financial cost structures. We discuss how SMS and IM are used in concert to provide increased awareness and to coordinate inter-household communications, and how privacy is regulated within the individual household as a means of maintaining these communications. © 2006 ACM.",IMing; Instant messaging; Text messaging; Texting,Computer supported cooperative work; Costs; Human computer interaction; Mobile telecommunication systems; Instant messaging (IM); Short message service (SMS); Technological differences; Text messaging; Telecommunication services
Analyzing the input stream for character- level errors in unconstrained text entry evaluations,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846003162&doi=10.1145%2f1188816.1188819&partnerID=40&md5=a57ecdc5f844b5505d737c61331761d1,"Recent improvements in text entry error rate measurement have enabled the running of text entry experiments in which subjects are free to correct errors (or not) as they transcribe a presented string. In these unconstrained experiments, it is no longer necessary to force subjects to unnaturally maintain synchronicity with presented text for the sake of performing overall error rate calculations. However, the calculation of character-level error rates, which can be trivial in artificially constrained evaluations, is far more complicated in unconstrained text entry evaluations because it is difficult to infer a subject's intention at every character. For this reason, prior character-level error analyses for unconstrained experiments have only compared presented and transcribed strings, not input streams. But input streams are rich sources of character-level error information, since they contain all of the text entered (and erased) by a subject. The current work presents an algorithm for the automated analysis of character-level errors in input streams for unconstrained text entry evaluations. It also presents new character-level metrics that can aid method designers in refining text entry methods. To exercise these metrics, we perform two analyses on data from an actual text entry experiment. One analysis, available from the prior work, uses only presented and transcribed strings. The other analysis uses input streams, as described in the current work. The results confirm that input stream error analysis yields richer information for the same empirical data. To facilitate the use of these new analyses, we offer pseudocode and downloadable software for performing unconstrained text entry experiments and analyzing data. © 2006 ACM.",Character recognition; Confusion matrix; Deletion; EdgeWrite; Error rate; Gesture; Input stream; Insertion; Minimum string distance; Nonrecognition; Omission; Optimal alignment; Presented string; Recognizer; Stream alignment; Stroke; Substitution; Text entry,Computer software; Constraint theory; Data reduction; Error analysis; Synchronization; Text processing; Confusion matrix; EdgeWrite; Error rate; Input stream; Text entry; Character recognition
Transparent adaptation of single-user applications for multi-user real-time collaboration,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846025813&doi=10.1145%2f1188816.1188821&partnerID=40&md5=33e33879ed8b89fd090b4b4a92801326,"Single-user interactive computer applications are pervasive in our daily lives and work. Leveraging single-user applications for supporting multi-user collaboration has the potential to significantly increase the availability and improve the usability of collaborative applications. In this article, we report an innovative Transparent Adaptation (TA) approach and associated supporting techniques that can be used to convert existing and new single-user applications into collaborative ones, without changing the source code of the original application. The cornerstone of the TA approach is the operational transformation (OT) technique and the method of adapting the single-user application programming interface to the data and operation models of OT. This approach and supporting techniques were developed and tested in the process of transparently converting two commercial off-the-shelf single-user applications (Microsoft Word and PowerPoint) into real-time collaborative applications, called CoWord and CoPowerPoint, respectively. CoWord and CoPowerPoint not only retain the functionalities and look-and-feel of their single-user counterparts, but also provide advanced multi-user collaboration capabilities for supporting multiple interaction paradigms, ranging from concurrent and free interaction to sequential and synchronized interaction, and for supporting detailed workspace awareness, including multi-user telepointers and radar views. The TA approach and generic collaboration engine software component developed from this work are potentially applicable and reusable in adapting a wide range of single-user applications. © 2006 ACM.",Application sharing; Computer-supported cooperative work; CoPowerPoint; CoWord; Operational transformation; Transparent adaptation,Computer software reusability; Computer supported cooperative work; Data processing; Human computer interaction; Mathematical models; Mathematical transformations; Real time systems; User interfaces; Application sharing; CoPowerPoint; CoWord; Operational transformation (OT); Transparent adaptation (TA); Interactive computer systems
Leveraging data complexity: Pupillary behavior of older adults with visual impairment during HCI,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845402350&doi=10.1145%2f1183456.1183460&partnerID=40&md5=53f09ff860faed79d334b4fb68eb76c9,"The current ubiquity of information technology has increased variability among users, creating a corresponding need to properly capture and understand these individual differences. This study introduces a novel application of multifractal statistical methods to distinguish users via patterns of variability within high frequency pupillary response behavior (PRB) data collected during computer-based interaction. PRB was measured from older adults, including two groups diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) maintaining a range of visual acuities (n = 14), and one visually healthy control group (i.e., disease-free, 20/20 - 20/32 acuity) (n = 14). Three measures of the multifractal spectrum, the distribution of regularity indices extracted from time series data, distinguished the user groups, including: 1) Spectral Mode; 2) Broadness; and 3) Left Slope. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between the values of these measures and the level of visual capabilities. These analytical techniques leverage the inherent complexity and richness of this high frequency physiological response data, which can be used to meaningfully differentiate individuals whose sensory and cognitive capabilities may be affected by aging and visual impairment. Multifractality analysis provides an objective, quantifiable means of uncovering and examining the underlying signatures in physiological behavior that may account for individual differences in interaction needs and behaviors. © 2006 ACM.",Age-related macular degeneration; Aging; Eyetracking; Human-computer interaction; Multifractality; Older adults; Physiological signals; Pupil diameter; Visual impairment; Wavelets,Cognitive systems; Computational complexity; Interfaces (computer); Statistical methods; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Age-related macular degeneration; Eyetracking; Physiological signals; Pupil diameter; Visual impairment; Wavelets; Information technology

The main goal of this study was to establish a better understanding of similarities and differences in the ways of interacting among the participants of these two newsgroups. A series of analytical/statistical techniques, like Social Network Analysis (SNA), were used in order to get a better understanding of the online communities that have emerged around the participants of these two newsgroups. The SNA analysis showed that the teens newsgroup is more highly connected, has more messages sent and received and has a higher reciprocity. On the other hand, the senior newsgroup has more central dominant people who tend to make the rest of the network dependent on them for communication. © 2006 ACM.",Aging; Human-computer interaction; Online communities; Social network analysis,Human computer interaction; Mathematical models; Social aspects; Statistical methods; Aging; Online communities; Social network analysis; Online systems

Most previous work in this area involves software enabling younger family members to monitor their parents. We have found, however, that older adults are equally if not more interested in the activities of younger family members. The major obstacle preventing them from participating in information sharing is the technology itself. Therefore, we developed a multi-layered interface approach that offers simple interaction to older users. In our system, users can choose to enter information into a computerized calendar or write it by hand on digital paper calendars. All of the information is automatically shared among everyone in the distributed family. By making the interface more accessible to older users, we promote symmetrical sharing of information among both older and younger family members. We present our participatory design process, describe the user interface, and report on an exploratory field study in three households of an extended family. © 2006 ACM.",Calendar; Digital paper; Elderly; Family technology; Home; Layered interface; Privacy; Universal usability,Computer software; Data privacy; Electronic publishing; Information dissemination; Information retrieval; Systems analysis; User interfaces; Calendar; Computerized calendar; Digital paper; Home; Layered interface; Management information systems

We present an ethnographic study of the game as it toured through two different cities and draws upon video recordings of online players, runners, technical support crew, and also on system logs of text communication. Our study reveals the diverse ways in which online players experienced the uncertainties inherent in GPS and WiFi, including being mostly unaware of them, but sometimes seeing them as problems, or treating the as a designed feature of the game, and even occasionally exploiting them within gameplay. In contrast, the runners and technical crew were fully aware of these uncertainties and continually battled against them through an ongoing and distributed process of orchestration. As a result, we encourage designers to deal with such uncertainties as a fundamental characteristic of location-based experiences rather than treating them as exceptions or bugs that might be ironed out in the future. We argue that designers should explicitly consider four potential states of being of a mobile participant: connected and tracked, connected but not tracked, tracked but not connected, and neither connected nor tracked. We then introduce five strategies that might be used to deal with uncertainty in these different states for different kinds of participant: remove it, hide it, manage it, reveal it, and exploit it. Finally, we present proposals for new orchestration interfaces that reveal the 'seams' in the underlying technical infrastructure by visualizing the recent performance of GPS and WiFi and predicting the likely future performance of GPS. © 2006 ACM.",Ethnography; GPS; Mobile and wireless games; Orchestration,Global positioning system; Human computer interaction; Mobile telecommunication systems; Online systems; Uncertain systems; Video recording; Virtual reality; Ethnography; Mobile and wireless games; Orchestration; Technical infrastructure; Game theory

Queueing networks are particularly suited for modeling parallel activities and complex structures. Symbolic models have particular strength in generating a person's actions in specific task situations. By integrating the two approaches, QN-MHP offers an architecture for mathematical modeling and real-time generation of concurrent activities in a truly concurrent manner. QN-MHP expands the three discrete serial stages of MHP, of perceptual, cognitive, and motor processing, into three continuous-transmission subnetworks of servers, each performing distinct psychological functions specified with a GOMS-style language. Multitask performance emerges as the behavior of multiple streams of information flowing through a network, with no need to devise complex, task-specific procedures to either interleave production rules into a serial program (ACTR), or for an executive process to interactively control task processes (EPIC). Using QN-MHP, a driver performance model was created and interfaced with a driving simulator to perform a vehicle steering, and a map reading task concurrently and in real time. The performance data of the model are similar to human subjects performing the same tasks. © 2006 ACM.",Cognition; Cognitive model; Human information processing; Human-computer interaction; User interfaces,Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Queueing networks; User interfaces; Cognition; Cognitive model; Control task processes (EPIC); Human information processing; Human computer interaction

Physically large displays improve performance on spatial tasks,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33746103238&doi=10.1145%2f1143518.1143521&partnerID=40&md5=c5676c79d987414b7de32dffe0bc2719,"Large wall-sized displays are becoming prevalent. Although researchers have articulated qualitative benefits of group work on large displays, little work has been done to quantify the benefits for individual users. In this article we present four experiments comparing the performance of users working on a large projected wall display to that of users working on a standard desktop monitor. In these experiments, we held the visual angle constant by adjusting the viewing distance to each of the displays. Results from the first two experiments suggest that physically large displays, even when viewed at identical visual angles as smaller ones, help users perform better on mental rotation tasks. We show through the experiments how these results may be attributed, at least in part, to large displays immersing users within the problem space and biasing them into using more efficient cognitive strategies. In the latter two experiments, we extend these results, showing the presence of these effects with more complex tasks, such as 3D navigation and mental map formation and memory. Results further show that the effects of physical display size are independent of other factors that may induce immersion, such as interactivity and mental aids within the virtual environments. We conclude with a general discussion of the findings and possibilities for future work. © 2006 ACM.",3D navigation; Field of view; Human memory; Immersion; Large display; Mental map formation; Presence; Spatial task; Visual angle,Cognitive systems; Navigation; Personal computers; Virtual reality; 3D navigation; Field of view; Human memory; Immersion; Large display; Mental map formation; Presence; Spatial task; Visual angle; Display devices
Zooming versus multiple window interfaces: Cognitive costs of visual comparisons,2006,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33749602671&doi=10.1145%2f1165734.1165736&partnerID=40&md5=d226bbe7226d2c8a07c9ce5d59fc39c0,"In order to investigate large information spaces effectively, it is often necessary to employ navigation mechanisms that allow users to view information at different scales. Some tasks require frequent movements and scale changes to search for details and compare them. We present a model that makes predictions about user performance on such comparison tasks with different interface options. A critical factor embodied in this model is the limited capacity of visual working memory, allowing for the cost of visits via fixating eye movements to be compared to the cost of visits that require user interaction with the mouse. This model is tested with an experiment that compares a zooming user interface with a multi-window interface for a multiscale pattern matching task. The results closely matched predictions in task performance times; however error rates were much higher with zooming than with multiple windows. We hypothesized that subjects made more visits in the multi-window condition, and ran a second experiment using an eye tracker to record the pattern of fixations. This revealed that subjects made far more visits back and forth between pattern locations when able to use eye movements than they made with the zooming interface. The results suggest that only a single graphical object was held in visual working memory for comparisons mediated by eye movements, reducing errors by reducing the load on visual working memory. Finally we propose a design heuristic: extra windows are needed when visual comparisons must be made involving patterns of a greater complexity than can be held in visual working memory. © 2006 ACM.",Focus-in-context; Interaction design; Multiple windows; Multiscale; Multiscale comparison; Visual working memory; Zooming,Cognitive systems; Computational complexity; Heuristic methods; Information dissemination; Focus in context; Interaction design; Multiple windows; Multiscale comparison; Visual working memory; Zooming; User interfaces

Users' evaluations are generally measured through questionnaires. We suggest that other evaluation methods, including economic measures, may provide different estimates of the relative value of features. In a laboratory experiment we created four versions of a data-entry application by independently manipulating the system's usability and aesthetics. Users' evaluations of the four experimental systems were obtained in a within-subjects design. In addition, five between-subjects experimental conditions were created, based on the evaluation method (questionnaire alone or auction and questionnaire), monetary incentives (present or absent), and experience in using the system (present or absent). In questionnaire-based responses, the systems' usability affected evaluations of usability as well as aesthetics. Similarly, the systems' aesthetics affected evaluations of both aesthetics and usability. Questionnaire-based evaluations of usability and aesthetics were not affected by experience with the system or by monetary performance incentives. Auction bids were only influenced by the system's usability: bids corresponded to the objective performance levels that could be attained with the different systems. The results suggest that by using economic methods, researchers and practitioners can obtain system evaluations that are strongly related to performance criteria and that may be more valid when the evaluation context favors task-oriented performance. © 2006 ACM.",Aesthetics; Auction; Market value; Preferences; Screen design; Usability; User evaluation,Compensation (personnel); Data acquisition; Economics; Logic design; Software engineering; Aesthetics; Bids; Economic methods; Performance incentives; Human computer interaction

The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) addresses this problem by providing a standard machine-readable format for website privacy policies. P3P user agents can fetch P3P privacy policies automatically, compare them with a user's privacy preferences, and alert and advise the user. Developing user interfaces for P3P user agents is challenging for several reasons: privacy policies are complex, user privacy preferences are often complex and nuanced, users tend to have little experience articulating their privacy preferences, users are generally unfamiliar with much of the terminology used by privacy experts, users often do not understand the privacy-related consequences of their behavior, and users have differing expectations about the type and extent of privacy policy information they would like to see. We developed a P3P user agent called Privacy Bird. Our design was informed by privacy surveys and our previous experience with prototype P3P user agents.

Designing and evaluating Kalas: A social navigation system for food recipes,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745125043&doi=10.1145%2f1096737.1096739&partnerID=40&md5=37ddf023c3a2d2e39ddf154f0f26b1eb,"The idea of social navigation is to aid users to navigate information spaces through making the collective, aggregated, or individual actions of others visible and useful as a basis for making decisions on where to go next and what to choose. These social markers should also help in turning the navigation experience into a social and pleasurable one rather than the tedious, boring, frustrating, and sometimes even scary experience of a lonely traveler. To evaluate whether it is possible to design for social navigation, we built the food recipe system Kalas. It includes several different forms of aggregated trails of user actions and means of communication between users: recommender system functionality (recommendations computed from others' choices), real-time broadcasting of concurrent user activity in the interface, possibilities to comment and vote on recipes, the number of downloads per recipe, and chatting facilities. Recipe author was also included in the recipe description. Kalas was tried with 302 users during six months, and 73 of the users answered a final questionnaire. The overall impression was that users liked and acted on aggregated trails and navigated differently because of them. 18% of the selected recipes came from the list of recommended recipes. About half of the 73 users understood that recommendations were computed from their own and others actions, while the rest had not reflected upon it or had erroneous beliefs. Interestingly, both groups selected a large proportion of their recipes from the recommendations. Unfortunately, there were not enough users to populate the space at every occasion, and thus both chatting and following other users moving in the space was for the most part not possible, but when possible, users move to the space where most other users could be found. Of the other social textures, users themselves claimed to be most influenced by other users' comments attached to the recipes and less by recipe author or number of downloads. Users are more positive to the possibility of expressing themselves in terms of comments and voting than seeing the comments and votes of others. It was noted that users did not pick more recommended recipes towards the end of the study period when the accuracy of recommendations should have been higher. More or less from the start, they picked recommended recipes and went on doing so throughout the whole period. © 2005 ACM.",Collaborative filtering; Design; Evaluation; Experiments; Social navigation,Computation theory; Decision making; Design; Evaluation; Experiments; Information analysis; Social aspects; User interfaces; Collaborative filtering; Food recipes; Kalas; Social navigation; Human computer interaction
The language of privacy: Learning from video media space analysis and design,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745168965&doi=10.1145%2f1067860.1067868&partnerID=40&md5=b3ecff855a7e698e2ec9ddb46f89ad3d,"Video media spaces are an excellent crucible for the study of privacy. Their design affords opportunities for misuse, prompts ethical questions, and engenders grave concerns from both users and nonusers. Despite considerable discussion of the privacy problems uncovered in prior work, questions remain as to how to design a privacy-preserving video media space and how to evaluate its effect on privacy. The problem is more deeply rooted than this, however. Privacy is an enormous concept from which a large vocabulary of terms emerges. Disambiguating the meanings of and relationships between these terms facilitates understanding of the link between privacy and design. In this article, we draw from resources in environmental psychology and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to build a broadly and deeply rooted vocabulary for privacy. We relate the vocabulary back to the real and hard problem of designing privacy-preserving video media spaces. In doing so, we facilitate analysis of the privacy-design relationship. © 2005 ACM.",Autonomy; Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW); Confidentiality; Environmental psychology; Human-computer interaction; Privacy; Social interaction; Solitude; User interface design; Video media spaces,Computer supported cooperative work; Product design; Social aspects; User interfaces; Visual communication; Vocabulary control; Autonomy; Confidentiality; Environmental psychology; Privacy; Social interaction; Solitude; User interface design; Video media spaces; Human computer interaction

While empirical evaluations showed a speed advantage for ToolGlass, they did not examine the relative importance of two possible factors in its improved performance: (1) the use of two hands and (2) the merging of command selection and direct manipulation. We conducted a study comparing the relative benefits of three command selection techniques that merge command selection and direct manipulation: one two-handed technique, Toolglass, and two one-handed techniques, namely, control menus [Pook et al. 2000] and FlowMenu [Guimbretière and Winograd 2000], Participants performed sequences of operations that required both selecting a color and designating the endpoints of a line. Our results show that control menus and FlowMenu are significantly faster than Toolglass. Further analysis suggests that the merging of command selection and direct manipulation is the most important factor in the performance of all three techniques. © 2005 ACM.",Command selection; Control menu; Direct manipulation; FlowMenu; Toolglass; Two-handed interaction,Command and control systems; Computational methods; Computer selection and evaluation; Numerical analysis; Command selection; Control menu; Direct manipulation; FlowMenu; Toolglass; Two handed interaction; Human computer interaction

A probabilistic approach to modeling two-dimensional pointing,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745182294&doi=10.1145%2f1096737.1096741&partnerID=40&md5=2c4c51720b5526f162882d283d70649f,"We investigate and model two-dimensional pointing where the target distance and size vary as does the angle of movement. We first study the spread of hits in a rapid approximate pointing task at varied distances and movement angles. Consistent with the literature, our results show that the spread of hits along the movement direction deviate more than the spread of hits in the direction perpendicular to movement, and both spreads increase with distance. Based on the distribution of this spread of hits, we propose and validate a new probabilistic model that describes two-dimensional pointing. Unlike previous models, our model accounts for more variables of twodimensional pointing and can be generalized to any target shape, size, orientation, location, and dimension. In contrast to previous work, which suggests that target height has minimal impact on performance when it is larger than the width, our results show that, even when height is greater than width, it can significantly impact movement time. © 2005 ACM.",Fitts' law; Human performance modeling; Probabilistic models; Two-dimensional pointing,Mathematical models; Probabilistic logics; Probability distributions; Size determination; Two dimensional; Fitts' law; Human performance modeling; Probabilistic models; Two dimensional pointing; Human computer interaction

Socio-technical environments supporting people with cognitive disabilities using public transportation,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33645794329&doi=10.1145%2f1067860.1067865&partnerID=40&md5=16ae8b7589b899adb48ef8c5bf8bdc00,"Public transportation systems are among the most ubiquitous and complex large-scale systems found in modern society. For those unable to drive such as people with cognitive disabilities, these systems are essential gateways for participation in community activities, socialization, and independence. To understand the magnitude and scope of this national problem, we highlight deficiencies identified in an international study by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council and present specific cognitive barriers identified in empirical studies of transportation systems in several U.S. cities. An interdisciplinary team of HCI researchers, urban transportation planners, commercial technologists, and assistive care specialists are now collaborating on the Mobility-for-All project to create architectures and prototypes that support those with cognitive disabilities and their care-givers. We have grounded our research and design efforts using a distributed cognition framework. We have derived requirements for our designs by analyzing ""how things are"" for individuals with cognitive disabilities who learn and use public transportation systems. We present a socio-technical architecture that has three components: a) a personal travel assistant that uses real-time Global Positioning Systems data from the bus fleet to deliver just-in-time prompts; b) a mobile prompting client and a prompting script configuration tool for caregivers; and c) a monitoring system that collects real-time task status from the mobile client and alerts the support community of potential problems. We then describe a phased community-centered assessment approach that begins at the design stage and continues to be integrated throughout the project. This research has broad implications for designing more human-centered transportation systems that are universally accessible for other disenfranchised communities such as the elderly or nonnative speaker. This project presents an ""in-the-world"" research opportunity that challenges our understanding about mobile human computer interactions with ubiquitous, context-aware computing architectures in noisy, uncontrolled environments; personalization and user modeling techniques; and the design of universally accessible interfaces for complex systems through participatory design processes. This article provides both a near-term vision and an architecture for transportation systems that are socially inclusive, technologically appealing, and easier for everyone to use. © 2005 ACM.",Active distributed support systems; Cognitive disabilities; Complex; Context-aware computing; Distributed cognition; Human-centered transportation; Mobility agents; Participatory design; Public transportation system; Socio-teohnical systems; Universal design,Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Global positioning system; Human computer interaction; Large scale systems; Project management; Public policy; Real time systems; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Active distributed support systems; Cognitive disabilities; Distributed cognition; Human-centered transportation; Mobility agents; Participatory design; Public transportation system; Socio-teohnical systems; Universal design; Transportation
Making by making strange: Defamiliarization and the design of domestic technologies,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644512594&doi=10.1145%2f1067860.1067862&partnerID=40&md5=5e0fa11b6925b79c1a00fb6a16e96b00,"This article argues that because the home is so familiar, it is necessary to make it strange, or defamiliarize it, in order to open its design space. Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere - even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home. © 2005 ACM.",Anthropology; Defamiliarization; Domestic labor; Domestic technology; Ethnicity; Ethnography; Gender; Home entertainment; Human-computer interaction,Human computer interaction; Product design; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; World Wide Web; Anthropology; Defamiliarization; Domestic labor; Domestic technology; Ethnicity; Ethnography; Gender; Home entertainment; Human-computer interaction; Domestic appliances

They have the potential to increase social interaction and foster collaboration. However, social matching systems lack a clear intellectual foundation: the nature of the design space, the key research challenges, and the roster of appropriate methods are all ill-defined. This article begins to remedy the situation. It clarifies the scope of social matching systems by distinguishing them from other recommender systems and related systems and techniques. It identifies a set of issues that characterize the design space of social matching systems and shows how existing systems explore different points within the design space. It also reviews selected social science results that can provide input into system design. Most important, the article presents a research agenda organized around a set of claims.

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for HCI designers. © 2005 ACM.",Embodied conversational agent; Human-computer interaction; Relational agent; Social interface,Information theory; Linguistics; Psychophysiology; Social aspects; Social sciences; Embodied conversational agents; Human-computer interaction; Relational agents; Social interfaces; Human computer interaction
Social empowerment and exclusion: A case study on digital libraries,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-28944447977&doi=10.1145%2f1067860.1067863&partnerID=40&md5=133bebea00d8bce74e0f9e8d686e2055,"This article reports on work studying how technology can empower or exclude its users due to interactions between social context, system design, and implementation. The analysis is based around the introduction and use of digital libraries in four different settings, three clinical and one academic. Across the four settings, in-depth interview and focus group data was collected from 144 users and analyzed with reference to ""communities of practice"". The four settings represent three different approaches to digital library implementation: making digital library resources available from existing computer systems in people's offices and the library (a traditional approach); making computer systems, and hence digital libraries, available in shared spaces (in this case, hospital wards); and employing information intermediaries to work with staff and library resources. These different approaches engendered different perceptions of the technology. The traditional approach produced perceptions of technology as being irrelevant for current needs and community practices. Making technology available within shared physical space but with poor design, support, and implementation procedures was widely perceived as a threat to current organizational structures. In contrast, technology implemented within the community which could adapt and change practices according to individual and group needs, supported by an information intermediary, was seen as empowering to both the community and the individual. We relate the findings to a discussion of evolutionary and revolutionary approaches to design and to the concept of communities of practice. © 2005 ACM.",Communities of practice; Digital libraries; Grounded theory; Social empowerment; Social exclusion,Computer systems; Data acquisition; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Social aspects; Systems analysis; Communities of practice; Grounded theory; Social context; Social empowerment; Social exclusion; Digital libraries

We show how a systematic comparison of expected, sensed, and desired movements, especially with regard to how they do not precisely overlap, can reveal potential problems with an interface and also inspire new features. We describe how this approach has been applied to the design of three interfaces: pointing flashlights at walls and posters in order to play sounds; the Augurscope II, a mobile augmented reality interface for outdoors; and the Drift Table, an item of furniture that uses load sensing to control the display of aerial photographs.

However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. Although some of this ambiguity may be resolved using automatic techniques, we argue that correct handling of ambiguous context will often need to involve the user. We use the term mediation to refer to the dialogue that ensues between the user and the system. In this article, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments. We present design guidelines that arise from supporting mediation over space and time, issues not present in the graphical user interface domain where mediation has typically been used in the past. We illustrate the use of our architecture and evaluate it through an example context-aware application, a word predictor system. © 2005 ACM.",Ambiguity; Aware environments; Context-aware computing; Error handling; Mediation; Ubiquitous computing,Data reduction; Distributed computer systems; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Problem solving; Signal processing; Ambiguity; Aware environments; Context-aware computing; Error handling; Mediation; Ubliquitous computing; Sensors

Our view is that the foreground concerns deliberate user activity where the user is attending to the device, while the background is the realm of inattention or split attention, using naturally occurring user activity as an input that allows the device to infer or anticipate user needs. The five questions for sensing systems of Bellotti et al. [2002] proposed as a framework for this special issue, primarily address the foreground, but neglect critical issues with background sensing. To support our perspective, we discuss a variety of foreground and background sensing techniques that we have implemented for sensor-enhanced mobile devices, such as powering on the device when the user picks it up, sensing when the user is holding the device to his ear, automatically switching between portrait and landscape display orientations depending on how the user is holding the device, and scrolling the display using tilt. We also contribute system architecture issues, such as using the foreground/background model to handle cross-talk between multiple sensor-based interaction techniques, and theoretical perspectives, such as a classification of recognition errors based on explicitly considering transitions between the foreground and background. Based on our experiences, we propose design issues and lessons learned for foreground/background sensing systems. © 2005 ACM.",Augmented devices; Context awareness; Human-computer interaction; Input devices; Interaction techniques; Sensing,Cognitive systems; Computer networks; Human computer interaction; Personal digital assistants; Problem solving; Wireless telecommunication systems; Augmented devices; Context awareness; Input devices; Interaction techniques; Sensing; Sensors

In these interfaces, tokens are discrete physical objects which represent digital information. Constraints are confining regions that are mapped to digital operations. These are frequently embodied as structures that mechanically channel how tokens can be manipulated, often limiting their movement to a single degree of freedom. Placing and manipulating tokens within systems of constraints can be used to invoke and control a variety of computational interpretations. We discuss the properties of the token+constraint approach; consider strengths that distinguish them from other interface approaches; and illustrate the concept with eleven past and recent supporting systems. We present some of the conceptual background supporting these interfaces, and consider them in terms of Bellotti et al.'s [2002] five questions for sensing-based interaction.

Predicting human interruptibility with sensors,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-18844407586&doi=10.1145%2f1057237.1057243&partnerID=40&md5=f11860846f952c7085851a176624d6d4,"A person seeking another person's attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible the other person currently is. Such assessments allow behavior that we consider natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. This is in sharp contrast to current computer and communication systems, which are largely unaware of the social situations surrounding their usage and the impact that their actions have on these situations. If systems could model human interruptibility, they could use this information to negotiate interruptions at appropriate times, thus improving human computer interaction. This article presents a series of studies that quantitatively demonstrate that simple sensors can support the construction of models that estimate human interruptibility as well as people do. These models can be constructed without using complex sensors, such as vision-based techniques, and therefore their use in everyday office environments is both practical and affordable. Although currently based on a demographically limited sample, our results indicate a substantial opportunity for future research to validate these results over larger groups of office workers. Our results also motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times. © 2005 ACM.",Context-aware computing; Machine learning; Managing human attention; Sensor-based interfaces; Situationally appropriate interaction,Communication systems; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Interfaces (computer); Learning systems; Mathematical models; Context-aware computing; Managing human atention; Sensor based interfaces; Situationally appropriate interaction; Sensors

Using NASA's Task Load Index, participants report increased workload under flashing text banners. Experiment 2 investigates search through news headlines at two levels of difficulty: exact matches and matches requiring semantic interpretation. Results show both animated and static commercial banners decrease visual search speeds. Eye tracking data reveal people rarely look directly at banners.

Managing availability: Supporting lightweight negotiations to handle interruptions,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745141895&doi=10.1145%2f1121112.1121114&partnerID=40&md5=1babb1f53b1917a2e230e83dfb08bbbf,"Interruptions are a central aspect of working life. The prevalence of remote co-workers and the use of mobile technology mean that interruptions are more prevalent, and workers have to learn to manage availability. To understand general issues in availability management, we carried out a naturalistic study of how interruptions are handled in face-to-face situations. We found that availability management requires negotiation, that it is also highly dependent on awareness about the availability of others, and that it demands cognitive effort to shift attention to the interruption. On the basis of these observations, we developed a technology, named. The Negotiator, that embodies three main design requirements: (a) support for negotiation, (b) contextual information about when a recipient is available for a call, (c) lightweightness to reduce attention overhead. We carried out an experimental study of interruption management using this technology. The interface satisfied the original design requirements, that is, people, were able to use it effectively to negotiate times to talk, while successfully carrying out an intellectually demanding activity. Contrary to our expectations, however, people preferred to take responsibility for returning calls rather than delegating them, and they preferred to schedule calls as soon as possible rather than deferring them. We suggest that there are social reasons why people do this. They feel a social obligation to return calls as soon as possible so as not to inconvenience others and also to be responsible for making these calls themselves. They also take calls sooner to avoid having to remember future conversational commitments. We discuss the theoretical and technical implications of these findings. © 2005 ACM.",Availability management; Availability negotiation; Aware-ness; Interaction asymmetry; Interaction management; Interruptions; Lightweight negotiations; Mobile phones,Availability; Computer aided design; Human computer interaction; Information management; Availability management; Availability negotiation; Awareness; Interaction asymmetry; Interaction management; Interruptions; Lightweight negotiations; Mobile phones; Mobile computing
Putting computing in context: An infrastructure to support extensible context-enhanced collaborative applications,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745175508&doi=10.1145%2f1121112.1121117&partnerID=40&md5=7aa5e62a21adbb36546ef84157849041,"Context-aware computing exposes a unique tension in how information about human context is modeled and used. On the one hand, approaches that use loosely structured information have been shown to be useful in situations where humans are the final consumers of contextual information; these approaches have found favor in many CSCW applications. On the other hand, more rigidly structured information supports machine interpretation and exchange; these approaches have been explored in the ubiquitous computing community. The system presented here, dubbed Intermezzo, represents an exploration of a space between these two extremes. Intermezzo combines a loose data structuring with a number of unique features designed to allow applications to embed specialized semantic interpretations of data into the infrastructure, allowing them to be reused by other applications. This approach can enable the construction of applications that can take advantage of rich, layered interpretations of context without requiring that they understand all aspects of that context. This approach is explored through the creation of two higher-level services that provide context-enhanced session management and context-enhanced access control.© 2005 ACM.",Collaboration; Context-aware computing; Coordination; Data representations,Data processing; Embedded systems; Information analysis; Learning systems; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Semantics; Collaboration; Context aware computing; Coordination; Data representations; Human computer interaction
Fitts' law and expanding targets: Experimental studies and designs for user interfaces,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745167682&doi=10.1145%2f1121112.1121115&partnerID=40&md5=bf8f777fd5fb3d16b382d16ce4c8d622,"Recently, there has been renewed interest in techniques for facilitating the selection of user interface widgets or other on-screen targets with a pointing device. We report research into using target expansion for facilitating selection. Widgets that expand or grow in response to the user's focus of attention allow for a reduced initial size which can help optimize screen space use and may be easier to select than targets that do not expand. However, selection performance could plausibly suffer from a decreased initial widget size. We describe an experiment in which users select a single, isolated target button that expands just before it is selected. Our results show that users benefit from target expansion even if the target only begins expanding after 90% of the distance to the target has been travelled. Furthermore, our results suggest that, for sufficiently large ID values, users are able to take approximately full advantage of the expanded target size. For interfaces with multiple expanding widgets, however, subtle problems arise due to the collisions or overlap that may occur between adjacent expanding widgets. We give a detailed examination of the issues involved in both untiled and tiled multiple expanding targets and present various design strategies for improving their performance. © 2005 ACM.",Empirical evaluation; Expanding targets; Expansion; Fitts' law; Growing targets; Interaction design; Interaction modeling; Target magnification; Widget design,Computer aided design; Design aids; Optimization; Problem oriented languages; Empirical evaluation; Expanding targets; Fitts' law; Growing targets; Interaction design; Interaction modeling; Target magnification; Widget design; Interfaces (computer)
An investigation into the effects of text-to-speech voice and 3D avatars on the perception of presence and flow of Live Help in electronic commerce,2005,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745148985&doi=10.1145%2f1121112.1121113&partnerID=40&md5=98d297099c0ffe78ce1721bf58634b17,"Expansion and growth of online shopping has led many companies to provide real-time communications on their Web sites to facilitate human-to-human interaction between service representatives and customers. The current study analyzes the interface design of such Live Help functions. More specifically, it attempts to understand whether or not the implementation of Text-To-Speech (TTS) voice communication and 3D avatars in the user interface of Live Help affects consumers' views of their own interactions with a service person. A laboratory experiment was designed to empirically test the hypotheses that TTS voice communication and 3D avatars can significantly affect consumers' perceptions of presence and flow. A 2*3 full factorial design was used (assessing three options for the use of voice and text, and two options for the use of avatars). The results of the experiment demonstrate that the presence of TTS voice significantly increases consumers' perceptions of flow (a construct depicting a user's interaction with a computer as playful and exploratory), while 3D avatars enhance consumers' feelings of telepresence (a user's experience of seeming to be present in a remote environment by means of a communication medium). These findings offer practitioners guidelines on how to improve interface designs for real-time human-to-human communications on electronic commerce Web sites. © 2005 ACM.",Avatar; Customer relationship man-agement (CRM); Electronic commerce; Flow; Live help; Social presence; Telepresence; Text-to-speech,Communication systems; Human computer interaction; Interfaces (computer); Online searching; Sensory perception; Speech; Avatar; Customer relationship man-agement (CRM); Flow; Live help; Social presence; Telepresence; Text to speech; Electronic commerce

Shared physical workplaces provide natural support for tasks such as (a) social reminding about communication commitments and keeping track of collaborators and friends, and (b) social data mining of local expertise for advice and information. However, many people now collaborate remotely using tools such as email and voicemail. Our field studies show that these tools do not provide the social cues needed for group work processes. In part, this is because the tools are organized around messages, rather than people. In response to this problem, we created ContactMap, a system that makes people the primary unit of interaction. ContactMap provides a structured social desktop representation of users' important contacts that directly supports social reminding and social data mining. We conducted an empirical evaluation of ContactMap, comparing it with traditional email systems, on tasks suggested by our fieldwork. Users performed better with ContactMap and preferred ContactMap for the majority of these tasks.

Using confidence scores to improve hands-free speech based navigation in continuous dictation systems,2004,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10844260787&doi=10.1145%2f1035575.1035576&partnerID=40&md5=ea2a3c9f091bed88070afd1741d73bfa,"Speech recognition systems have improved dramatically, but recent studies confirm that error correction activities still account for 66-75% of the users' time, and 50% of that time is spent just getting to the errors that need to be corrected. While researchers have suggested that confidence scores could prove useful during the error correction process, the focus is typically on error detection. More importantly, empirical studies have failed to confirm any measurable benefits when confidence scores are used in this way within dictation-oriented applications. In this article, we provide data that explains why confidence scores are unlikely to be useful for error detection. We propose a new navigation technique for use when speech-only interactions are strongly preferred and common, desktop-sized displays are available. The results of an empirical study that highlights the potential of this new technique are reported. An informal comparison between the current study and previous research suggests the new technique reduces time spent on navigation by 18%.

Differences in pointing task performance between preschool children and adults using mice,2004,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10844249430&doi=10.1145%2f1035575.1035577&partnerID=40&md5=b34dfde0845d65f23243f1ca6c1ffd85,"Several experiments by psychologists and human factors researchers have shown that when young children execute pointing tasks, they perform at levels below older children and adults. However, these experiments have not provided user interface designers with an understanding of the severity or the nature of the difficulties young children have when using input devices. To address this need, we conducted a study to gain a better understanding of 4 and 5 year-old children's use of mice. We compared the performance of thirteen 4 year-olds, thirteen 5 year-olds and thirteen young adults in point-and-click tasks. Plots of the paths taken by the participants show severe differences between adults' and preschool children's ability to control the mouse. We were not surprised then to find age had a significant effect on accuracy, target reentry, and efficiency. We also found that target size had a significant effect on accuracy and target reentry. Measuring movement time at four different times (first entering target, last entering target, pressing button, releasing button) yielded the result that Fitts' law models children well only up to the time they first enter the target. Overall, we found that the difference between the performance of children and adults was large enough to warrant user interface interactions designed specifically for preschool children. The results additionally suggest that children need the most help once they get close to targets.",Accuracy; Children; Fitts' law; Human-computer interaction; Mouse; Target reentry,Behavioral research; Data processing; Digital libraries; Input output programs; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Accuracy; Children; Fitts' law; Mouse; Target reentry; Human computer interaction
Toward adaptive conversational interfaces: Modeling speech convergence with animated personas,2004,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-5444241431&doi=10.1145%2f1017494.1017498&partnerID=40&md5=ef4296cc3f3d0845fe5f7d990fa717e6,"The design of robust interfaces that process conversational speech is a challenging research direction largely because users' spoken language is so variable. This research explored a new dimension of speaker stylistic variation by examining whether users' speech converges systematically with the text-to-speech (TTS) heard from a software partner. To pursue this question, a study was conducted in which twenty-four 7 to 10-year-old children conversed with animated partners that embodied different TTS voices. An analysis of children's amplitude, durational features, and dialogue response latencies confirmed that they spontaneously adapt several basic acoustic-prosodic features of their speech 10-50%, with the-largest adaptations involving utterance pause structure and amplitude. Children's speech adaptations were relatively rapid, bidirectional, and dynamically readaptable when introduced to new partners, and generalized across different types of users and TTS voices. Adaptations also occurred consistently, with 70-95% of children converging with their partner's TTS, although individual differences in magnitude of adaptation were evident. In the design of future conversational systems, users' spontaneous convergence could be exploited to guide their speech within system processing bounds, thereby enhancing robustness. Adaptive system processing could yield further significant performance gains. The long-term goal of this research is the development of predictive models of human-computer communication to guide the design of new conversational interfaces.",Adaptive interfaces; Amplitude; Animated characters; Children's educational software; Communication accommodation theory; Conversational interfaces; Dialogue response latency; Duration; Human-computer adaptation; Individual differences; Mobile interfaces,Computer software; Human computer interaction; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Speech recognition; Adaptive interfaces; Communication accommodation theory; Conversational interfaces; Mobile interfaces; User interfaces

Our main advance is to use context-sensitive speech recognition in a general way, with a representation of dialogue context that is rich and flexible enough to support conversation about multiple interleaved topics, as well as the interpretation of corrective fragments. We explain, by use of worked examples, the use of our ""Conversational Intelligence Architecture"" (CIA) to represent conversational threads, and how each thread can be associated with a language model (LM) for more robust speech recognition. The CIA uses fine-grained dynamic representations of dialogue context, which supersede those used in finite-state or form-based dialogue managers. In an evaluation of a dialogue system built using this architecture we found that 87.9% of recognized utterances were recognized using a context-specific language model, resulting in an 11.5% reduction in the overall utterance recognition error rate, and a 13.4% reduction in concept error rate. Thus we show that by using context-sensitive recognition based on the predicted type of the user's next dialogue move, a more flexible dialogue system can also exhibit an improvement in speech recognition performance.",Contact; Corrections; Dialogue; Multithreading; Recognition,Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Human computer interaction; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Speech recognition; Conversational intelligence architecture (CIA); Conversational interfaces; Multithreaded conversational flow; User interfaces

The interface also gives users control over the visible time period, as well as supporting integrated search to discover patterns and outliers. Designed with device scalability in mind, DateLens currently runs on desktop computers as well as PDAs. Two user studies were conducted to examine the viability of DateLens as a replacement for traditional calendar visualizations. In the first study, non-PDA users performed complex tasks significantly faster with DateLens than with the Microsoft Pocket PC 2002™ calendar (using a PDA emulator). In addition, they rated DateLens as being easier to use than the default calendar application for a majority of the tasks. In the second study, the participants were expert Pocket PC users and the software was run on their own devices. Again, DateLens performed significantly faster for the complex tasks, and there were satisfaction differences favoring each calendar for different kinds of tasks. From these studies, it is clear that DateLens is superior for more complex tasks such as those associated with longer time periods. For daily event tracking, users familiar with the default Pocket PC calendar strongly preferred its daily view and behaviors.",Animation; Calendar interfaces; Fisheye distortion interfaces; Graphics; Information visualization; PDAs,Animation; Computational complexity; Graphic methods; Navigation; Robustness (control systems); Visualization; Calendar interfaces; DateLens; Fisheye distortion interfaces; Information visualization; Personal digital assistants

These patterns are organised around a framework and are inspired by how such regularities are highlighted in ethnomethodologically- informed ethnographic studies of work and technology. They comprise a high level description and two or more comparable examples drawn from specific studies. Our contention is that these patterns form a useful resource for reusing findings from previous field studies, for enabling analysis and considering design in new settings. Previous work on the relationship between ethnomethodology and design has been concerned primarily in providing presentation frameworks and mechanisms, practical advice, schematisations of the ethnomethodologist's role, different possibilities of input at different stages in development, and various conceptualisations of the relationship between study and design. In contrast, this article seeks to first discuss the position of patterns relative to emergent major topics of interest of these studies. Subsequently it seeks to describe the case for the collection of patterns based on findings, their comparison across studies and their general implications for design problems, rather than the concerns of practical and methodological interest outlined in the other work. Special attention is paid to our evaluations and to how they inform how the patterns collection may be read, used and contributed to, as well as to reflections on the composition of the collection as it has emerged. The paper finishes, first, with a discussion of how our work relates to other work on patterns, before some closing comments are made on the role of our patterns and ethnomethodology in systems design.",Ethnomethodology; Human-computer interaction; Patterns of cooperative interaction; Work design,Groupware; Problem solving; Project management; Psychophysiology; Societies and institutions; Systems analysis; Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW); Ethnographic studies; Social psychology; Sociology; Human computer interaction

For both these areas, we provide an overview of identified user practices and a citation-based analysis of the problems users encountered, including those related to the use of the screen real estate (the actual desktop). Two types of problems were identified: (1) Problems that concern the actual use of the system installed on the computer. (2) Problems that arise when people realise that they are using a system that does not allow for the desired work or organizational functions sought. We were able to show that skill continues to be an important factor with respect to the ease of using today's systems. We suggest the following necessary improvements for the evolution of personal information systems: A storage facility that represents the user's view of information; replacing pure technical file metadata with more user-friendly attributes; and introduction of annotations as a new information type.",Desktop metaphor; Document classification; Document retrieval; Improvements; Personal computer; User practices; User problems; User study,Computer selection and evaluation; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Design; Graphical user interfaces; Human engineering; Information management; Problem solving; Desktop metaphors; Document classification; Document retrieval; Improvements; User practices; User problems; User study; Personal computers
Task analysis for groupware usability evaluation: Modeling shared-workspace tasks with the mechanics of collaboration,2003,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042813207&doi=10.1145%2f966930.966932&partnerID=40&md5=0a310080bb03877a3ee4751d076c2f8d,"Researchers in Computer Supported Cooperative Work have recently developed discount evaluation methods for shared-workspace groupware. Most discount methods rely on some understanding of the context in which the groupware systems will be used, which means that evaluators need to model the tasks that groups will perform. However, existing task analysis schemes are not well suited to the needs of groupware evaluation: they either do not deal with collaboration issues, do not use an appropriate level of analysis for concrete assessment of usability in interfaces, or do not adequately represent the variability inherent in group work. To fill this gap, we have developed a new modeling technique called Collaboration Usability Analysis. CUA focuses on the teamwork that goes on in a group task rather than the taskwork. To enable closer links between the task representation and the groupware interface, CUA grounds each collaborative action in a set of group work primitives called the mechanics of collaboration. To represent the range of ways that a group task can be carried out, CUA allows variable paths through the execution of a task, and allows alternate paths and optional tasks to be modeled. CUA's main contribution is to provide evaluators with a framework in which they can simulate the realistic use of a groupware system and identify usability problems that are caused by the groupware interface.",Groupware evaluation; Groupware usability; Mechanics of collaboration; Task analysis,Computer supported cooperative work; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Software engineering; Groupware evaluation; Groupware usability; Mechanics of collaboration; Task analysis; Groupware
A model for notification systems evaluation-assessing user goals for multitasking activity,2003,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042734130&doi=10.1145%2f966930.966933&partnerID=40&md5=6e0efa2e1f8aaa1443e13cb20e3a9a83,"Addressing the need to tailor usability evaluation methods (UEMs) and promote effective reuse of HCI knowledge for computing activities undertaken in divided-attention situations, we present the foundations of a unifying model that can guide evaluation efforts for notification systems, Often implemented as ubiquitous systems or within a small portion of the traditional desktop, notification systems typically deliver information of interest in a parallel, multitasking approach, extraneous or supplemental to a user's attention priority. Such systems represent a difficult challenge to evaluate meaningfully. We introduce a design model of user goals based on blends of three critical parameters-interruption, reaction, and comprehension. Categorization possibilities form a logical, descriptive design space for notification systems, rooted in human information processing theory. This model allows conceptualization of distinct action models for at least eight classes of notification systems, which we describe and analyze with a human information processing model. System classification regions immediately suggest useful empirical and analytical evaluation metrics from related literature. We present a case study that demonstrates how these techniques can assist an evaluator in adapting traditional UEMs for notification and other multitasking systems. We explain why using the design model categorization scheme enabled us to generate evaluation results that are more relevant for the system redesign than the results of the original exploration done by the system's designers.",Claims reuse; Design model; Peripheral systems; Usability,Cognitive systems; Computer software; Multiprocessing systems; Multitasking; User interfaces; Claims reuse; Design models; Peripheral systems; Usability evaluation methods (UEM); Human computer interaction
Are you looking at me?

Various elaborate inventions have been proposed to get around this problem but none have found wide use. The alternative explored here is that these expensive alternatives may be unnecessary. Users of conventional desktop video equipment may, under the right conditions, be able to learn to interpret what is at first sight inappropriate apparent gaze direction as signalling that the other person is ""looking at me."" Data are presented from two experiments where an estimator judges where a gazer is looking. The gazer may be looking either at the desktop video image of the estimator or some point to the side. Experiment 1 compared two image sizes and two camera positions. While the size of the image (352 × 288 pixels versus 176 × 144) had no significant effect on participants' ability to judge where the gazer was looking, horizontally offsetting the position of the camera inhibited performance. Experiment 2 examined the effect of reducing the image size further. The smallest image size (88 × 72 pixels) resulted in poorer performance than the intermediate (176 × 144). The results show that it is possible for users of low cost desktop video conferencing to learn to interpret gaze direction to a very high degree of accuracy if the equipment is configured optimally. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.",Eye contact; Gaze awareness; Video conferencing,Cameras; Data acquisition; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Personal computers; Signaling; Visual communication; Desktop video conferencing; Eye contact; Gaze awareness; Video conferencing
ScentTrails: Integrating browsing and searching on the Web,2003,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042854920&doi=10.1145%2f937549.937550&partnerID=40&md5=0aece86dd76b81b995c284792e1b46da,"The two predominant paradigms for finding information on the Web are browsing and keyword Searching. While they exhibit complementary advantages, neither paradigm alone is adequate for complex information goals that lend themselves partially to browsing and partially to searching. To integrate browsing and searching smoothly into a single interface, we introduce a novel approach called ScentTrails. Based on the concept of information scent developed in the context of information foraging theory, ScentTrails highlights hyperlinks to indicate paths to search results. This interface enables users to interpolate smoothly between searching and browsing to locate content matching complex information goals effectively. In a preliminary user study, ScentTrails enabled subjects to find information more quickly than by either searching or browsing alone.",Browsing; Information scent; ScentTrails; Searching; World Wide Web,Algorithms; Computer graphics; Information retrieval; Interfaces (computer); Online searching; Statistical methods; Web browsers; Browsing; Information scent; Scent trails; Searching; World Wide Web
Effects of scent and breadth on use of site-specific search on e-commerce web sites,2003,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042854921&doi=10.1145%2f937549.937551&partnerID=40&md5=c794be9d362cad33f3edfb0d8183db8a,"Users faced with Web sites containing many possibly relevant pages often have a decision to make about navigation: use the menu of links or use the provided site search function. Two studies were conducted to examine what users do when faced with this decision on e-commerce Web sites, and how users go about deciding which method to attempt. An exploratory study revealed a wide distribution of searching and browsing behavior across sites and users. Counter to some predictions, use of the site search functions did not yield faster or more accurate performance in locating products. Questionnaire data suggested that factors relevant to the menu structure, interface element prominence, information scent and user dispositions all influenced the decision of whether to browse or search a site for a product. A second experiment utilizing novel e-commerce sites and allowing for more control of factors found to be important in the first study found that browsing behavior was influenced by both the breadth and information scent of the menus. These results suggest that providing site search should not be used to compensate for poor menu design, and provide further evidence regarding the design of effective menu structures.",Browsing; e-commerce; Empirical studies; Information retrieval; Navigation; Searching; WWW,Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information retrieval; Online searching; User interfaces; Web browsers; Browsing; E-commerce web sites; Emperical studies; Searching; Websites

Do the capabilities afforded by collaboratories outweigh their disadvantages? To evaluate a scientific collaboratory system, we conducted a repeated-measures controlled experiment that compared the outcomes and process of scientific work completed by 20 pairs of participants (upper level undergraduate science students) working face-to-face and remotely. We collected scientific outcomes (graded lab reports) to investigate the quality of scientific work, post-questionnaire data to measure the adoptability of the system, and post-interviews to understand the participants' views of doing science under both conditions. We hypothesized that study participants would be less effective, report more difficulty, and be less favorably inclined to adopt the system when collaborating remotely. Contrary to expectations, the quantitative data showed no statistically significant differences with respect to effectiveness and adoption.The qualitative data helped explain this null result: participants reported advantages and disadvantages working under both conditions and developed work-arounds to cope with the perceived disadvantages of collaborating remotely. While the data analysis produced null results, considered as a whole, the analysis leads us to conclude there is positive potential for the development and adoption of scientific collaboratory systems.",Collaboration; Controlled experiment; Geographically-distributed work; Nanoscience; Scientific collaboratory,Computational complexity; Data reduction; Education; Nanotechnology; Professional aspects; Research; Collaboration; Controlled experiment; Geographically-distributed work; Scientific collaboratory; Human computer interaction

The defining features of these diagrams are nodes, represented by a circle or rectangle connected by links usually represented by some form of line or arrow. We investigate the proposition that drawing threedimensional shaded elements instead of using simple lines and outlines will result in diagrams that are easier to interpret. A set of guidelines for such diagrams is derived from perception theory and these collectively define the concept of the geon diagram.We also introduce a new substructure identification task for evaluating diagrams and use it to test the effectiveness of geon diagrams. The results from five experiments are reported. In the first three experiments geon diagrams are compared to Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. The results show that substructures can be identified in geon diagrams with approximately half the errors and significantly faster. The results also show that geon diagrams can be recalled much more reliably than structurally equivalentUMLdiagrams. In the final two experiments geon diagrams are compared with diagrams having the same outline but not constructed with shaded solids. This is designed to specifically test the importance of using 3D shaded primitives. The results also show that substructures can be identified much more accurately with shaded components than with 2D outline equivalents and remembered more reliably.

Reading patterns and usability in visualizations of electronic documents,2003,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042852638&doi=10.1145%2f772047.772050&partnerID=40&md5=7b1b74168e12dfdc47a009636f51562a,"We present an exploration of reading patterns and usability in visualizations of electronic documents. Twenty subjects wrote essays and answered questions about scientific documents using an overview+detail, a fisheye, and a linear interface. We study reading patterns by progression maps that visualize the progression of subjects' reading activity, and by visibility maps that show for how long different parts of the document are visible. The reading patterns help explain differences in usability between the interfaces and show how interfaces affect the way subjects read. With the overview+detail interface, subjects get higher grades for their essays. All but one of the subjects prefer this interface. With the fisheye interface, subjects use more time on gaining an overview of the document and less time on reading the details. Thus, they read the documents faster, but display lower incidental learning. We also show how subjects only briefly have visible the parts of the document that are not initially readable in the fisheye interface, even though they express a lack of trust in the algorithm underlying the fisheye interface. When answering questions, the overview is used for jumping directly to answers in the document and to already-visited parts of the document. However, subjects are slower at answering questions with the overview+detail interface. From the visualizations of the reading activity, we find that subjects using the overview+detail interface often explore the document further even when a satisfactory answer to the given question has already been read. Thus, overviews may grab subjects' attention and possibly distract them.",Digital documents; Electronic documents; Fisheye interface; Information retrieval; Information visualization; Overview+detail interface; Reading; Reading patterns,Algorithms; Computer graphics; Data reduction; Information retrieval; User interfaces; Visualization; World Wide Web; Digital documents; Electronic documents; Fisheye interface; Information visualization; Reading patterns; Human computer interaction

The presented method accommodates the design of scanning interfaces with modern programming tools, leading to flexible interfaces with improved appearance and it is based on the use of specially designed software objects called ""wifsids"" (Widgets For Single-switch Input Devices). The wifsid structure is demonstrated and 4 types of wifsids are analyzed. Developed software applications are to be operated by single-switch activations that are captured through the wifsids, with the employment of several modes of the scanning technique. We also demonstrate the ""Autonomia"" software application, that has been developed according to the specific methodology. The basic snapshots of this application are analyzed, in order to demonstrate how the wifsids cooperate with the scanning process in a user-friendly environment that enables a quadriplegic person to access an ordinary computer system.",Accessibility; Assistive technology; Augmentative communications; Disability; Graphical keyboard; Motor-impaired users; Mouse simulation; Quadriplegic people; Scanning selection; Single-switch input; Wifsid; Word-prediction,Computer programming languages; Computer systems; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Feedback; Scanning; User interfaces; Accessibility; Assistive technology; Motor-impaired users; Mouse simulation; Quadriplegic people; Human computer interaction

Information scent is a theoretical construct that captures one kind of interaction between task and display. Information scent is provided by task-relevant display cues, such as node labels on a tree that influence a user's visual search behavior and navigation decisions. An empirical Accuracy of Scent (AOS) score was developed to characterize a set of tasks that required users to find (Retrieval Tasks) or compare (Comparison Tasks) information in tree structures. Two experiments investigated the effect of information scent (tasks with different AOS scores) on performance with the Hyperbolic Tree Browser and the Microsoft Windows File Browser, which is a widely available conventional browser. Experiment 1 found no overall difference in performance time between the two browsers, but did reveal a marginal interaction of information scent with browser performance on Retrieval Tasks. On high AOS tasks the Hyperbolic showed faster performance, but on low AOS tasks theWindows File Browser showed faster performance. Experiment 2 focused only on the Retrieval tasks and revealed that Hyperbolic Tree users examined more tree nodes at a faster rate and visually searched through the tree hierarchy at a faster rate than users of a Windows File Browser lookalike, however, visual search paths were shortened in dense areas of the Hyperbolic Tree display when information scent was low. Two processes appear to affect visual search in the Hyperbolic display: strong information scent improves visual search, and the crowding of targets in a compressed region degrades visual search especially when there is weak information scent. © 2003, ACM.

During diagram manipulation a constraint solver uses these geometric constraints to maintain the diagram's semantics. We introduce the Penguins system. This automates the development of graphical editors that support the intelligent diagram metaphor. It takes a grammatical specification of a particular diagram language and generates an editor specialized for the creation, manipulation and parsing of diagrams in that visual language. We extend previous research in this area by allowing more expressive grammars, performing automatic error correction, and detailing how efficient incremental parsing has been achieved. We also provide an empirical evaluation of the system. This shows that the system can be used to generate customized editors for a wide variety of diagram languages, ranging from state transition diagrams to mathematical equations, with real-time incremental parsing and error correction.",Constraint multi-set grammars; Constraint solving; Diagram interaction; Diagram parsing; Intelligent diagram; Pen-based computing,Computer graphics; Computer software; Constraint theory; Error correction; Intelligent control; Semantics; Constraint multi-set grammers; Constraint solving; Diagram parsing; Disgram interaction; Pen-based computing; Human computer interaction

They do this by mining and redistributing information from computational records of social activity such as Usenet messages, system usage history, citations, or hyperlinks. Some general questions for evaluating such systems are: (1) is the extracted information valuable? and (2) do interfaces based on the information improve user task performance? We report here on TopicShop, a system that mines information from the structure and content of Web pages and provides an exploratory information workspace interface. We carried out experiments that yielded positive answers to both evaluation questions. First, a number of automatically computable features about Web sites do a good job of predicting expert quality judgments about sites. Second, compared to popular Web search interfaces, the TopicShop interface to this information lets users select significantly more high-quality sites, in less time and with less effort, and to organize the sites they select into personally meaningful collections more quickly and easily. We conclude by discussing how our results may be applied and considering how they touch on general issues concerning quality, expertise, and consensus. © 2003, ACM.

To exploit these modalities in HCI, we need to understand the interplay between them and the way in which they support communication. We propose a framework for the gesture research done to date, and present our work on the cross-modal cues for discourse segmentation in free-form gesticulation accompanying speech in natural conversation as a new paradigm for such multimodal interaction. The basis for this integration is the psycholinguistic concept of the coequal generation of gesture and speech from the same semantic intent.We present a detailed case study of a gesture and speech elicitation experiment in which a subject describes her living space to an interlocutor. We perform two independent sets of analyses on the video and audio data: video and audio analysis to extract segmentation cues, and expert transcription of the speech and gesture data by microanalyzing the videotape using a frame-accurate videoplayer to correlate the speech with the gestural entities.We compare the results of both analyses to identify the cues accessible in the gestural and audio data that correlate well with the expert psycholinguistic analysis. We show that “handedness” and the kind of symmetry in two-handed gestures provide effective supersegmental discourse cues. © 2002, ACM.

Thirty-two subjects solved navigation and browsing tasks on two maps. We found no difference between interfaces in subjects' ability to solve tasks correctly. Eighty percent of the subjects preferred the interface with an overview, stating that it supported navigation and helped keep track of their position on the map. However, subjects were faster with the interface without an overview when using one of the two maps. We conjecture that this difference was due to the organization of that map in multiple levels, which rendered the overview unnecessary by providing richer navigation cues through semantic zooming. The combination of that map and the interface without an overview also improved subjects' recall of objects on the map. Subjects who switched between the overview and the detail windows used more time, suggesting that integration of overview and detail windows adds complexity and requires additional mental and motor effort. © 2002, ACM.

However, supporting undo in collaborative applications is technically challenging and none of the existing group undo solutions is able to offer such a capability. In this article, we contribute an undo solution with such a capability for group text editors. The basic idea is to interpret an undo command as a concurrent inverse operation by means of operational transformation. To cope with the high complexity of group undo, a generic undo framework has been adopted to separate undo policy from the undo mechanism and to separate transformation control algorithms from transformation functions. The proposed undo solution consists of a generic transformation control algorithm that is capable of generating, transforming, and representing valid inverse operations in any context, and a set of transformation functions that are capable of preserving undo-related transformation conditions and properties. Formal proofs are provided to show the correctness of the undo transformation control algorithm in achieving the required undo effect, undo property, and consistency properties. Solutions to the known undo puzzles are provided to show soundness of the transformation functions. AWeb-based group text editor REDUCE (REal-time Distributed Unconstrained Cooperative Editing) has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the proposed undo and other technical solutions. The proposed undo solution is generally applicable to collaborative applications that support concurrent insertion and deletion on shared documents consisting of one or multiple dimensions of linearly ordered data objects with positional references. © 2002, ACM.

A dynamic moving background was provided by a large screen TV and an untidy bookshelf was used to provide a complex static background.With the TV background large effects were found attributable to both rivalry and visual interference. These two effects were roughly additive. Smaller effects were found with the bookshelf. In conclusion we suggest that monocular transparent HMDs may be unsuitable for use in visually dynamic environments. However when backgrounds are relatively static, having a transparent display may be preferable to having an opaque display. © 2002, ACM.

Symmetric and Asymmetric Action Integration During Cooperative Object Manipulation in Virtual Environments,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10044236131&doi=10.1145%2f586081.586084&partnerID=40&md5=a60bf0432657be1f4ed2b912d5aa8589,"Cooperation between multiple users in a virtual environment (VE) can take place at one of three levels. These are defined as where users can perceive each other (Level 1), individually change the scene (Level 2), or simultaneously act on and manipulate the same object (Level 3). Despite representing the highest level of cooperation, multiuser object manipulation has rarely been studied. This paper describes a behavioral experiment in which the piano movers' problem (maneuvering a large object through a restricted space) was used to investigate object manipulation by pairs of participants in a VE. Participants' interactions with the object were integrated together either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former only allowed the common component of participants' actions to take place, but the latter used the mean. Symmetric action integration was superior for sections of the task when both participants had to perform similar actions, but if participants had to move in different ways (e.g., one maneuvering him/herself through a narrow opening while the other traveled down a wide corridor) then asymmetric integration was superior. With both forms of integration, the extent to which participants coordinated their actions was poor and this led to a substantial cooperation overhead (the reduction in performance caused by having to cooperate with another person). © 2002, ACM.

A Scalable Method for Deductive Generalization in the Spreadsheet Paradigm,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-45849150561&doi=10.1145%2f586081.586083&partnerID=40&md5=1993aa92432ae079ddbf6a33f7e31f37,"In this paper, we present an efficient method for automatically generalizing programs written in spreadsheet languages. The strategy is to do generalization through incremental analysis of logical relationships among concrete program entities from the perspective of a particular computational goal. The method uses deductive dataflow analysis with algebraic back-substitution rather than inference with heuristics, and there is no need for generalization-related dialog with the user. We present the algorithms and their time complexities and show that, because the algorithms perform their analyses incrementally, on only the on-screen program elements rather than on the entire program, the method is scalable. Performance data is presented to help demonstrate the scalability. © 2002, ACM.

Introduction to The New Usability,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013693794&doi=10.1145%2f513665.513666&partnerID=40&md5=f86df642614cc79408489cf0c301c9a5,"This paper introduces the motivation for and concept of the “new usability” and positions it against existing approaches to usability. It is argued that the contexts of emerging products and systems mean that traditional approaches to usability engineering and evaluation are likely to prove inappropriate to the needs of “digital consumers.” The paper briefly reviews the contributions to this special issue in terms of their relation to the idea of the “new usability” and their individual approaches to dealing with contemporary usability issues. This helps provide a background to the “new usability” research agenda, and the paper ends by posing what are argued to be the central challenges facing the area and those which lie at the heart of the proposed research agenda. © 2002, ACM.

The Usability of Everyday Technology-Emerging and Fading Opportunities,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013685819&doi=10.1145%2f513665.513667&partnerID=40&md5=794a8534f724bb6989cb854db8c1bbd0,"Current work in the field of usability tends to focus on snapshots of use as the basis for evaluating designs. However, giving due consideration to the fact that everyday use of technology involves a process of evolution, we set out to investigate how the design of the technology may be used to support this. Based on a long-term empirical study of television use in the homes of two families, we illustrate how use continuously develops in a complex interplay between the users' expectations—as they are formed and triggered by the design—and the needs and context of use per se. We analyze the empirical data from the perspective of activity theory. This framework serves to highlight how use develops, and it supports our analysis and discussion about how design, the users' backgrounds, previous experience, and needs, and the specific context of use supports or hinders the development of use. Moreover, we discuss how the characteristics of the home settings, in which the televisions studied were situated, represent a challenge to usability work. The concluding discussion leads to a set of hypotheses relevant to designers and researchers who wish to tackle some of the aspects of usability of particular importance to development in the use of home technology. © 2002, ACM.

The design collaboratorium has been developed as a reaction to the failing capabilities of classical usability methods to cope with ubiquitous technologies. It has borrowed elements from participatory design and developed them further to become useful in large-scale industrial development organizations. The design collaboratorium will be presented through examples from a joint project: a vision project concerning wastewater treatment technology. In light of the case, we will discuss the philosophy underlying the design collaboratorium in further detail: the collaboration between active participants, the role of design artifacts, and the room as a meeting ground. Finally we lay out the working method and propose directions for future usability competencies. © 2002, ACM.

From Use to Presence: On the Expressions and Aesthetics of Everyday Computational Things,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959685278&doi=10.1145%2f513665.513668&partnerID=40&md5=392c4b1d117c9cdf49723d28b9b6ff9f,"The coming ubiquity of computational things urges us to consider what it means for something to be present in someone's life, in contrast to being just used for something. “Use” and “presence” represent two perspectives on what a thing is. While “use” refers to a general description of a thing in terms of what it is used for, “presence” refers to existential definitions of a thing based on how we invite and accept it as a part of our lifeworld. Searching for a basis on which these existential definitions are formed, we argue that the expressions of things are central for accepting them as present in our lives. We introduce the notion of an expressional, referring to a thing designed to be the bearer of certain expressions, just as an appliance is designed to be the bearer of a certain functionality. Aesthetics, as a logic of expressions, can provide a proper foundation for design for presence. We discuss the expressiveness of computational things as depending both on time structures and space structures. An aesthetical leitmotif for the design of computational things—a leitmotif that may be used to guide a normative design philosophy, or a design style—is described. Finally, we describe a practical example of what designing a mobile phone as an “expressional” might be like. © 2002, ACM.

By entering into contractual relationships with service-providers, and by using network-based services, users interact with a larger system—one that has social and technological components. The operation of the wireless telephone requires the assimilation of heterogeneous sources of information from the device manufacturer, sales people, customer service representatives, marketing people, and members of the popular media, among others, which can easily confound users' understanding of this new class of technology. Opportunities for usability problems therefore scale beyond the handset, as do opportunities for better design. We report the results of a study of 19 novice wireless phone users who were closely tracked for the first 6 weeks after service acquisition. Taking a technology-as-system analytical approach, we describe the wireless telephony system as four socio-technical components: hardware, software, “netware,” and “bizware.” This particular organization of the system is intended for the practical application of designing for usability. © 2002, ACM.

Consistency maintenance in the face of concurrent accesses to shared objects is one of the core issues in the design of these types of systems. In this article, we propose an object-level multiversioning approach to consistency maintenance in real-time collaborative graphic editors. This approach is novel in achieving intention preservation and convergence, in preserving the work concurrently produced by multiple users in the face of conflict, and in minimizing the number of object versions for conflict resolution. Major technical contributions of this work include a formal specification of a unique combined effect for an arbitrary group of conflict and compatible operations, a distributed algorithm for incremental creation of multiple object versions, a consistent object identification scheme for multiple object versions, and a convergent layering scheme for overlapping objects.

The Importance of Translucence in Mobile Computing Systems,2002,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974530506&doi=10.1145%2f505151.505153&partnerID=40&md5=6abbcfacc985c7b5397d1d078e5db797,"Mobile computing has been an active area of research for the past decade, but its importance will increase substantially in the decade to come. One problem faced by designers of mobile systems is that of maintaining the illusion of connectivity even when network performance is poor or nonexistent. The Coda file system uses its cache to maintain this illusion. Extensive experience with the system suggests that, although users find the functionality provided by the system extremely valuable, new users face an arduous learning curve and even experienced users are sometimes confused by the system's behavior. The fundamental problem is that the lack of a strong network connection causes the system to violate a key property of caching: transparency. To overcome this problem, we have built an interface, called the CodaConsole, that makes caching translucent to users through controlled exposure of cache management internals. The interface exposes critical aspects of caching to support the mobile user while hiding noncritical details to preserve usability. This article presents the design, implementation, and usability evaluation of this interface. The CodaConsole successfully makes caching translucent in the presence of disconnected or weakly connected operation. The most surprising result was that novice Coda users performed almost as well as experienced Coda users. © 2002, ACM.

Previous constraint solvers designed for user interface applications cannot handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities efficiently. This is a major limitation, as such systems of constraints arise often in natural declarative specifications. We describe Cassowary—an incremental algorithm based on the dual simplex method, which can solve such systems of constraints efficiently. We have implemented the algorithm as part of a constraint-solving toolkit. We discuss the implementation of the toolkit, its application programming interface, and its performance. © 2001, ACM.

The system provides users an intelligent environment that automatically retrieves and displays digital information corresponding to the real objects (e.g., books) on the desk by using computer vision. The system also provides users direct manipulation of digital information by using the users' own hands and fingers for more natural and more intuitive interaction. Based on the experiments with our first prototype system, some critical issues on augmented desk systems were identified when trying to pursue rapid and fine recognition of hands and fingers. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel method for realtime finger tracking on an augmented desk system by introducing a infrared camera, pattern matching with normalized correlation, and a pan-tilt camera. We then show an interface prototype on EnhancedDesk. It is an application to a computer-supported learning environment, named Interactive Textbook. The system shows how effective the integration of paper and digital information is and how natural and intuitive direct manipulation of digital information with users' hands and fingers is. © 2001, ACM.

This article presents a study of mobile workers that highlights different facets of access to remote people and information, and different facets of anytime, anywhere. Four key factors in mobile work are identified: the role of planning, working in “dead time,” accessing remote technological and informational resources, and monitoring the activities of remote colleagues. By reflecting on these issues, we can better understand the role of technology and artifacts in mobile work and identify the opportunities for the development of appropriate technological solutions to support mobile workers. © 2001, ACM.

Applying Cartoon Animation Techniques to Graphical User Interfaces,2001,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014718986&doi=10.1145%2f502907.502909&partnerID=40&md5=1e6a49b78e5a26b08e4b29ece1ceb852,"If judiciously applied, animation techniques can enhance the look and feel of computer applications that present a graphical human interface. Such techniques can smooth the rough edges and abrupt transitions common in many current graphical interfaces, and strengthen the illusion of direct manipulation that many interfaces strive to present. To date, few applications include such animation techniques. One possible reason is that animated interfaces are difficult to implement: they are difficult to design, place great burdens on programmers, and demand high-performance from underlying graphics systems. This article describes how direct manipulation human computer interfaces can be augmented with techniques borrowed from cartoon animators. In particular, we wish to improve the visual feedback of a direct manipulation interface by smoothing the changes of an interface, giving manipulated objects a feeling of substance and providing cues that anticipate the result of a manipulation. Our approach is to add support for animation techniques such as object distortion and keyframe interpolation, and to provide prepackaged animation effects such as animated widgets for common user interface interactions. To determine if these tools and techniques are practical and effective, we built a prototype direct manipulation drawing editor with an animated interface and used the prototype editor to carry out a set of human factors experiments. The experiments show that the techniques are practical even on standard workstation hardware, and that the effects can indeed enhance direct manipulation interfaces. © 2001, ACM.

We examined the reasons people collect paper, types of data they collect, problems encountered in handling paper, and strategies used for processing it. We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office move. The greater availability of public digital data along with changes in people's jobs or interests should lead to wholescale discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead we found workers kept large, highly valued paper archives. We also expected that the major part of people's personal archives would be unique documents. However, only 49% of people's archives were unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure. We discovered different paper-processing strategies (filing and piling) that were relatively independent of job type. We predicted that filers' attempts to evaluate and categorize incoming documents would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage in premature filing: to clear their workspace, they archive information that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved in organizing data, they are also loath to discard filed information, even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of this research for digital personal information management. © 2001, ACM.

Two structures are examined—labeled visual hierarchies (groups of objects with one label per group) and unlabeled visual hierarchies (groups without labels). Search and selection times were separated by imposing a point-completion deadline that discouraged participants from moving the mouse until they found the target. The observed search times indicate that labeled visual hierarchies can be searched much more efficiently than unlabeled visual hierarchies, and suggest that people use a fundamentally different strategy for each of the two structures. The results have implications for screen layout design and cognitive modeling of visual search. The observed mouse-pointing times suggest that people use a slower and more accurate speed-accuracy operating characteristic to select a target with a mouse when visual distractors are present, which suggests that Fitts' law coefficients derived from standard mouse-pointing experiments may under-predict mouse-pointing times for typical human-computer interactions. The observed mouse-pointing times also demonstrate that mouse movement times for a two-dimensional pointing task can be most-accurately predicted by setting the w in Fitts' law to the width of the target along the line of approach. © 2001, ACM.

We introduce a “knowledge/usability graph,” which shows the impact of even a small amount of knowledge for the user, and the extent to which designers' knowledge may bias their views of usability. Markov models can be built into design tools, and can therefore be made very convenient for designers to utilize. One would hope that in the future, design tools would include such mathematical analysis, and no new design skills would be required to evaluate devices.

Using Model Dataflow Graphs to Reduce the Storage Requirements of Constraints,2001,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27544474451&doi=10.1145%2f502907.502910&partnerID=40&md5=d88760725f7a30cb9c1b2dbe3e5aa00b,"Dataflow constraints allow programmers to easily specify relationships among application objects in a natural, declarative manner. Most constraint solvers represent these dataflow relationships as directed edges in a dataflow graph. Unfortunately, dataflow graphs require a great deal of storage. Consequently, an application with a large number of constraints can get pushed into virtual memory, and performance degrades in interactive applications. Our solution is based on the observation that objects derived from the same class use the same constraints, and thus have the same dataflow graphs. We represent the common dataflow patterns in a model dataflow graph that is stored with the class. Instance objects may derive explicit dependencies from this graph when the dependencies are needed. Model dependencies provide a useful new mechanism for improving the storage efficiency of dataflow constraint systems, especially when a large number of constrained objects must be managed. © 2001, ACM.

Previous work hypothesized that switching modality could speed up interactive correction of recognition errors. This article presents multimodal error correction methods that allow the user to correct recognition errors efficiently without keyboard input. Correction accuracy is maximized by novel recognition algorithms that use context information for recognizing correction input. Multimodal error correction is evaluated in the context of a prototype multimodal dictation system. The study shows that unimodal repair is less accurate than multimodal error correction. On a dictation task, multimodal correction is faster than unimodal correction by respeaking. The study also provides empirical evidence that system-initiated error correction (based on confidence measures) may not expedite error correction. Furthermore, the study suggests that recognition accuracy determines user choice between modalities: while users initially prefer speech, they learn to avoid ineffective correction modalities with experience. To extrapolate results from this user study, the article introduces a performance model of (recognition-based) multimodal interaction that predicts input speed including time needed for error correction. Applied to interactive error correction, the model predicts the impact of improvements in recognition technology on correction speeds, and the influence of recognition accuracy and correction method on the productivity of dictation systems. This model is a first step toward formalizingmultimodal interaction. © 2001, ACM.

The interaction styles were experimentally compared to determine if either method was superior to the other in terms of speed, error rate, or user preference, for children. The two interaction styles were also compared based on children's achievement and motivation, within a commercial software environment. Experiment I used an interactive learning environment as children played two versions of an educational puzzle-solving game, each version utilizing a different mouse interaction style; Experiment II used a mouse-controlled software environment modeled after the educational game. The results were similar to previous results reported for adults: the point-and-click interaction style was faster; fewer errors were committed using it; and it was preferred over the drag-and-drop interaction style. Within the context of the puzzle-solving game, the children solved significantly fewer puzzles, and they were less motivated using the version that utilized a drag-and-drop interaction style as compared to the version that utilized a point-and-click interaction style. These results were also explored through the use of state-transition diagrams and GOMS models, both of which supported the experimental data gathered. © 2001, ACM.

Role of Interface Manipulation Style and Scaffolding on Cognition and Concept Learning in Learnware,2001,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038207127&doi=10.1145%2f371127.371159&partnerID=40&md5=b4bae2464f48bc69a755950de0163afb,"This research investigates the role of interface manipulation style on reflective cognition and concept learning through a comparison of the effectiveness of three versions of a software application for learning two-dimensional transformation geometry. The three versions respectively utilize a Direct Object Manipulation (DOM) interface in which the user manipulates the visual representation of objects being transformed; a Direct Concept Manipulation (DCM) interface in which the user manipulates the visual representation of the transformation being applied to the object; and a Reflective Direct Concept Manipulation (RDCM) interface in which the DCM approach is extended with scaffolding. Empirical results of a study showed that grade-6 students using the RDCM version learned significantly more than those using the DCM version, who in turn learned significantly more than those using the DOM version. Students using the RDCM version had to process information consciously and think harder than those using the DCM and DOM versions. Despite the relative difficulty when using the RDCM interface style, all three groups expressed a similar (positive) level of liking for the software. This research suggests that some of the educational deficiencies of Direct Manipulation (DM) interfaces are not necessarily caused by their “directness,” but by what they are directed at-in this case directness toward objects rather than embedded educational concepts being learned.

Inhabited Television: Broadcasting Interaction from within Collaborative Virtual Environments,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038341527&doi=10.1145%2f365058.365095&partnerID=40&md5=29a585e48826f8fb2c5cdf3b2d953435,"Inhabited television combines collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) with broadcast television so that on-line audiences can participate in television shows within shared virtual worlds. We describe a series of experiments with inhabited television, beginning with the NOWninety6 poetry performance, The Mirror, and Heaven & Hell—Live. These early experiments raised fundamental questions for inhabited television concerning the extent to which it is possible to establish fast-paced social interaction within a CVE, and to which it is possible to produce a coherent and engaging broadcast of this action. We then present a fourth more recent experiment, Out of This World, that directly addressed these questions. We describe how the formulation of inhabited television design principles, combined with the use of dedicated production software for scripting and directing a show and for controlling virtual cameras, enabled us to create a fast-moving and more coherent experience. © 2000, ACM.

Using While Moving: HCI Issues in Fieldwork Environments,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0003347851&doi=10.1145%2f355324.355329&partnerID=40&md5=eda36d6298352416803764dd0fcb4b07,"“Using while moving” is the basic ability fieldwork users require of a mobile computer system. These users come from a wide range of backgrounds but have in common an extremely mobile and dynamic workplace. We identify four specific characteristics of this class of users: dynamic user configuration, limited attention capacity, high-speed interaction, and context dependency. A prototype is then presented that was designed to assist fieldworkers in data collection tasks and to explore the HCI design issues involved. The prototype was used in an extensive field trial by a group of ecologists observing giraffe behavior in Kenya. Following this trial, improvements were made to the prototype interface which in turn was tested in a subsequent field trial with another group of ecologists. From this experience, we have formulated our resulting ideas about interface design for fieldworkers into two general principles: Minimal Attention User Interfaces (MAUIs) and context awareness. The MAUI seeks to minimize the attention, though not necessarily the number of interactions, required from the user in operating a device. Context awareness enables the mobile device to provide assistance based on a knowledge of its environment. © 2000, ACM.

Nomadic Radio: Speech and Audio Interaction for Contextual Messaging in Nomadic Environments,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67349207836&doi=10.1145%2f355324.355327&partnerID=40&md5=911909731cf23117f2ef7bcba2c103d6,"Mobile workers need seamless access to communication and information services while on the move. However, current solutions overwhelm users with intrusive interfaces and ambiguous notifications. This article discusses the interaction techniques developed for Nomadic Radio, a wearable computing platform for managing voice and text-based messages in a nomadic environment. Nomadic Radio employs an auditory user interface, which synchronizes speech recognition, speech synthesis, nonspeech audio, and spatial presentation of digital audio, for navigating among messages as well as asynchronous notification of newly arrived messages. Emphasis is placed on an auditory modality as Nomadic Radio is designed to be used while performing other tasks in a user's everyday environment; a range of auditory cues provides peripheral awareness of incoming messages. Notification is adaptive and context sensitive; messages are presented as more or less obtrusive based on importance inferred from content filtering, whether the user is engaged in conversation and his or her own recent responses to prior messages. Auditory notifications are dynamically scaled from ambient sound through recorded voice cues up to message summaries. Iterative design and a preliminary user evaluation suggest that audio is an appropriate medium for mobile messaging, but that care must be taken to minimally intrude on the wearer's social and physical environment. © 2000, ACM.

The aim of the experiment was to investigate if added haptic force feedback in such an environment affects perceived virtual presence, perceived social presence, perceived task performance, and task performance. A between-group design was employed, where seven pairs of subjects used an interface with graphic representation of the environment, audio connection, and haptic force feedback. Seven other pairs of subjects used an interface without haptic force feedback, but with identical features otherwise. The PHANToM, a one-point haptic device, was used for the haptic force feedback, and a program especially developed for the purpose provided the virtual environment. The program enables for two individuals placed in different locations to simultaneously feel and manipulate dynamic objects in a shared desktop virtual environment. Results show that haptic force feedback significantly improves task performance, perceived task performance, and perceived virtual presence in the collaborative distributed environment. The results suggest that haptic force feedback increases perceived social presence, but the difference is not significant. © 2000, ACM.

We describe “Satchel,” a system that is designed specifically to support the distinctive features of mobile document work. Satchel is designed to meet the following five high-level design goals: (1) easy access to document services; (2) timely document access; (3) streamlined user interface; (4) ubiquity; and (5) compliance with security policies. Our current prototype uses a Nokia 9000 Communicator as the mobile device; it communicates to the rest of the Satchel system using wireless communications, both infrared and radio. A fundamental Satchel concept is the use of tokens, or small secure references, to represent documents on the mobile device. The mobile client only transmits small tokens over the wireless channels, leaving the wired network to transmit the contents of documents when, and only when, they are required. Another fundamental Satchel concept is the highly specialized and context-sensitive user interface on the mobile device. The user's interactions are streamlined because of this specialization and through the use of contextual information gained by using infrared communications. We report the results of a trial of Satchel that was carried out within our own company, and discuss how well Satchel met our design goals. We call Satchel a “document appliance” because it provides a streamlined solution to the problem of remote document access—it aims to support only a limited set of activities, but supports them very well. © 2000, ACM.

An Experimental Study on the Role of Touch in Shared Virtual Environments,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952678400&doi=10.1145%2f365058.365082&partnerID=40&md5=157d3ca361102a749efadf9c1b5e9b0c,"Investigating virtual environments has become an increasingly interesting research topic for engineers, computer and cognitive scientists, and psychologists. Although there have been several recent studies focused on the development of multimodal virtual environments (VEs) to study human-machine interactions, less attention has been paid to human-human and human-machine interactions in shared virtual environments (SVEs), and to our knowledge, no attention paid at all to what extent the addition of haptic communication between people would contribute to the shared experience. We have developed a multimodal shared virtual environment and performed a set of experiments with human subjects to study the role of haptic feedback in collaborative tasks and whether haptic communication through force feedback can facilitate a sense of being and collaborating with a remote partner. The study concerns a scenario where two participants at remote sites must cooperate to perform a joint task in an SVE. The goals of the study are (1) to assess the impact of force feedback on task performance, (2) to better understand the role of haptic communication in human-human interactions, (3) to study the impact of touch on the subjective sense of collaborating with a human as reported by the participants based on what they could see and feel, and (4) to investigate if gender, personality, or emotional experiences of users can affect haptic communication in SVEs. The outcomes of this research can have a powerful impact on the development of next-generation human-computer interfaces and network protocols that integrate touch and force feedback technology into the Internet, development of protocols and techniques for collaborative teleoperation such as hazardous material removal, space station repair, and remote surgery, and enhancement of virtual environments for performing collaborative tasks in shared virtual worlds on a daily basis such as cooperative teaching, training, planning and design, cybergames, and social gatherings. Our results suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves the task performance and contributes to the feeling of “sense of togetherness” in SVEs. In addition, the results show that the experience of visual feedback only at first, and then subsequently visual plus haptic feedback, elicits a better performance than presentation of visual plus haptic feedback first followed by visual feedback only. © 2000, ACM.

It considers a range of context-related issues and focus on location as a key issue for mobile systems. A design framework is described consisting of taxonomies of location, mobility, population, and device awareness. The design framework informs the construction of a semantic model of space for mobile systems. The semantic model is reflected in a computational model built on a distributed platform that allows contextual information to be shared across a number of mobile devices. The framework supports the design of interactive mobile systems while the platform supports their rapid development. © 2000, ACM.

Improving Selection Performance on Pen-Based Systems: A Study of Pen-Based Interaction for Selection Tasks,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013709517&doi=10.1145%2f355324.355328&partnerID=40&md5=ed2b0b05c74e8c3f9590445e510e9436,"Two experiments were conducted to compare pen-based selection strategies and their characteristics. Two state transition models were also formulated which provide new vocabulary that will help in investigating interactions related to target selection issues. Six strategies, which can be described by the state transition models, were used in the experiments. We determined the best strategy of the six to be the “Slide Touch” strategy, where the target is selected at the moment the pen-tip touches the target for the first time after landing on the screen surface. The six strategies were also classified into strategy groups according to their characteristics. We determined the best strategy group to be the “In-Out” strategy group, where the target is selected by contact either inside or outside the target. Analyses show that differences between strategies are influenced by variations in target size; however, the differences between strategies are not affected by the distance to the target (i.e., pen-movement-distance) or the direction of pen movement (i.e., pen-movement-direction). We also found “the smallest maximum size” of five pixels, i.e., the boundary value for the target size below which there are significant differences, and above which there are no significant differences between the strategies in error rate. Relationships between interaction states, routes, and strategy efficiency were also investigated. © 2000, ACM.

Observations include: problems due to “fragmented” views of embodiments in relation to shared objects; participants compensating with spoken accounts of their actions; and difficulties in understanding others' perspectives. Implications and proposals for the design of CVEs drawn from these observations are: the use of semidistorted views to support peripheral awareness; more explicit or exaggerated representations of actions than are provided by pseudohumanoid avatars; and navigation techniques that are sensitive to the actions of others. The paper also presents some examples of the ways in which these proposals might be realized. © 2000, ACM.

Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers-virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the “desktop” box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interfaces on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, pagers, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall-size computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refrigerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems. Other changes we see are an increasing need for 3D and end-user customization, programming, and scripting. All of these changes will require significant support from the underlying user interface software tools. © 2000, ACM.

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials. © 2000, ACM.

We call such systems “socially translucent systems” and suggest that they have three characteristics-visibility, awareness, and accountability-which enable people to draw upon their social experience and expertise to structure their interactions with one another. To motivate and focus our ideas we develop a vision of knowledge communities, conversationally based systems that support the creation, management and reuse of knowledge in a social context. We describe our experience in designing and deploying one layer of functionality for knowledge communities, embodied in a working system called “Babble,” and discuss research issues raised by a socially translucent approach to design. © 2000, ACM.

Bringing different and often controversial points of view together to create a shared understanding among these stakeholders can lead to new insights, new ideas, and new artifacts. New media that allow owners of problems to contribute to framing and resolving complex design problems can extend the power of the individual human mind. Based on our past work and study of other approaches, systems, and collaborative and participatory processes, this article identifies challenges we see as the limiting factors for future collaborative human-computer systems. The Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC) is introduced as an integrated physical and computational environment addressing some of these challenges. The vision behind the EDC shifts future development away from the computer as the focal point, toward an emphasis that tries to improve our understanding of the human, social, and cultural system that creates the context for use. This work is based on new conceptual principles that include creating shared understanding among various stakeholders, contextualizing information to the task at hand, and creating objects to think with in collaborative design activities. Although the EDC framework is applicable to different domains; our initial effort has focused on the domain of urban planning (specifically transportation planning) and community development. © 2000, ACM.

For the past decade, application-driven research in ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes: natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitous computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continuous interaction requires addressing interruption and resumption of interaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating ubiquitous computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies-but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary. © 2000, ACM.

On the Effective Use and Reuse of HCI Knowledge,2000,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016910440&doi=10.1145%2f353485.353488&partnerID=40&md5=6958b9a17e482aae448db15a64121713,"The article argues that new approaches for delivering HCI knowledge from theory to designers will be necessary in the new millennium. First the role of theory in HCI design to date is reviewed, including the progress made in cognitive theories of interaction and their impact on the design process. The role of bridging models that build on models of interaction is described, but it is argued that direct application of cognitive theory to design is limited by scalability problems. The alternative of representing HCI knowledge as claims and the role of the task-artefact approach to theory-based design are introduced. Claims are proposed as a possible bridging representation that may enable theories to frame appropriate recommendations for designers and, vice versa, enable designers to ask appropriate questions for theoretical research. However, claims provide design advice grounded in specific scenarios and examples, which limits their generality. The prospects for reuse becoming an important mode of development and the possible directions in generalizing claims for reuse are discussed, including generalizing claims beyond their original context, providing a context for reuse of claims by linking them to generic task and domain models. It is argued that generic models provide a way forward for developing reusable libraries of interactive components. The approach is illustrated from a case study of extracting claims from one information retrieval application, generalizing claims for future reuse in information-searching tasks, and reapplying claims in the Web-based Multimedia Broker application. The article concludes by proposing that HCI knowledge should be theory-grounded, and development of reusable “designerdigestible” packets will be an important contribution in the future. © 2000, ACM.

While interface technologies and heuristic methods for behavioral evaluation have rapidly advanced in both capability and breadth of application, progress toward deeper theory has been modest, and some now believe it to be unnecessary. A case is presented for developing new forms of theory, based around generic “systems of interactors.” An overlapping, layered structure of macro- and microtheories could then serve an explanatory role, and could also bind together contributions from the different disciplines. Novel routes to formalizing and applying such theories provide a host of interesting and tractable problems for future basic research in HCI. © 2000, ACM.

These demands require a relatively unique approach to the design of computer-based support tools. A review of the characteristics associated with the global knowledge-based economy strongly suggests that there will be a increasing need for workers, managers, and organizations to adapt to change and novelty. This is equivalent to a call for designing computer tools that foster continuous learning. There are reasons to believe that the need to support adaptation and continuous learning will only increase. Thus, in the new millennium, HCI should be concerned with explicitly designing for worker adaptation. The cognitive work analysis framework is briefly described as a potential programmatic approach to this practical design challenge. © 2000, ACM.

They have been useful to HCI by predicting task times, by assisting users, and by acting as surrogate users. If cognitive models could interact with the same interfaces that users do, the models would be easier to develop and would be easier to apply as interface testers. This approach can be encapsulated as a cognitive model interface management system (CMIMS), which is analogous to and based on a user interface management system (UIMS). We present five case studies using three different UIMSes. These show how models can interact with interfaces using an interaction mechanism that is designed to apply to all interfaces generated within a UIMS. These interaction mechanisms start to support and constrain performance in the same ways that human performance is supported and constrained by interaction. Most existing UIMSes can and should be extended to create CMIMSes, and models can and should use CMIMSes to look at larger and more complex tasks. CMIMSes will help to further exploit the synergy between the disciplines of cognitive modeling and HCI by supporting cognitive models as users. © 2000, ACM.

Effects of Diagrammatic Representation on the Cognitive Integration Process of Systems Analysis and Design,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886439465&doi=10.1145%2f329693.329694&partnerID=40&md5=c6a92038c20f35a82b09a211736d467f,"Various diagrams have been used heavily in systems analysis and design without proper verification of their usability. However, different diagrammatic representations of the same information may vary in the computational efficiency of working with these diagrams. The objective of this research was to explore the effects of diagrammatic representations on the task of integrating multiple diagrams. The domain of systems analysis and design was used to generate examples and test the theory. A cognitive model of diagram integration was proposed, and an experimental study was conducted, both to explore the effects of representational features of diagrams on the cognitive process of diagram integration. Results of the experiment show that the representational features of the diagrams acted as the criteria for selecting among various methods for analyzing and designing the integrated diagram. In addition, the difference in the selected methods resulted in different task performances in terms of analysis and design errors. This article concludes with the implications of the results for the development of cognitively compelling diagrams. © 1999, ACM.

Rotating Virtual Objects with Real Handles,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001558986&doi=10.1145%2f319091.319102&partnerID=40&md5=17e0ac0c601817604e767073a98db85b,"Times for virtual object rotations reported in the literature are of the order of 10 seconds or more and this is far longer than it takes to manually orient a “real” object, such as a cup. This is a report of a series of experiments designed to investigate the reasons for this difference and to help design interfaces for object manipulation. The results suggest that two major factors are important. Having the hand physically in the same location as the virtual object being manipulated is one. The other is based on whether the object is being rotated to a new, randomly determined orientation, or is always rotated to the same position. Making the object held in the hand have the same physical shape as the object being visually manipulated was not found to be a significant factor. The results are discussed in the context of interactive virtual environments. © 1999, ACM.

An Impact Analysis Method for Safety-Critical User Interface Design,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988832886&doi=10.1145%2f331490.331493&partnerID=40&md5=8c5354d68dec1996970e4113d0b70cd3,"We describe a method of assessing the implications for human error on user interface design of safety-critical systems. In previous work we have proposed a taxonomy of influencing factors that contribute to error. In this article, components of the taxonomy are combined into a mathematical and causal model for error, represented as a Bayesian Belief Net (BBN). The BBN quantifies error influences arising from user knowledge, ability, and the task environment, combined with factors describing the complexity of user action and user interface quality. The BBN model predicts probabilities of different types of error—slips and mistakes— for each component action of a task involving user-system interaction. We propose an Impact Analysis Method that involves running test scenarios against this causal model of error in order to determine user interactions that are prone to different types of error. Applying the proposed method will enable the designer to determine the combinations of influencing factors and their interactions that are most likely to influence human error. Finally we show how such scenario-based causal analysis can be useful as a means of focusing on relevant guidelines for safe user interface design. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study of an operator performing a task using the control system for a laser spectrophotometer. © 1999, ACM.

Is Paper Safer? The Role of Paper Flight Strips in Air Traffic Control,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025384616&doi=10.1145%2f331490.331491&partnerID=40&md5=89b7d2193cbfe508230612f055da2340,"Air traffic control is a complex, safety-critical activity, with well-established and successful work practices. Yet many attempts to automate the existing system have failed because controllers remain attached to a key work artifact: the paper flight strip. This article describes a four-month intensive study of a team of Paris en-route controllers in order to understand their use of paper flight strips. The article also describes a comparison study of eight different control rooms in France and the Netherlands. Our observations have convinced us that we do not know enough to simply get rid of paper strips, nor can we easily replace the physical interaction between controllers and paper strips. These observations highlight the benefits of strips, including qualities difficult to quantify and replicate in new computer systems. Current thinking offers two basic alternatives: maintaining the existing strips without computer support and bearing the financial cost of limiting the air traffic, or replacing the strips with automated versions, which offer potential benefits in terms of increased efficiency through automation, but unknown risks through radical change of work practices. We conclude with a suggestion for a third alternative: to maintain the physical strips, but turn them into the interface to the computer. This would allow controllers to build directly upon their existing, safe work practices with paper strips, while offering them a gradual path for incorporating new computer-based functions. Augmented paper flight strips allow us to take advantage of uniquely human skills in the physical world, and allows us to leave the user interface and its subsequent evolution in the hands of the people most responsible, the air traffic controllers themselves. © 1999, ACM.

A Partial Test of the Task-Medium Fit Proposition in a Group Support System Environment,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977106447&doi=10.1145%2f310641.310643&partnerID=40&md5=d58f4a5f736774fb9597cd872116d72f,"A laboratory experiment was carried out to partially test the task-medium fit proposition in a GSS environment. Communication medium was varied using a face-to-face GSS and a dispersed GSS setting. Task type was varied using an intellective and a preference task. Group decision outcome variables of interest were (actual and perceived) decision quality, decision time, decision satisfaction, and decision process satisfaction. With the intellective task, there were no significant differences between face-to-face GSS and dispersed GSS groups for all group decision outcome variables. With the preference task, face-to-face GSS groups performed significantly better than dispersed GSS groups for all group decision outcome variables. These findings suggest that group decision outcomes in a GSS environment tend to be adversely affected when the communication medium is too lean for the task but not when the communication medium is too rich for the task. Consequences of providing groups with too rich and too lean a communication medium for their task are discussed. Implications of these findings, and other related results, for practice and for future revisions of media richness theory are explored. © 1999, ACM.

Web sites are structured multimedia documents consisting of many pages, and users often are interested in obtaining and evaluating entire collections of topically related sites. Once such a collection is obtained, users face the challenge of exploring, comprehending, and organizing the items. We report four innovations that address these user needs: (1) we replaced the Web page with the Web site as the basic unit of interaction and analysis; (2) we defined a new information structure, the clan graph, that groups together sets of related sites; (3) we augment the representation of a site with a site profile, information about site structure and content that helps inform user evaluation of a site; and (4) we invented a new graph visualization, the auditorium visualization, that reveals important structural and content properties of sites within a clan graph. Detailed analysis and user studies document the utility of this approach. The clan graph construction algorithm tends to filter out irrelevant sites and discover additional relevant items. The auditorium visualization, augmented with drill-down capabilities to explore site profile data, helps users to find high-quality sites as well as sites that serve a particular function. © 1999, ACM.

Particularly, the role of stereoscopic viewing and the use of object motion to reflect the position and size of objects in 3D space have been extensively studied. However, the effective use of computer-rendered object shadows to provide spatial information about the relative position and size of objects in virtual space has not. Subjects perform two tasks with 3D geometric patterns of objects presented on a computer screen: (1) positioning the object to complete a symmetrical geometric figure and (2) resizing the object to match the size of other objects. Performance accuracy and speed are recorded under the following conditions: (1) objects casting shadows on and off, (2) shadows from one or two light sources (nested within the shadows-on condition), (3) stereoscopic and monoscopic viewing, and (4) different scene backgrounds: flat plane (i.e., floor), “stair-step” floor with no walls, and floor with walls (i.e., room). The use of object shadows as depth cues enhances the accuracy (but not the speed) of object positioning, but does not enhance either the accuracy or the speed of object resizing. Moreover, the object shadows are not as effective as stereoscopic viewing in facilitating both positioning-task and resizing-task performances. Furthermore, task performances degrade with the stair-step scene background and when the number of shadowing light sources increases from one to two. © 1999, ACM.

Flexible Collaboration Transparency: Supporting Worker Independence in Replicated Application-Sharing Systems,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024498043&doi=10.1145%2f319091.319096&partnerID=40&md5=d60b94404fc14a6fa2f99faa36d739bc,"This article presents a critique of conventional collaboration transparency systems, also called “application-sharing” systems, which provide the real-time shared use of legacy single-user applications. We find that conventional collaboration transparency systems are inefficient in their use of network resources and lack support for key groupware principles: concurrent work, relaxed WYSIWIS, and group awareness. Next, we present an alternative approach to implementing collaboration transparency that provides many features previously seen only in collaboration-aware applications. Our approach is based on a replicated architecture where selected single-user interface components are dynamically replaced by multiuser versions. The replacement occurs at run-time and is transparent to the single-user application and its developers. As an instance of this approach, we describe its incorporation into a Java-based collaboration transparency system for serializable, Swing-based Java applications, called Flexible JAMM (Java Applets Made Multiuser). To validate that the flexible collaboration transparency system is truly an improvement over conventional systems, we conducted an empirical study of collaborators performing both tightly and loosely coupled tasks using Flexible JAMM versus a representative conventional collaboration transparency system, Microsoft NetMeeting. Completion times were significantly faster in the loosely coupled task using Flexible JAMM and were not adversely affected in the tightly coupled task. Accuracy was equivalent for both systems. Participants greatly preferred Flexible JAMM. © 1999, ACM.

A Software Model and Specification Language for Non-WIMP User Interfaces,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869122870&doi=10.1145%2f310641.310642&partnerID=40&md5=4723b3c8f1cfe489578e7fb1ee219e3c,"We present a software model and language for describing and programming the fine-grained aspects of interaction in a non-WIMP user interface, such as a virtual environment. Our approach is based on our view that the essence of a non-WIMP dialogue is a set of continuous relationships-most of which are temporary. The model combines a data-flow or constraintlike component for the continuous relationships with an event-based component for discrete interactions, which can enable or disable individual continuous relationships. To demonstrate our approach, we present the PMIW user interface management system for non-WIMP interactions, a set of examples running under it, a visual editor for our user interface description language, and a discussion of our implementation and our restricted use of constraints for a performance-driven interactive situation. Our goal is to provide a model and language that captures the formal structure of non-WIMP interactions in the way that various previous techniques have captured command-based, textual, and event-based styles and to suggest that using it need not compromise real-time performance. © 1999, ACM.

However, this structure is very limited in comparison with the rich and varied forms of document interaction and category management in everyday document use. Presto is a prototype document management system providing rich interaction with documents through meaningful, user-level document attributes, such as “Word file,” “published paper,” “shared with Jim,” “about Presto,” or “currently in progress.” Document attributes capture the multiple different roles that a single document might play, and they allow users to rapidly reorganize their document space for the task at hand. They also provide a basis for novel document systems design and new approaches to document management and interaction. In this article, we outline the motivations behind this approach, describe the principal components of our implementation, discuss architectural consequences, and show how these support new forms of interaction with large personal document spaces. © 1999, ACM.

The Effects of Workspace Awareness Support on the Usability of Real-Time Distributed Groupware,1999,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013155457&doi=10.1145%2f329693.329696&partnerID=40&md5=490a6a2bf543e89a72188bcdabbbdb64,"Real-time collaboration in current distributed groupware workspaces is often an awkward and clumsy process. We hypothesize that better support for workspace awareness-the understanding of who is in the workspace, where they are working, and what they are doing-can improve the usability of these shared computational workspaces. We conducted an experiment that compared people's performance on two versions of a groupware interface. The interfaces used workspace miniatures to provide different levels of support for workspace awareness. The basic miniature showed information only about the local user, and the enhanced miniature showed the location and activity of other people in the workspace as well. We examined five aspects of groupware usability: task completion times, communication efficiency, the participants' perceived-effort, overall preference, and strategy use. In two of three task types tested, completion times were lower in the awareness-enhanced system, and in one task type, communication was more efficient. The additional awareness information also allowed people to use different and more effective strategies to complete the tasks. Participants greatly preferred the awareness-enhanced system. The study provides empirical evidence that support for workspace awareness improves the usability of groupware, and uncovers some of the reasons underlying this improvement. © 1999, ACM.

The comparison is performed using three sets of criteria based on task performance, analysis of user deviations and consequent hazards, and coordination. The explicit emphasis on hazards and communication issues, using actual tasks to guide the evaluation, ensures that designers' attention is focused on the interactions where problems are likely to occur.

This suggests that user interface performance and acceptance may increase by adopting a multimodal approach that combines speech and direct manipulation. This effort examined the hypothesis that the speed, accuracy, and acceptance of multimodal speech and direct-manipulation interfaces will increase when the modalities match the perceptual structure of the input attributes. A software prototype that supported a typical biomedical data collection task was developed to test this hypothesis. A group of 20 clinical and veterinary pathologists evaluated the prototype in an experimental setting using repeated measures. The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis that the perceptual structure of an input task is an important consideration when designing a multimodal computer interface. Task completion time, the number of speech errors, and user acceptance improved when interface best matched the perceptual structure of the input attributes. © 1998, ACM.

Manual and Cognitive Benefits of Two-Handed Input,1998,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878742343&doi=10.1145%2f300520.300522&partnerID=40&md5=4fdd684c03fe14a25ef1d8f8627bdece,"One of the recent trends in computer input is to utilize users' natural bimanual motor skills. This article further explores the potential benefits of such two-handed input. We have observed that bimanual manipulation may bring two types of advantages to human-computer interaction: manual and cognitive. Manual benefits come from increased time-motion efficiency, due to the twice as many degrees of freedom simultaneously available to the user. Cognitive benefits arise as a result of reducing the load of mentally composing and visualizing the task at an unnaturally low level which is imposed by traditional unimanual techniques. Area sweeping was selected as our experimental task. It is representative of what one encounters, for example, when sweeping out the bounding box surrounding a set of objects in a graphics program. Such tasks cannot be modeled by Fitts' Law alone and have not been previously studied in the literature. In our experiments, two bimanual techniques were compared with the conventional one-handed GUI approach. Both bimanual techniques employed the two-handed “stretchy” technique first demonstrated by Krueger in 1983. We also incorporated the “Toolglass” technique introduced by Bier et al. in 1993. Overall, the bimanual techniques resulted in significantly faster performance than the status quo one-handed technique, and these benefits increased with the difficulty of mentally visualizing the task, supporting our bimanual cognitive advantage hypothesis. There was no significant difference between the two bimanual techniques. This study makes two types of contributions to the literature. First, practically we studied yet another class of transaction where significant benefits can be realized by applying bimanual techniques. Furthermore, we have done so using easily available commercial hardware in the context to our understanding of why bimanual interaction techniques have an advantage over unimanual techniques. A literature review on two-handed computer input and some of the most relevant bimanual human motor control studes is also included. © 1998, ACM.

By itself, this system is a “point design,” an example of an advanced user interface technique. In this work, we argue that in order to understand why interaction techniques do or do not work, and to suggest possibilities for new techniques, it is important to move beyond point design and to introduce careful scientific measurement of human behavioral principles. In particular, we argue that the common-sense viewpoint that “two hands save time by working in parallel” may not always be an effective way to think about two-handed interface design because the hands do not necessarily work in parallel (there is a structure to two-handed manipulation) and because two hands do more than just save time over one hand (two hands provide the user with more information and can structure how the user thinks about a task). To support these claims, we present an interface design developed in collaboration with neurosurgeons which has undergone extensive informal usability testing, as well as a pair of formal experimental studies which investigate behavioral aspects of two-handed virtual object manipulation. Our hope is that this discussion will help others to apply the lessons learned in our neurosurgery application to future two-handed user interface designs. © 1998, ACM.

Boolean access, which allowed subjects to frame their queries as combinations of keywords, was compared to hypertext access, which allowed subjects to navigate from one database node to another. The accessible biomedical data were identical across system versions. Performance data were collected from two cohorts of first-year medical students, each student randomly assigned to either the Boolean or the hypertext system. Additional attitudinal data were collected from the second cohort. At each of two research sessions (one just before and one just after their bacteriology course), subjects worked eight clinical case problems, first using only their personal knowledge and, subsequently, with aid from the database. Database retrievals enabled students to answer questions they could not answer based on personal knowledge alone. This effect was greater when personal knowledge of bacteriology was lower. There were not statistically significant differences between the two forms of access, in terms of problem-solving effectiveness or efficiency. Students preferred Boolean access over hypertext access. © 1998, ACM.

Moreover, an integrated set of schemes and algorithms, which support the proposed consistency model, are devised and discussed in detail. In particular, we have contributed (1) a novel generic operation transformation control algorithm for achieving intention preservation in combination with schemes for achieving convergence and causality preservation and (2) a pair of reversible inclusion and exclusion transformation algorithms for stringwise operations for text editing.

This inability to conveniently go beyond numbers and strings without straying outside the spreadsheet paradigm has been a limiting factor in the applicability of spreadsheet languages. In this article we present graphical definitions, an approach that removes this limitation, allowing both simple and complex graphical objects to be programmed directly using direct manipulation and gestures, in a manner that fits seamlessly within the spreadsheet paradigm. We also describe an empirical study, in which subjects programmed such objects faster and with fewer errors using this approach than when using a traditional approach to formula specification. Because the approach is expressive enough to be used with both built-in and user-defined types, it allows the directness of demonstrational and spreadsheet techniques to be used in programming a wider range of applications than has been possible before. © 1998, ACM.

Using Nonspeech Sounds to Provide Navigation Cues,1998,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79958141351&doi=10.1145%2f292834.292839&partnerID=40&md5=6fd12850bb0460f611f1226d372255af,"This article describes three experiments that investigate the possibility of using structured nonspeech audio messages called earcons to provide navigational cues in a menu hierarchy. A hierarchy of 27 nodes and four levels was created with an earcon for each node. Rules were defined for the creation of hierarchical earcons at each node. Participants had to identify their location in the hierarchy by listening to an earcon. Results of the first experiment showed that participants could identify their location with 81.5% accuracy, indicating that earcons were a powerful method of communicating hierarchy information. One proposed use for such navigation cues is in telephone-based interfaces (TBIs) where navigation is a problem. The first experiment did not address the particular problems of earcons in TBIs such as “does the lower quality of sound over the telephone lower recall rates,” “can users remember earcons over a period of time,” and “what effect does training type have on recall?” An experiment was conducted and results showed that sound quality did lower the recall of earcons. However, redesign of the earcons overcame this problem with 73% recalled correctly. Participants could still recall earcons at this level after a week had passed. Training type also affected recall. With “personal training” participants recalled 73% of the earcons, but with purely textual training results were significantly lower. These results show that earcons can provide good navigation cues for TBIs. The final experiment used compound, rather than hierarchical, earcons to represent the hierarchy from the first experiment. Results showed that with sounds constructed in this way participants could recall 97% of the earcons. These experiments have developed our general understanding of earcons. A hierarchy three times larger than any previously created was tested, and this was also the first test of the recall of earcons over time. © 1998, ACM.

Controlling Access in Multiuser Interfaces,1998,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0005336726&doi=10.1145%2f274444.274446&partnerID=40&md5=032d8cdae92684b5a6f8ccde3d9885f3,"Traditionally, access control has been studied in the areas of operating systems and database management systems. With the advent of multiuser interfaces, there is a need to provide access control in the user interface. We have developed a general framework for supporting access control in multiuser interfaces. It is based on the classical notion of an access matrix, a generalized editing-based model of user-application interaction, and a flexible model of user-user coupling. It has been designed to support flexible control of all significant shared operations, high-level specification of access control policies, and automatic and efficient implementation of access control in a multiuser interface. It supports several new kinds of protected objects including sessions, windows, and hierarchical active variables; a large set of rights including not only the traditional semantic rights but also interaction and coupling rights; a set of inference rules for deriving default permissions; and a programming interface for implementing access control in multiuser interfaces. We have implemented the framework as part of a system called Suite. This article describes and motivates the framework using the concrete example of Suite, identifies some of the difficult issues we faced in its design, describes our preliminary experience with it, and suggests directions for future work. © 1998, ACM.

Using Metalevel Techniques in a Flexible Toolkit for CSCW Applications,1998,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48749095554&doi=10.1145%2f287675.287676&partnerID=40&md5=221e54f114773e870be95183bece1a24,"Ideally, software toolkits for collaborative applications should provide generic, reusable components, applicable in a wide range of circumstances, which software developers can assemble to produce new applications. However, the nature of CSCW applications and the mechanics of group interaction present a problem. Group interactions are significantly constrained by the structure of the underlying infrastructure, below the level at which toolkits typically offer control. This article describes the design features of Prospero, a prototype CSCW toolkit designed to be much more flexible than traditional toolkit techniques allow. Prospero uses a metalevel architecture so that application programmers can have control over not only how toolkit components are combined and used, but also over aspects of how they are internally structured and defined. This approach allows programmers to gain access to “internal” aspects of the toolkit's operation that affect how interaction and collaboration proceed. This article explains the metalevel approach and its application to CSCW, introduces two particular metalevel techniques for distributed data management and consistency control, shows how they are realized in Prospero, and illustrates how Prospero can be used to create a range of collaborative applications. © 1998, ACM.

Selection Using a One-Eyed Cursor in a Fish Tank VR Environment,1997,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001386334&doi=10.1145%2f267135.267136&partnerID=40&md5=6c8e85f162fd1ea3df37834db1209647,"This study investigates the use of a 2D cursor presented to one eye for target selection in Fish Tank VR and other stereo environments. It is argued that 2D selection of 3D objects should be less difficult than 3D selection. Vision research concerning binocular rivalry and the tendency we have to project images onto surfaces suggests that this mode of viewing will not seem particularly unnatural. A Fitts' Law experiment was done to directly compare target acquisition with a one-eyed 2D cursor and target acquisition using a 3D cursor. In both cases we used the same input device (Polhemus Fastrak) so that the device lag and gain parameters were exactly matched. The results show a large improvement in target acquisition time using the 2D cursor. The practical implications of this is that the 2D selection method using a one-eyed cursor is preferable to the 3D selection method. Theoretical implications relate to methods for extending Fitts' Law from the one-dimensional task for which it was designed to 2D and 3D tasks. We conclude that the existing approaches to this problem are not adequate. © 1997, ACM.

Some Programming by Demonstration (PBD) systems do provide such support, but none provide full support for demonstrating interfaces, such as those in games, in which the graphics are animated. This article proposes a number of techniques for creating animated interfaces, all of which have been included in an exploratory system, Pavlov. Many of the techniques are based on the addition of timing controls to a form of PBD called stimulus-response demonstration. Others are based on an adaptation of a traditional animation time-line that integrates end-user interaction with animation. The article also evaluates Pavlov with (1) a comparison to other PBD systems in terms of the behaviors that can be specified interactively and (2) a report on an informal user study comparing development in Pavlov to development in a conventional interface builder. © 1997, ACM.

In the first study, spatial detail was degraded by reducing resolution. In the second study, detail was degraded in the color domain by using grayscale in the periphery. In each study, 10 subjects were given a complex search task that required users to indicate whether or not a target object was present among distracters. Subjects used several different displays varying in the amount of detail presented. Frame rate, object location, subject input method, and order of display use were all controlled. The primary dependent measures were search time on correctly performed trials and the percentage of all trials correctly performed. Results indicated that peripheral LOD degradation can be used to reduce color or spatial visual complexity by almost half in some search tasks without significantly reducing performance. © 1997, ACM.

We identify the strategies that were effective to: encourage the adoption of the mobile app; interweave use with the other elements of the opera performance; make it consistent with the content; and ensure it complemented but was not essential to the show.

However, opt-in rates tend to be low. In response, questionable design practices have emerged to nudge consumers into inadvertent choices. Many of these design constructs are presented using an opt-out design. Using eye tracking and think-aloud data techniques, this research investigates the impact of the framing and optionality of micro-decisions on user perceptions and error rates. Focusing on opt-out decisions, the study found: up to one in three users make errors in decision-making; there is a higher error rate for rejection-framed opt-out decisions; users widely misinterpret decision framing; and failure to read decision text results in rushed and unsighted decisions, even leading users to automatically construe un-ticked checkboxes as opt-in decisions. In talking afterwards about their experiences, users expressed strong negative emotions, feeling confused, manipulated and resentful. Many suggested they would, in practice, steer away from similar encounters toward more unambiguous and honest sites. These findings might alert managers and developers, tempted to use dark patterns, that such a strategy might backfire over time.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",dark patterns; decision framing; eye tracking; Micro-decision; opt-out; visual focus,Behavioral research; Decision making; Errors; Human engineering; Dark pattern; Decision framing; Design practice; Error rate; Eye-tracking; Micro-decision; Online transaction; Opt-out; Think aloud; Visual focus; Eye tracking
Optimal Feedback Control for Modeling Human-Computer Interaction,2022,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129051178&doi=10.1145%2f3524122&partnerID=40&md5=6b90ca863996f26be4c9b42a9a44fccc,"Optimal feedback control (OFC) is a theory from the motor control literature that explains how humans move their body to achieve a certain goal, e.g., pointing with the finger. OFC is based on the assumption that humans aim at controlling their body optimally, within the constraints imposed by body, environment, and task. In this article, we explain how this theory can be applied to understanding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the case of pointing. We propose that the human body and computer dynamics can be interpreted as a single dynamical system. The system state is controlled by the user via muscle control signals, and estimated from observations. Between-trial variability arises from signal-dependent control noise and observation noise. We compare four different models from optimal control theory and evaluate to what degree these models can replicate movements in the case of mouse pointing. We introduce a procedure to identify parameters that best explain observed user behavior. To support HCI researchers in simulating, analyzing, and optimizing interaction movements, we provide the Python toolbox OFC4HCI. We conclude that OFC presents a powerful framework for HCI to understand and simulate motion of the human body and of the interface on a moment-by-moment basis.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",aimed movements; Human-Computer Interaction; Intermittent Control; LQG; LQR; minimum jerk; modeling; mouse pointing; OFC; Optimal control; parameter fitting; second-order lag,Behavioral research; Computation theory; Computer software; Control theory; Dynamical systems; Feedback control; Aimed movement; Intermittent controls; LQG; LQR; Minimum jerks; Modeling; Mouse pointing; Optimal controls; Optimal feedback control; Parameter fitting; Second orders; Second-order lag; Human computer interaction

In this article, we present novel insights gained from a field study investigating the emotional effect of smell on memories and body image. Taking inspiration from the cultural design probes approach, we designed QuintEssence, a probe package that includes three scents and materials to complete three tasks over a period of four weeks. Here, we describe the design of QuintEssence and the main findings based on the outcomes of the three tasks and a final individual interview. The findings show similar results between participants based on the scent. For example, with cinnamon, participants experienced feelings of warmth, coziness, happiness, and relaxation; they recalled blurred memories of past moments about themselves and reported a general feeling of being calm and peaceful towards their bodies. Our findings open up new design spaces for multisensory experiences and inspire future qualitative explorations beyond laboratory boundaries.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",body awareness; body image; cultural probes; emotions; field study; memories; scents; Smell,Odors; Body awareness; Body image; Cultural probes; Daily lives; Emotion; Field studies; Power; Real world environments; Scent; Smell; Probes

However, realizing this potential requires the development of a means for searching through a large corpus that goes beyond surface matches and simple keywords. Here we contribute the first end-to-end system for analogical search on scientific articles and evaluate its effectiveness with scientists' own problems. Using a human-in-the-loop AI system as a probe we find that our system facilitates creative ideation, and that ideation success is mediated by an intermediate level of matching on the problem abstraction (i.e., high versus low). We also demonstrate a fully automated AI search engine that achieves a similar accuracy with the human-in-the-loop system.

Our findings show that the facilitation of activities plays a relevant role for engaging in social interaction. We discuss how technologies can contribute to engaging people living with dementia in social interaction: firstly, facilitation can be understood as a concept that is supported by people and technology.

The philosophers lived with the Tilting Bowl during this period. We call these conversations, polylogues, of which the aim is to co-speculate on a range of new possible relations by which to consider living with technological things. The contributions of our article are two-fold. Firstly, through our polylogues, we offer descriptions of three relations with things. These include (1) non-anthropocentric care: care that is non-anthropocentric and existential; (2) non-presumptive relations: not-knowing in relating to and engaging with things; and (3) ideologized relations: ideologies that frame relations with technologies. Secondly, the article elaborates and critically reflects on co-speculation as a method for relational and situated knowing that can be of benefit to HCI researchers.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",co-speculation; human-technology relations; material speculation; posthumanism; Postphenomenology,Co-speculation; Counterfactuals; Design researchers; Human-technology relation; Material speculation; Methodological approach; Posthumanism; Postphenomenology; Human engineering

Yet, they have primarily been used for specialist appointments or within health care facilities. We are now seeing a shift with the proliferation of commercial technologies, such as smartphone apps that allow people to have appointments with a general practitioner from nearly any location for various reasons. Telemedicine has also seen an uptake due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about how doctors and patients perceive smartphone-based telemedicine systems, what types of medical ailments are best suited for these systems, what sociotechnical challenges might emerge through their usage, and how systems should be designed to best meet the needs of both doctors and patients. Thus, we applied a scenario-based design method by presenting a set of medical situations to both general practitioners and patients, and conducted contextual interviews with them to investigate their thoughts on video-based appointments for a range of medical situations. Results show that video consultations using smartphone apps could raise challenges in delivering appropriate care and utilization, conducting camera work to assist different types of examinations, supporting doctor-patient relationship creation and maintenance, allowing doctors to maintain control over the appointment, as well as protecting patients' and doctors' privacy. This suggests the need to create designs that can support particular workflows, relationship building, safety and privacy protection, and camera work for varying contexts.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",domestic setting; Mobile video communication; primary health care; video doctor appointment; video-mediated communication,Cameras; Home health care; Image communication systems; mHealth; Smartphones; Telemedicine; Camera works; Domestic setting; General practitioners; Mobile video communication; Primary healthcare; Smartphone apps; Telemedicine systems; Video doctor appointment; Video-conferencing; Video-mediated communications; Video conferencing

First, we investigate past experiences with authentication mechanisms emphasizing problems and aspects that hamper good user experience. Second, we investigate the different authentication factors more closely. Our results reveal particularly interesting preferences regarding the authentication factor ""ownership""in terms of properties, physical realizations, and interaction.

While research involving other living entities, namely humans and animals is regulated, there exists no guidance for plants involved in HCI research. Motivated by biocentric philosophy, the present article makes a first attempt at addressing this gap. Commencing with a review of the development of research ethics, we show that as ethical concern has expanded from humans to animals, there is an argument for its expansion to plants. Through the lens of Respect for Nature, we then review the state-of-the-art in HCI design research involving plants. Our focus lies with ethics in the process of conducting research and its implications for the plants involved. We derive a set of actionable ethical design considerations for researchers involving plants in their interaction design work. Finally, our work aims to stimulate discussion on the involvement of plants in interaction design research.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",biocentric; design considerations; design research; interaction design; plants; Research ethics; Respect for Nature,Design; Ethical technology; Biocentric; Design considerations; Design research; Ethical concerns; HCI design; Interaction design; Plant; Research ethics; Respect for nature; Through the lens; Animals

However, existing exemplars that successfully reify abstract meanings through interactions are usually case-specific, and it is currently unclear how to systematically create or extend meanings for general gesture-based interactions. We present Metaphoraction, a creativity support tool that formulates design ideas for gesture-based interactions to show metaphorical meanings with four interconnected components: gesture, action, object, and meaning. To represent the interaction design ideas with these four components, Metaphoraction links interactive gestures to actions based on the similarity of appearances, movements, and experiences; relates actions to objects by applying the immediate association; bridges objects and meanings by leveraging the metaphor TARGET-SOURCE mappings. We build a dataset containing 588,770 unique design idea candidates through surveying related research and conducting two crowdsourced studies to support meaningful gesture-based interaction design ideation. Five design experts validate that Metaphoraction can effectively support creativity and productivity during the ideation process. The paper concludes by presenting insights into meaningful gesture-based interaction design and discussing potential future uses of the tool.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",creative support tool; Gesture-based interaction design; metaphor; mobile gesture; user experience; wearable gesture,Association reactions; User interfaces; Wearable technology; Creative support tool; Creatives; Gesture-based interaction; Gesture-based interaction design; Interaction design; Metaphor; Mobile gesture; Support tool; Users' experiences; Wearable gesture; Bridges

In this article, we present a novel remote strategy for involving stakeholders to co-design interactive technology: Designerly Tele-Experiences (DTE). Our methodological proposal enables participants to experience early design concepts in-the-wild as a provocation to contribute new ideas that resonate with their experiential preferences.

While DES is well-studied in computer displays, its impact on users of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) is largely unexplored-despite that some of their key properties (e.g., the vergence-Accommodation conflict) make VR-HMDs particularly prone. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation into DES in VR HMDs. We present results from a survey with 68 experienced users to understand DES symptoms in VR-HMDs. To help address DES, we investigate eye exercises resulting from survey answers and blue light filtering in three user studies (N = 71). Results demonstrate that eye exercises, but not blue light filtering, can effectively reduce DES. We conclude with an extensive analysis of the user studies and condense our findings in 10 key challenges that guide future work in this emerging research area.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

While powerful in prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models are black boxes by nature, preventing users from making informed judgments about the correctness and fairness of such an automated system. Explanations have been proposed as a general remedy to the black box problem. However, it remains unclear if effects of explanations on user trust generalise over varying accuracy levels. In an online user study with 959 participants, we examined the practical consequences of adding explanations for user trust: We evaluated trust for three explanation types on three classifiers of varying accuracy. We find that the influence of our explanations on trust differs depending on the classifier's accuracy. Thus, the interplay between trust and explanations is more complex than previously reported. Our findings also reveal discrepancies between self-reported and behavioural trust, showing that the choice of trust measure impacts the results.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Explainable AI; Explanation fidelity; Machine learning; Minimum explanations; User trust,Decision making; Deep learning; Human engineering; User interfaces; Automated decision making systems; Black boxes; Explainable AI; Explanation fidelity; Minimum explanation; Modeling accuracy; Modeling complexity; Prediction accuracy; User trust; User trust models; Automation

We then augment these findings with data from interviews with 11 skilled researchers who reflect on their working experience in this area. Our analysis reveals how the domain has evolved from the European migrant crisis to a more global agenda of migration and points towards a shifting focus from addressing immediate needs to acknowledging more complex political and emotional aspects of mobility. We also uncover the critical role of academic, local, and international politics in migration research in HCI.

This analysis reveals variance in how authors report experiments, which creates challenges to understand, reproduce, and build on that research. It then describes an overarching experiment model that provides a formal structure for reporting HCI research with brain signals, including definitions, terminology, categories, and examples for each aspect. Multiple distinct reporting styles were identified through factor analysis and tied to different types of research. The paper concludes with recommendations and discusses future challenges.

Despite its widespread adoption, the design of appropriate gesture vocabularies remains a challenging task for developers and designers. Existing research has largely used Expert-Led, User-Led, or Computationally-Based methodologies to design gesture vocabularies. These methodologies leverage the expertise, experience, and capabilities of experts, users, and systems to fulfill different requirements. In practice, however, none of these methodologies provide designers with a complete, multi-faceted perspective of the many factors that influence the design of gesture vocabularies, largely because a singular set of factors has yet to be established. Additionally, these methodologies do not identify or emphasize the subset of factors that are crucial to consider when designing for a given use case. Therefore, this work reports on the findings from an exhaustive literature review that identified 13 factors crucial to gesture vocabulary design and examines the evaluation methods and interaction techniques commonly associated with each factor. The identified factors also enable a holistic examination of existing gesture design methodologies from a factor-oriented viewpoint and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology. This work closes with proposals of future research directions of developing an iterative user-centered and factor-centric gesture design approach as well as establishing an evolving ecosystem of factors that are crucial to gesture design.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Factors and methodologies; Gesture design; Use-centered design,Human computer interaction; Human engineering; User centered design; Best practices; Factor and methodology; Gestural interaction; Gesture design; Gesture vocabularies; Lead users; Novel interaction techniques; Research labs; Survey and analysis; Use-centered design; Iterative methods

What actions can they consider? In light of this debate, platforms have begun experimenting with softer alternatives to outright bans. We examine one such intervention called quarantining, that impedes direct access to and promotion of controversial communities. Specifically, we present two case studies of what happened when Reddit quarantined the influential communities r/TheRedPill (TRP) and r/The-Donald (TD). Using over 85M Reddit posts, we apply causal inference methods to examine the quarantine's effects on TRP and TD. We find that the quarantine made it more difficult to recruit new members: new user influx to TRP and TD decreased by 79.5% and 58%, respectively. Despite quarantining, existing users' misogyny and racism levels remained unaffected.

Control has been investigated mainly at a high level, using subjective questionnaire data, but also at a low level, using objective data on participants' sense of agency. However, it remains unclear how differences in higher level, experienced control reflect lower level sense of control. We study that link in two experiments. In the first one we measure the low-level sense of agency with button, touchpad, and on-skin input. The results show a higher sense of agency with on-skin input. In the second experiment, participants played a simple game controlled with the same three inputs. We find that on-skin input results in both increased sense and experience of control compared to touchpad input. However, the corresponding difference is not found between on-skin and button input, whereas the button performed better in the experiment task. These results suggest that other factors of user experience spill over to the experienced control at rates that overcome differences in the sense of control.

Participants' reading speeds (measured in words-per-minute (WPM)) increased by 35% when comparing fastest and slowest fonts without affecting reading comprehension. High WPM variability across fonts suggests that one font does not fit all. We provide font recommendations related to higher reading speed and discuss the need for individuation, allowing digital devices to match their readers' needs in the moment.

It's Good to Talk: A Comparison of Using Voice Versus Screen-Based Interactions for Agent-Assisted Tasks,2022,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124807406&doi=10.1145%2f3484221&partnerID=40&md5=6ea6f1e79ca6e5009e11f1de21f37eb3,"Voice assistants have become hugely popular in the home as domestic and entertainment devices. Recently, there has been a move towards developing them for work settings. For example, Alexa for Business and IBM Watson for Business were designed to improve productivity, by assisting with various tasks, such as scheduling meetings and taking minutes. However, this kind of assistance is largely limited to planning and managing user's work. How might they be developed to do more by way of empowering people at work? Our research is concerned with achieving this by developing an agent with the role of a facilitator that assists users during an ongoing task. Specifically, we were interested in whether the modality in which the agent interacts with users makes a difference: How does a voice versus screen-based agent interaction affect user behavior? We hypothesized that voice would be more immediate and emotive, resulting in more fluid conversations and interactions. Here, we describe a user study that compared the benefits of using voice versus screen-based interactions when interacting with a system incorporating an agent, involving pairs of participants doing an exploratory data analysis task that required them to make sense of a series of data visualizations. The findings from the study show marked differences between the two conditions, with voice resulting in more turn-taking in discussions, questions asked, more interactions with the system and a tendency towards more immediate, faster-paced discussions following agent prompts. We discuss the possible reasons for why talking and being prompted by a voice assistant may be preferable and more effective at mediating human-human conversations and we translate some of the key insights of this research into design implications. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",agent intervention; collaboration; conversation; exploratory data analysis; GUI; interaction modality; limited proactivity; proactive agent; question-asking; sensemaking; voice assistant; Voice user interface,Behavioral research; Information analysis; Productivity; User interfaces; Agent intervention; Collaboration; Conversation; Exploratory data analysis; Interaction modality; Limited proactivity; Proactive agent; Proactivity; Question-asking; Sense making; Voice assistant; Voice user interface; Data handling

Although several tickling artifacts have been suggested in prior work, limited knowledge is available if those artifacts could evoke laughter. In this article, we aim at filling this gap by designing and developing a novel foot-tickling mechanism that can evoke laughter. We first developed an actuator that can create tickling sensations along the sole of the foot utilising magnet-driven brushes. Then, we conducted two studies to identify the most ticklish locations of the foot's sole and stimulation patterns that can evoke laughter. In a follow-up study with a new set of participants, we confirmed that the identified stimuli could evoke laughter. From the participants' feedback, we derived several applications that such a simulation could be useful. Finally, we embedded our actuators into a flexible insole, demonstrating the potential of a wearable tickling insole. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",elciting emotions; eliciting laughter; fun; haptics; laughter; magnetic locomotion; Tickling,Design development; Design evaluation; Elciting emotion; Eliciting laughter; Fun; Haptics; Laughter; Magnetic locomotion; Sole patterns; Tickling; Actuators

To achieve this, interfaces actuate the user's to touch involuntarily (using exoskeletons or electrical-muscle-stimulation); we refer to this as computer-driven touch. Unfortunately, forcing users to touch causes a loss of their sense of agency. While researchers found that delaying the timing of computer-driven touch preserves agency, they only considered the naïve case when user-driven touch is aligned with computer-driven touch. We argue this is unlikely as it assumes we can perfectly predict user-touches. But, what about all the remainder situations: when the haptics forces the user into an outcome they did not intend or assists the user in an outcome they would not achieve alone? We unveil, via an experiment, what happens in these novel situations.

First, through the lens of the monster, we articulate how the wearer can adopt or reject the garment, resulting in either harmonious or disconcerting experiences of touch. Second, it can be experienced as an organic ""other""-with its own agency-resulting in uncanny experiences of touch. Through mirroring the wearer's breathing, the garment can also be experienced as a twisted version of one's own body.

Physecology: A Conceptual Framework to Describe Data Physicalizations in their Real-World Context,2022,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124792684&doi=10.1145%2f3505590&partnerID=40&md5=bb9f5c73189ac1af5a0979a1099db518,"The standard definition for ""physicalizations""is ""a physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data""[47]. While this working definition provides the fundamental groundwork for conceptualizing physicalization, in practice many physicalization systems go beyond the scope of this definition as they consist of distributed physical and digital elements that involve complex interaction mechanisms. In this article, we examine how ""physicalization""is part of a broader ecology - the ""physecology""- with properties that go beyond the scope of the working definition. Through analyzing 60 representative physicalization papers, we derived six design dimensions of a physecology: (i) represented data type, (ii) way of information communication, (iii) interaction mechanisms, (iv) spatial input-output coupling, (v) physical setup, and (vi) audiences involved. Our contribution is the extension of the definition of physicalization to the broader concept of ""physecology,""to provide conceptual clarity on the design of physicalizations for future work. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This provides a new direction in the field that seeks to address the complexity of human touch and interrogates the limitation of today’s haptic devices. Papers in this special issue contribute to understanding this gap by engaging with socio-cultural issues around digital touch communication and identifying new ways to study touch, specifically exploring the nuance and subtlety of touch and an expanded view of touch. Much work in the area of haptics for social communication focuses on the hand, both in understanding touch mechanisms and in developing means for the conveying and interpretation of tactile communication.",,Cultural issue; Haptic devices; Haptics; Human touches; Social communications; Socio-cultural; Tactile communications; Conveying
Manipulating Interface Design Features Affects Children's Stop-And-Think Behaviours in a Counterintuitive-Problem Game,2022,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130494671&doi=10.1145%2f3485168&partnerID=40&md5=481a7bfadffdc687e411128c1e969cf5,"The human-computer interaction (HCI) design of educational technologies influences cognitive behaviour, so it is imperative to assess how different HCI strategies support intended behaviour. We developed a neuroscience-inspired game that trains children's use of ""stopping-and-thinking""(S&T) - an inhibitory control-related behaviour - in the context of counterintuitive science problems. We tested the efficacy of four HCI features in supporting S&T: (1) a readiness mechanic, (2) motion cues, (3) colour cues, and (4) rewards/penalties. In a randomised eye-tracking trial with 45 7-to-8-year-olds, we found that the readiness mechanic increased S&T duration, that motion and colour cues proved equally effective at promoting S&T, that combining symbolic colour with the readiness mechanic may have a cumulative effect, and that rewards/penalties may have distracted children from S&T. Additionally, S&T duration was related to in-game performance. Our results underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to educational technology research that actively investigates how HCI impacts intended learning behaviours.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Prior scholarship has investigated the challenges that users face as they take up these devices in their homes. However, little is known about when and how users or potential users would prefer future domestic Internet of Things (IoT) to support their activities in home settings. To fill this gap, we conducted two co-design workshops, an in-home activity between the two sessions, and pre- and post-study interviews with 18 adult participants, who had diverse levels of prior experience of IoT use. Our findings contribute new insights into how smart home devices could adapt their behavior based on social contexts; how to re-imagine agency and support useful intelligibility; and how to resolve user-driven conflict by providing appropriate information about those with whom devices are shared. Finally, based on these findings, we discuss the implications of our work and provide a set of design considerations from which designers of future smart home technologies can benefit.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",agency; co-design; conflicts; Internet of Things; IoT; private spaces; public spaces; Smart homes,Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Agency; Co-designs; Conflict; Private spaces; Public space; Smart devices; Smart Home Technology; Smart homes; Social conflicts; Social context; Automation

We analyzed videos of users' faces and upper bodies recorded 10s prior to self-reported mind wandering (i.e., ground truth) while they engaged in a computerized reading task. We found that a state-of-the-art machine learning model had comparable accuracy to aggregated judgments of nine untrained human observers (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = .598 versus .589). A fusion of the two (AUC = .644) outperformed each, presumably because each focused on complementary cues. Furthermore, adding more humans beyond 3-4 observers yielded diminishing returns.

In a user study, we firstly examine the impact and pitfalls of visualising shortcuts on a tracked physical keyboard, exploring the utility of virtual per-keycap displays. Supported by this and other recent developments in XR keyboard research, we then describe the design, development, and evaluation-by-demonstration of KAT. KAT simplifies the creation of virtual keyboards (optionally bound to a tracked physical keyboard) that support enhanced display - 2D/3D per-key content that conforms to the virtual key bounds; enhanced interactivity - supporting extensible per-key states such as tap, dwell, touch, swipe; flexible keyboard mappings that can encapsulate groups of interaction and display elements, e.g., enabling application-dependent interactions; and flexible layouts - allowing the virtual keyboard to merge with and augment a physical keyboard, or switch to an alternate layout (e.g., mid-air) based on need. Through these features, KAT will assist researchers in the prototyping, creation and replication of XR keyboard experiences, fundamentally altering the keyboard's form and function.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Can Unhappy Pictures Enhance the Effect of Personas?

We report a user experiment with 235 participants, testing the effects of happy and unhappy image styles on user perceptions, engagement, and personality traits attributed to personas using a mixed-methods analysis. Results indicate that the participant's perceptions of the persona's realism and pain point severity increase with the use of unhappy pictures. In contrast, personas with happy pictures are perceived as more extroverted, agreeable, open, conscientious, and emotionally stable. The participants' proposed design ideas for the personas scored more lexical empathy scores for happy personas. There were also significant perception changes along with the gender and ethnic lines regarding both empathy and perceptions of pain points. Implications are the facial expression in the persona profile can affect the perceptions of those employing the personas. Therefore, persona designers should align facial expressions with the task for which the personas will be employed. Generally, unhappy images emphasize realism and pain point severity, and happy images invoke positive perceptions.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",design; Personas; pictures; sentiment; user experiment,Health; Facial Expressions; Mixed method; Persona; Personality traits; Picture; Sentiment; User engagement; User experiments; User perceptions; User personalities; Behavioral research

Yet, there has not been much work to improve screen reader access in mainstream collaborative writing tools. This severely affects the way people with vision impairments collaborate in ability-diverse teams. As a step toward addressing this issue, the present article aims at improving screen reader representation of collaborative features such as comments and track changes (i.e., suggested edits). Building on our formative interviews with 20 academics and professionals with vision impairments, we developed auditory representations that indicate comments and edits using non-speech audio (e.g., earcons, tone overlay), multiple text-to-speech voices, and contextual presentation techniques. We then performed a systematic evaluation study with 48 screen reader users that indicated that non-speech audio, changing voices, and contextual presentation can potentially improve writers' collaboration awareness. We discuss implications of these results for the design of accessible collaborative systems.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We seek to understand whether chatbots design should account for linguistic register. This research analyzes how register differences play a role in shaping the user's perception of the human-chatbot interaction. We produced parallel corpora of conversations in the tourism domain with similar content and varying register characteristics and evaluated users' preferences of chatbot's linguistic choices in terms of appropriateness, credibility, and user experience. Our results show that register characteristics are strong predictors of user's preferences, which points to the needs of designing chatbots with register-appropriate language to improve acceptance and users' perceptions of chatbot interactions.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Chatbots; conversational agents; language design; register; user perceptions,User interfaces; Chatbots; Conversational agents; Language design; Language variation; Register; Research analysis; Social roles; User perceptions; User's preferences; Users' experiences; Linguistics

To decelerate and articulate design processes that occurred at the rapid pace of radio production, the sound designer and producer wrote retrospective design accounts. We then revisited the radio pieces through principles drawn from guidance design, data storytelling, visualization literacy, and sound studies. Finally, we speculated how these principles might be applied through interactive, voice-based technologies. First-person methods enabled us to access the implicit knowledge embedded in radio production and translate it to technologies of interest to the human-computer-interaction community, such as voice user interfaces that rely on auditory display. Traditionally, sonification practitioners have focused more on generating sounds than on teaching people how to listen; our process, however, treated sound and narrative as a holistic, sonic-narrative experience.

Our discussion contributes to broader reflections on shifting design research practice: (a) methodological considerations inviting others to engage failures through retrospective trioethnography, (b) letting go as a mode of research care, (c) possibilities for more candid research reporting, and (d) how centering failure may contribute to design justice by providing a technique for attending to harm and healing in design research practices. Throughout, we call for challenging success narratives in design research, and underscore the need for systemic changes in design research practice.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",autoethnography; Failure; reflection; research-through-design; trioethography,Autoethnography; Can design; Design research; Design researchers; Imaginaries; Learn+; Research-through-design; Trioethography; Unfoldings; Failure (mechanical)

We introduce Generative Theories of Interaction, which draw insights from empirical theories about human behavior in order to define specific concepts and actionable principles, which, in turn, serve as guidelines for analyzing, critiquing, and constructing new technological artifacts. After introducing and defining Generative Theories of Interaction, we present three detailed examples from our own work: Instrumental Interaction, Human-Computer Partnerships, and Communities & Common Objects. Each example describes the underlying scientific theory and how we derived and applied HCI-relevant concepts and principles to the design of innovative interactive technologies.

Do You Feel the Same?

It involves re-immersing users to a level where emotional responses are comparable to those experienced during actual interaction with a system. To validate whether the robustness of CRD would vary with the time gap between the actual and recalled event and with the affective state preceding the recall, two empirical studies with altogether 100 participants were conducted. Specifically, participants' emotions were measured in terms of galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and self-assessment manikin (SAM) rating when they were interacting with an email client seeded with usability problems. The same measures were taken when they viewed the videoed interactions. Two between-subject variables were ĝ€ intervening time' (from 0 minutes up to 24 hours) and ĝ€intervening affect' (images with different valence and arousal). Advanced computational models were applied to optimise the shifting of GSR/HR waves generated at the actual interaction and recall phases, which were found to be significantly correlated. The shifting process is necessary for addressing the memory effect and is a methodological innovation. Overall, CRD proved to be a robust method that can be deployed to a broad range of HCI research and practice contexts. © 2021 ACM.",emotion; galvanic skin response; heart rate; peak-end effect; physiological sensors; self-assessment manikin; User Experience,Electrophysiology; Computational model; Emotional response; Empirical studies; Galvanic skin response; Methodological innovations; Shifting process; Usability problems; User experience evaluations; User experience
"Predictable Robots for Autistic Children-Variance in Robot Behaviour, Idiosyncrasies in Autistic Children's Characteristics, and Child Robot Engagement",2021,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114473764&doi=10.1145%2f3468849&partnerID=40&md5=1e2b3a9f97d9d944e40f8497605ada24,"Predictability is important to autistic individuals, and robots have been suggested to meet this need as they can be programmed to be predictable, as well as elicit social interaction. The effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions designed for social skill learning presumably depends on the interplay between robot predictability, engagement in learning, and the individual differences between different autistic children. To better understand this interplay, we report on a study where 24 autistic children participated in a robot-assisted intervention. We manipulated the variance in the robot's behaviour as a way to vary predictability, and measured the children's behavioural engagement, visual attention, as well as their individual factors. We found that the children will continue engaging in the activity behaviourally, but may start to pay less visual attention over time to activity-relevant locations when the robot is less predictable. Instead, they increasingly start to look away from the activity. Ultimately, this could negatively influence learning, in particular for tasks with a visual component. Furthermore, severity of autistic features and expressive language ability had a significant impact on behavioural engagement. We consider our results as preliminary evidence that robot predictability is an important factor for keeping children in a state where learning can occur. © 2021 held by the owner/author(s).",autism spectrum condition; engagement; human-robot interaction; individual differences; Predictability; variability,Behavioral research; Autistic children; Engagement in learning; Individual Differences; Individual factors; Social interactions; Social skills; Visual Attention; Visual components; Social robots
"""citizens Too"": Safety Seting Collaboration among Older Adults with Memory Concerns",2021,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114521089&doi=10.1145%2f3465217&partnerID=40&md5=41ab3285ff86b4fd4534bd3401496e96,"Designing technologies that support the cybersecurity of older adults with memory concerns involves wrestling with an uncomfortable paradox between surveillance and independence and the close collaboration of couples. This research captures the interactions between older adult couples where one or both have memory concerns - a primary feature of cognitive decline - as they make decisions on how to safeguard their online activities using a Safety Setting probe we designed, and over the course of several informal interviews and a diary study. Throughout, couples demonstrated a collaborative mentality to which we apply a frame of citizenship in opensource collaboration, specifically (a) histories of participation, (b) lower barriers to participation, and (c) maintaining ongoing contribution. In this metaphor of collaborative enterprise, one partner (or member of the couple) may be the service provider and the other may be the participant, but at varying moments, they may switch roles while still maintaining a collaborative focus on preserving shared assets and freedom on the internet. We conclude with a discussion of what this service provider-contributor mentality means for empowerment through citizenship, and implications for vulnerable populations' cybersecurity. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",couples; cybersecurity; Memory; older adults,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Cognitive decline; Collaborative enterprise; Cyber security; Diary study; Older adults; Online activities; Open-source; Service provider; Network security
Intermittent Control as a Model of Mouse Movements,2021,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114456505&doi=10.1145%2f3461836&partnerID=40&md5=9b91a4bbb02ecf6683496640dc4d482b,"We present Intermittent Control (IC) models as a candidate framework for modelling human input movements in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). IC differs from continuous control in that users are not assumed to use feedback to adjust their movements continuously, but only when the difference between the observed pointer position and predicted pointer positions becomes large. We use a parameter optimisation approach to identify the parameters of an intermittent controller from experimental data, where users performed one-dimensional mouse movements in a reciprocal pointing task. Compared to previous published work with continuous control models, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the experimental observations, IC is better able to generatively reproduce the distinctive dynamical features and variability of the pointing task across participants and over repeated tasks. IC is compatible with current physiological and psychological theory and provides insight into the source of variability in HCI tasks. © 2021 held by the owner/author(s).

The flip side is that the integrity of the election can be compromised by adversarial attacks and malfunctioning voting infrastructure. Individual verifiability aims to protect against such risks by letting voters verify that their votes are correctly registered in the electronic ballot box. Therefore, voters need to carry out additional tasks making human factors crucial for security. In this article, we establish a categorization of individually verifiable Internet voting schemes based on voter interactions. For each category in our proposed categorization, we evaluate a voting scheme in a user study with a total of 100 participants. In our study, we assessed usability, user experience, trust, and further qualitative data to gain deeper insights into voting schemes.

Fifty-four individuals took part in a mixed-methods user study; they were classified as field-dependent (FD) or independent (FI) based on a field-dependent-independent (FD-I) cognitive-style-elicitation instrument. Three groups of teams were formed, based on the cognitive style of each team member: FD-FD, FD-FI, and FI-FI. We examined collaborative gameplay in terms of team performance, cognitive load, communication, and player experience.

This is becoming increasingly relevant in services and operating systems. Previous research often focuses on specific recommendation tasks with data captured from interactions with an individual application. The quality of recommendations is also often evaluated addressing only computational measures of accuracy, without investigating the usefulness of recommendations in realistic tasks. The aim of this work is to synthesize the research in this area through a novel approach by (1) demonstrating comprehensive digital activity monitoring, (2) introducing entity-based computing and interaction, and (3) investigating the previously overlooked usefulness of entity recommendations and their actual impact on user behavior in real tasks. The methodology exploits context from screen frames recorded every 2 seconds to recommend information entities related to the current task. We embodied this methodology in an interactive system and investigated the relevance and influence of the recommended entities in a study with participants resuming their real-world tasks after a 14-day monitoring phase. Results show that the recommendations allowed participants to find more relevant entities than in a control without the system. In addition, the recommended entities were also used in the actual tasks. In the discussion, we reflect on a research agenda for entity recommendation in context, revisiting comprehensive monitoring to include the physical world, considering entities as actionable recommendations, capturing drifting intent and routines, and considering explainability and transparency of recommendations, ethics, and ownership of data. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, existing HCI methods can be impractical to apply to programming languages: languages have high iteration costs, programmers require significant learning time, and user performance has high variance. To address these problems, we adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. We integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. We assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement. © 2021 Owner/Author.",programming language design; Usability of programming languages,Ada (programming language); Iterative methods; Tools; Design decisions; Empirical studies; HCI methods; Learning time; Programming language design; Safety property; User performance; User-centered; User centered design

However, this process is slow and expensive, and practitioners often have to make ad-hoc privacy-related decisions with little actual feedback from users.We introduce Lean Privacy Review (LPR), a fast, cheap, and easy-to-access method to help practitioners collect direct feedback from users through the proxy of crowd workers in the early stages of design. LPR takes a proposed data practice, quickly breaks it down into smaller parts, generates a set of questionnaire surveys, solicits users' opinions, and summarizes those opinions in a compact form for practitioners to use. By doing so, LPR can help uncover the range and magnitude of different privacy concerns actual people have at a small fraction of the cost and wait-time for a formal review. We evaluated LPR using 12 real-world data practices with 240 crowd users and 24 data practitioners. Our results show that (1) the discovery of privacy concerns saturates as the number of evaluators exceeds 14 participants, which takes around 5.5 hours to complete (i.e., latency) and costs 3.7 hours of total crowd work ( $80 in our experiments); and (2) LPR finds 89% of privacy concerns identified by data practitioners as well as 139% additional privacy concerns that practitioners are not aware of, at a 6% estimated false alarm rate. © 2021 held by the owner/author(s).

This article presents a concept to provide precise micro-navigation instructions through a tactile around-the-head display. Our system presents four tactile patterns for fundamental navigation instructions in conjunction with continuous directional guidance. We followed an iterative, user-centric approach to design the patterns for the fundamental navigation instructions, combined them with a continuous directional guidance stimulus, and tested our system with 13 sighted (blindfolded) and 2 blind participants in an obstacle course, including stairs. We optimized the patterns and validated the final prototype with another five blind participants in a follow-up study. The system steered our participants successfully with a 5.7 cm average absolute deviation from the optimal path. Our guidance is only a little less precise than the usual shoulder wobbling during normal walking and an order of magnitude more precise than previous tactile navigation systems. Our system allows various new use cases of micro-navigation for people with visual impairments, e.g., preventing collisions on a sidewalk or as an anti-veering tool. It also has applications in other areas, such as personnel working in low-vision environments (e.g., firefighters). © 2021 ACM.",obstacle avoidance; tactile guidance; tactile navigation; tactile patterns; Visually impaired,Curricula; Navigation systems; Average absolute deviation; Follow-up Studies; Normal walking; Optimal paths; Tactile navigation system; Tactile patterns; User-centric; Visual impairment; Air navigation

In this article, we introduce GAVIN, a gaze-assisted voice note-taking application, which enables readers to seamlessly take voice notes on digital documents by implicitly anchoring them to text passages. We first conducted a contextual enquiry focusing on participants' note-taking practices on digital documents. Using these findings, we propose a method which leverages eye-tracking and machine learning techniques to annotate voice notes with reference text passages. To evaluate our approach, we recruited 32 participants performing voice note-taking. Following, we trained a classifier on the data collected to predict text passage where participants made voice notes. Lastly, we employed the classifier to built GAVIN and conducted a user study to demonstrate the feasibility of the system.

We consider why these two forms of Internet-enabled work are pursued by different segments of the rural population, attending to the socio-demographic variation within and between these two broad categories. Some key differences include whether workers are urban transplants or rural-originating, in ""white-collar""or ""blue-collar""occupations, and whether they are men or women. We argue that deficit framings that focus on inadequate infrastructure or absent skills are insufficient to understand such patterns of differentiated use. Instead a sociocultural explanation is needed: one that draws connections between work cultures, occupational values, skills, and practices.  © 2021 Owner/Author.",ethnography; Internet-enabled work; rural studies; telework,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Demographic variations; Rural population; Rural regions; Telework; Western United States; Work practices; Rural areas

Rural Islandness as a Lens for (Rural) HCI,2021,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111651047&doi=10.1145%2f3443704&partnerID=40&md5=6c2d3019baf728e1f4c2679632068c7d,"This article contributes to research that aims to better understand and describe the rural context for rural computing. We argue that the particularities of rurality are heightened by the experience of ĝ islandness'. We report on our experiences of engaging on one small island as islanders established community radio using a novel platform. Data comes from 12 semi-structured interviews with community members and ethnographic field notes assembled through eight researcher visits to the island. Transcripts and notes were analysed using thematic analysis. We discuss how rural islandness as a socio-cultural lens influenced technology appropriation and factors to support participation. We explore the elements of rural islandness that can be used as an analytic tool for rural HCI and HCI more broadly, through three main contributions of rural islandness that we believe have not yet been sufficiently explored in HCI. These are (1) separateness, (2) pushing things ahead, and (3) publics and rural pluralities.  © 2021 ACM.",community engagemen; community radio; ethnography; islandness; publics; Rural HCI; rural studies; thematic analysis,Human computer interaction; Analytic tools; Field notes; Semi structured interviews; Small island; Socio-cultural; Technology appropriations; Thematic analysis; Ubiquitous computing

Rural areas offer novel insights on topics such as privacy, location, values, and space for imagining more diverse forms of information infrastructures and technologies. Human-computer interaction (HCI) can and is offering an important counter to popular media that often emphasizes the apparent helplessness of rural people in the face of complex sociopolitical and economic crises, whether it is about outmoded infrastructure, lack of jobs, and health crises. This special issue is an effort to extend a study of rurality in HCI research and beyond.",,Ubiquitous computing; Computer Human Interaction; Economic crisis; Hci researches; Health crisis; Human computer interaction (HCI); Information infrastructures; Rural people; Human computer interaction

However, we know little about if their experiences with technologies are similar to their ""urban-native""peers. This study reports on a qualitative study in a community in Beijing. We found a new type of ""rurality"": second generation mingongs' experiences with technologies differed from their urban-native peers in nearly every aspect, but exhibited similarities with their peers in rural areas. Taking nostalgia and memory as theoretical lenses, we demonstrate that such a ""rurality""could be a coping mechanism for mingongs' identity struggles. Our work contributed to HCI and CSCW literature by identifying the existence of a new type of ""rurality.""That is, although residing in the city for nearly almost all of their lives, these second generation mingongs experiences greatly differed from their urban-native peers while exhibiting certain similarities with people living in rural areas.  © 2021 ACM.",experience with technology; identity struggles; rurality; Second generation mingongs,Rural areas; Supply chains; Coping mechanisms; Economic growths; Global supply chain; Qualitative study; Rural life; Second generation; Urban growth

Even so, some places remain at the periphery, participating in this system without being fully absorbed by it. In this article, we take a detailed look at the economic life of such a ""pericapitalist""[161] community in the Brazilian Amazon region. We detail how the community increasingly participates in global systems and supply chains, yet also organizes economic life around local and traditional values. We pay special attention to the role of digital technologies in the community, including mobile phones and internet. The contribution of the article is as follows: firstly, it provides a detailed analysis of the material practices of a community at the edge. Secondly, it draws attention to the heterogeneous nature of responses to global capitalism, formed from the relationship between specific material practices, new technology, and elements of cultural identity. Thirdly, it argues for an increased sensibility towards these different relations to capitalism when considering design implications. We argue that close attention to material practice goes some way towards resolving those tensions and, further, provides for an appeal to a more pluralistic views of culture and development [61].  © 2021 ACM.",Amazon rainforest; buen vivir; capitalocene; Decolonial studies; digital technology; pericapitalism; pluriverse,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Brazilian Amazon; Cultural identity; Design implications; Digital technologies; Global systems; Material practices; Specific materials; Traditional values; Supply chains

We sought to understand how HCI researchers navigate work that engages with marginalized people and considerations researchers might work through to expand benefits and mitigate potential harms. In total, 24 HCI researchers, located primarily in the United States, participated in an interview, survey, or both. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four tensions - exploitation, membership, disclosure, and allyship. We explore the complexity involved in each, demonstrating that an equitable endpoint may not be possible, but this work is still worth pursuing when researchers make certain considerations. We emphasize that researchers who work with marginalized people should account for each tension in their research approaches to move forward. Finally, we propose an allyship-oriented approach to research that draws inspiration from discourse occurring in tangential fields and activist spaces and pushes the field into a new paradigm of research with marginalized people.  © 2021 ACM.","allyship, tensions; disclosure; exploitation; Marginalized people; membership",Ubiquitous computing; Human-computer interaction researches; Potential harm; Research approach; Thematic analysis; Human computer interaction

Subsequently, Human-Computer Interaction Games research is increasingly concerned with the development of games that serve neurodivergent1 players. In a critical review of 66 publications informed by Disability Studies and Self-Determination Theory, we analyse which populations, research methods, kinds of play and overall purpose goals existing games address. We find that games are largely developed for children, in a top-down approach. They tend to focus on educational and medical settings and are driven by factors extrinsic to neurodivergent interests. Existing work predominantly follows a medical model of disability, which fails to support self-determination of neurodivergent players and marginalises their opportunities for immersion. Our contribution comprises a large-scale investigation into a budding area of research gaining traction with the intent to capture a status quo and identify opportunities for future work attending to differences without articulating them as deficit.  © 2021 ACM.",adults; children; critical review; disability; Games; neurodivergence; neurodiversity; play; research priorities,Human computer interaction; Critical review; Medical modeling; Medical settings; Self-determination theories; Status quo; Top down approaches; Computer games

Fifteen team leaders used the digital checklist in 187 actual trauma resuscitations. The measures of checklist interactions included the number of unchecked items and the number of notes written on the checklist. Of the 10 contexts we studied, team leaders' arrival after the patient and patients with penetrating injuries were both associated with more unchecked items. We also found that the care of patients with external injuries contributed to more notes written on the checklist. Finally, our results showed that more experienced leaders took significantly more notes overall and more numerical notes than less experienced leaders.

Fusaroli and Tylén [40] achieved a direct comparison by designing two models: one based on alignment theory and the other based on complementarity theory that encapsulated interpersonal synergy and audience design. The current research used these models, extending them to differentiate between interpersonal synergy and audience design. Few studies have tested multiple common ground models against tasks representative of envisioned human - computer interaction (HCI) applications. We report on four such tests, which allowed examination of generalizability of findings. Results supported the complementarity models over the alignment model, and were suggestive of the audience design variant of complementarity, providing guidance for HCI design that differs from contemporary approaches.  © 2021 Public Domain.",Common ground; spoken dialogue systems,Alignment; Alignment theories; Audience design; Communication task; Complementarity models; Human computer interaction (HCI); Human-computer dialogues; Improve performance; Interface designs; Human computer interaction
CogTool+: Modeling Human Performance at Large Scale,2021,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105519286&doi=10.1145%2f3447534&partnerID=40&md5=46440d13b9270247c39383e4a978aa63,"Cognitive modeling tools have been widely used by researchers and practitioners to help design, evaluate, and study computer user interfaces (UIs). Despite their usefulness, large-scale modeling tasks can still be very challenging due to the amount of manual work needed. To address this scalability challenge, we propose CogTool+, a new cognitive modeling software framework developed on top of the well-known software tool CogTool. CogTool+ addresses the scalability problem by supporting the following key features: (1) a higher level of parameterization and automation; (2) algorithmic components; (3) interfaces for using external data; and (4) a clear separation of tasks, which allows programmers and psychologists to define reusable components (e.g., algorithmic modules and behavioral templates) that can be used by UI/UX researchers and designers without the need to understand the low-level implementation details of such components. CogTool+ also supports mixed cognitive models required for many large-scale modeling tasks and provides an offline analyzer of simulation results. In order to show how CogTool+ can reduce the human effort required for large-scale modeling, we illustrate how it works using a pedagogical example, and demonstrate its actual performance by applying it to large-scale modeling tasks of two real-world user-authentication systems.  © 2021 ACM.",automation; Cognitive modeling; CogTool; cyber security; human performance evaluation; parameterization; simulation; software; user authentication,Authentication; Computer aided software engineering; Computer programming; Scalability; Algorithmic module; Cognitive model; Human performance; Key feature; Large-scale modeling; Reusable components; Scalability problems; User authentication systems; User interfaces

Computer models operationalize real-world behaviors of selected variables, and can simulate interactions between the modeled elements through programmed instructions. This study explores how middle school students think about the high-level semantic meaning of those instructions, which we term rules. To investigate this aspect of students' computational thinking, we developed the Computational Modeling Inventory and administered it to 253 7th grade students. The Inventory included three computer models that students interacted with during the assessment. In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the ""typical""questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2 - 10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.  © 2021 ACM.",computer models; computer models in science; Middle school science,Semantics; Computational model; Computational thinkings; Computer models; High level semantics; Middle school science; Middle school students; Programmed instruction; Real-world; Students

It allows us to detect the presence of post-semester depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 85.7% and change in symptom severity with an accuracy of 85.4%. It also predicts these outcomes with an accuracy of >80%, 11-15 weeks before the end of the semester, allowing ample time for pre-emptive interventions.

However, the processes underlying the concept and the nudge's effectiveness in different contexts, and in the long term, are still poorly understood. Our research thus first reviewed the nudge concept and differentiated it from other interventions before applying it to the cybersecurity area. We then carried out an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of three different nudge-related interventions on four types of cybersecurity-specific decisions. Our study demonstrated that the combination of a simple nudge and information provision, termed a “hybrid nudge,” was at least as, and in some decision contexts even more effective in encouraging secure choices as the simple nudge on its own. This indicates that the inclusion of information when deploying a nudge, thereby increasing the intervention's transparency, does not necessarily diminish its effectiveness. A follow-up study explored the educational and long-term impact of our tested nudge interventions to encourage secure choices. The results indicate that the impact of the initial nudges, of all kinds, did not endure. We conclude by discussing our findings and their implications for research and practice. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

We present RubikAuth, an authentication scheme for VR where users authenticate quickly and secure by selecting digits from a virtual 3D cube that leverages coordinated 3D manipulation and pointing. We report on results from three studies comparing how pointing using eye gaze, head pose, and controller tapping impact RubikAuth's usability, memorability, and observation resistance under three realistic threat models. We found that entering a four-symbol RubikAuth password is fast: 1.69-3.5 s using controller tapping, 2.35-4.68 s using head pose and 2.39 -4.92 s using eye gaze, and highly resilient to observations: 96-99.55% of observation attacks were unsuccessful. RubikAuth also has a large theoretical password space: 45n for an n-symbols password. Our work underlines the importance of considering novel but realistic threat models beyond standard one-time attacks to fully assess the observation-resistance of authentication schemes.

We present BodyWire-HCI, which utilizes the human body as a wire-like communication channel, to enable human-computer interaction, that for the first time, demonstrates selective and physically secure communication strictly during touch. The signal leakage out of the body is minimized by utilizing a novel, low frequency Electro-QuasiStatic Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC) technique that enables interaction strictly when there is a conductive communication path between the transmitter and receiver through the human body. Design techniques such as capacitive termination and voltage mode operation are used to minimize the human body channel loss to operate at low frequencies and enable EQS-HBC. The demonstrations highlight the impact of BodyWire-HCI in enabling new human-machine interaction modalities for variety of application scenarios such as secure authentication (e.g., opening a door and pairing a smart device) and information exchange (e.g., payment, image, medical data, and personal profile transfer) through touch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwrig2XQIH8). © 2020 ACM.",Electro Quasi-Static HBC; HBC-HCI; Human Body Communication (HBC); Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Security; Strictly Touch Based Communication,Ambient intelligence; Medical imaging; Signal receivers; Capacitive termination; Human body communications; Human machine interaction; Information exchanges; Secure authentications; Transmitter and receiver; Voltage-mode operation; Wireless transmissions; Human computer interaction
"Privacy Risks, Emotions, and Social Media: A Coping Model of Online Privacy",2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097351575&doi=10.1145%2f3412367&partnerID=40&md5=7c1220f23d3f046f4bd878e776403db7,"This study proposes a novel coping model of privacy that extends prior privacy work in two important ways: first, the reconceptualization of privacy coping reflecting both problem-and emotion-focused strategies, and second, the incorporation of discrete emotions as a driver of privacy coping. Results from online survey data (N = 605) show that Facebook users' adaptation to privacy risks consists of multifaceted coping strategies that are problem-focused, emotion-focused, and communication-focused. These coping strategies have selective relationships with theoretical antecedents such as cognitive appraisals (i.e., threat appraisals and coping appraisals) and negative emotions (i.e., anger, frustration, regret, and anxiety/fear). Discrete emotions play a crucial functional role in determining users' coping responses to privacy risks by selectively activating (or deactivating) emotionally congruent (or incongruent) coping strategies. Specifically, approach-associated emotions such as frustration and regret lead to problem-focused privacy coping strategies, whereas avoidance-associated emotions such as anxiety and fear lead to emotion-focused strategies. We also find a new type of privacy coping strategy: communication-focused coping strategies that are affected by regret and anxiety/fear. © 2020 ACM.",cognitive appraisals; coping; discrete emotions; functional emotion perspectives; Online privacy; social media,Privacy by design; Cognitive appraisal; Coping strategies; Facebook; Online privacy; Online surveys; Privacy risks; Social media; Social networking (online)
Rehabilitation Games in Real-World Clinical Settings,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097339695&doi=10.1145%2f3418197&partnerID=40&md5=90db5ce7c88763a668ba283429d7544c,"Upper-limb impairments due to stroke can severely affect the quality of life in patients. Scientific evidence supports that repetitive rehabilitation exercises can improve motor ability in stroke patients. Rehabilitation games gained tremendous interest among researchers and clinicians because of their potential to make the seemingly mundane, enduring rehabilitation therapies more engaging. However, routine and longitudinal use of rehabilitation games in real-world clinical settings has not been investigated in depth. Particularly, we know little about current practices, challenges, and their potential impacts on therapeutic outcomes. To address this gap, we established a partnership with a rehabilitation hospital where game-assisted rehabilitation was routinely employed over a 2-year period. We then conducted an observational study, in which we observed 11 game-assisted therapy sessions and interviewed 15 therapists who moderated the therapy. Significant findings include (1) different engagement patterns of stroke patients in game-assisted therapy, (2) imperative roles of therapists in moderating games and challenges that therapists face during game-assisted therapy, and (3) lack of support for therapists in delivering patient-centered, personalized therapy to individual stroke patients. Furthermore, we discuss design implications for more effective rehabilitation game therapies that take into consideration both patients and therapists and their specific needs. © 2020 ACM.",neofect rapael smart board; post-stroke patients; rehabilitation; Serious games; upper-limb motor rehabilitation,Electronic medical equipment; Patient treatment; Clinical settings; Design implications; Observational study; Rehabilitation exercise; Rehabilitation hospitals; Rehabilitation therapy; Scientific evidence; Therapeutic outcomes; Patient rehabilitation
Longer Delays in Rehearsal-based Interfaces Increase Expert Use,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097332140&doi=10.1145%2f3418196&partnerID=40&md5=1200163db6b610df864025e6a2666962,"Rehearsal-based interfaces are designed to encourage a transition from novice to expert, but many users fail to make this transition. Most of these interfaces activate novice mode after a short delay, between 150 and 500 ms. We investigate the impact of delay time on expert usage and learning in three crowdsourced experiments. The first experiment examines an 8-item marking menu with delay times from 200 ms to 2 s. Results show longer delays increase successful expert selections. The second and third experiments generalise this result to a different rehearsal-based menu, a desktop clone of FastTap with 8 items and 15 items. Together, our results show that expert use correlates positively with increased delay time, but can increase errors since users are less risk averse. We also find imperceptible delays of 200 ms can harm long-term retention of menu items. Designers should consider longer delays in rehearsal-based interfaces to encourage a transition to expert usage. © 2020 ACM.",expert mode; Learning; menus; novice mode; rehearsal,Human computer interaction; Delay Time; Long-term retention; Marking Menu; Menu items; Risk averse; Ubiquitous computing

Yet, little is known about these processes of technology appropriation and how care practices are impacted. Adopting a relational perspective of care, we longitudinally examined how four family care networks appropriated a new commercial ICT service into their existing technological arrangements and care practices. Cross-case analysis interpreted collaborative appropriation to encompass two interrelated processes of creating and adapting technological practices and negotiating and augmenting care relationships. Four driving forces were also proposed: motivating meanings that actors ascribe to the technology and its use; the learnability of the technology and actors' resourcefulness; the establishment of responsive and cooperative care practices; and the qualities of empathy and shared power in care relationships. The importance of technological literacy, learning, meaning-making, and the nature and quality of care relationships are discussed. Future work is urged to employ longitudinal and naturalistic approaches, and focus design efforts on promoting synergistic care relationships and care practices. © 2020 ACM.",Alzheimer's disease; appropriation; care practices; care relationship; caregiving; case study; cognitive impairment; commercial product; dementia; family care; information and communication technologies; off-the-shelf,Neurodegenerative diseases; Case analysis; Driving forces; Information and Communication Technologies; Meaning makings; Persons with dementia; Quality of care; Technological literacy; Technology appropriations; Engineering education
Necessary and Unnecessary Distractor Avoidance Movements Affect User Behaviors in Crossing Operations,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097338856&doi=10.1145%2f3418413&partnerID=40&md5=76ed3d656a24e94bb20a3118bf049026,"The ""crossing time""to pass between objects in lassoing tasks is predicted by Fitts' law. When an unwanted object, or obstacle, intrudes into the user's path, users curve the stroke to avoid hitting that obstacle. We empirically show that, in the presence of an obstacle, modified Fitts models for pointing with obstacle avoidance can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of movement time compared with standard Fitts' law. Yet, we also found that when an object is (only) close to the crossing path, i.e., a distractor, users still curve their stroke, even though the object does not intrude. We tested the effects of distractor proximity and length. While the crossing motion is modified by a nearby distractor, our results also identify that overall its effect on crossing times was small, and thus Fitts' law can still be applied safely with distractors. © 2020 ACM.",Crossing; distractors; graphical user interface; human motor performance; obstacle avoidance; pointing,Crossing motions; Crossing time; Fitts' law; Movement time; Prediction accuracy; User behaviors; Behavioral research

Findings from a user study where eye, speech, and head movement data were collected from 24 participants demonstrate that the proposed measures are significantly different between low and high load levels with high effect size. It was also found that voluntary actions are more likely to be coordinated during tasks. Implications for the design of multimodal-multisensor interfaces include (i) utilizing event change and interaction in multiple modalities is feasible to distinguish task load levels and load types and (ii) voluntary actions should be allowed for effective task completion. © 2020 ACM.",eye; head; Multimodality; speech; task load,Eye movements; Behavioral measures; Computing devices; Head movements; Multimodal coordination; Multiple modalities; Specific tasks; User interaction; Voluntary action; User experience
TimeToFocus: Feedback on interruption durations discourages distractions and shortens interruptions,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092701504&doi=10.1145%2f3396044&partnerID=40&md5=47b106ca7c2d800d517aab483eb17d2d,"Many computer tasks involve looking up information from different sources, and these self-interruptions can be disruptive. In this article, we investigate whether giving people feedback on how long they are away from their task influences their self-interruption behaviour. We conducted a contextual inquiry on self-interruption behaviour in an office workplace. Participants were observed to postpone physical interruptions until a convenient moment in the task if they were expected to take time. In contrast, observations revealed that digital interruptions were addressed immediately; participants reported these were presumed to be quick to deal with. To increase awareness of time spent on digital interruptions, we developed TimeToFocus, a notification tool showing people the duration of their interruptions while working on a task. A field study deployment of TimeToFocus in an office workplace found that feedback on the duration of interruptions made participants reflect on what they were doing during interruptions. They reported that they used this insight to avoid task-irrelevant activities. To confirm whether participants' perceptions of the benefit of the tool could be measured, we conducted an online experiment, where participants had to retrieve information from an email sent to their personal email addresses and enter it into a spreadsheet. Participants who used our tool made shorter interruptions, completed the spreadsheet task faster and made fewer data entry errors. We conclude that feedback on the length of interruptions can assist users in focusing on their primary task and thus improve productivity.  © 2020 ACM.",contextual inquiry; data entry; distractions; field study; focus; Interruptions; notifications; online experiment; productivity; workplace,Productivity; Spreadsheets; Contextual inquiry; E-mail address; Field studies; Interruption durations; On-line experiments; Primary task; Self-interruption; Time spent; Electronic mail

Early detection of latent user interface problems can be facilitated by user-centered design methods that integrate formal verification technologies. This article considers the role that formal verification technologies can play in the context of user-centered design by considering the following three existing tools: CIRCUS, PVSio-web, and IVY. These tools have been developed to support the model based analysis of critical user interfaces. They have their foundations in existing formal verification technologies, but each of them is focused towards particular issues relating to user interface design. The article explores the different phases of the user-centered design process and the extent to which each of these tools supports these phases. Criteria are developed for assessing their role at each stage of the design process. The results of the evaluation provide guidance to developers to help choose the most appropriate tool based on their analysis needs while at the same time setting challenges for future developments.  © 2020 ACM.",Formal modeling of interactive systems; safety critical systems; user centered design,Formal verification; Safety engineering; Software design; User centered design; Interface problems; Model-based analysis; Provide guidances; Safety-critical domain; Safety-critical user interfaces; User centered design methods; User interface designs; User-centered design process; User interfaces

ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.  © 2020 Owner/Author.",AI applications; ethics; health care; interaction design; interpretability; machine learning; Mental health; mental illness; real-world interventions; society + AI; systematic review,Behavioral research; Diagnosis; Disease control; Diseases; Machine learning; Disease progression; Ethical implications; Human behaviors; Learning patterns; Multi-disciplinary approach; Research and development; State of the art; Systematic Review; Health risks

However, the way we use smell as an interaction modality in human-computer interaction (HCI) is limited. We lack a common reference point to guide designers' choices when using smell. Here, we map out an olfactory design space to provide designers with such guidance. We identified four key design features: (i) chemical, (ii) emotional, (iii) spatial, and (iv) temporal. Each feature defines a building block for smell-based interaction design and is grounded in a review of the relevant scientific literature. We then demonstrate the design opportunities in three application cases. Each application (i.e., one desktop, two virtual reality implementations) highlights the design choices alongside the implementation and evaluation possibilities in using smell. We conclude by discussing how identifying those design features facilitates a healthy growth of this research domain and contributes to an intermediate-level knowledge space. Finally, we discuss further challenges the HCI community needs to tackle.  © 2020 ACM.",chemical sense; novel interactions; odour interfaces; olfactory design space; scent-based interaction design; Smell; smell-based applications; virtual reality applications,Ubiquitous computing; Building blockes; Human computer interaction (HCI); Interaction design; Intermediate level; Knowledge spaces; Reference points; Research domains; Scientific literature; Human computer interaction

We found that experts perform around 800 keyboard shortcuts per day, which are not available on smartphones. Interviews revealed the lack of shortcuts as a major limitation that prevents mobile text editing. Therefore, we elicited gestures for the 22 most important shortcuts for smartphones that are touch-sensitive on the whole device surface. We implemented the gestures for a fully touch-sensitive smartphone using deep learning and evaluated them in realistic scenarios to gather feedback. We show that the developed prototype is perceived as intuitive and faster than recent commercial approaches.  © 2020 ACM.",gestures; keyboard; Shortcuts; smartphone; text editing,Deep learning; Device surfaces; Keyboard shortcuts; Mobile text entry; Potential users; Realistic scenario; Text editing; Smartphones

One is the rising emphasis on women's health, a topic that is often seen as at least partly political. The other development in HCI research is the ongoing interest in supporting democracy and political activism. We present the case of a menstrual cup design project in Taiwan, called the Formoonsa Cup, whose product development led to the change in the legal status of menstrual cups and forcefully challenged a traditional value of hymen maintenance as an expression of ""pure""and morally upright womanhood. We argue that this project is significant to HCI research for the following two reasons: first, because the design project is a successful, if complicated, case of political activism, and second, because the design and legalization processes were in part mediated by platform technologies, including social networking, crowdfunding, and direct democracy platforms. Using philosopher Michel Foucault's notion of ""subjugated knowledge,""we analyze the case to improve understandings of how design can engage in emancipatory politics in the domain of women's health in HCI. In this case study, we begin with the idea that women's freedom of self-care is the knowledge that is subjugated, though by the end we suggest that subjugated knowledge is a more complex, and troubling, category than this initial evaluation suggests. We also argue that design can critique and intervene when it materializes previously subjugated knowledges and renders them both socially intelligible and politically efficacious.  © 2020 ACM.",Genealogy; Menstruation; Policy; Women's health,Health; Philosophical aspects; Social sciences computing; Design projects; Hci researches; Legal status; Michel Foucault; Platform technology; Self-care; Traditional values; Women's health; Product design

Drawing again on our cases, we discuss the importance of taking a long, holistic, and intersectional view to women's wellbeing. Consolidating lessons learned across studies, we emphasize the potential of framing challenges around women's health as learning problems, rather than problems of information access alone. Leveraging this perspective, we propose the use of design-based implementation research as a potential approach in identified learning ecologies, given its emphasis on long-term engagement with multiple stakeholders in the learning process. Although the empirical research we draw from took place in various Indian contexts, we conclude by arguing that key contextual characteristics may translate to other cultures and geographies as well.  © 2020 ACM.",Capabilities approach; HCI4D; Intersectionality; Women's health,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Empirical research; Extrinsic factors; Human capability; Implementation researches; Information access; Learning ecologies; Multiple stakeholders; Through the lens; Health

Results showed that while Re-dictation performs significantly better for more semantically complex edits, Commanding is more suitable for making one-word edits, especially deletions. We developed VoiceRev to combine both the techniques in the same interface and evaluated it with realistic tasks. Results showed improved usability of the combined techniques over either of the two techniques used individually.  © 2020 ACM.",Commanding; Eyes-free; Re-dictation; Text editing; Voice interaction; Voice user interfaces; Voice-based text editing,Human computer interaction; Actual system; Combined techniques; Controlled experiment; Primary Users; User strategies; Voice interaction; Voice-based interfaces; Wizard-of-oz studies; Ubiquitous computing

In doing so, these technologies subtly dictate the forms of knowledge and types of relationships menstruators are expected to establish with their bodies (i.e., transactional or instrumentalized). Through historical analysis and a series of participatory experiments, we offer a vision for menstrual sensemaking that expands on these forms of interaction and ways of knowing to emphasize multiplicity and dimensionality rather than models, predictability, or a user's relation to averages or norms.  © 2020 ACM.",Menstruation; Self-tracking; Transgender health; Women's health,Human computer interaction; Historical analysis; Menstrual cycle; Mobile applications; Participatory experiments; Sensemaking; Tracking technology; Ubiquitous computing

As these devices and platforms proliferate, whether from respected medical institutions or commercial interests, they place new demands on families and add an implicit emphasis on how humans (often mothers) can be augmented and improved by data-rich technology. This is expressed both in the actions they support (e.g., breastfeeding, monitoring food intake), as well as in the emotions they render marginal (e.g., rage, struggle, loss, and regret). In this article, we turn away from optimization and self-improvement narratives to attend to our own felt experiences as mothers and designers. Through an embodied practice of creating Design Memoirs, we speak directly to the HCI community from our position as both users and subjects of optimized parenting tools. Our goal in this work is to bring nuance to a domain that is often rendered in simplistic terms or frames mothers as figures who could endlessly do more for the sake of their families. Our Design Memoirs emphasize the conflicting and often negative emotions we experienced while navigating these tools and medical systems. They depict our feelings of being at once powerful and powerless, expressing rage and love simultaneously, and struggling between expressing pride and humility. The Design Memoirs serve us in advocating that designers should use caution when considering a problem/solution focus to the experiences of parents. We conclude by reflecting on how our shared practice of making memoirs, as well as other approaches within feminist and queer theory, suggest strategies that trouble these optimization and improvement narratives. Overall, we present a case for designing for mothers who feel like they are just making do or falling short, in order to provide relief from the anxiety of constantly seeking improvement.  © 2020 ACM.",Design memoirs; Optimization; Parenting; Uncertainty; Women's health,Human computer interaction; Best practices; Cultural norms; Growing bodies; Medical institutions; Medical systems; Monitoring foods; Sociotechnical; Technical innovation; Ubiquitous computing
Use of intelligent voice assistants by older adults with low technology use,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092497903&doi=10.1145%2f3373759&partnerID=40&md5=eb3bdcaf44547e584f6fde9b20785e1a,"Voice assistants embodied in smart speakers (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home) enable voice-based interaction that does not necessarily rely on expertise with mobile or desktop computing. Hence, these voice assistants offer new opportunities to different populations, including individuals who are not interested or able to use traditional computing devices such as computers and smartphones. To understand how older adults who use technology infrequently perceive and use these voice assistants, we conducted a 3-week field deployment of the Amazon Echo Dot in the homes of seven older adults. While some types of usage dropped over the 3-week period (e.g., playing music), we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information was health-related, this finding emphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g., setting timers, reminders) were initially perceived as useful, the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns. We discuss how these findings apply to other user groups along with design implications and recommendations for future work on voice-user interfaces.  © 2020 ACM.",Conversational interfaces; Low technology use; Older adults; Smart speakers; Voice assistants,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Design implications; Desktop computing; Field deployment; Interaction mediums; On-line information; Technology use; Traditional computing; Voice user interface; User interfaces

In this article, we explore how different translations of HCI knowledge might bridge this gap. A literature review characterizes the gap as having two key dimensions - one between general theory and particular artefacts and a second between academic HCI research and professional UX design practice. We report on a 5-year engagement between HCI researchers and a major media company to explore how a particular piece of HCI research, the trajectories conceptual framework, might be translated for and with UX practitioners. We present various translations of this framework and fit them into the gap we previously identified. This leads us to refine the idea of translations, suggesting that they may be led by researchers, by practitioners or co-produced by both as boundary objects.

Troubling design: A design program for designing with women's health,2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092440576&doi=10.1145%2f3397199&partnerID=40&md5=ef99ed6462b92be44f506a3c20e02c25,"The euphemism ""female trouble""(discreetly referring to women's health experiences) suggests that trouble is linked to women and bodily transitions women can go through. However, trouble is not only a noun; it is also a verb with a strong feminist tradition. In this article, I present troubling design; a theoretically grounded and practice-oriented design program for designing with women's health. Troubling design brings to matter how trouble is an implicit condition of designing ethical and responsible technologies for women's health. By designing with trouble, troubling design encourages designers and researchers to develop knowledge embedded in criticality and questioning status quo, in order to expand their perspectives on designing with intimate and tabooed bodily experiences. Grounded in feminist theory and research-through-design, troubling design contributes with analytical and generative design knowledge articulated through design examples and three practices: staying with the wrong, curious visiting, and collective imagining.  © 2020 Owner/Author.",Design program; Feminist HCI; Feminist theory; Research-through-design; Troubling; Women's health,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Design programs; Generative design; Status quo; Women's health; Health
"Woman-centered design through humanity, activism, and inclusion",2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092444011&doi=10.1145%2f3397176&partnerID=40&md5=92d235684533385105e9fe1f461c5eea,"Women account for over half of the global population, however, continue to be subject to systematic and systemic disadvantage, particularly in terms of access to health and education. At every intersection, where systemic inequality accounts for greater loss of life or limitations on full and healthy living, women are more greatly impacted by those inequalities. The design of technologies is no different, the very definition of technology is historically cast in terms of male activities, and advancements in the field are critical to improve women's quality of life. This article views HCI, a relatively new field, as well positioned to act critically in the ways that technology serve, refigure, and redefine women's bodies. Indeed, the female body remains a contested topic, a restriction to the development of women's health. On one hand, the field of women's health has attended to the medicalization of the body and therefore is to be understood through medical language and knowledge. On the other hand, the framing of issues associated with women's health and people's experiences of and within such system(s) remain problematic for many. This is visible today in, e.g., socio-cultural practices in disparate geographies or medical devices within a clinic or the home. Moreover, the biological body is part of a great unmentionable, i.e., the perils of essentialism. We contend that it is necessary, pragmatically and ethically, for HCI to turn its attention toward a woman-centered design approach. While previous research has argued for the dangers of gender-demarcated design work, we advance that designing for and with women should not be regarded as ghettoizing, but instead as critical to improving women's experiences in bodily transactions, choices, rights, and access to and in health and care. In this article, we consider how and why designing with and for woman matters. We use our design-led research as a way to speak to and illustrate alternatives to designing for and with women within HCI.  © 2020 ACM.",Body; Embodiment; Feminisms; Feminist HCI; Genders; Health care; Intimate care; Technology; Women's health,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Biological body; Design approaches; Global population; Loss of life; Medical Devices; Quality of life; Socio-cultural; Women's health; Health

Game scholar Caillois calls such experiences ""vertigo play,""elucidating that these enjoyable activities are a result of confusion between sensory channels. In HCI, designers are often cautious to avoid deliberately causing sensory confusion in players, but we believe there is an opportunity to transition and extend Caillois' thinking to the digital realm, allowing designers to create novel and intriguing digital bodily experiences inspired by traditional vertigo play activities. To this end, we present the Digital Vertigo Experience framework. Derived from four case studies and the development of three different digital vertigo experiences, this framework aims to bring the excitement of traditional vertigo play experiences to the digital world, allowing designers to create more engaging and exciting body-based games, and provides players with more possibilities to enjoy novel and exciting play experiences.  © 2020 ACM.",augmented reality; bodily interaction; bodily play; exergame; exertion games; head mounted displays; movement-based interaction; social play; sports; Vertigo; virtual reality; whole-body interaction,Human computer interaction; Case-studies; Digital world; Sensory channels; Ubiquitous computing

Unexpected vibrations or sounds from the environment may disrupt the perception of such information. Although disruptive effects have been systematically explored in vision and audition, they have been less thoroughly examined in the haptic domain. Here we briefly review the relevant literature from HCI and psychology, distilling principles of when distraction is likely. We then investigate these principles through four experiments, examining how the timing and modality of relatively rare or unexpected stimuli (surprise distractors) affect the detection and recognition of vibrotactile target patterns. At short distractor-target delays (<350 ms), both auditory and vibrotactile surprise distractors impaired performance. At a longer delay (1,050 ms), performance was not affected overall, even being improved with repeated exposure to the vibrotactile distractors. We discuss the importance of our findings in the context of HCI and cognitive psychology, and we provide design guidelines for mitigating the effects of distraction on haptic devices.  © 2020 ACM.",audio; auditory; distraction; haptic feedback; perception; ring; vibration; vibrotactile pattern; Wearable computing,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Cognitive psychology; Disruptive effects; Haptic devices; Target delay; Target patterns; Vibrotactile; Timing circuits

However, given the physical and ergonomic limitations of neck movement, users may need assistance to view these display spaces comfortably. Through two studies, we developed new ways of minimising the physical effort and discomfort of viewing such display spaces. We first explored how the mapping between gaze angle and display position could be manipulated, helping users view wider display spaces than currently possible within an acceptable and comfortable range of neck movement. We then compared our implicit control of display position based on head orientation against explicit user control, finding significant benefits in terms of user preference, workload and comfort for implicit control. Our novel techniques create new opportunities for productive work by leveraging MR headsets to create interactive wide virtual workspaces with improved comfort and usability.

I detail six types of factors related to the self, audience, network, society, platform, and temporality that contribute to non-disclosure decisions. I show that the Disclosure Decision-Making (DDM) framework introduced in prior work explaining disclosures when they do occur, also explains non-disclosure decisions on social media.

We build on the literature on UX, in particular UX at work, and extend it to ordinary UX at work. In a 10-day diary study, we collected data with a general UX instrument (AttrakDiff), a domain-specific instrument, and interviews. We find that AttrakDiff is valid at work; its three-factor structure of pragmatic quality (PQ), hedonic identification quality, and hedonic stimulation quality is recognizable in the growers' responses. In this article, UX at work is understood as interactions among technology, tasks, structure, and actors. Our data support the recent proposal for the ordinariness of UX at work. We find that during continued use, UX at work is middle-of-the-scale, remains largely constant over time, and varies little across use situations. For example, the largest slope of the four AttrakDiff constructs when regressed over the 10 days was as small as 0.04. The findings contrast existing assumptions and findings in UX research, which is mainly about extraordinary and positive experiences. In this way, the present study contributes to UX research by calling attention to the mundane, unremarkable, and ordinary UXs at work.  © 2020 ACM.",continued use; greenhouse growers; horticultural workplace; User experience; UX at work,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Climate management; Continued use; Domain specific; Factor structure; Hedonic identification; Positive experiences; Pragmatic qualities; User experiences (ux); User experience

Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed - inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as ""Visited Places,"" ""Instrumented Places,"" ""Instrumented People,"" ""Lived-in Places,"" and ""Innovation Spaces.""

To support users in adopting healthy exercise routines, app designers integrate persuasive techniques in their apps. In this study, we focus on two of these techniques, i.e., offering tangible rewards and sending motivational messages to users. Past research has demonstrated the effects of these techniques in nudging recipients to increase their physical activity levels. However, the effect of these interventions on the intrinsic motivation of the participants has not yet been studied. We conducted a 10-month study involving 208 participants; this research consisted of a 3-month baseline (pre-phase), a 4-month experiment and a 3-month follow-up (post-phase). The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three interventions: either they receive money ((i.) through a fixed incentive or (ii.) a lottery), or (iii.) informative messages. Their daily goal was to walk 10K steps. Through their smart phones, we recorded how many steps they walked every day. These interventions had no effect on the main outcome variable (i.e., the number of steps). However, the manipulations produced a detrimental effect on the intrinsic motivation of the participants, measured through a standardized questionnaire. This negative effect extended into the follow-up period. Our study reveals that tangible rewards and motivational messages decrease the intrinsic motivation of the participants, hence their connected physical activity. In our findings, we highlight the importance of intrinsic motivation in setting up healthy exercise routines that will be carried on autonomously by the participants after the period of the intervention. Finally, we present implications for the design of persuasive apps. © 2020 ACM.",Lmer; Longitudinal study; Persuasive technology; Randomized controlled trial,Smartphones; Follow up; Intrinsic motivation; Physical activity; Physical activity levels; Motivation

They are either inevitable, e.g., due to system limits, or are intentionally added, e.g., advertisements. In many situations, a visual feedback is provided during the delay to manage expectations. This feedback is usually provided through progress bars, percentages, or countdowns, depending on design limitations such as screen size. In this article, we use 15-second delays and examine (a) how delays affect users' decision-making and task satisfaction, and (b) how to manipulate time perception to reduce the negative consequences of delays. Experiment 1 (N=421) shows that faster countdowns increase task satisfaction and lead to more rational decisions in the subsequent task. In Experiment 2, we investigate the effect of countdown speed on delay perception and recall (N=531). We show that faster countdowns lead to shorter perceived delays, while the delay will be recalled as longer after the task. The opposite is obtained for slower countdowns. We also increased the countdown rate and found a limit for the effect of increased speed.

"Performing the digital self: Understanding location-based social networking, territory, space, and identity in the city",2020,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078525166&doi=10.1145%2f3364997&partnerID=40&md5=eee499c838c676bc06f6cd04bc0cb914,"Expressions of territoriality have been positioned as one of the main reasons users alter their behaviors and perceptions of spatiality and sociality while engaging with location-based social networks (LBSN). Despite the potential for this interplay to further our understanding of LBSN usage in the context of identity, very little work has actually been done toward this. Addressing this gap in the literature is one of the chief aims of the article. Drawing on an original 6-week study with 42 participants utilizing a bespoke LBSN entitled “GeoMoments,” our research explores the following: (1) the way that territoriality is linked to self-identity; and (2) how this interplay affects the interactions between users as well as the environments they inhabit. Our findings suggest that participants affirmed their self-identity by selectively posting and claiming ownership of their neighborhood through the LBSN. Here, the locative decisions are made related to risk, hierarchies, and the users' relationship to the area. This practice then led participants to discover and interact with the digital information overlaying their physical environments in a playful manner. These interactions demonstrate the perceived power structures that are facilitated by identity claims over a virtual area. In the main, our results reaffirm that territoriality is a central concept in understanding LBSN use, while also drawing attention to the temporality involved in user-to-user and user-to-place interactions pertaining to physical place mediated by LBSN. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Impression management; Location-based social networks; Self-identity; Self-presentation; Territoriality,Location based services; Impression management; Location-based social networks; Self presentations; Self-identity; Territoriality; Location

Given the prevalence and adverse impact of anxiety and anxiety disorders, our goal is to develop a technology that helps people regulate their anxiety through paced breathing. We examined two previously unstudied questions: What is an effective vibrotactile pattern for paced breathing, and where should the tactors be placed on the body to make the pacer most effective? We designed a series of personalized vibrotactile pacing patterns, and evaluated them on three body sites, in terms of self-reported and psychophysiological measures including skin conductance and breath wave parameters. The results show that personalization plays an important role in PIV's pattern and placement design choices. We concluded that the choice of frequency based, strong-exhale-phased patterns and abdomen placement are appropriate for future studies. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Affect; EDA; Emotion; Emotion regulation; Haptic; Respiration; Skin conductance response; Slow-paced breathing; Vibrotactile; Wearable,Human computer interaction; Affect; Emotion; Emotion regulations; Haptic; Respiration; Skin conductance; Slow-paced breathing; Vibrotactile; Wearable; Ubiquitous computing

We identify general eye, head and torso coordination patterns and provide an analysis of the relative movements’ contribution and temporal alignment. We quantify effects of target distance, direction and user posture, describe preferred eye-in-head motion ranges and identify a high variability in head movement tendency. Study insights lead us to propose gaze zones that reflect different levels of contribution from eye, head and body. We discuss design implications for HCI and VR, and in conclusion argue to treat gaze as multimodal input, and eye, head and body movement as synergetic in interaction design. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Eye; Eye gaze; Eye tracking; Eye-head coordination; Gaze interaction; Gaze shifts; Head and body movement; Multimodal interaction,Eye movements; Virtual addresses; Virtual reality; Body movements; Eye-gaze; Eye-head coordination; Gaze interaction; Gaze shifts; Multi-Modal Interactions; Eye tracking

However, there is a lack of empirical research on the practical implications of informed privacy decision-making in IoT. To gain deeper insights into this question, we conducted an online study (N = 488) of people’s privacy decision-making as well as their levels of privacy awareness toward diverse IoT service scenarios. Statistical analysis on the collected data confirmed that people who are well aware of potential privacy risks in a scenario tend to make more conservative and confident privacy decisions. Machine learning (ML) experiments also revealed that individuals overall privacy awareness is the most important feature when predicting their privacy decisions. We verified that ML models trained on privacy decisions made with confidence can produce highly accurate privacy recommendations for users (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 87%). Based on these findings, we propose functional requirements for privacy-aware systems to facilitate well-informed privacy decision-making in IoT, which results in conservative and confident decisions that enjoy high consistency. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Decision confidence; Informed privacy decision-making; IoT; Privacy awareness; Privacy decision support; Privacy-aware system; Random effects model; Random forest,Behavioral research; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Random processes; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Decision confidence; Decision supports; Privacy aware; Privacy awareness; Random effects model; Random forests; Internet of things

Prior research on collaboration technologies (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) has shown that to coordinate system sharing people require awareness of the social context, which interfaces can support by making salient information visible. Although literature exists on how to design for awareness, this can be fragmented and difficult to relate to other application domains. To introduce a broader audience of interaction designers to awareness, we aim to make the available design knowledge more generalizable and operational.With this aim, we construct the Designing for Awareness in Shared Systems framework that gives a structured and comprehensive overview of design considerations for awareness.

I review selected theories- Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism-and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Entanglement; New materialism; Philosophy; Posthumanism,Embedded systems; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Social sciences computing; Virtual reality; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Digital technologies; Entanglement; Knowledge generations; New materialism; Object-oriented ontology; Philosophy; Posthumanism; User centered design

Given the prevalence of smartphones,mindfulness applications have attracted growing global interest. However, themajority of existing applications use guided meditation that is not adaptable to each user's unique needs or pace. This article proposes a novel framework called Attention Regulation Framework (ARF), which studies how more flexible and adaptable mindfulness applications could be designed, beyond guided meditation and toward self-regulated meditation. ARF proposes mindfulness interaction design guidelines and interfaces whereby practitioners naturally and constantly bring their attention back to the present moment and develop nonjudgmental awareness. This is achieved by the performance of subtle movements, which are supported by non-intrusive detection-feedback mechanisms. We used two design cases to demonstrate ARF in static and kinetic meditation conditions. We conducted four user evaluation studies in unique situations where ARF is particularly effective, vis-à-vis mindfulness practice in busy environments and mindfulness interfaces that adapt to the pace of the user. The studies show that the design cases, compared with guided meditation applications, are more effective in improving attention, mindfulness, mood, well-being, and physical balance. Our work contributes to the development of self-regulated mindfulness technologies. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Attention; Attentionregulation; Framework; MBMA; Meditation; Mindfulness; Mobile applications; Self-regulation,Human computer interaction; Attention; Attentionregulation; Framework; MBMA; Meditation; Mindfulness; Mobile applications; Self regulation; Ubiquitous computing

Using eye tracking as an input method is challenging due to accuracy and ambiguity issues, and therefore research in eye gaze interaction is mainly focused on better pointing and typing methods. However, these methods eventually need to be assimilated to enable users to control application interfaces. A common approach to employ eye tracking for controlling application interfaces is to emulate mouse and keyboard functionality. We argue that the emulation approach incurs unnecessary interaction and visual overhead for users, aggravating the entire experience of gaze-based computer access. We discuss how the knowledge about the interface semantics can help reducing the interaction and visual overhead to improve the user experience. Thus, we propose the efficient introspection of interfaces to retrieve the interface semantics and adapt the interaction with eye gaze. We have developed a Web browser, GazeTheWeb, that introspects Web page interfaces and adapts both the browser interface and the interaction elements on Web pages for gaze input. In a summative lab study with 20 participants, GazeTheWeb allowed the participants to accomplish information search and browsing tasks significantly faster than an emulation approach. Additional feasibility tests of GazeTheWeb in lab and home environment showcase its effectiveness in accomplishing daily Web browsing activities and adapting large variety of modern Web pages to suffice the interaction for people with motor impairment. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Eye tracking; Gaze interaction experience; Gaze-based emulation; Gaze-controlled interface; GazeTheWeb; Interface semantics; Introspection; Web accessibility,Digital communication systems; Mammals; Semantics; Web browsers; Websites; Gaze interaction; Gaze-based emulation; GazeTheWeb; Introspection; Web accessibility; Eye tracking

We provide a critical review of the purposes of these technologies and how they discursively conceptualise the agency of autistic children. Through our analysis, we establish six categories of these purposes: Behaviour analysis, assistive technologies, education, social skills, therapy and well-being. Further, our discussion of these purposes shows how the technologies embody normative expectations of a neurotypical society, which predominantly views autism as a medical deficit in need of 'correction'. Autistic children-purportedly the beneficiaries of these technologies-thus become a secondary audience to the largely externally defined purposes.We identify a lack of design for technologies that are geared towards the interests, needs and desires of autistic children. To move HCI's research into autism beyond this, we provide guidance on how to consider agency in use and explicitly allow for appropriation beyond externally driven goals. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Agency; Autism; Children; Literature review; Participation,Diseases; Engineering research; Human computer interaction; Agency; Autism; Children; Literature reviews; Participation; Engineering education

Making maps available for play: Analyzing the design of game cartography interfaces,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069958127&doi=10.1145%2f3336144&partnerID=40&md5=c000cca8e0f4409cc721a06f53a8664e,"Maps in video games have grown into complex interactive systems alongside video games themselves. What map systems have done and currently do have not been cataloged or evaluated. We trace the history of game map interfaces from their paper-based inspiration to their current smart phone-like appearance. Readonly map interfaces enable players to consume maps, which is sufficient for wayfinding. Game cartography interfaces enable players to persistentlymodifymaps, expanding the range of activity to support planning and coordination. We employ thematic analysis on game cartography interfaces, contributing a near-exhaustive catalog of games featuring such interfaces, a set of properties to describe and design such interfaces, a collection of play activities that relate to cartography, and a framework to identify what properties promote the activities. We expect that designers will find the contributions enable them to promote desired play experiences through game map interface design. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cartography; Game design; Maps,Mapping; Maps; Smartphones; Software design; Complex interactive systems; Game design; Game maps; Map interfaces; MAP systems; Thematic analysis; Video game; Way-finding; Human computer interaction
Concurrent think-aloud verbalizations and usability problems,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069953616&doi=10.1145%2f3325281&partnerID=40&md5=ed01294917ed120411ca50295205c899,"The concurrent think-aloud protocol-inwhich participants verbalize their thoughts when performing tasks- is a widely employed approach in usability testing. Despite its value, analyzing think-aloud sessions can be onerous because it often entails assessing all of a user's verbalizations. This has motivated previous research on developing categories to segment verbalizations into manageable units of analysis. However, the way in which a category might relate to usability problems is currently unclear. In this research, we sought to address this gap in our understanding. We also studied how speech features might relate to usability problems. Through two studies, this research demonstrates that certain patterns of verbalizations are more telling of usability problems than others and that these patterns are robust to different types of test products (i.e., physical devices and digital systems), access to different types of information (i.e., video and audio modality), and the presence or absence of a visualization of verbalizations. The implication is that the verbalization and speech patterns can potentially reduce the time and effort required for analysis by enabling evaluators to focus more on the important aspects of a user's verbalizations. The patterns could also potentially be used to inform the design of systems to automatically detect when in the recorded think-aloud sessions users experience problems. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Concurrent think-aloud; Loudness; Pitch; Sentiment; Silence; Speech features; Speech rate; Usability problems; Usability testing; Verbal fillers; Verbalization; Verbalization categories,Audio systems; Continuous speech recognition; Digital devices; Loudness; Pitch; Sentiment; Silence; Speech features; Speech rates; Think aloud; Usability problems; Usability testing; Verbalization; Verbalization categories; Usability engineering
What do we mean by “interaction”? An analysis of 35 years of ChI,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069531390&doi=10.1145%2f3325285&partnerID=40&md5=988ef7c9caa6e391c474e0b3ec5dc5a8,"The notion of interaction is essential to human-computer interaction, yet rarely studied. We use quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate how this notion has been used across 35 years of proceedings from the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI). Using natural language processing, we extract 53,568 occurrences of the word “interaction” across 4,604 papers. In these occurrences, we categorize 2,668 unique words that modify how “interaction” is used in a sentence. We show that the use of “interaction” is both increasing and diversifying, suggesting the importance of the notion, but also the difficulty in developing theory about interaction. Our findings show that styles of interaction are closely associated with changes in technology and that modalities and characteristics of interaction are becoming more of a topic than specific devices or widgets. Interaction qualities, relating to structure, feel, effectiveness, and efficiency, are consistently prominent, and the quality of novelty is increasingly frequent. From this analysis, we identify open questions about interaction, including how to build knowledge across changing technologies, how to work toward a model of quality for interaction, and what the core of a science of interaction could be. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",History; Interaction; Quality; Style,Computation theory; History; Image quality; Natural language processing systems; Quality control; Interaction; Interaction quality; Model of qualities; NAtural language processing; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Style; Unique word; Human computer interaction

We propose four design principles to create tools that mitigate these problems: Provide multiple viewpoints, maintain a single source of truth, reveal the invisible, and support design by enaction.We applied these principles to create Enact, a live environment for prototyping touch-based interactions. We conducted two studies to assess Enact and to compare designer-developer collaboration with Enact versus current tools. Results suggest that Enact helps participants detect more edge cases, increases designers' participation and provides new opportunities for co-creation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Designer-developer collaboration; Prototyping; Touch-based interaction,Human computer interaction; Software prototyping; Current practices; Design and implementations; Design Principles; Designer-developer collaboration; Multiple viewpoints; Professional designers; Technical limitations; Touch based interactions; Ubiquitous computing
Rethinking technologies for behavior change: A view from the inside of Human change,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067583162&doi=10.1145%2f3318142&partnerID=40&md5=90a87b491964baf8cedead8afec1ab03,"Human-Computer Interaction researchers are increasingly designing technologies aimed at supporting ""behavior change."" The model of change, which most of these works embrace, focuses on the idea that change occurs on the behavioral level and that it is externalistic, monistic, mechanistic, fragmented, and episodic. We think that a different take, focusing on the internal aspects of change, may integrate and extend what has been done using this behavioral model. We conducted 20 interviews exploring how individuals live, account for, and manage life changes. Then, we outlined five tentative patterns we identified across different kinds of changes reported by the interviewees, pointing out that change might be internalistic, multiple, intentional, holistic, and continuous. This led us to propose a set of design considerations for the evolution of the current behavior change technologies. Finally, we suggested some preliminary lines of future research, which aim to open the design space of technologies for change. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Behavior change; Behavior change technologies; Human change; Persuasive technologies; Phenomenology; Technologies for change; Third-wave HCI,Ubiquitous computing; Behavior change; Human change; Persuasive technology; Phenomenology; Third wave hci; Human computer interaction

Specifically, we characterize the utility of interactive feature selection through a combination of human-subjects experiments and computational simulations. We find that, in expectation, interactive modification fails to improve model performance and may hamper generalization due to overfitting. We examine how these trends are affected by the dataset, learning algorithm, and the training set size. Across these factors we observe consistent generalization issues.

Although some features of current robots fit children in school settings, we discovered a number of cases where there was a mismatch or additional features are needed.

Exploring low-occlusion qwerty soft keyboard using spatial landmarks,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067545151&doi=10.1145%2f3318141&partnerID=40&md5=0c56d1301f05910c7cd2e498ebe85c9c,"The Qwerty soft keyboard is widely used on mobile devices. However, keyboards often consume a large portion of the touchscreen space, occluding the application view on the smartphone and requiring a separate input interface on the smartwatch. Such space consumption can affect the user experience of accessing information and the overall performance of text input. In order to free up the screen real estate, this article explores the concept of Sparse Keyboard and proposes two new ways of presenting the Qwerty soft keyboard. The idea is to use users' spatial memory and the reference effect of spatial landmarks on the graphical interface. Our final design K3-SGK displays only three keys while L5-EYOCN displays only five line segments instead of the entire Qwerty layout. To achieve this, we employ a user-centered computational design method: first study the reference effect of a single landmark key (line segment) from empirical data, then make assumptions to generalize the effect to multiple landmarks, and finally optimize the best designs. To make the text entry function more complete, we also design and implement gestural interactions for editing operations and non-alphabetical characters' input. User evaluation shows that participants can quickly learn how to type with K3-SGK and L5-EYOCN. After five 15-phrase typing sessions, participants achieve 88.1%-92.8% of the full Qwerty keyboard in terms of words per minute on the smartphone and 98.4%-99.1% on the smartwatch. The differences on character and word error rate between our keyboard designs and the full Qwerty keyboard are not significant. The results of out-of-vocabulary words input are also promising. In addition, participants can quickly recall the typing skills and maintain the input performance even after a few days. User feedbacks in real application contexts show that with the low occlusion keyboard, users can acquire more information and perform less scrolling on the smartphone and achieve a higher input efficiency on the smartwatch with a more fluent input experience. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Keyboard design; Low-occlusion interface; Spatial landmark; Spatial memory; Spatial reference; Text entry,Computer keyboards; Smartphones; User experience; Wearable computers; Keyboard design; Spatial landmark; Spatial memory; Spatial reference; Text entry; User centered design

We use the Freirean model of participatory communication theory to unpack the movement-building process of SftP-Atlanta. The Freirean model provides a three-step, iterative process for sustainablemovement building: forming a collective identity, moving toward collective action, and engaging in reflexive dialog. We analyze both the perceived strengths and weaknesses of their sociotechnical practices in supporting the organization as they iteratively go through the phases of the Freirean model. Finally, we identify inclusivity, privacy/security, and social translucence as three values desirable for sociotechnical practices of grassroots organizing. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Grassroots social movements; Sociotechnical systems; Value-sensitive design,Information theory; Iterative methods; Collective identity; Communication technologies; Computer supported cooperative work systems; Democratic participation; Social computing technologies; Social movements; Sociotechnical systems; Value sensitive design; Computation theory

Do architects and designers think about interactivity differently?,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065762724&doi=10.1145%2f3301425&partnerID=40&md5=85ed2d12a881a5976c3b0ceb9c1ae4a6,"This essay has three parts. In Part 1, I review six biases that frame the way architects and human-computer interaction (HCI) practitioners think about their design problems. These arise from differences between working on procedurally complex tasks in peripersonal space like writing or sketching and being immersed in larger physical spaces where we dwell and engage in body-sized activity like sitting, chatting, and moving about. In Part 2, I explore three types of interface: classical HCI, network interfaces such as context-aware systems, and socio-ecological interfaces. An interface for an architect is a niche that includes the very people who interact with it. In HCI, people are still distinct from the interface. Because of this difference, architectural conceptions may be a fertile playground for HCI. The same holds for interactivity. In Part 3, I discuss why interactivity in HCI is symmetric and transitive. Only in ecological and social interaction is it also reflexive. In ecological interfaces, people co-create bubbles of joint awareness where they share highly situated values, experience, and knowledge. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Architecture; Control effectiveness; Control transparency; Direct manipulation; Ecological interfaces; Embodied interaction; Interactivity; Interface; Joint activity; Networked interaction; Seeing through; Socio-ecological; Transparency,Architecture; Ecology; Interfaces (materials); Transparency; User interfaces; Control effectiveness; Direct manipulation; Embodied interaction; Interactivity; Joint activity; Networked interactions; Seeing through; Socio-ecological; Human computer interaction

Less attention, however, has focused on the role of the environment in fabrication processes. By understanding how interactions with tools, fixtures, materials, and spaces shape workflows, we can better determine how to design the next generation of workshops, design tools, and fabrication equipment to support personal fabrication activities. To build this understanding, site visits and interviews at local makerspaces, fabrication studios, and workshops were conducted. These visits uncovered the rich practices and roadblocks generated by workshops today. The observations identified the importance of spatial layouts, territoriality and occupant agency, distributed knowledge, and organizational flux, among others, to design and fabrication processes. These observations were further synthesized into one possible direction for such spaces: hybrid workshops (i.e., environments that can leverage computation and responsive architecture to enhance a maker's ability to design and fabricate). This work identifies how such spaces could harness the rich practices and eliminate the challenges found with workshops today and discusses the technical innovations and philosophical questions that hybrid workshops will pose to the future of personal fabrication. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adaptive tools; Distributed information; Distributed knowledge; DIY; Environment agency; Hybrid workshop; Makerspace; Making; Organizational flux; Personal fabrication; Responsive environments; Territoriality; Workshop,Knowledge management; Philosophical aspects; Adaptive tools; Distributed information; Distributed knowledge; Environment Agency; Hybrid workshop; Makerspace; Making; Personal fabrication; Responsive environments; Territoriality; Workshop; Fabrication
Temporal constraints in human-building interaction,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065785451&doi=10.1145%2f3301424&partnerID=40&md5=5ec1d08d5c31d57baf36facf3f36e42f,"Human-building interaction (HBI) is converging the fields of architecture and interaction design, leading to new and interesting tensions in perspectives and methodological approaches. One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Human-building interaction; Product life cycle; Smart building; Temporal constraints,Intelligent buildings; Interactive computer systems; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Human-building interaction; Interaction design methods; Iterative approach; Levels of abstraction; Methodological approach; Participatory design; Product life cycles; Temporal constraints; Architectural design

One approach has been to design for distraction - where displays, surfaces, and interactive installations are created to draw visitor's attention away from their immediate thoughts. However, little is known as to how people respond to such interventions. We present the findings of an ethnographic study that examined the social and psychological effects of using distraction as a design principle in a children's hospital reception area.

We call this emerging area Human-Building Interaction (HBI) and introduce it as an interdisciplinary domain of research interfacing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with Architecture and Urban Design. HBI seeks to examine the involvement of HCI in studying and steering the evolution of built environments. Therefore,we need to ask foundational questions such as the following:what are the specific attributes of built environments that HCI researchers should take into account when shifting attention and scale from ""artefacts"" to ""environments""? Are architecture and interaction design methods and processes compatible? Concretely, how can a team of interaction designers bring their tools to an architectural project, and collaborate with other stakeholders? Can and will architecture change the theory and practice of HCI? Furthermore, research in HBI should produce knowledge and practical guidelines by experimenting novel design instances that combine architecture and digital interaction. The primary aim of this article is to specify the mission, vision, and scope of research in HBI.

Understanding the role of interactive machine learning in movement interaction design,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062343834&doi=10.1145%2f3287307&partnerID=40&md5=4bf14ed0381c8b916d7044346924bbe8,"Interaction based on human movement has the potential to become an important new paradigm of human-computer interaction. However, high quality, mainstream movement interaction requires effective tools and techniques to support designers. A promising approach to movement interaction design is Interactive Machine Learning, in which designing is done by physically performing an action. This article brings together many different perspectives on understanding human movement knowledge and movement interaction. This understanding shows that the embodied knowledge involved in movement interaction is very different from the representational knowledge involved in a traditional interface, so a very different approach to design is needed. We apply this knowledge to understand why interactive machine learning is an effective tool for motion interaction designers and to make a number of suggestions for future development of the technique. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Support for carers of young people with mental illness: Design and trial of a technology-mediated therapy,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062327862&doi=10.1145%2f3301421&partnerID=40&md5=7a41698defb695b741c093821a0b9387,"In this article, we show how a technology-mediated mental health therapy involving psycho-education, therapist moderators, and social networking can provide support for carers of young people with mental illness. This multi-faceted tool provides opportunities for users to adapt the system to their needs, leading us to refocus the goal of treatment adherence toward a relatively new phenomenon in HCI, concordance, which has not previously been examined in the HCI literature in relation to online mental-health tools. Concordance shares important links with the development of therapeutic alliance, which is centrally important to mental health therapy, and to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which informed our approach to design. We present a three-month user study, which provides initial encouraging support for both the suitability of concordance as a lens for viewing user engagement and the idea that users can develop a therapeutic alliance with an online support system. This latter result is surprising as the phenomenon of therapeutic alliance generally describes a relationship between client and (human) clinician. Therapeutic alliance has previously been explored for face-to-face groups, and between individuals and online systems, but not for online groups. We show how even automated system behavior can encourage engagement from users and contribute to alliance formation, if the non-human parts of an online system are interactive. We argue that a design approach involving peer/moderator support as well as automated feedback, and which takes account of SDT, can provide support for therapeutic alliance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Concordance; Peer-support; Self-determination theory; Social networking; Technology-mediated support; Therapeutic alliance; User-centered design,Automation; Human computer interaction; Online systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; User centered design; Alliance formation; Automated feedback; Concordance; Design approaches; Face-to-face groups; Peer support; Self-determination theories; Therapeutic alliance; Diseases

Despite their prevalence, we do not have a detailed understanding of how these technologies are used in domestic spaces. To understand how people use VAs, we conducted interviews with 19 users, and analyzed the log files of 82 Amazon Alexa devices, totaling 193,665 commands, and 88 Google Home Devices, totaling 65,499 commands. In our analysis, we identified music, search, and IoT usage as the command categories most used by VA users. We explored how VAs are used in the home, investigated the role of VAs as scaffolding for Internet of Things device control, and characterized emergent issues of privacy for VA users. We conclude with implications for the design of VAs and for future research studies of VAs. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Isopleth: Supporting sensemaking of professional web applications to create readily available learning experiences,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065132053&doi=10.1145%2f3310274&partnerID=40&md5=4ac26c59aeca350814c7d40667a5d114,"Online resources can help novice developers learn basic programming skills, but few resources support progressing from writing working code to learning professional web development practices. We address this gap by advancing Readily Available Learning Experiences, a conceptual approach for transforming all professional web applications into opportunities for authentic learning. This article presents Isopleth, a web-based platform that helps learners make sense of complex code constructs and hidden asynchronous relationships in professional web code. Isopleth embeds sensemaking scaffolds informed by the learning sciences to (1) expose hidden functional and event-driven relationships, (2) surface functionally related slices of code, and (3) support learners manipulating the provided code representations. To expose event-driven relationships, Isopleth implements a novel technique called Serialized Deanonymization to determine and visualize asynchronous functional relationships. To evaluate Isopleth, we conducted a case study across 12 professional websites and a user study with 14 junior and senior developers. Results show that Isopleth's sensemaking scaffolds helped to surface implementation approaches in event binding, web application design, and complex interactive features across a range of complex professional web applications. Moreover, Isopleth helped junior developers improve the accuracy of their conceptual models of how features are implemented by 31% on average. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Automated usability evaluation of virtual reality applications,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065121678&doi=10.1145%2f3301423&partnerID=40&md5=f66d8ea901daac045b48c0be2a2a0c21,"Virtual reality (VR) and VR applications have reached the end-user and, hence, the demands on usability, also for novel applications, have increased. This situation requires VR usability evaluation methods that can be applied quickly, even after a first release of an application. In this article, we describe such an approach, which is fully automated and does not ask users to perform predefined tasks in a fixed test setting. Instead, it works on recordings of the actual usage of a VR application from which it generates task trees. Afterwards, it analyzes these task trees to search for usability smells, i.e., user behavior indicating usability issues. Our approach provides detailed descriptions of the usability issues that have been found and how they can be solved. We performed a large case study to evaluate our approach and show that it is capable of correctly identifying usability issues. Although our approach is applicable for different VR interaction modalities, such as gaze, controller, or hand interaction, it also has limitations. For example, it can detect diverse issues related to user efficiency, but specific misunderstandings of users cannot be uncovered. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Yet our knowledge of it harbours striking absences. There are few, if any detailed accounts of the contingent, material ways in which usability testing is actually practiced. Further, it is rare that industry practitioners' testing work is treated as indigenous and particular (instead subordinated as a 'compromised' version). To service these problems, this article presents an ethnomethodological study of usability testing practices in a design consultancy. It unpacks how fndings are produced in and as the work of observers analysing the test as it unfolds between moderators taking participants through relevant tasks. The study nuances conventional views of usability fndings as straightforwardly 'there to be found' or read off by competent evaluators. It explores how evaluators/observers collaboratively work to locate relevant troubles in the test's unfolding. However, in the course of doing this work, potential candidate troubles may also routinely be dissipated and effectively 'ignored' in one way or another. The implications of the study suggest refnements to current understandings of usability evaluations, and afrm the value to HCI in studying industry practitioners more deeply. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conversation analysis; Ethnomethodology; Usability testing; Work practice,Social aspects; Conversation analysis; Ethnomethodology; Hci researches; Industry practices; Key elements; Usability evaluation; Usability testing; Work practices; Usability engineering
How can affect be detected and represented in technological support for physical rehabilitation?,2019,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061174743&doi=10.1145%2f3299095&partnerID=40&md5=363208dee3d8dee6efd34ff447e31884,"Although clinical best practice suggests that affect awareness could enable more effective technological support for physical rehabilitation through personalisation to psychological needs, designers need to consider what affective states matter, and how they should be tracked and addressed. In this article, we set the standard by analysing how the major affective factors in chronic pain (pain, fear/anxiety, and low/depressed mood) interfere with everyday physical functioning. Further, based on discussion of the modality that should be used to track these states to enable technology to address them, we investigated the possibility of using movement behaviour to automatically detect the states. Using two body movement datasets on people with chronic pain, we show that movement behaviour enables very good discrimination between two emotional distress levels (F1=0.86), and three pain levels (F1=0.9). Performance remained high (F1=0.78 for two pain levels) with a reduced set of movement sensors. Finally, in an overall discussion, we suggest how technology-provided encouragement and awareness can be personalised given the capability to automatically monitor the relevant states, towards addressing the barriers that they pose. In addition, we highlight movement behaviour features to be tracked to provide technology with information necessary for such personalisation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Affective computing; Affective interaction; Chronic pain; Physical rehabilitation,Human computer interaction; Affective Computing; Affective interaction; Chronic pain; Movement behaviour; Physical functioning; Physical rehabilitation; Psychological needs; Technological supports; Health
Fast and precise touch-based text entry for head-mounted augmented reality with variable occlusion,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058790198&doi=10.1145%2f3232163&partnerID=40&md5=d0f86fe097b13ec0c728a8af6c6e54c7,"We present the VISAR keyboard: An augmented reality (AR) head-mounted display (HMD) system that supports text entry via a virtualised input surface. Users select keys on the virtual keyboard by imitating the process of single-hand typing on a physical touchscreen display. Our system uses a statistical decoder to infer users' intended text and to provide error-tolerant predictions. There is also a high-precision fall-back mechanism to support users in indicating which keys should be unmodified by the auto-correction process. A unique advantage of leveraging the well-established touch input paradigm is that our system enables text entry with minimal visual clutter on the see-through display, thus preserving the user's field-of-view. We iteratively designed and evaluated our system and show that the final iteration of the system supports a mean entry rate of 17.75wpm with a mean character error rate less than 1%. This performance represents a 19.6% improvement relative to the state-of-the-art baseline investigated: A gaze-then-gesture text entry technique derived from the system keyboard on the Microsoft HoloLens. Finally, we validate that the system is effective in supporting text entry in a fully mobile usage scenario likely to be encountered in industrial applications of AR HMDs. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Responding to sensitive disclosures on social media: A decision-making framework,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058777250&doi=10.1145%2f3241044&partnerID=40&md5=aa9383179c75e987c0b3b0f2ac768a99,"When people disclose information on social media that is sensitive or potentially stigmatized (e.g., mental illness, pregnancy loss), how do others decide to respond? We use interviews and vignettes to provide a response decision-making framework (RDM) that explains factors informing whether and how individuals respond to sensitive disclosures from their social media connections. The RDM framework includes factors related to the self, poster, and disclosure context (i.e., relational, temporal, social). Our findings include how people's decisions are complicated by balancing their own needs (e.g., privacy, wellbeing) as well as the posters' (e.g., support) when seeing what they consider sensitive posts on social media. We identify empirically grounded insights and information that social media designs could surface to support both potential disclosers and responders. We argue that social media sites should provide privacy controls for both disclosers and responders, and facilitate the visibility of network-level support. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

CheerOn: Facilitating online social support for novice project-based learning teams,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061181287&doi=10.1145%2f3241043&partnerID=40&md5=d2434b828f6d58a80865402891f2a228,"Novices learn innovation best through project-based learning (PBL), working in face-to-face teams to tackle real-world problems. Yet, real-world projects are complex, stressful, and especially challenging for novices. Online communities could provide social support to motivate novices, but it is unclear how to design online communities to support face-to-face PBL teams. Here we ask: How might we design an online system that enlists external supporters to provide online social support to motivate PBL students? Our need-finding study found that PBL students received infrequent social support, rarely engaged in help-seeking, and perceived little progress until the end of their projects. Based on these findings, we designed CheerOn, an online social support system that prompts novice student teams to externalize progress allowing external, online supporters to offer social support. We tested CheerOn with 3 PBL teams and 15 external supporters over a 6-week course.We found that external supporters provided instrumental, informational, and emotional support that strengthened students' bonds to the community, which increased help-seeking. Supporters also provided appraisal support, which increased students' perceived value of their work. Supporters were more likely to offer informational and instrumental support when they were promoted or saw a clear need for help; supporters who received gratitude from students were more likely to offer emotional support in return; and supporters who were closely connected to the community were more likely to offer appraisal and instrumental support. Theoretically, this research contributes to our understanding of how hybrid face-to-face and online communities can impact the behavior of PBL students, specifically towards the facilitation of help-seeking behavior, as well as increased understanding of how different types of social support (i.e., appraisal, emotional, informational, and instrumental) can impact the participation of PBL students and supporters. Practically, this research contributes to our understanding of how to design socio-technical systems that facilitate social support for offline novice PBL students working, expanding the instructional resources available for preparing novices in PBL environments. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",computer supported cooperative work; online communities; progress; project-based learning; self-efficacy; Social support; student motivation; teams,Computer supported cooperative work; E-learning; Online systems; Social networking (online); On-line communities; progress; Project based learning; Self efficacy; Social support; Student motivation; teams; Students
Empirical measurement of perceived privacy risk,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058805106&doi=10.1145%2f3267808&partnerID=40&md5=302632ac373822ebbe8ce750211971e4,"Personal data is increasingly collected and used by companies to tailor services to users, and to make financial, employment, and health-related decisions about individuals. When personal data is inappropriately collected or misused, however, individuals may experience violations of their privacy. Historically, government regulators have relied on the concept of risk in energy, aviation and medicine, among other domains, to determine the extent to which products and services may harm the public. To address privacy concerns in government-controlled information technology, government agencies are advocating to adapt similar risk management frameworks to privacy. Despite the recent shift toward a risk-managed approach for privacy, to our knowledge, there are no empirical methods to determine which personal data are most at-risk and which contextual factors increase or decrease that risk. To this end, we introduce an empirical framework in this article that consists of factorial vignette surveys that can be used to measure the effect of different factors and their levels on privacy risk. We report a series of experiments to measure perceived privacy risk using the proposed framework, which are based on expressed preferences, and which we define as an individual's willingness to share their personal data with others given the likelihood of a potential privacy harm. These experiments control for one or more of the six factors affecting an individual's willingness to share their information: data type, computer type, data purpose, privacy harm, harm likelihood, and individual demographic factors, such as age range, gender, education level, ethnicity, and household income. To measure likelihood, we introduce and evaluate a new likelihood scale based on construal level theory in psychology. The scale frames individual attitudes about risk likelihood based on social and physical distance to the privacy harm. The findings include predictions about the extent to which the above factors correspond to risk acceptance, including that perceived risk is lower for induced disclosure harms when compared to surveillance and insecurity harms as defined in Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy. We also found that participants are more willing to share their information when they perceive the benefits of sharing. In addition, we found that likelihood was not a multiplicative factor in computing privacy risk perception, which challenges conventional theories of privacy risk in the privacy and security community. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Factorial vignettes; Multilevel modeling; Privacy; Privacy risk perception,Computation theory; Computer privacy; Information dissemination; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Empirical measurement; Factorial vignettes; Government regulators; Multilevel model; Multiplicative factors; Privacy risks; Products and services; Risk management framework; Data privacy

We have deployed and studied the use of telepresence robots at three ACM conferences, Ubicomp/ISWC 2014, CSCW 2016, and CHI 2016, ranging from remote users having dedicated telepresence robots to users sharing telepresence robots both synchronously and asynchronously. In this article, we report on the telepresence offerings along with the user behaviors, experiences, and the social norms found for remote conference attendance. Our results across the studies focus around three main themes: shared vs. dedicated robot usage, identity presentation and the value and challenges associated with it; and local in-person support through proxies and instant messaging backchannels. These themes point to three different areas of design exploration for telepresence robots, pointing out the limitations of existing design solutions with respect to each theme, areas for future telepresence design work, and the value in considering varied telepresence robot solutions, including both dedicated and shared telepresence robots. 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4-14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",artificially intelligent agent; Autism; intelligent learning environments; neurodiversity; social communication,Artificial intelligence; Blending; Bridges; Computer aided instruction; Diseases; Virtual reality; Autism; Educational intervention; Individual Differences; Intelligent learning environments; Intelligent technology; Learning difficulties; neurodiversity; Social communications; Intelligent well technology

This interaction strategy is attracting increasing interest within sustainable HCI studies. While most of these consider how interactive technology can change household behavior, only a few report on how shifting is experienced in everyday life when assisted by automation. In this study, we investigate an interactive technology that assists households to shift electricity consumption to times when electricity is cheap or more sustainable. Our study was conducted as a long-term field deployment for 6-18 months with eight households, each living with an interactive prototype that shifts running times for a heat pump within user-defined boundaries. Our findings show that managing heat pumps toward assisted shifting was well-received by all households because it was a convenient way to shift electricity consumption. Shifting electricity use facilitated price savings of 6.8-16.9%. Nevertheless, our findings also reveal a conflict between the system design, and how householders actually interact with their heating system and experience assisted shifting. Based on the eight households' experiences, we present three overall themes of convenience, control, and complexity that each describes different aspects of long-term real-life use of automatic technology assisting households to shift electricity use. We discuss the broader implications of these findings and the role of design and future sustainability technology in everyday life. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Automation; Domestic; Electricity use; Field study; Heating; Long-term; Shifting; Smart grid; Sustainability,Automation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Domestic; Electricity use; Field studies; Long-term; Shifting; Smart grid; Heating

We find that posts seeking support receive more comments, and comments from ""throwaway"" (i.e., anonymous) accounts are more likely on posts also from throwaway accounts. Anonymous commenting enables commenters to share intimate content such as reciprocal disclosures and supportive messages, and commenter anonymity is not associated with aggressive or unsupportive comments.

These models fell into personal, private, public, and interpersonal categories. We contribute insights regarding the following barriers and facilitators associated with these models: (1) affordability; (2) individual capabilities; (3) interpersonal trust, care and/or reciprocity; (4) trust in technology; (5) service availability/eligibility; (6) spatial and temporal matches; (7) match between transportation mode and physical needs; (8) service reliability and quality; and (9) infrastructure access.

Infrastructural inaccessibility: Tech entrepreneurs in occupied palestine,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060328971&doi=10.1145%2f3219777&partnerID=40&md5=d7cf7e71b8abda8ffbc9facfb973fd44,"In this article, we examine the fundamental and taken-for-granted infrastructures that make tech entrepreneurship possible. We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs' potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Participatory design,Public works; Digital platforms; Ethnographic study; Legal frameworks; Mobile Internet; Multiple dimensions; Palestine; Participatory design; Payment gateways; Critical infrastructures
Speed-accuracy tradeoff: A formal information-theoretic transmission scheme (FITTS),2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054284280&doi=10.1145%2f3231595&partnerID=40&md5=4ae752da4bfb002dab4f552ccb94b671,"The rationale for Fitts' law is that pointing tasks have the information-theoretic analogy of sending a signal over a noisy channel, thereby matching Shannon's capacity formula. Yet, the currently received analysis is incomplete and unsatisfactory: There is no explicit communication model for pointing; there is a confusion between central concepts of capacity (a mathematical limit), throughput (an average performance measure), and bandwidth (a physical quantity); and there is also a confusion between source and channel coding so that Shannon's Theorem 17 can be misinterpreted. We develop an information-theoretic model for pointing tasks where the index of difficulty (ID) is the expression of both a source entropy and a zero-error channel capacity. Then, we extend the model to include misses at rate ε and prove that ID should be adjusted to (1 − ε)ID. Finally, we reflect on Shannon's channel coding theorem and argue that only minimum movement times, not performance averages, should be considered. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Channel capacity; Fitts' law; Speed-accuracy tradeoff,Channel capacity; Channel coding; Explicit communication; Fitts' law; Performance measure; Physical quantities; Shannon's theorem; Source and channel coding; Speed accuracy; Transmission schemes; Transmissions

Such maps would allow non-visual haptic exploration with advanced functions, such as panning and zooming. In this study, we designed an actuated tangible tabletop interface, called BotMap, allowing the exploration of geographic data through non-visual panning and zooming. In BotMap, small robots represent landmarks and move to their correct position whenever the map is refreshed. Users can interact with the robots to retrieve the names of the landmarks they represent. We designed two interfaces, named Keyboard and Sliders, which enable users to pan and zoom. Two evaluations were conducted with, respectively, ten blindfolded and eight VI participants. Results show that both interfaces were usable, with a slight advantage for the Keyboard interface in terms of navigation performance and map comprehension, and that, even when many panning and zooming operations were required, VI participants were able to understand the maps. Most participants managed to accurately reconstruct maps after exploration. Finally, we observed three VI people using the system and performing a classical task consisting in finding the more appropriate itinerary for a journey. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Actuated interface; Interactive map; Non-visual interaction; Pan; Tactile map; Tangible interaction; Tangible user interface; Visual impairment; Zoom,Interactive computer systems; Maps; Robots; Actuated interfaces; Interactive maps; Non-visual interaction; Tactile maps; Tangible interaction; Tangible user interfaces; Visual impairment; Zoom; User interfaces
Older adults’ deployment of ‘Distrust’,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051981485&doi=10.1145%2f3196490&partnerID=40&md5=4e0b7be80193f5ae16656893ce0cf87d,"Older adults frequently deploy the concept of distrust when discussing digital technologies, and it is tempting to assume that distrust is largely responsible for the reduced uptake by older adults witnessed in the latest surveys of technology use. To help understand the impact of distrust on adoption behavior, we conducted focus groups with older adults exploring how, in what circumstances, and to what effect older adults articulate distrust in digital technologies. Our findings indicate that distrust is not especially relevant to older adults’ practical decision making around technology (non-)use. The older adults in our study used the language of distrust to open up discussions around digital technologies to larger issues related to values. This suggests that looking to distrust as a predictor of non-use (e.g., in Technology Acceptance Model studies) may be uniquely unhelpful in the case of older adults, as it narrows the discussion of technology acceptance and trust to interactional issues, when their use of distrust pertains to much wider concerns. Likewise, technology adoption should not be viewed as indicative of trust or an endorsement of technology acceptability. Older adults using-while-distrusting offers important insights into how to design truly acceptable digital technologies. © 2018 ACM.",Adoption; Ageing; Aging; Inclusive design; Technology acceptance model (TAM); Trust,Aging of materials; Decision making; Adoption; Ageing; Inclusive design; Technology acceptance model; Trust; Behavioral research
Automatics: Dynamically generating fabrication tasks to adapt to varying contexts,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051939749&doi=10.1145%2f3185065&partnerID=40&md5=c590ebaf97b94ff1a6593da4288a3c19,"When fabricating, it is common to follow a prescribed set of steps in a tutorial or how-to. While popular, such explicit knowledge resources have many inconsistencies and omissions, use static illustrations, and cannot adapt to drop-in makers or a maker’s mistakes. To overcome many of these issues, this work presents Automatics, a novel explicit knowledge resource system that dynamically generates fabrication activities for one or more makers based on their current environmental and fabrication context. Automatics assigns tasks to makers based on the past tools and components the maker was working with, enables makers to recover from mistakes through model regeneration, suggests alternative tools if a needed tool is unavailable or in use, and allows multiple makers to drop-in throughout a fabrication activity. Initial usage and feedback from novice makers showed that Automatics increases the number of tasks that can be completed compared to paper instructions, decreases frustration, and improves one’s understanding of the global context of assigned tasks during fabrication activities. © 2018 ACM.",Assembly; Assembly sequence planning; Error handling; Explicit knowledge resources; Fabrication; Instruction consumption; Making; Multi-maker fabrication; Tool substitution,Assembly; Drops; Assembly sequence planning; Error handling; Explicit knowledge; Instruction consumption; Making; Fabrication

We address this problem by augmenting text messaging with information about users and contexts. We present and reflect on lessons learned from three field studies, in which we deployed augmentation concepts as prototype chat apps in users' daily lives. We studied (1) subtly conveying context via dynamic font personalisation (TapScript), (2) integrating and sharing physiological data - namely heart rate - implicitly or explicitly (HeartChat) and (3) automatic annotation of various context cues: music, distance, weather and activities (ContextChat). Based on our studies, we discuss chat augmentation with respect to privacy concerns, understandability, connectedness and inferring context in addition to methodological lessons learned. Finally, we propose a design space for chat augmentation to guide future research, and conclude with practical design implications. © 2018 ACM.",Chat context; Heart rate; Mobile device sensors; Mobile text messaging,Heart; Mobile devices; Automatic annotation; Chat context; Design implications; Emotional awareness; Face-to-face communications; Heart rates; Physiological data; Understandability; Text messaging
Interpretive impacts of text visualization: Mitigating political framing effects,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051990788&doi=10.1145%2f3214353&partnerID=40&md5=704c9bd70544a8a5de6642ed6b39db1d,"Information visualizations are often evaluated as a tool in terms of their ability to support performance of a specific task. This article argues that value can be gained by instead evaluating visualizations from a communicative perspective. Specifically, it explores how text visualization can influence the impacts that framing has on the perception of political issues. Using data from a controlled laboratory study, the results presented here demonstrate that exposure to a text visualization can mitigate framing effects. Furthermore, it also shows a transfer effect, where participants who saw the visualization remained uninfluenced by framing in subsequent texts, even when the visualization was absent. These results carry implications for the methods used to evaluate information visualization systems, for understanding the cognitive and interpretive mechanisms by which framing effects occur, and for exploring the design space of interactive text visualization. © 2018 ACM.",Text visualization; Visualization design,Cognitive systems; Data visualization; Information analysis; Information systems; Controlled laboratories; Framing effects; Information visualization; Information visualization system; Interactive text visualizations; Political issues; Text visualization; Visualization designs; Visualization

These characteristics have been investigated in various studies in human-computer interaction (HCI) and related research fields. Such studies include applications for using the body as a conductive lead for transmission or electric field sensing and activating human muscles or organs. However, electricity is not completely safe for the human body; therefore, to avoid harming users, careful consideration is essential when developing such devices. The knowledge required for such consideration is spread throughout a large number research fields, and it can be difficult for researchers in the HCI field to comprehend all of them. The purpose of this article is to support researchers in developing systems that apply electricity to the human body and to serve as a basis for further research. This article reviews previous research pertaining to HCI in which users come into contact with electricity. In addition, considerations of how and where this type of research can be expanded, along with guidelines grounded in other fields for designing systems safely and addressing ethical concerns, are presented. An understanding of the field and of the related safety issues will enhance the understanding of limitations and potential and can clarify the design space. © 2018 ACM.",Actuation; Electric shock; Electrical stimulation; On-body interaction; Perception,Electric fields; Sensory perception; Actuation; Designing systems; Electric field sensing; Electric shock; Electrical characteristic; Electrical stimulations; Human computer interaction (HCI); On-body interactions; Human computer interaction
Fallacies of agreement: A critical review of consensus assessment methods for gesture elicitation,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058447468&doi=10.1145%2f3182168&partnerID=40&md5=5c8b16bedc4bdf12c4bc755d6f7f6248,"Discovering gestures that gain consensus is a key goal of gesture elicitation. To this end, HCI research has developed statistical methods to reason about agreement. We review these methods and identify three major problems. First, we show that raw agreement rates disregard agreement that occurs by chance and do not reliably capture how participants distinguish among referents. Second, we explain why current recommendations on how to interpret agreement scores rely on problematic assumptions. Third, we demonstrate that significance tests for comparing agreement rates, either within or between participants, yield large Type I error rates (>40% for α =.05). As alternatives, we present agreement indices that are routinely used in interrater reliability studies. We discuss how to apply them to gesture elicitation studies. We also demonstrate how to use common resampling techniques to support statistical inference with interval estimates.

However, most interventions fail to take habitual behaviour into account, limiting their potential impact. This failure is partly driven by a plethora of overlapping behaviour change theories and related strategies that do not consider the role of habits. We critically review the main theories and models used in the research to analyse their application to designing effective habitual behaviour change interventions. We highlight the potential for Dual Process Theory, modern habit theory, and Goal Setting Theory, which together model how users form and break habits, to drive effective digital interventions. We synthesise these theories into an explanatory framework, the Habit Alteration Model, and use it to outline the state of the art.

Collective privacy management in social media: A cross-cultural validation,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058992552&doi=10.1145%2f3193120&partnerID=40&md5=78461135827f3010270baf876cb69c62,"If one wants to study privacy from an intercultural perspective, one must first validate whether there are any cultural variations in the concept of “privacy” itself. This study systematically examines cultural differences in collective privacy management strategies, and highlights methodological precautions that must be taken in quantitative intercultural privacy research. Using survey data of 498 Facebook users from the US, Singapore, and South Korea, we test the validity and cultural invariance of the measurement model and predictive model associated with collective privacy management. The results show that the measurement model is only partially culturally invariant, indicating that social media users in different countries interpret the same instruments in different ways. Also, cross-national comparisons of the structural model show that causal pathways from collective privacy management strategies to privacy-related outcomes vary significantly across countries. The findings suggest significant cultural variations in privacy management practices, both with regard to the conceptualization of its theoretical constructs, and with respect to causal pathways. © 2018 ACM 1073-0516/2018/06-ART17 $15.00",Collective privacy management; Measurement invariance; Privacy; Social media,Data privacy; Predictive analytics; Cross-national; Cultural difference; Measurement model; Predictive modeling; Privacy management; Social media; South Korea; Structural modeling; Social networking (online)

But they are notoriously difficult to implement at scale and many devices are abandoned following initial adoption.We report findings from a study of global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices intended to support the independent living of people with cognitive impairment. Our aims were threefold: to understand (through ethnography) such individuals' lived experience of GPS tracking; to facilitate (through action research) the customization and adaptation of technologies and care services to provide effective, ongoing support; and to explore the possibilities for a co-production methodology that would enable people with cognitive impairment and their families to work with professionals and technical designers to shape these devices and services to meet their particular needs in a sustainable way.We found that the articulation work needed for maintaining the GPS technology in ""working order"" was extensive and ongoing. This articulation work does not merely supplement formal procedures, a lot of it is needed to get round them, but it is also often invisible and thus its importance goes largely unrecognized. If GPS technologies are to be implemented at scale and sustainably, methods must be found to capitalize on the skills and tacit knowledge held within the care network (professional and lay) to resolve problems, improve device design, devise new service solutions, and foster organizational learning. 2018 © is held by the owner/author(s).",Ageing in place; Articulation work; Assisted living; Co-production; Cognitive impairment; Collaboration; GPS; Telecare; Telehealth,Assisted living; Engineering education; Medical computing; Ageing in place; Articulation works; Co-production; Cognitive impairment; Collaboration; Telecare; Telehealth; Global positioning system

While a number of online marketplaces have emerged to facilitate such connections, most end-users do not approach a market to hire an expert when faced with a challenge. To reduce friction in hiring from peer-to-peer expert crowd work markets, we propose Ink, a system that crowd workers can use to showcase their services by embedding tasks inside web tutorials-a common destination for users with information needs. Workers have agency to define and manage tasks, through which users can request their help to review or execute each step of the tutorial, for example, to give feedback on a paper outline, perform a statistical analysis, or host a practice programming interview. In a public deployment, over 25,000 pageviews led 168 tutorial readers to pay crowd workers for their services, most of whom had not previously hired from crowdsourcing marketplaces. A field experiment showed that users were more likely to hire crowd experts when the task was embedded inside the tutorial rather than when they were redirected to the same worker's Upwork profile to hire them. Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that Ink framed hiring expert crowd workers within users' well-established information seeking habits and gave workers more control over their work. © 2018 ACM.",Crowdsourcing; Social computing,Crowdsourcing; Electronic commerce; Employment; Friction; Peer to peer networks; Field experiment; Information seeking; On-line marketplaces; Pageviews; Peer to peer; Qualitative analysis; Social computing; Web tutorials; Surveys

We evaluate the impact of this feedback on task performance and perceived task performance, in comparison to industry standard mid-task self-assessments, and explore participants' perceptions of this feedback. In line with previous work, we confirm that deploying self-reporting methods affect both perceived and actual performance. Conversely, we conclude that our objective concurrent feedback correlated more closely with task demand, supported reflection in action, and did not negatively affect performance.

In addition, we present a research model considering the impact of player characteristics on learning outcome and player experience as well as their interrelation. Two empirical studies were conducted with 280 students. The application domain was computer programming. Study 1 compared three DEGs of the Mini-Game genre, differing in a single GEAM attribute-time pressure vs. puzzle solving and abstract vs. realistic settings. Study 2 compared DEGs of different genres, which vary in the implementation of several GEAM attributes. None of the player characteristics were found to be statistically significant factors. For both studies, significant differences were found in learning outcomes, for Study 2 also in some of the player experience dimensions.

Next, we use blocklists to interrogate online harassment – the forms it takes, as well as tactics used by harassers. Specifically, we interviewed both people who use blocklists to protect themselves, and people who are blocked by blocklists. We find that users are not adequately protected from harassment, and at the same time, many people feel that they are blocked unnecessarily and unfairly. Moreover, we find that not all users agree on what constitutes harassment.

With the massive amount of fine-grained data being generated, new data-points are being generated, which can shed light on player and team performance. However, due to the complexity of plays in continuous sports, these data-points often lack the specificity and context to enable meaningful retrieval and analytics. In this article, we present an intelligent human-computer interface that utilizes trajectories instead of words, which enables specific play retrieval in sports. Various techniques of alignment, templating, and hashing were utilized by our system and they are tailored to multi-agent scenario so that interactive speeds can be achieved. We conduct a user study to compare our method to the conventional keywords-based system and the results show that our method significantly improves the retrieval quality. We also show how our interface can be utilized for broadcast purposes, where a user can draw and interact with trajectories on a broadcast view using computer vision techniques. Additionally, we show that our method can also be used for interactive analytics of player performance, which enables the users to move players around and see how performance changes as a function of position and proximity to other players. © 2018 ACM.",Alignment; Camera calibration; Fine-grain retrieval; Interactive analytics; Multiagent trajectories; Sports analytics,Alignment; Human computer interaction; Multi agent systems; Trajectories; Camera calibration; Computer vision techniques; Fine grains; Human computer interfaces; Intelligent interface; Interactive analytics; Multiagent; Player and ball tracking; Sports

The paper aims to revitalize and revise PD to help people influence big issues. The agenda for this is set through proposing a set of key elements for realizing new, important possibilities. We discuss the possible changes of partnership with users, call for a new role of researchers as activists, debate how to work with demanding visions for lasting impact, and democratic control. We focus on high technological ambitions, on deployment of working prototypes, on alliances, and on scaling up, all seen as important for a PD that matters. We conclude the paper with an invitation to participate in the continued discussion, codesign, and realization of a PD that matters. © 2018 ACM.",Alternatives; Participatory design,Human computer interaction; Alternatives; Co-designs; Computer technology; Human lives; Key elements; Participatory design; Scaling-up; Ubiquitous computing

A variety of Personal Informatics (PI) tools are starting to provide support and improve athletes' performance in many sports. In this article, we interviewed 20 amateur and elite athletes of different disciplines, using an array of PI devices, to explore how sports, as well as athletes' experience, are affected by such instruments. We discovered that amateur athletes present different patterns of usage compared to elite ones. Moreover, we found that elite athletes make sense of their data by exploiting the knowledge they have about their own body and sports practice. We then proposed four considerations for design that we believe should be explored in the future, 6 to reflect on how self-tracking is changing our perspective on sports, and, by and large, on our everyday life. © 2018 ACM 1073-0516/2018/06-ART16 $15.00",Amateur athletes; Elite athletes; Information visualization; Personal Informatics; Quantified Self; Self-tracking; Sport; Wearable devices,Information systems; Wearable technology; Amateur athletes; Elite athlete; Information visualization; Personal informatics; Quantified selves; Self-tracking; Wearable devices; Sports

Moreover, the role messaging plays in interaction and talk with those who are co-present has been neglected. In this article, we draw upon a corpus of naturalistic recordings of text message reading and composition to document the face-to-face life of text messages. Messages, both sent and received, share similarities with reported speech in conversation; they can become topical resource for local conversation-supporting verbatim reading aloud or adaptive summaries. Yet with text messages, their verifiability creates a distinctive resource. Similarly, in message composition, what to write may be discussed with collocated others. We conclude with discussion of designs for messaging in both face-to-face, and remote, communication. © 2018 ACM.",Mobile devices; Text messaging; Video analysis,Human computer interaction; Mobile devices; Ubiquitous computing; Co-present; Face to face; Message readings; Verifiability; Video analysis; WhatsApp; Text messaging
Opening up the design space of neurofeedback brain-computer interfaces for children,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041436204&doi=10.1145%2f3131607&partnerID=40&md5=513f6b1d4c841c71eb64b7e592b6cc9c,"Brain-computer interface applications (BCIs) utilizing neurofeedback (NF) can make invisible brain states visible in real time. Learning to recognize, modify, and regulate brain states is critical to all children's development and can improve learning, and emotional and mental health outcomes. How can we design usable and effective NF BCIs that help children learn and practice brain state self-regulation? Our contribution is a list of challenges for this emerging design space and a conceptual framework that addresses those challenges. The framework is composed of five interrelated strong concepts that we adapted from other design spaces. We derived the concepts reflectively, theoretically, and empirically through a design research process in which we created and evaluated a NF BCI, called Mind-Full, designed to help children living in Nepal who had suffered from complex trauma learn to self-regulate anxiety and attention. We add rigor to our derivation methodology by horizontally and vertically grounding our concepts, that is, relating them to similar concepts in the literature and instantiations in other artifacts.We illustrate the generative power of the concepts and the inter-relationships between them through the description of two new NF BCIs we created using the framework for urban and indigenous children with anxiety and attentional challenges. We then show the versatility of our framework by describing how it inspired and informed the conceptual design of three NF BCIs for different types of self-regulation: selective attention and working memory, pain management, and depression. Last, we discuss the contestability, defensibility, and substantiveness of our conceptual framework in order to ensure rigor in our research design process. Our contribution is a rigorously derived design framework that opens up this new and emerging design space of NF BCI's for children for other researchers and designers. © 2018 ACM.",Brain-computer interfaces; Children; Conceptual framework; Design; Mental health; Self-regulation; Strong concepts,Conceptual design; Deregulation; Design; Health; Interface states; Interfaces (computer); Children; Conceptual frameworks; Mental health; Self regulation; Strong concepts; Brain computer interface

I thus propose a cooperative engagement between feminist utopianism and PD at the levels of theory, methodology, and on-the-ground practice. I offer an analysis of a case—an urban renewal project in Taipei, Taiwan—as a means of exploring what such a cooperative engagement might entail. I argue that feminist utopianism and PD have complementary strengths that could be united to develop and to propose alternative futures that reflect democratic values and procedures, emerging technologies and infrastructures as design materials, a commitment to marginalized voices (and the bodies that speak them), and an ambitious, even literary, imagination. © 2018 ACM.",,Human computer interaction; Co-operative engagement; Design experiments; Design materials; Emerging technologies; Participatory design; Reflective practices; Social justice; Urban renewal projects; Ubiquitous computing

In this article, we describe an approach taken to empower socially disadvantaged citizens, using a variety of both social and technological tools, in a Smart City project. Through analysing the nature of citizens' concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has control of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city. © 2018 ACM.",Citizen innovation; Digital civics; Participatory design; Smart cities,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Co-designing; Digital civics; Finding solutions; Local authorities; Participatory design; Technological tools; Urban population; Urban scale; Smart city
Participatory design in emerging civic engagement initiatives in the new public sector: Applying PD concepts in resource-scarce organizations,2018,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041443576&doi=10.1145%2f3152420&partnerID=40&md5=73b7bc2d4e888c820d217b4908a1d53b,"In this study, we address the role of Participatory Design (PD) in emerging public sector governance forms and, more specifically, civic engagement and we-government initiatives. We achieve this by first providing a research overview of the development of PD approaches since they originated in the 1970s, identifying different PD generations and associated concepts, contexts, and challenges, and then relating them to current public sector trends. Next, we link the overview to a practical example by presenting a case of applying PD to a civic engagement project that takes place in the Swedish emergency response system. Our example findings sustain previously identified needs to return to broad change processes and balance this with ICT re-configuration and structuration of the collaborative processes, the related stakeholders, and their needs, this time in a context where work tasks and responsibilities are not yet defined, known or experienced among stakeholders. We then suggest methodological ways to handle this by (1) applying an interdisciplinary PD approach, (2) replacing the traditional design groupwith a combination of various qualitativemethods and PD techniques, e.g., focus groups,modified scenario-based future workshops, exercises, and after-action-reviews, and (3) support PD activities with context-specific frameworks. We argue that applying PD concepts to the governance forms that are emerging in resource-constrained public sector organizations poses a number of challenges, many of them relating directly to the unknown character of the work setting and the practical difficulties of involving civil citizens as end-users. However, if they are addressed and handled adequately, making civic engagement initiatives work processes and ICT support to work smoothly, this can contribute to a re-politicization of PD in terms of space, action, and the empowerment of citizens both by enhancing their skills and by having them represented in design activities. 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Civic engagement; Participatory design; Public sector,Human computer interaction; After action review; Civic engagement; Collaborative process; Emergency response systems; Government initiatives; Participatory design; Public sector; Public sector organization; Ubiquitous computing

We identify that the most discriminative changes in physiological signals happen at the later stages of the information consumption process, reflected in changes on the upper EEG frequency bands, higher levels of EDA, and heart-rate acceleration. Additionally, we present a comprehensive analysis by benchmarking the predictive power of each of the physiological signals separately, and by comparing them to state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms based on facial video recordings.

This model is then used to present our survey of existing user identification approaches and visualize their characteristics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The model also makes it possible to visually represent requirements of systems that require user identification, identify existing approaches that can meet an application's requirements, and help report on and evaluate new approaches to user identification systematically. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Authentication; IMU; Interactive Surfaces; Multi-touch Interaction; User Identification; Wrist-worn Devices,Authentication; Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Characteristic identification; Desirable features; Identification techniques; Identification technology; Interactive surfaces; Multi-touch interactions; User identification; Wrist-worn Devices; Surveys

We used guidelines derived from our study to design a tool, Metatation, which uses a pen-and-paper system with a peripheral display to utilize reader annotations as underspecified interactions to augment close reading.

BubbleView: An interface for crowdsourcing image importance maps and tracking visual attention,2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040313687&doi=10.1145%2f3131275&partnerID=40&md5=f3e6ad204e3d0d38e5f53ba987535af4,"In this article,we present BubbleView, an alternative methodology for eye tracking using discrete mouse clicks to measure which information people consciously choose to examine. BubbleView is a mouse-contingent, moving-window interface in which participants are presented with a series of blurred images and click to reveal ""bubbles"" - small, circular areas of the image at original resolution, similar to having a confined area of focus like the eye fovea. Across 10 experiments with 28 different parameter combinations, we evaluated BubbleView on a variety of image types: Information visualizations, natural images, static webpages, and graphic designs, and compared the clicks to eye fixations collected with eye-trackers in controlled lab settings. We found that BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information visualization or measuring image importance. BubbleView data is cleaner and more consistent than related methodologies that use continuous mouse movements. Our analyses validate the use of mouse-contingent, moving-window methodologies as approximating eye fixations for different image and task types. © 2017 ACM.",Crowdsourcing; Eye tracking; Graphic designs; Human vision; Image importance; Information visualizations; Mouse-contingent interface; Natural scenes; Saliency; Visual attention; Websites,Crowdsourcing; Design; Eye movements; Information analysis; Information systems; Mammals; Visualization; Websites; Eye-tracking; Graphic design; Human vision; Image importance; Information visualization; Natural scenes; Saliency; Visual Attention; Behavioral research
Computational support for functionality selection in interaction design,2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031710080&doi=10.1145%2f3131608&partnerID=40&md5=520a84c168ae7fbe3a5a8e41a0a651da,"Designing interactive technology entails several objectives, one of which is identifying and selecting appropriate functionality. Given candidate functionalities such as ""print,"" ""bookmark,"" and ""share,"" a designer has to choose which functionalities to include and which to leave out. Such choices critically affect the acceptability, productivity, usability, and experience of the design. However, designers may overlook reasonable designs because there is an exponential number of functionality sets and multiple factors to consider. This article is the first to formally define this problem and propose an algorithmic method to support designers to explore alternative functionality sets in early stage design. Based on interviews of professional designers, we mathematically define the task of identifying functionality sets that strike the best balance among four objectives: usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and profitability. We develop an integer linear programming solution that can efficiently solve very large instances (set size over 1,300) on a regular computer. Further, we build on techniques of robust optimization to search for diverse and surprising functionality designs. Empirical results from a controlled study and field deployment are encouraging. Most designers rated computationally created sets to be of the comparable or superior quality than their own. Designers reported gaining better understanding of available functionalities and the design space. © 2017 ACM.",Computer-supported design; Creativity; Design tools; Functionality selection; Integer linear programming; Interaction design; Optimization methods; User-centered design,Computer programming; Optimization; User centered design; Computer supported designs; Creativity; Design tool; Functionality selection; Integer Linear Programming; Interaction design; Optimization method; Integer programming

Two accounts are particularly vocal about these mechanisms, namely the technology acceptance model (TAM) and work on user experience (UX) models. In this study, we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human-computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human-computer interactions and about how these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear why the relations exist and under which conditions the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes.We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research. © 2017 ACM.",Technology acceptance; Usability; User experience,Ubiquitous computing; Explanatory variables; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Usability; User experience; User experiences (ux); Human computer interaction

These games for change have been shown to motivate behavior change, persuade people, and promote learning using various persuasive strategies. However, persuasive strategies that motivate one player may demotivate another. In this article, we show the importance of tailoring games for change in the context of a game designed to improve healthy eating habits.We tailored a custom-designed game by adapting only the persuasive strategies employed; the game mechanics themselves did not vary. Tailoring the game design to players' personality type improved the effectiveness of the games in promoting positive attitudes, intention to change behavior, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, we show that the benefits of tailoring the game intervention are not explained by the improved player experience, but directly by the choice of persuasive strategy employed.

This article investigates several factors that may influence whether use of an expert technique persists when the context of use changes. Two studies examine the effect of changing performance requirements, and find that a high performance requirement imposed in a training context can effectively push users to adopt an expert technique, and that use of the technique is maintained when the requirement is subsequently reduced or removed. In a final study, performance requirement, high-level task, and environment of use are changed-participants played a training game to learn the menu for a drawing application, which they then used to complete a series of drawings over the following week. Participants exhibited a somewhat surprising ""all-or-nothing"" effect, using the expert technique nearly exclusively or not at all, and maintaining this behavior over a range of qualitatively different tasks. This suggests that switching to an expert technique involves a global change by the user, rather than an incremental change as suggested by previous work. © 2017 ACM.",Expert interaction techniques; Novice to expert transitions; Training,Human computer interaction; Personnel training; All or nothings; Context of use; Global change; Incremental changes; Interaction techniques; Performance requirements; Ubiquitous computing

Implementing and prototyping such games present non-trivial technical challenges to interaction and game designers; this hampers iterative prototyping and testing cycles that are core to usercentred design and game development processes. This insight has motivated the development of RaPIDO (Rapid prototyping of Physical Interaction Design for Outdoor games), a prototyping platform for physical computing, targeting interaction designers with limited electronics or software skills. RaPIDO has been evaluated in a user test, evaluating RaPIDOs software library, and in a case study involving two designers who used it to develop outdoor games for children. We illustrate how RaPIDO enabled broader exploration of the design space and faster iterations than would otherwise be possible, allowing designers to focus on the core game concepts rather than complex and low-level engineering issues. © 2017 ACM.",Child-computer interaction; Iterative prototyping; Outdoor play,Computer games; Health; Rapid prototyping; Software design; Software testing; Child-computer interactions; Design and evaluations; Iterative prototyping; Outdoor play; Physical interactions; Prototyping platform; Social interactions; Technical challenges; Software prototyping

In this work, we focus on individual crowd worker competencies. By drawing from self-assessment theories in psychology, we show that crowd workers often lack awareness about their true level of competence. Due to this, although workers intend to maintain a high reputation, they tend to participate in tasks that are beyond their competence. We reveal the diversity of individual worker competencies, and make a case for competence-based pre-selection in crowdsourcing marketplaces. We show the implications of flawed self-assessments on real-world microtasks, and propose a novel worker pre-selection method that considers accuracy of worker self-assessments. We evaluated our method in a sentiment analysis task and observed an improvement in the accuracy by over 15%, when compared to traditional performance-based worker pre-selection. Similarly, our proposed method resulted in an improvement in accuracy of nearly 6% in an image validation task.

Such dynamic models are generative, estimating not only movement time, but also pointer position, velocity, and acceleration on a moment-to-moment basis. We describe an experimental framework for acquiring pointing actions and automatically fitting the parameters of mathematical models to the empirical data.We present the use of time-series, phase space, and Hooke plot visualisations of the experimental data, to gain insight into human pointing dynamics. We find that the identified control models can generate a range of dynamic behaviours that captures aspects of human pointing behaviour to varying degrees. Conditions with a low index of difficulty (ID) showed poorer fit because their unconstrained nature leads naturally to more behavioural variability. We report on characteristics of human surge behaviour (the initial, ballistic sub-movement) in pointing, as well as differences in a number of controller performance measures, including overshoot, settling time, peak time, and rise time. We describe trade-offs among the models. We conclude that control theory offers a promising complement to Fitts' law based approaches in HCI, with models providing representations and predictions of human pointing dynamics, which can improve our understanding of pointing and inform design. © 2017 ACM.",Aimed movements; Control theory; Dynamics; Fitts' law; Modelling; Pointing; Targeting,Behavioral research; Control theory; Economic and social effects; Human computer interaction; Phase space methods; Aimed movement; Empirical comparison; Fitts's law; Human users; Modeling; Pointing; Pointing dynamics; Second orders; Targeting; Theoretic model; Dynamics

This involves adorning them with decorative patterns that enhance their beauty while triggering digital interactions when scanned with cameras. These are realized using an existing augmented reality technique that embeds computer readable codes into the topological structures of hand-drawn patterns. We describe a research through design process that engaged artisans to craft a portfolio of interactive artefacts, including ceramic bowls, embroidered gift cards, fabric souvenirs, and an acoustic guitar. We annotate this portfolio with reflections on the crafting process, revealing how artisans addressed pattern, materials, form and function, and digital mappings throughout their craft process. Further reflection on our portfolio reveals how they bridged between human and system perceptions of visual patterns and engaged in a deep embedding of digital interactions into physical materials. Our findings demonstrate the potential for interactive decoration, distilling the craft knowledge involved in creating aesthetic and functional decoration, highlight the need for transparent computer vision technologies, and raise wider issues for HCI's growing engagement with craft. © 2017 ACM.",Ambiguity; Augmented reality; Computer vision; Craft; DIY; Embedded; Fabric; Hybrid-craft; Lifespan; Maker; Material; Obsolescence; Seamful design; Sustainability; Tangible; Tangible and embedded interfaces; Wood,Augmented reality; Fabrics; Interfaces (materials); Materials; Obsolescence; Sustainable development; Wood; Ambiguity; Craft; Embedded; Embedded interface; Hybrid crafts; Life span; Maker; Seamful designs; Tangible; Computer vision

These categories can be applied to both the physical and virtual space, and by looking at all permutations of these categories, we articulate four ways of coupling the spaces: comparative, actuated, derived, and projected coupling.

Children in the UK tend to prefer static positioning with minimal physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in Finland use a mixture of dynamic and static positioning with minimal physical contact and object movement. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding collaboration strategies and behaviours when designing and deploying interactive tabletops in heterogeneous educational environments.

We report on a contextual inquiry study in which we collected qualitative data from 18 participants in 12 households on the current potential and acceptance of home automation, as well as explored the respective benefits and drawbacks of these two notation paradigms for end users. Results show that rule-based notations are sufficient for simple automation tasks but not flexible enough for more complex use cases.

In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography-distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and ""the Big Sort"" (spatial homophily)-manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms. © 2017 ACM.",Geography residential segregation big sort mental maps distance decay population density location-aware computing; Mobile crowdsourcing; Sharing economy,Cognitive systems; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Distance decay; Homophily; Mental maps; Mobile crowdsourcing; Platform design; Population densities; Sharing economy; Socioeconomic status; Economics

The current classroom experiment compared a popular commercial game for equation solving, DragonBox and a research-based ITS, Lynnette with respect to desirable educational outcomes. The 190 participating 7th and 8th grade students were randomly assigned to work with either system for 5 class periods. We measured out-of-system transfer of learning with a paper and pencil pre- and posttest of students' equation-solving skill. We measured enjoyment and accuracy of self-assessment with a questionnaire. The students who used DragonBox solved many more problems and enjoyed the experience more, but the students who used Lynnette performed significantly better on the post-test. Our analysis of the design features of both systems suggests possible explanations and spurs ideas for how the strengths of the two systems might be combined. The study shows that intuitions about what works, educationally, can be fallible. Therefore, there is no substitute for rigorous empirical evaluation of educational technologies. © 2017 ACM.",Classroom experiment; Dragonbox 12+; Educational games; Enjoyment; Intelligent tutoring systems; Lynnette; Out-of-system transfer of learning,Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Teaching; Dragonbox 12; Educational game; Enjoyment; Intelligent tutoring system; Lynnette; Transfer of learning; Students

A challenge lies in devising a simple end-user development approach to support the specification of transformations, which can bridge the mismatch in the data being exchanged among IoT objects. To tackle this challenge, we present Visual Simple Transformations (ViSiT) as an approach that allows end-users to use a jigsaw puzzle metaphor for specifying transformations that are automatically converted into underlying executable workflows. ViSiT is explained by presenting meta-models and an architecture for implementing a system of connected IoT objects. A tool is provided for supporting end-users in visually developing and testing transformations. Another tool is also provided for allowing software developers to modify, if they wish, a transformation's underlying implementation. This work was evaluated from a technical perspective by developing transformations and measuring ViSiT's efficiency and scalability and by constructing an example application to show ViSiT's practicality.

Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users' needs in specific contexts of use. Thus, it represents a contribution to obtaining low threshold/high ceiling environments. We also report on an example application in the home automation domain, and a user study that has provided useful positive feedback. ©2017 ACM.",End-user development; internet of things; trigger-action programming,Internet of things; Specifications; Application developers; Commercial tools; Context dependent; End user development; Home automation; Personalizations; Programming experience; WEB application; Human computer interaction
Improv: An input framework for improvising cross-device interaction by demonstration,2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018476881&doi=10.1145%2f3057862&partnerID=40&md5=42983f6e0bb0f048755f934e26b3f7d2,"As computing devices become increasingly ubiquitous, it is now possible to combine the unique capabilities of different devices or Internet of Things to accomplish a task. However, there is currently a high technical barrier for creating cross-device interaction. This is especially challenging for end users who have limited technical expertise-end users would greatly benefit from custom cross-device interaction that best suits their needs. In this article, we present Improv, a cross-device input framework that allows a user to easily leverage the capability of additional devices to create new input methods for an existing, unmodified application, e.g., creating custom gestures on a smartphone to control a desktop presentation application. Instead of requiring developers to anticipate and program these cross-device behaviors in advance, Improv enables end users to improvise them on the fly by simple demonstration, for their particular needs and devices at hand. We showcase a range of scenarios where Improv is used to create a diverse set of useful cross-device input. Our study with 14 participants indicated that on average it took a participant 10 seconds to create a cross-device input technique. In addition, Improv achieved 93.7% accuracy in interpreting user demonstration of a target UI behavior by looking at the raw input events from a single example. © 2017 ACM.",Cross-device interaction; End-user programming; Gesture-based interaction; Input framework; Programming by demonstration,Computer programming; Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Cross-device interactions; End user programming; Gesture-based interaction; Input framework; Programming by demon-stration; Demonstrations

To some extent, the emerging technological infrastructures around them exemplify ways how digitalization will change production machines and lines, in general, in the Internet of Things (IoT). From an End-User Development perspective, the main question is how users can be supported in managing those complex digital production lines. To reach a better understanding, we carefully analyzed 3D printers as an example of highly digitalized production machines with regard to the creative activities of their users that help them to make these machines work for their practices. In our study of appropriation processes, we are concerned with situational and social aspects of the configuration and practice challenges associated with making digitalization work and how IoT technologies can support these collaborative appropriation activities of end users by making these machines more ""sociable."" We therefore conceptualize the idea of ""Sociable Technologies"" and implement a prototype that provides hardware-integrated affordances for communicating and documenting practices of usage.

In this article, we consider motion correlation as an alternative for selection. The principle is to represent available objects by motion in the interface, have users identify a target by mimicking its specific motion, and use the correlation between the system's output with the user's input to determine the selection. The resulting interaction has compelling properties, as users are guided by motion feedback, and only need to copy a presented motion. Motion correlation has been explored in earlier work but only recently begun to feature in holistic interface designs. We provide a first comprehensive review of the principle, and present an analysis of five previously published works, in which motion correlation underpinned the design of novel gaze and gesture interfaces for diverse application contexts. We derive guidelines for motion correlation algorithms, motion feedback, choice of modalities, overall design of motion correlation interfaces, and identify opportunities and challenges identified for future research and design. © 2017 ACM.",Eye tracking; Gaze interaction; Gesture interfaces; Interaction techniques; Motion correlation; Motion tracking; Natural user interfaces,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Eye-tracking; Gaze interaction; Gesture interfaces; Interaction techniques; Motion correlation; Motion tracking; Natural user interfaces; User interfaces

Little social and practical benefits have emerged so far. IoT devices, so-called smart objects, are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in ""composing"" their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution. © 2017 ACM.",Human-centered computings user studies; Information systems mashups; Software and its engineerings integrated and visual development environments; Visual languages,Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Controlled experiment; Interaction strategy; Internet of thing (IOT); Mashups; Technological aspects; Temporal and spatial constraints; User study; Visual development; Visual languages

In such scenarios, when compared to the real world, audio cues are often impoverished. As a result, users cannot rely on subtle spatial audio-visual cues that guide attention and enable effective social interactions in real-world situations. We explored whether gaze-contingent audio enhancement techniques driven by inferring audio-visual attention in virtual displays could be used to enable effective communication in cluttered audio VEs. In all of our experiments, we hypothesized that visual attention could be used as a tool to modulate the quality and intensity of sounds from multiple sources to efficiently and naturally select spatial sound sources. For this purpose, we built a gaze-contingent display (GCD) that allowed tracking of a user's gaze in real-time and modifying the volume of the speakers' voices contingent on the current region of overt attention. We compared six different techniques for sound modulation with a base condition providing no attentional modulation of sound. The techniques were compared in terms of source recognition and preference in a set of user studies. Overall, we observed that users liked the ability to control the sounds with their eyes. They felt that a rapid change in attenuation with attention but not the elimination of competing sounds (partial rather than absolute selection) was most natural. In conclusion, audio GCDs offer potential for simulating rich, natural social, and other interactions in VEs. They should be considered for improving both performance and fidelity in applications related to social behaviour scenarios or when the user needs to work with multiple audio sources of information. © 2017 ACM.",Gaze-contingent displays; Sound modulation; User experience; Visual-audio attention,Behavioral research; Modulation; Sensory perception; Social sciences; Virtual reality; Visual communication; Collaborative virtual environment; Effective communication; Gaze-contingent displays; Real world situations; Social interactions; User experience; Virtual reality simulations; Visual-audio attention; Audio acoustics

We describe four ways that players can engage with framing structures, which we classify in terms of whether players conform to explore, transgress, or (re)create them.

We introduce a simple context-range semantics (CRS) and a context-range editor (CoRE) that support end users formulate and understand logical expressions regarding context. The editor builds on two key ideas (a) contextual information is used to evaluate and minimize logical expressions; (b) logical expressions are presented in a disjunctive normal form (DNF) thus applying a principle established in mental model theory. User tests reveal situations in which the theory regarding the intuitiveness of the DNF needs to be extended with a new element: Logical terms are easier to comprehend and formulate when grouped according to their semantic affinity. We report two experiments that demonstrate the intuitiveness of this approach and how it improves performance of non-programmers in specifying context sensitive system behaviour. © 2017 ACM.,ambient intelligence; context awareness; End-user development; mental-models; natural programming,Ambient intelligence; Cognitive systems; Semantics; Context- awareness; Contextual information; Contextual reasoning; Disjunctive normal form; End user development; Logical expressions; Mental model; Natural Programming; Human computer interaction

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This opens up new ways of working together. We examined the data traces of collaborative writing behavior in student teams' use of Google Docs to discover how they are writing together now. We found that student teams write both synchronously and asynchronously, take fluid roles in the writing and editing of the documents, and show a variety of styles of collaborative writing, including writing from scratch, beginning with an outline, pasting in a related example as a template to organize their own writing, and three more. We also found that the document serves as a place where they share a number of things not included in the final document, including links or references to related materials, the assignment requirements from the instructor, and informal discussions to coordinate the collaboration or to structure the document. We computed a number of measures to depict a group's collaboration behavior and asked external graders to score these documents for quality.

"Sharing policies in multiuser privacy scenarios: Incorporating context, preferences, and arguments in decision making",2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016481114&doi=10.1145%2f3038920&partnerID=40&md5=94afb83bfac6bfb551cdd1045726ec27,"Social network services (SNSs) enable users to conveniently share personal information. Often, the information shared concerns other people, especially other members of the SNS. In such situations, two or more people can have conflicting privacy preferences; thus, an appropriate sharing policy may not be apparent. We identify such situations as multiuser privacy scenarios. Current approaches propose finding a sharing policy through preference aggregation. However, studies suggest that users feel more confident in their decisions regarding sharing when they know the reasons behind each other's preferences. The goals of this paper are (1) understanding how people decide the appropriate sharing policy in multiuser scenarios where arguments are employed, and (2) developing a computational model to predict an appropriate sharing policy for a given scenario. We report on a study that involved a survey of 988 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users about a variety of multiuser scenarios and the optimal sharing policy for each scenario. Our evaluation of the participants' responses reveals that contextual factors, user preferences, and arguments influence the optimal sharing policy in a multiuser scenario.We develop and evaluate an inference model that predicts the optimal sharing policy given the three types of features. We analyze the predictions of our inference model to uncover potential scenario types that lead to incorrect predictions, and to enhance our understanding of when multiuser scenarios are more or less prone to dispute. © 2017 ACM.",Argumentation; Crowdsourcing; Multiuser; Privacy; Social media,Behavioral research; Crowdsourcing; Data privacy; Decision making; Forecasting; Amazon mechanical turks; Argumentation; Multi-user; Personal information; Preference aggregations; Privacy preferences; Social media; Social network services; Social networking (online)
WaitSuite: Productive use of diverse waiting moments,2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016471092&doi=10.1145%2f3044534&partnerID=40&md5=ddb8c697ca50642b1c74efff67be7977,"The busyness of daily life makes it difficult to find time for informal learning. Yet, learning requires significant time and effort, with repeated exposures to educational content on a recurring basis. Despite the struggle to find time, there are numerous moments in a day that are typically wasted due to waiting, such as while waiting for the elevator to arrive, wifi to connect, or an instant message to arrive.We introduce the concept of wait-learning: automatically detecting wait time and inviting people to learn while waiting. Our approach is to design seamless interactions that augment existing wait time with productive opportunities. Combining wait time with productive work opens up a new class of software systems that overcome the problem of limited time. In this article, we establish a design space for wait-learning and explore this design space by creating WaitSuite, a suite of five different wait-learning apps that each uses a different kind of waiting. For one of these apps, we conducted a feasibility study to evaluate learning and to understand how exercises should be timed during waiting periods. Subsequently, we evaluated multiple kinds of wait-learning in a two-week field study of WaitSuite with 25 people. We present design implications for wait-learning, and a theoretical framework that describes how wait time, ease of accessing the learning task, and competing demands impact the effectiveness of wait-learning in different waiting scenarios. These findings provide insight into how wait-learning can be designed to minimize interruption to ongoing tasks and maximize engagement with learning. © 2017 ACM.",Attention management; Micro-learning; Microtasks; Productivity; Wait-learning,Human computer interaction; Productivity; Attention management; Design implications; Educational contents; Feasibility studies; Micro-learning; Microtasks; Theoretical framework; Wait-learning; Ubiquitous computing

All common mobile platforms and many desktop systems now support emoji entry, and users have embraced their use. Yet, we currently know very little about what makes for good emoji entry. While soft keyboards for text entry are well optimized, based on language and touch models, no such information exists to guide the design of emoji keyboards. In this article, we investigate of the problem of emoji entry, starting with a study of the current state of the emoji keyboard implementation in Android. To enable moving forward to novel emoji keyboard designs, we then explore a model for emoji similarity that is able to inform such designs. This semantic model is based on data from 21 million collected tweets containing emoji. We compare this model against a solely description-based model of emoji in a crowdsourced study. Our model shows good perfor mance in capturing detailed relationships between emoji. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Introducing mood self-tracking at work: Empirical insights from call centers,2017,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016454731&doi=10.1145%2f3014058&partnerID=40&md5=a198c651b79758d88116b03efc442fc9,"The benefits of self-tracking have been thoroughly investigated in private areas of life, like health or sustainable living, but less attention has been given to the impact and benefits of self-tracking in work-related settings. Through two field studies, we introduced and evaluated a mood self-tracking application in two call centers to investigate the role of mood self-tracking at work, as well as its impact on individuals and teams. Our studies indicate that mood self-tracking is accepted and can improve performance if the application is well integrated into the work processes and matches the management style. The results show that (i) capturing moods and explicitly relating them to work tasks facilitated reflection, (ii) mood self-tracking increased emotional awareness and this improved cohesion within teams, and (iii) proactive reactions by managers to trends and changes in team members' mood were key for acceptance of reflection and correlated with measured improvements in work performance. These findings help to better understand the role and potential of self-tracking at the workplace, and further provide insights that guide future researchers and practitioners to design and introduce these tools in a work setting. © 2017 ACM.",Call center; Field study; Mood self-tracking; Reflection; Work performance,Human computer interaction; Reflection; Ubiquitous computing; Call centers; Emotional awareness; Field studies; Improve performance; Management style; Self-tracking; Team members; Work performance; Human resource management

Although LDA models text documents as distributions over word topics, we model magazine covers as distributions over color-word topics. The results of our crowdsourcing experiments confirm that the model is able to successfully discover the associations between colors and linguistic concepts. Finally, we demonstrate several prototype applications that use the learned model to enable more meaningful interactions in color palette recommendation, design example retrieval, pattern recoloring, image retrieval, and image color selection. © 2017 ACM.",Aesthetics; Color palette recommendation; Color semantics; Design example retrieval; Generative models; Image color selection; Image retrieval; Interaction design; Pattern recoloring; Topic modeling; Visual design language; Visual design mining,Crowdsourcing; Data mining; Image retrieval; Modeling languages; Probability distributions; Semantics; Statistics; Visual languages; Aesthetics; Color palette; Generative model; Image color; Interaction design; Recoloring; Topic Modeling; Visual design; Visual design languages; Color

This line of research, however, predominately focuses on positive leisure experiences, and it is unclear whether need fulfillment plays a similar role in negative experiences or in other activity domains such as work. Therefore, this study investigates need fulfillment in positive and negative experiences, and in work and leisure experiences in two separate studies by analyzing almost 600 users' experiences with technology along with ratings on need fulfillment, affect, and perceived product quality. Results suggest that work and leisure experiences as well as positive and negative experiences differ in terms of need fulfillment. Hence, both activity domain and valence of experiences are important factors that should be taken in account when modeling user experience. © 2016 ACM.",Need fulfillment; Negative affect; Positive affect; User experience; Work and leisure,Human computer interaction; Need fulfillment; Negative affects; Positive affects; User experience; Work and leisure; Ubiquitous computing

We seek to understand how technologies are used and negotiated among family members and the influence of technology on commensality. We conducted an observational study of six families. The findings showed how technologies are integrated into the mealtime activities. Our study identifies domestic circumstances where background technologies are raised to the foreground, visible devices are hidden, unwanted distractions become desired, and ordinary technologies are integrated into mealtime experiences. We identify four patterns of arrangement between technologies and family members during mealtimes, and we discuss how technologies contribute to mealtime satiety and commensality. Finally, we present implications of our findings and directions for technological advancements focusing on the social and celebratory nature of family mealtimes. © 2016 ACM.",Commensality; Communication technologies; Eating; Family conversation; Food; Spatial arrangement; Tension around technologies in shared space,Food products; Human computer interaction; Commensality; Communication technologies; Eating; Family conversation; Shared spaces; Spatial arrangements; Ubiquitous computing

This article is focused around information access in such regions, aiming to build upon and extend the audio-based services that are already widely used in order to provide access to further types of media. In this article, then, we present an extended exploration of AudioCanvas-an interactive telephone-based audio information system that allows cameraphone users to interact directly with their own photos of physical media to receive narration or description.

Using mobile eye-trackers to unpack the perceptual benefits of a tangible user interface for collaborative learning,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006839765&doi=10.1145%2f3012009&partnerID=40&md5=d7587888e42353645946dbc1fb64d464,"In this study, we investigated the way users memorize, analyze, collaborate, and learn new concepts on a Tangible User Interface (TUI). Twenty-seven pairs of apprentices in logistics (N = 54) interacted with an interactive simulation of a warehouse. Their task was to discover efficient design principles for building storehouses. In a between-subjects experimental design, half of the participants used 3D physical shelves, whereas the other half used 2D paper shelves. This manipulation allowed us to control for the ""representational effect"" of 3D tangibles: the first group saw the warehouse as a small-scale model with realistic shelves, whereas the second group had access to a more abstract layout with rectangular pieces of paper. Both groups interacted with the system in the same way. We found that participants in the first group (i.e., who used 3D realistic shelves) better memorized a warehouse layout, built a more efficient model, and scored higher on a learning test. Additionally, students wore eye-tracking goggles while completing those tasks; preliminary results suggest that 3D interfaces increased joint visual attention, which was found to be a significant predictor for participants' task performance and learning gains.

This article investigates the use of an ad-hoc system for sending SOS signals in a large-scale exercise that simulated a terrorist attack. In this context, we found that the sensitivity that was introduced by the adversarial nature of the situation posed unexpected challenges for our approach, as giving away one's location in the immediate danger of a terrorist attack became an issue both for first responders and the affected people in the area. We show how practices of calling for help and reacting to help calls can be affected by such a system and affect the management of the visibility and validity of SOS calls, implying a need for further negotiation in situations where communication is sensitive and technically restrained. © 2016 ACM.",Emergency response; Mobile computing; SOS calls; Validity; Visibility,Mobile computing; Systems engineering; Visibility; Ad hoc systems; Communication technologies; Distress call; Emergency response; First responders; SOS calls; Terrorist attacks; Validity; Terrorism
Examining the role of smart TVs and VR HMDs in synchronous at-a-distance media consumption,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006968229&doi=10.1145%2f2983530&partnerID=40&md5=566a47b077945f075508272d1f2465cc,"This article examines synchronous at-a-distance media consumption from two perspectives: How it can be facilitated using existing consumer displays (through TVs combined with smartphones), and imminently available consumer displays (through virtual reality (VR) HMDs combined with RGBD sensing). First, we discuss results from an initial evaluation of a synchronous shared at-a-distance smart TV system, CastAway. Through week-long in-home deployments with five couples, we gain formative insights into the adoption and usage of at-a-distance media consumption and how couples communicated during said consumption. We then examine how the imminent availability and potential adoption of consumer VR HMDs could affect preferences toward how synchronous at-a-distance media consumption is conducted, in a laboratory study of 12 pairs, by enhancing media immersion and supporting embodied telepresence for communication. Finally, we discuss the implications these studies have for the near-future of consumer synchronous at-a-distance media consumption. When combined, these studies begin to explore a design space regarding the varying ways in which at-a-distance media consumption can be supported and experienced (through music, TV content, augmenting existing TV content for immersion, and immersive VR content), what factors might influence usage and adoption and the implications for supporting communication and telepresence during media consumption. © 2016 ACM.",,Virtual reality; Consumer displays; Design spaces; Immersive VR; Laboratory studies; Media consumption; Potential adoption; Smart-TV; Telepresence; Visual communication
Investigating expressive tactile interaction design in artistic graphical representations,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994521318&doi=10.1145%2f2957756&partnerID=40&md5=667c3108ecc7d9e9713ec3e9d334b1cd,"In this article, a design research approach is taken to investigate expressive design of tactile interactions. Most research efforts to date on designing and exploring the representational aspects of tactile interfaces have focused on usability and task-oriented scenarios. Yet, there is limited knowledge on how to aid the design of tactile interfaces that support the design of expressive or user-experience-oriented tactile interactions. We address this gap by studying tactile designs in a multisensory context, where the tactile interface augments works of visual art. The expressive and artistic context introduces new opportunities to extend on previous work, and identify new design and interaction potentials with tactile interfaces in graphical multisensory scenarios. During one-on-one guided design sessions, visual artists were asked to create tactile design prototypes that augmented one of their existing works. Each element of the overall tactile design, regarded as a tactile feature, was analyzed using both the bottom-up and top-down approaches. The results discovered through grounded theory are presented and discussed with respect to semiotic theory. Accordingly, tactile constructs and tactile intents define the ""form"" and ""meaning"" components of each tactile feature, respectively. Overall analysis of the findings indicates associations among the identified categories and between the two components, leading to design implications for expressive tactile interfaces. Insights from the tactile intents suggest a set of affordances for expressive visuotactile interactions, which we introduce under the notion of expressive roles. Additionally, implications from the tactile constructs indicate a design space for an expressive tactile augmentation design tool, based on which a user interface architecture is proposed. Findings from this research can assist in developing systems and tools for expressive tactile interface design and inspire research in user experience and behavior in multisensory tactile interaction scenarios. © 2016 ACM.",Affordances; Creativity support tools; Design tools; Expressive tactile interaction design; Interaction design; Research through design; Tactile interfaces; Visuotactile interaction,Arts computing; Behavioral research; Haptic interfaces; Semiotics; Affordances; Creativity support tools; Design tool; Interaction design; Tactile interaction; Visuotactile interaction; User interfaces

In addition, we present an empirical study of three UIs; in the study, participants completed a standard three-dimensional object manipulation task. We found that the post-WIMP UI condition led to enhancements of mental representation of UI and task. We conclude that the Norman model is a good theoretical framework to study post-WIMP UIs. In addition, by studying post-WIMP UIs in the context of the Norman model, we conclude that mental representation of task may be influenced by the interaction itself; this supposition is an extension of the original Norman model. © 2016 ACM.",Direct manipulation interaction; Post-WIMP interaction; Reality-based interaction,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Direct manipulation; Empirical studies; Mental representations; Post wimps; Reality-based interaction; Theoretical framework; Three-dimensional object; User-centered modeling; User interfaces

We explored this question with EarthShake: a mixed-reality game bridging physical and virtual worlds via depth-camera sensing, designed to help children learn basic physics principles. In this paper, we report on a controlled experiment with 67 children, 4-8 years old, that examines the effect of observing physical phenomena and collaboration (pairs vs. solo). A follow-up experiment with 92 children tests whether adding simple physical control, such as shaking a tablet, improves learning and enjoyment. Our results indicate that observing physical phenomena in the context of a mixed-reality game leads to significantly more learning and enjoyment compared to screen-only versions. However, there were no significant effects of adding simple physical control or having students play in pairs vs. alone.

Most HCI research on bereavement focuses on retaining these significant digital possessions to honor the departed. However, recent work suggests that significant digital possessions may complicate moving on; they function as both comforting and painful reminders but currently provide inflexible methods for disposal. A few works have investigated the disposal of digital objects as a means of letting go. To better understand this we interviewed 10 psychotherapists who employ rituals of letting go to help patients overcome loss in situations such as a divorce, a breakup, or a stillbirth. Patients disposed of either natural artifacts or symbolic personal possessions through actions such as burning, burying, or placing in a body of water. Therapists noted that people increasingly have digital possessions, and that the act of deletion does not offer the same cathartic sense of release as disposal of material artifacts. Based on the analysis of this grief therapy, we propose a new conceptual framework for rituals of letting go that highlights temporality, visibility, and force. It provides a vocabulary to talk about disposal. We then offer design implications connecting the rituals of letting go to the disposal of digital things. Based on our interviews and analytic framework, we propose novel technologies that better connect the embodied nature of letting go rituals to the process of digital disposal. © 2016 ACM.",Artifact disposal; Embodiment; Grief; Rituals of letting go,Human computer interaction; Conceptual frameworks; Design implications; Digital Objects; Embodiment; Grief; Hci researches; Rituals of letting go; Ubiquitous computing

An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments, specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies, we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity, whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science. In this field study, we show that employing our model increases the number of visitors engaging in interaction. © 2016 ACM.",First impressions; Interpersonal attitudes; Nonverbal behavior; Personality traits; Relational agents,Museums; Virtual reality; First impressions; Interpersonal attitudes; Nonverbal behavior; Personality traits; Relational agents; User interfaces
Increasing activity in enterprise online communities using content recommendation,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029384172&doi=10.1145%2f2910581&partnerID=40&md5=41e1013ece6c8b462c10dcfd8412af70,"Although online communities have become popular both on the web and within enterprises, many of them often experience low levels of activity and engagement from their members. Previous studies identified the important role of community leaders in maintaining the health and vitality of their communities. One of their key means for doing so is by contributing relevant content to the community. In this paper, we study the effects of recommending social media content on enterprise community leaders. We conducted a large-scale user survey with four recommendation rounds, in which community leaders indicated their willingness to share social media items with their communities. They also had the option to instantly share these items. Recommendations were generated based on seven types of community interest profiles that were member-based, content-based, or hybrid. Our results attest that providing content recommendations to leaders can help uplift activity within their communities. © 2016 ACM.",Engagement; Enterprise; Group recommendation; Online communities; Social business; Social recommender systems,Industry; Social networking (online); Engagement; Group recommendations; On-line communities; Social business; Social recommender systems; Online systems
Technology-mediated memory: Is technology altering our memories and interfering with well-being?,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042487126&doi=10.1145%2f2934667&partnerID=40&md5=8e8620b6e84a880df835adb8d2598e4f,"Technology increasingly allows us to capture and revisit rich digital records of our lives, processes which we call Technology-Mediated Memory (TMM). We explore whether TMM alters unmediated remembering and also whether such changes affect psychological well-being. Human memory biases promote well-being by adaptively editing our memories, making them more positive. In contrast, TMM often provides rich records of what people actually did and felt, which could disrupt adaptive edits. To explore this, we developed a smartphone-based personal TMM application, Echo, that allows participants to record and later reflect on everyday events. In a month-long deployment, 64 users made over 3200 recordings and reflections. We found that although Echo TMM alters how we remember, these changes remain adaptive. Instead of compromising adaptive biases, Echo TMM helps well-being and benefits are sustained long-term. Logfile analysis shows that participants use Echo strategically to prospectively edit by initially reporting events positively to anticipate future viewing. Participants also distance themselves from past negative events by reflecting more positively than at recording. We discuss design and theoretical implications. © 2016 ACM.",Memory; Recording; Reflection; Technology-mediated memory (TMM); Well-being,Data storage equipment; Human computer interaction; Reflection; Ubiquitous computing; Adaptive bias; Digital records; IS technologies; Log-file analysis; Negative events; Psychological well-being; Recording; Well being; Smartphones

The level of system autonomy plays a vital role in the development of smart systems as it profoundly affects how people and these systems interact with each other. However, to date, there are very few studies on human interaction with such systems. This paper presents findings from two field studies where two different prototypes for automating energy tariff-switching were developed and evaluated in the wild. Both prototypes offer flexible autonomy by which users can shift the system's level of autonomy among three options: suggestion-only, semi-autonomy, and full autonomy, whenever they like. Our findings based on thematic analysis show that flexible autonomy is a promising way to sustain users' engagement with smart systems, despite their occasional mistakes. The findings also suggest that users take responsibility for the undesired outcomes of automated actions when delegation of autonomy can be adjusted flexibly. © 2016 ACM.",Algorithms; Design; Field study; Flexible autonomy; H.5.2 [information interfaces and presentation]: user interfaces; Human Factors; Human-agent interaction; Interactive intelligent systems; Internet of things; Smart grid,Algorithms; Design; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; User interfaces; Field studies; Flexible autonomy; H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces; Human agent interactions; Interactive intelligent systems; Smart grid; Autonomous agents

Through iterative design, we explored practical designs that accommodate differences in users' community participation in three HIP prototypes: Text, Word Cloud, and Timeline. By comparing prototype usability with patients and design experts, we found that patients accurately used each prototype but completed some tasks faster with the Timeline HIP. Despite this advantage, patients preferred the Text HIP. Design experts and patients agreed that simple data overviews and granular details with salient cues that invite interactivity are key design considerations for HIPs. Findings offer key design considerations for HIPs that patients find most useful when forging critical connections. © 2016 ACM.",Health informatics; Heuristic evaluations; Information extraction; Interaction design; Online health communities; Social media; Usability testing; User profiles,Design; Information retrieval; Tellurium compounds; Health informatics; Heuristic evaluation; Interaction design; Online health communities; Social media; Usability testing; User profile; Health
Diminished control in crowdsourcing: An investigation of crowdworker multitasking behavior,2016,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978141616&doi=10.1145%2f2928269&partnerID=40&md5=22929c9d8265efb70d81d7b1582d3efb,"Obtaining high-quality data from crowds can be difficult if contributors do not give tasks sufficient attention. Attention checks are often used to mitigate this problem, but, because the roots of inattention are poorly understood, checks often compel attentive contributors to complete unnecessary work. We investigated a potential source of inattentiveness during crowdwork: multitasking. We found that workers switched to other tasks every 5 minutes, on average. There were indications that increasing switch frequency negatively affected performance. To address this, we tested an intervention that encouraged workers to stay focused on our task after multitasking was detected. We found that our intervention reduced the frequency of task switching. It also improves on existing attention checks because it does not place additional demands on workers who are already focused. Our approach shows that crowds can help to overcome some of the limitations of laboratory studies by affording access to naturalistic multitasking behavior. © 2016 ACM.",Crowdsourcing; Cuing; Data entry; Human performance; Interruptions; Methodology; Multitasking; Online experimentation; Transcription,Crowdsourcing; Data acquisition; Multitasking; Transcription; Cuing; Human performance; Interruptions; Methodology; Online experimentations; Behavioral research

Although such physical metaphors help both authors and audiences make sense of material, they also constrain authoring in ways that can negatively impact presentation delivery. In this article, we derive heuristics for the design of presentation media that are independent of any underlying physical metaphors. We use these heuristics to craft a new kind of presentation medium called SlideSpace - one that combines hierarchical outlines, content collections, and design rules to automate the real-time, outline-driven synthesis of hybrid Slide-Canvas visuals. Through a qualitative study of SlideSpace use, we validate our heuristics and demonstrate that such a hybrid presentation medium can combine the advantages of existing systems while mitigating their drawbacks. Overall, we show how a heuristic design approach helped us challenge entrenched physical metaphors to create a fundamentally digital presentation medium with the potential to transform the activities of authoring, delivering, and viewing presentations.",Canvas presentations; Design automation; Heuristic design; Slides,Human computer interaction; Ubiquitous computing; Canvas presentations; Design automations; Digital presentation; Heuristic designs; Oral presentations; Physical metaphor; Qualitative study; Slides; Computer aided design

This study presents and examines a new method for automatic pitch correction: Dynamic PitchWarping (DPW). The analytic formulation of thewarping function is derived. In the context of live playing of continuous pitch trajectories, the dynamics of pitch correction must be considered. Methods for triggering and releasing the correction are discussed, and a performance test is conducted. DPW is evaluated in the context of digital musical instruments that are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The results show significant improvement in note accuracy and precision with the addition of the correction method. Analyses of various types of modulations (including vibrato, portamento, and glissando) demonstrate that expressive pitch variations are preserved by the DPW correction. Perceptual tests show that the effects of DPW correction are well perceived and positively assessed by listeners. The proposed method allows for accurate pitch target acquisition together with preservation of expressive motion, a result that could be extended to other situations that require dynamic trajectory correction. © 2016 ACM.",Adaptive mapping; Digital musical instrument; Dynamic pitch correction; Expressive pointing; Gestural control of pitch; Target acquisition,Mergers and acquisitions; Musical instruments; Accuracy and precision; Correction method; Dynamic pitch; Dynamic trajectories; Gestural control; Perceptual test; Performance tests; Target acquisition; Tracking (position)

We present four experiments that test 3D perception. We varied projection geometry in three ways: type of projection (perspective/parallel), separation between the observer's point of view and the projection's center (discrepancy), and the presence of motion parallax (with/without parallax). Projection geometry had strong effects different for each task. Reducing discrepancy is desirable for orientation judgments, but not for object recognition or internal angle judgments. Using a fixed center of projection above the table reduces error and improves accuracy in most tasks. The results have far-reaching implications for the design of 3D views on tables, in particular, for multi-user applications where projections that appear correct for one person will not be perceived correctly by another. © 2016 ACM.",3D perception; 3D representation; 3D visualization; Center-of-projection; Fish-tank virtual reality; Interactive tabletops; Point-of-view; Projection,Geometrical optics; Geometry; Object recognition; Virtual reality; 3D perception; 3d representations; 3D Visualization; Center of projections; Fish tank virtual realities; Interactive tabletop; Point-of-view; Projection; Three dimensional computer graphics

In particular, the design of Safaricom's airtime scratch cards andmobile services does not support rural users' capabilities.

Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others' advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants' experience of guilt and envy when engaginginsocial decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans.

Key for this ""embeddedness"" is that interaction is contextualized within a meaningful setting, creating relationships between system and environment. While retaining a focus on original objects or environments, it supports user's active engagement and sense making by inviting, enticing, or forcing them to draw connections. At the heart of this is ""indexing"": mindful acts of referencing back-and-forth between here and there, connecting objects or representations. Analysis of case studies provides a repertoire of examples of ""indexing,"" and examples for high- and low-tech installation designs that foster drawing of connections. Two core values for design underpin the argument: (1) primacy of real objects and environments and (2) supporting human agency. The case examples highlight how technological arrangements may support or hinder indexing activity. This is condensed into potential design strategies. This article contributes to design knowledge on design for human agency, sense making, and mindful engagement with our environment.

A secondary interactive layer is used to evaluate three different conditions that varied in the presentation (sequential versus simultaneous) and spatialisation (non-spatialised versus egocentric/exocentric spatialisation) of multiple auditory sources. Our findings show that (1) participants spent significantly more time interacting with spatialised displays; (2) using the same design for primary and interactive secondary display (simultaneous exocentric) showed a negative impact on the user experience, an increase in workload and substantially increased participant movement; and (3) the other spatial interactive secondary display designs (simultaneous egocentric, sequential egocentric, and sequential exocentric) showed an increase in time spent stationary but no negative impact on the user experience, suggesting a more exploratory experience. A follow-up qualitative and quantitative analysis of user behaviour support these conclusions.

Motivated by this challenge, accessibility and HCI researchers have called for voice-based communities to support aging and disability. This paper extends prior work on voice community design and short-term use by providing empirical data on how people interact with voice communities over time and intentional instances of non-use. We conducted a one-year study with 43 blind and low vision older adults, of whom 21 used a voice-based community. We use vignettes to unpack five different voice community member roles - the obligatory poster, routine poster, cross-platform lurker, busy socialite, and visual expertise seeker - and discuss community interactions over time. Findings show how participation varied based on engagement in other communities and ways that participants sought interaction. We discuss (1) how to design voice communities for member roles and (2) the implications of synchronous and asynchronous voice community interaction in voice-only communities.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In two empirical studies (n1 = 30 & n2 = 96), we investigate authorship and ownership in human-AI collaboration for personalized language generation. We show an AI Ghostwriter Effect: Users do not consider themselves the owners and authors of AI-generated text but refrain from publicly declaring AI authorship. Personalization of AI-generated texts did not impact the AI Ghostwriter Effect, and higher levels of participants' influence on texts increased their sense of ownership. Participants were more likely to attribute ownership to supposedly human ghostwriters than AI ghostwriters, resulting in a higher ownership-authorship discrepancy for human ghostwriters. Rationalizations for authorship in AI ghostwriters and human ghostwriters were similar.

Like any technology, participatory budgeting platforms are not value-free or politically neutral; their design, configuration, and deployment display assumptions and configure participant behaviour. To understand what kinds of configurations occur and what kinds of democratic values they hold, we studied 31 digital participatory budgeting cases in Spain, France, and Finland. These cases were all supported by the same technical platform, Decidim, allowing us to focus on the variations in their configurations. We examined the data from these cases and identified 25 different technical configurations and 15 participatory budgeting configurations. The configurations observed in our cases exhibit individual and community-centred assumptions about expected state-society interactions, as well as open vs managerial approaches to participatory budgeting. Based on these findings, we highlight a dilemma for civic technology designers: to what degree should platforms be open to configuration and customisation, and which political values should be enforced by platform design? © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesParticipatory budgeting; Decidim; digital platforms; participatory budgeting configuration; technical configurations,Additional key word and phrasesparticipatory budgeting; Customisation; Decidim; Design configurations; Digital platforms; Finland; Key words; Participatory budgeting configuration; Platform design; Technical configuration; Budget control

Few prior studies explore the lived experiences of non-engagers, because reaching this population is inherently difficult. We present an observational inquiry into the barriers to sign-up and early use of a DMHI, along with reasons for initial interest in the DMHI. We collected 205 online questionnaire responses and 20 interviews from self-referring participants across four healthcare ecosystems in the UK and US. Questionnaire results revealed that uncertainty about DMHI usefulness and usability were the main barriers to uptake, whereas forgetting about it, not finding time for it and not finding it useful were the main barriers to early engagement. Participants reported multiple reasons for considering the DMHI, reflecting the contextual, subjective nature of mental health. Our thematic analysis generated themes around (1) the need for human connection, (2) the impact of self-stigma on help-seeking, (3) the lack of knowledge around DMHIs and psychological therapy, (4) the desire for personally relevant care, and (5) the fluctuating, perennial nature of mental health.

Yet, a prerequisite for these interactions is being able to view the environment. Despite the existence of numerous scene-viewing techniques (i.e., interaction techniques that facilitate the visual perception of virtual scenes), there is no guidance to help designers choose which techniques to implement. We propose a scene taxonomy based on the visual structure and task within a VE by drawing on literature from cognitive psychology and computer vision, as well as virtual reality (VR) applications. We demonstrate how the taxonomy can be used by applying it to an accessibility problem, namely limited head mobility. We used the taxonomy to classify existing scene-viewing techniques and generate three new techniques that do not require head movement. In our evaluation of the techniques with 16 participants, we discovered that participants identified tradeoffs in design considerations such as accessibility, realism, and spatial awareness, that would influence whether they would use the new techniques. Our results demonstrate the potential of the scene taxonomy to help designers reason about the relationships between VR interactions, tasks, and environments.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",accessibility; Additional Key Words and PhrasesVirtual reality; scene-viewing technique; situational impairment; taxonomy; virtual environment; virtual scene,Virtual reality; Accessibility; Additional key word and phrasesvirtual reality; Interaction techniques; Key words; Physical environments; Scene-viewing technique; Situational impairment; Virtual scenes; Visual perception; Visual structure; Taxonomies

Covert behaviors, such as trolling, are especially challenging to detect automatically, because they utilize deceptive strategies to manipulate conversation. We illustrate a novel approach to their detection: analyzing conversational structures instead of focusing only on messages in isolation. Building on conversation analysis, we demonstrate that (1) conversational actions and their norms provide concepts for a deeper understanding of covert disruption, and that (2) machine learning, natural language processing and structural analysis of conversation can complement message-level features to create models that surpass earlier approaches to trolling detection. Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies' message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively).

We first explore visual noise and scenarios in which visual noise arises based on findings from four workshops we conducted. We then introduce the concept of visual noise cancellation (VNC) and how it can be used to reduce identified effects of visual noise. In addition, we developed head-worn demonstration prototypes to practically explore the concept of active VNC with selected scenarios in a user study.

In this article, we explore an additional contributor to workers' limited temporal flexibility: the design of crowdsourcing platforms, namely requiring crowdworkers to be 'on call' for work. We conducted two studies to investigate the impact of having to be 'on call' on workers' schedule control and job control. We find that being 'on call' impacted (1) participants' ability to schedule their time and stick to planned work hours, and (2) the pace at which participants worked and took breaks. The results of the two studies suggest that the 'on-demand' nature of crowdsourcing platforms can limit workers' temporal flexibility by reducing schedule control and job control.

RadarHand: A Wrist-Worn Radar for On-Skin Touch-Based Proprioceptive Gestures,2024,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184842915&doi=10.1145%2f3617365&partnerID=40&md5=e7794e0d7c5381fd9eb6ac1f44fda0da,"We introduce RadarHand, a wrist-worn wearable with millimetre wave radar that detects on-skin touch-based proprioceptive hand gestures. Radars are robust, private, small, penetrate materials, and require low computation costs. We first evaluated the proprioceptive and tactile perception nature of the back of the hand and found that tapping on the thumb is the least proprioceptive error of all the finger joints, followed by the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky finger in the eyes-free and high cognitive load situation. Next, we trained deep-learning models for gesture classification. We introduce two types of gestures based on the locations of the back of the hand: generic gestures and discrete gestures. Discrete gestures are gestures that start at specific locations and end at specific locations at the back of the hand, in contrast to generic gestures, which can start anywhere and end anywhere on the back of the hand. Out of 27 gesture group possibilities, we achieved 92% accuracy for a set of seven gestures and 93% accuracy for the set of eight discrete gestures. Finally, we evaluated RadarHand's performance in real-time under two interaction modes: Active interaction and Reactive interaction. Active interaction is where the user initiates input to achieve the desired output, and reactive interaction is where the device initiates interaction and requires the user to react. We obtained an accuracy of 87% and 74% for active generic and discrete gestures, respectively, as well as 91% and 81.7% for reactive generic and discrete gestures, respectively.

However, how researchers operationalize such a theory as a design remains largely unclear. One way to clarify this methodological step is to clearly state which functional elements of a design are aimed at operationalizing a specific behavior change theory construct to evaluate if such aims were successful. In this article, we investigate how the operationalization of functional elements of theories and designs can be more easily conveyed. First, we present a scoping review of the literature to determine the state of operationalizations of SCT as behavior change designs. Second, we introduce a new tool to facilitate the operationalization process. We term the tool blueprints. A blueprint explicates essential functional elements of a behavior change theory by describing it in relation to necessary and sufficient building blocks incorporated in a design. We describe the process of developing a blueprint for SCT. Last, we illustrate how the blueprint can be used during the design refinement and reflection process. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesBehavior change theory; behavior change design; intermediate-level knowledge; methods; multidisciplinary research; operationalization; scoping review; social comparison theory,Behavioral research; Computation theory; Human computer interaction; Additional key word and phrasesbehavior change theory; Behavior change design; Behaviour changes; Change theory; Intermediate-level knowledge; Key words; Method; Multi-disciplinary research; Operationalization; Scoping review; Social comparison theory; Blueprints

We interviewed thirteen professionals who use digital fabrication for the low-volume manufacturing of commercial products. From these interviews, we describe the workflows used for nine products created with a variety of materials and manufacturing methods. We show how digital fabrication professionals use software development to support physical production, how they rely on multiple partial representations in development, how they develop manufacturing processes, and how machine control is its own design space. We build from these findings to argue that future digital fabrication systems should support the exploration of material and machine behavior alongside geometry, that simulation is insufficient for understanding the design space, and that material constraints and resource management are meaningful design dimensions to support. By observing how professionals learn, we suggest ways digital fabrication systems can scaffold the mastery of new fabrication techniques.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesDigital fabrication; CAD/CAM; digital craft; digital design; low-volume production; product design,Computer aided design; Product design; Scaffolds; Software design; Additional key word and phrasesdigital fabrication; Cad/cams; Design spaces; Digital craft; Digital designs; Digital fabrication; Fabrication systems; Key words; Low-volume production; Work-flows; Fabrication
“It’s Weird That it Knows What I Want”: Usability and Interactions with Copilot for Novice Programmers,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173838298&doi=10.1145%2f3617367&partnerID=40&md5=7b7e7e60f56ea79c1d1b56ff69d925d7,"Recent developments in deep learning have resulted in code-generation models that produce source code from natural language and code-based prompts with high accuracy. This is likely to have profound effects in the classroom, where novices learning to code can now use free tools to automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments. However, little is currently known about how novices interact with these tools in practice. We present the first study that observes students at the introductory level using one such code auto-generating tool, Github Copilot, on a typical introductory programming (CS1) assignment. Through observations and interviews we explore student perceptions of the benefits and pitfalls of this technology for learning, present new observed interaction patterns, and discuss cognitive and metacognitive difficulties faced by students. We consider design implications of these findings, specifically in terms of how tools like Copilot can better support and scaffold the novice programming experience. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Holistic approaches to supporting workers, which consider both productivity and well-being, are increasingly important. Taking this holistic approach, we designed an intervention inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy that consists of: (1) using the term “Time Well Spent” (TWS) in place of “productivity”, (2) a mobile self-logging tool for logging activities, feelings, and thoughts at work, and (3) a visualization that guides users to reflect on their data. We ran a 4-week exploratory qualitative comparison in the field with 24 graduate students to examine our Therapy-inspired intervention alongside a classic Baseline intervention. Participants who used our intervention often shifted toward a holistic perspective of their primary working hours, which included an increased consideration of breaks and emotions. No such change was seen by those who used the Baseline intervention. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",burnout; cognitive-behavioral therapy; Knowledge worker; productivity; stress; time well spent; well-being; work intervention,Data visualization; Knowledge management; Burnout; Cognitive-behavioral therapies; Field evaluation; Holistic approach; Knowledge workers; Time well spend; Well being; Work intervention; Work life; Workers'; Students

This study rigorously developed dimensions and associated scales of the DVA user experience. We employed a mixed-method approach that integrated qualitative and quantitative methods. This study first developed multilevel dimensions of DVA user experience based on consumers’ online reviews (n = 21,314), then adopted the ten-step method to develop the associate measurement scale with reliability and validity by collecting and examining three data sets (pretest: n = 368, refinement and validation: n = 585, cross-validation: n = 567). This study fills the gap of a lack of research on the classification and measurement of DVA user experience and provides a reference for practitioners in developing DVA and continuously improving the DVA user experience. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

After identifying CQA practices and design opportunities through formative interviews, we designed and implemented CoAIcoder, a tool leveraging AI to enhance human-to-human collaboration within CQA through four distinct collaboration methods. With a between-subject design, we evaluated CoAIcoder with 32 pairs of CQA-trained participants across common CQA phases under each collaboration method. Our findings suggest that while using a shared AI model as a mediator among coders could improve CQA efficiency and foster agreement more quickly in the early coding stage, it might affect the final code diversity. We also emphasize the need to consider the independence level when using AI to assist human-to-human collaboration in various CQA scenarios. Lastly, we suggest design implications for future AI-assisted CQA systems. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A Design Vocabulary for Data Physicalization,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180415484&doi=10.1145%2f3617366&partnerID=40&md5=7f1202a33290bf9541fb53861df9b8cb,"Although physical artifacts that represent data have been used for centuries, the research field—known as data physicalization—has only recently gained traction. Compared to data visualization, there is no established vocabulary for analyzing and discussing the properties of physicalizations. Through a grounded analysis of examples and literature, we propose a comprehensive design vocabulary, which consist of three separate, but connected parts: explicit variables, implicit properties, and consequential aspects. Explicit variables build on visual variables known from visualization and extend it to account for physicalization’s multi-modal nature. Implicit properties concern elements which are central to the design intention and user experience of physicalizations, yet are not a result of “explicit” encoding strategies. Finally, consequential aspects refer to unintentional effects of design decisions, that influence how a physicalization is experienced. Our work illustrates how physicalizations incorporate opportunities and challenges that are not afforded in other data representations, such as embodiment and imagined touch. With this, we contribute to generating theory on physicalization. Our design vocabulary can support (1) creators through informing their design processes and highlighting design strategies, (2) educators, and (3) academics and practitioners to analyse existing physicalizations, and reflect on the impact of design decisions on interpretation and experience. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",data narrative; design language; embodiment; InfoVis; material turn; materiality; user experience; Visualization,Data visualization; Design; Data narrative; Design decisions; Design languages; Embodiment; Infovi; Material turn; Materiality; Physical artifacts; Property; Users' experiences; Visualization

We explored the potential of three different nudge types (color highlighting, social cue, timer) and default settings to interrupt this auto-response in an experimental between-subject design with 167 participants. We did not find statistically significant differences regarding the buttons clicked. Our results showed that opt-in default settings significantly decrease tracking technology use acceptance rates.

We assessed the clinical feasibility of the Mood Monitor by comparing clinical, usage, and acceptance metrics obtained from the 35 patients with a smartwatch with those from an additional 34 patients without a smartwatch (digital treatment as usual). Findings showed that the smartwatch app was highly accepted by patients, revealed which factors facilitated and impeded this acceptance, and supported clinical feasibility.

How Gaze Visualization Facilitates Initiation of Informal Communication in 3D Virtual Spaces,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180365588&doi=10.1145%2f3617368&partnerID=40&md5=3de97f85659f066d5c2433bb5829ec67,"This study explores how gaze visualization in virtual spaces facilitates the initiation of informal communication. Three styles of gaze cue visualization (arrow, bubbles, and miniature avatar) with two types of gaze behavior (one-sided gaze and joint gaze) were evaluated. 96 participants used either a non-visualized gaze cue or one of the three visualized gaze cues. The results showed that all visualized gaze cues facilitated the initiation of informal communication more effectively than the non-visualized gaze cue. For one-sided gaze, overall, bubbles had more positive effects on the gaze receiver’s behaviors and experiences than the other two visualized gaze cues, although the only statistically significant difference was in the verbal reaction rates. For joint gaze, all three visualized gaze cues had positive effects on the receiver’s behaviors and experiences.

We embody these features into a prototype system, Paper Plain. We evaluate Paper Plain, finding that participants who used the prototype system had an easier time reading research papers without a loss in paper comprehension compared to those who used a typical PDF reader. Altogether, the study results suggest that guiding readers to relevant passages and providing plain language summaries alongside the original paper content can make reading medical papers easier and give readers more confidence to approach these papers. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Augmented reading; healthcare consumers; plain language summaries,Health care; Natural language processing systems; Augmented reading; Healthcare consumer; Language processing; Medical papers; Medical research papers; Natural languages; Plain language summary; Prototype system; Research papers; Paper

Overall, 73% of participants were affected by at least one breach, but participants were unaware of 74% of breaches affecting them. Although some reported intention to take action, most participants believed the breach would not impact them. We also found a sizable intention-behavior gap. Participants did not follow through with their intention when they were apathetic about breaches, considered potential costs, forgot, or felt resigned about taking action.

Toward Understanding the Design of Intertwined Human-Computer Integrations,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167958390&doi=10.1145%2f3590766&partnerID=40&md5=c1ffa8c13772b686160698bbb9f6da5c,"Human-computer integration is an HCI trend in which computational machines can have agency, i.e., take control. Our work focuses on a particular form of integration in which the user and the computational machine share agency over the user's body, that is, can simultaneously (in contrast to a traditional turn-taking approach) control the user's body. The result is a user experience where the agency of the user and the computational machine is so intertwined that it is often no more discernable who contributed what to what extent; we call this ""intertwined integration"". Due to the recency of advanced technologies enabling intertwined integration systems, we find that little understanding and documented design knowledge exist. To begin constructing such an understanding, we use three case studies to propose two key dimensions (""awareness of machine's agency""and ""alignment of machine's agency"") to articulate a design space for intertwined integration systems. We differentiate four roles that computational machines can assume in this design space (angel, butler, influencer, and adversary). Based on our craft knowledge gained through designing such intertwined integration systems, we discuss strategies to help designers create future systems. Ultimately, we aim at advancing the HCI field's emerging understanding of sharing agency.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In a creative collaboration, interaction dynamics, such as turn-taking, contribution type, and communication, are the driving forces of the co-creative process. Therefore the interaction model is a critical and essential component for effective co-creative systems. There is relatively little research about interaction design in the co-creativity field, which is reflected in a lack of focus on interaction design in many existing co-creative systems. The primary focus of co-creativity research has been on the abilities of the AI. This article focuses on the importance of interaction design in co-creative systems with the development of the Co-Creative Framework for Interaction design (COFI) that describes the broad scope of possibilities for interaction design in co-creative systems. Researchers can use COFI for modeling interaction in co-creative systems by exploring alternatives in this design space of interaction. COFI can also be beneficial while investigating and interpreting the interaction design of existing co-creative systems. We coded a dataset of existing 92 co-creative systems using COFI and analyzed the data to show how COFI provides a basis to categorize the interaction models of existing co-creative systems. We identify opportunities to shift the focus of interaction models in co-creativity to enable more communication between the user and AI leading to human-AI partnerships.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",co-creativity; framework; Human-AI co-creativity; interaction design,Co-creativity; Creative products; Creative systems; Creatives; Framework; Human-AI co-creativity; Interaction design; Interaction dynamics; Interaction modeling; Model interaction

We conduct an extensive study that combines elicitation of prior expectations before writing, observation and semi-structured interviews during writing, and outcome evaluations after writing. Our results illustrate the individual and situational variation in machine-in-the-loop writing approaches, suggestion acceptance, and ways the system is helpful.

The potential of this paradigm is demonstrated through three prototypes: Inter-Dream, a system that integrates with the brain's autonomic physiological processes to drive users toward healthy sleep states; Neo-Noumena, a system that integrates with the user's affective neurophysiology to augment the interpersonal communication of emotion; and PsiNet, a system that integrates interpersonal brain activity to amplify human connection.

Predictive machine learning models, based on routinely collected EHR data, offer potential for early warning of hypotension to enable proactive clinical intervention. However, while research has demonstrated the feasibility of such machine learning models, little effort is made to ground their formulation and development in socio-technical context of perioperative care work. To address this, we present a study of collaborative work practices of clinical teams during and after surgery with specific emphasis on the organisation of hypotension management. The findings highlight where predictive insights could be usefully deployed to reconfigure care and facilitate more proactive management of hypotension. We further explore how the socio-technical insights help define key parameters of machine learning prediction tasks to align with the demands of collaborative clinical practice. We discuss more general implications for the design of predictive machine learning in hospital care.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Three experimental conditions were tested: in-person collaboration, remote collaboration, and single user. We hypothesized that collaboration focuses users' attention on key information facilitating decision-making. Collaborating participants dwelt longer on key elements of the simulation than single users. Moreover, in-person collaboration and single users yielded a strategy of decision-making similar to an optimal strategy. Finally, in-person collaboration was less cognitively demanding and of higher quality. The contribution of this article is a deeper understanding of how in-person collaboration on a large display can help users focus their visual attention on the most important areas. With this novel understanding, we believe collaborative systems designers will be better equipped to design more effective attention-guiding mechanisms in remote collaboration systems.

"""What's Your Name Again?"": How Race and Gender Dynamics Impact Codesign Processes and Output",2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176792938&doi=10.1145%2f3603624&partnerID=40&md5=d369b70d720c579a9ab6cee8c036e27c,"Creating technology products using codesign techniques often results in higher end-user engagement compared to expert-driven designs. Codesign sessions are typically structured in flexible and informal ways to achieve equal design partnerships, especially in adult-child interactions. This generally leads to better design output, however, it may also increase the enactment of socially constructed stereotypes and biases in ways that negatively affect the experiences of racial minorities and girls/women in design spaces. We codesigned a video game with a K-5 afterschool program located in a working-class, rural, predominantly white county over 20 weeks. We uncover ways that the codesign process and different activity types can create a permissive environment for enacting behaviors that are harmful to minorities. We discuss ways to manage and restructure codesign programs to be more conducive for children and adults from diverse backgrounds, ultimately leading to healthier design partnerships.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Using Feedforward to Reveal Interaction Possibilities in Virtual Reality,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176783146&doi=10.1145%2f3603623&partnerID=40&md5=cbc7fdcf1028fb845db5583d9e2d26cb,"In virtual reality (VR), interactions may fail when users encounter new, unknown, or unexpected objects. We propose using feedforward in VR to help users interact with objects by revealing how such objects work. Feedforward lets users know what to do and how to do it by showing the available actions and outcomes before an interaction. In this article, we first chart the design space of feedforward in VR and illustrate how to design feedforward for specific VR interactions. We discuss starting the feedforward, previewing actions and outcomes, and returning the virtual world to its state before the feedforward. Second, we implement three real-world VR applications to show how feedforward can be applied to multistep interactions, perceived interactivity, and discoverability. Third, we conduct an evaluation of the design space with 14 VR experts to understand its usefulness. Finally, we summarize the findings of our work on VR feedforward in 15 guidelines.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",feedforward; Virtual reality,User interfaces; Design spaces; Feed forward; Interactivity; Multisteps; Real-world; Virtual reality interactions; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality

Through an online user experiment with 48 participants, we find that, compared with two baselines, the two kinds of Learning Engagement can lead to users' more accurate mental models of the robot's learning progress, more positive perceptions of the robot, and better teaching experience.

Within HCI, sustainable HCI and human-food-interaction have developed as a response. We argue, nevertheless, that food practices as a social activity remain relatively under-examined, and further that sustainable food practices hinge on communal activity. We present the results of action-oriented research with a grassroots movement committed to sustainable food practices at a local, communal level, thereby demonstrating the role of ICT in making food resource sharing a viable practice. We suggest that the current focus on food sharing might usefully be supplemented by attention to food resource sharing, an approach that aligns with a paradigm shift from surplus to abundance. We argue for a design that aims to encourage food resource sharing at a local level but that also has wider ramifications. These ""glocal""endeavors recognize the complexity of prosumption practices and foster aspirations for ""deep change""in food systems.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",abundance; grassroots; HFI; sharing economy; surplus; Sustainability; sustainable HCI,Human engineering; Abundance; Food resources; Grassroot; HFI; Human food interactions; Resources sharing; Sharing economy; Social activities; Surplus; Sustainable HCI; Sustainable development

Content moderation relies on offender-centered, punitive approaches, e.g., bans and content removal. We consider an alternative justice framework, restorative justice, which aids victims in healing, supports offenders in repairing the harm, and engages community members in addressing the harm collectively. To assess the utility of restorative justice in addressing online harm, we interviewed 23 users from Overwatch gaming communities, including moderators, victims, and offenders; such communities are particularly susceptible to harm, with nearly three quarters of all online game players suffering from some form of online abuse. We study how the communities currently handle harm cases through the lens of restorative justice and examine their attitudes toward implementing restorative justice processes. Our analysis reveals that cultural, technical, and resource-related obstacles hinder implementation of restorative justice within the existing punitive framework despite online community needs and existing structures to support it. We discuss how current content moderation systems can embed restorative justice goals and practices and overcome these challenges.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",alternative justice; Content moderation; Discord; online harassment; Overwatch,Online systems; Alternative justice; Community IS; Content moderation; Discord; On-line games; On-line gaming; Online harassment; Overwatch; Restorative justice; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)

The results show that the use of traditional form autocompletion tools significantly diminishes users' deliberate privacy decision-making, while the proposed tools can mitigate these adverse effects, such that users (1) disclose significantly less information and (2) are more likely to assess the alignment between the type of the data requested and the goal of the entity requesting that data (i.e., context specificity).

Attending to this gap, this article reports a qualitative study examining how people account for continuing to use services that conflict with their stated privacy preferences, and how trust features in these accounts. Our findings undermine the notion that individuals engage in strategic thinking about privacy, raising important questions regarding the explanatory power of the well-known privacy calculus model and its proposed relationship between privacy and trust. Finding evidence of hopeful trust in participants' accounts, we argue that trust allows people to morally account for their ""paradoxical""information disclosure behavior. We propose that effecting greater alignment between people's privacy attitudes and privacy behavior - or ""un-paradoxing privacy""- will require greater regulatory assurances of privacy.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

During reading, Marvista helps the user reflect on their understanding of each paragraph with AI-generated questions. After reading, Marvista generates an explainable human-AI summary that combines AI's processing of the text, the user's reading behavior, and user-generated data in the reading process. In contrast to prior work that offered (content-independent) interaction techniques or devices for reading, Marvista takes a human-AI collaborative approach that contributes text-specific guidance (content-aware) to support the entire reading process.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We find that metaphors people use are contextually fluid, can change with the mode of conversation, and can reveal differences in how people perceive VUIs compared to other devices. Not all metaphors are helpful, and some may be offensive. Analyzing this broader class of metaphors can help understand, perhaps even predict problems.

To address this gap, we conducted qualitative interviews with 21 patients clinically diagnosed with abnormal blood pressure (BP) living in low-resourced communities of Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh in India. We found that patients' trust in the BP ecosystem and social ties plays a significant role in shaping their perceptions of technology and chronic care. Trust in one actor of the ecosystem fosters trust in another, e.g., trust in BP reading depended on the type of device and the person measuring the BP. We also observed nuanced sharing and intermediation of BP devices.

Based on a systematic review of the cumulative evidence on BOIs from 111 research articles published in 2010 to 2021, this article summarizes the findings of empirical studies of BOIs. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review points to diverse experimental practices for inducing and measuring body ownership. The two major components of embodiment measurement, body ownership and agency, are examined. The embodiment of virtual avatars generally leads to modest body ownership and slightly higher agency. We also find that BOI research lacks statistical power and standardization across tasks, measurement instruments, and analysis approaches. Furthermore, the reviewed studies showed a lack of clarity in fundamental terminology, constructs, and theoretical underpinnings. These issues restrict scientific advances on the major components of BOIs, and together impede scientific rigor and theory-building.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, many factors can impact success of Human-AI teams, including a user's domain expertise, mental models of an AI system, trust in recommendations, and more. This article reports on a study that examines users' interactions with three simulated algorithmic models, all with equivalent accuracy rates but each tuned differently in terms of true positive and true negative rates. Our study examined user performance in a non-trivial blood vessel labeling task where participants indicated whether a given blood vessel was flowing or stalled. Users completed 140 trials across multiple stages, first without an AI and then with recommendations from an AI-Assistant. Although all users had prior experience with the task, their levels of proficiency varied widely.Our results demonstrated that while recommendations from an AI-Assistant can aid in users' decision making, several underlying factors, including user base expertise and complementary human-AI tuning, significantly impact the overall team performance. First, users' base performance matters, particularly in comparison to the performance level of the AI. Novice users improved, but not to the accuracy level of the AI. Highly proficient users were generally able to discern when they should follow the AI recommendation and typically maintained or improved their performance. Mid-performers, who had a similar level of accuracy to the AI, were most variable in terms of whether the AI recommendations helped or hurt their performance. Second, tuning an AI algorithm to complement users' strengths and weaknesses also significantly impacted users' performance. For example, users in our study were better at detecting flowing blood vessels, so when the AI was tuned to reduce false negatives (at the expense of increasing false positives), users were able to reject those recommendations more easily and improve in accuracy. Finally, users' perception of the AI's performance relative to their own performance had an impact on whether users' accuracy improved when given recommendations from the AI. Overall, this work reveals important insights on the complex interplay of factors influencing Human-AI collaboration and provides recommendations on how to design and tune AI algorithms to complement users in decision-making tasks. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We report an ""in the wild""study of a hybrid chocolate gift deployed as a commercial product. Interviews reveal the experiences of receivers and givers, as well as the producer's friction points and tangible benefits. We reveal how in hybrid gifts the digital elevates the physical while the physical grounds the digital. We discuss how hybrid gifts bridge the tension between receiver-preference and relationship-signalling motivations, the need to further strengthen the exchange and reveal stages of hybrid gifting, and to manage the privacy of sensitive personal messages.

A noticeable factor is the spatial enclosure that defines where users meet. This involves a mutual object of interest, contents that the users may generate around the object, and the proximity between users. This study examines these factors, namely how object interactivity, user-generated contents (UGC) and avatar proximity influence engagement. We designed a Hybrid Virtual and Augmented Reality (HVAR) environment that supports paired users to experience cultural heritage in both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). A user study was conducted with 60 participants, providing assessments of engagement and presence via questionnaires, together with mobile electroencephalogram (mEEG) and user activity data that measures VR user engagement in real-time. Our findings provide insights into how engagement between users can occur in HVAR environments for the future hybrid reality with multi-device connectivity.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Technological interventions, such as mobile and wearable health systems, can support data collection and reflection about health status. However, little is known about how ADHD children interpret such data. We conducted a deployment study with 10 children, aged 10 to 15, for six weeks, during which they used a smartwatch in their homes. Results from observations and interviews during this study indicate that children with ADHD can interpret their own health data, particularly at the moment. However, as ADHD children develop more autonomy, smartwatch systems may require alternatives for data reflection that are interpretable and actionable for them.

However, the effects of the conversational design of CSCs remain understudied, and there is a need to investigate and enhance users' interactions with CSCs. In this article, we conducted a two-stage exploratory study using a human-centered design methodology. We first conducted a qualitative interview study to identify key user needs in engaging with CSCs. We then performed an experimental study to investigate potential CSC conversational design solutions based on the results from the interview study. We identified that emotional support, explanations of medical information, and efficiency were important factors for users in their interactions with CSCs. We also demonstrated that emotional support and explanations could affect user perceptions and experiences, and they are context-dependent.

The central studies of the extent, content, and impact of such frustration were done more than 15 years ago. We revisit this issue after computers have become more mature and computer use is more extensive. To this end, we had 234 crowdsourced participants log the frustrating episodes they experienced with their computers during one hour of computer use. The average time lost due to frustrating episodes was between 11% and 20% of the one-hour period. Though this is less time lost than in the earlier studies, frustration remains a common user experience. While shorter, the median level of frustration during the episodes was high (7 on a 9-point scale). The frustration level correlated with task importance and time lost but was unaffected by computer experience and largely unaffected by computer self-efficacy. In addition, participants indicated that 84% of the episodes had happened before, that 87% could happen again, and that they were unable to resolve 26% of the episodes. This high rate of recurrence and lack of control likely added to the frustration level.

To sense such gestures, minimal instrumentation of the user's hand is desirable. However, the choice of an effective but minimal IMU layout remains challenging, due to the complexity of the multi-factorial space that comprises diverse finger gestures, objects, and grasps. We present SparseIMU, a rapid method for selecting minimal inertial sensor-based layouts for effective gesture recognition. Furthermore, we contribute a computational tool to guide designers with optimal sensor placement. Our approach builds on an extensive microgestures dataset that we collected with a dense network of 17 inertial measurement units (IMUs).

Simulating Interaction Movements via Model Predictive Control,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160822786&doi=10.1145%2f3577016&partnerID=40&md5=0b20134c2a5ccb50af84339922c33303,"We present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to simulate movement in interaction with computers, focusing on mid-air pointing as an example. Starting from understanding interaction from an Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) perspective, we assume that users aim at minimizing an internalized cost function, subject to the constraints imposed by the human body and the interactive system. Unlike previous approaches used in HCI, MPC can compute optimal controls for nonlinear systems. This allows to use state-of-the-art biomechanical models and handle nonlinearities that occur in almost any interactive system. Instead of torque actuation, our model employs second-order muscles acting directly at the joints. We compare three different cost functions and evaluate the simulation against user movements in a pointing study. Our results show that the combination of distance, control, and joint acceleration cost matches individual users' movements best, and predicts movements with an accuracy that is within the between-user variance. To aid HCI researchers and designers in applying our approach for different users, interaction techniques, or tasks, we make our SimMPC framework, including CFAT, a tool to identify maximum voluntary torques in joint-actuated models, publicly available, and give step-by-step instructions.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",AR/VR environments; biomechanics; interaction techniques; maximum voluntary torques; mid-air pointing; model predictive control; optimal feedback control; Simulation,Biomechanics; Cost functions; Feedback control; Predictive control systems; Torque; AR/VR environment; Cost-function; Interaction techniques; Interactive system; Maximum voluntary torque; Mid-air pointing; Model-predictive control; Optimal feedback control; Simulation; User movement; Model predictive control
Transitioning Cognitive Aids into Decision Support Platforms: Requirements and Design Guidelines,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164302853&doi=10.1145%2f3582431&partnerID=40&md5=fb6e9ca9eb97643f1ae16cc48a8d25dd,"Digital cognitive aids have the potential to serve as clinical decision support platforms, triggering alerts about process delays and recommending interventions. In this mixed-methods study, we examined how a digital checklist for pediatric trauma resuscitation could trigger decision support alerts and recommendations. We identified two criteria that cognitive aids must satisfy to support these alerts: (1) context information must be entered in a timely, accurate, and standardized manner, and (2) task status must be accurately documented. Using co-design sessions and near-live simulations, we created two checklist features to satisfy these criteria: a form for entering the pre-hospital information and a progress slider for documenting the progression of a multi-step task. We evaluated these two features in the wild, contributing guidelines for designing these features on cognitive aids to support alerts and recommendations in time- and safety-critical scenarios.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Intercorporeal Biofeedback for Movement Learning,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164303147&doi=10.1145%2f3582428&partnerID=40&md5=e68081d9642b89f1439fa5fa12cf4987,"Technology-supported movement learning has received increased attention in HCI. Previous design research has mostly focused on individual experiences, even though the social and situated context is essential to movement learning practices. Based on the experiences from two design projects in the fitness domain featuring open-ended biofeedback artefacts, we propose Intercorporeal Biofeedback as a strong concept to support the design and use of biofeedback in such practices. We ground the concept in situated movement learning theory, phenomenology of social cognition, and HCI work on biofeedback. We articulate four key characteristics of intercorporeal biofeedback: it provides participants with a shared frame of reference, upon which they engage in fluid meaning allocation and use it to guide attention and action, becoming an interactional resource. Intercorporeal biofeedback can serve to guide future design work for situated, social movement practices.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

While excellent attention to detail has many advantages, some contexts require the rapid integration of global and local information. A local processing style can be so strong that local details interfere with the fluid integration of global information required for processing of information rapidly displayed on user interfaces. This disconnect between context of an interaction and processing style can be termed local interference. Personalization of visual stimuli can promote a more accessible computing experience. We describe how technological interventions can support shifting of visual attention from local to global features to make them more accessible. We present two empirical studies. One study with one autistic adult revealed a significant shift in eye gaze fixation, and the other study with 20 autistic children revealed filters that visually emphasize primary aspects encouraged more global comments about the image content.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",accessibility; assistive technology; Autism; global local processing; local interference; Neurodiversity; sensory processing; slow global order processing; visual filters,Assistive technology; Image processing; User interfaces; Accessibility; Assistive technology; Autism; Global local processing; Global ordering; Global-local; Local interference; Local processing; Neurodiversity; Order processing; Sensory processing; Slow global order processing; Visual filter; Behavioral research

However, evaluating website aesthetics through user ratings is resource intensive, and extant models to predict website aesthetics are limited in performance and ability. We contribute a novel and more precise approach to predict website aesthetics that considers rating distributions. Moreover, we use this approach as a baseline model to illustrate how future research might be conducted using predictions instead of participants. Our approach is based on a deep convolutional neural network model and uses innovations in the field of image aesthetic prediction. It was trained with the dataset from Reinecke and Gajos [2014] and was validated using two independent large datasets. The final model reached an unprecedented cross-validated correlation between the ground truth and predicted rating of LCC = 0.752.

This research investigated user characteristics associated with interdependent privacy perceptions, by asking social media users to rate photo-based memes depicting strangers on the degree to which they were too private to share. Users also completed questionnaires measuring social media usage and personality. Separate groups rated the memes on shareability, valence, and entertainment value. Users were less likely to share memes that were rated as private, except when the meme was entertaining or when users exhibited dark triad characteristics. Users with dark triad characteristics demonstrated a heightened awareness of interdependent privacy and increased sharing of others' photos. A model is introduced that highlights user types and characteristics that correspond to different privacy preferences: privacy preservers, ignorers, and violators. We discuss how interventions to support interdependent privacy must effectively influence diverse users.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cluster analysis; dark triad; interdependent privacy; memes; sharing decisions; social media,Behavioral research; Social networking (online); User profile; Dark triad; Interdependent privacy; Media usage; Meme; Privacy preferences; Privacy violation; Sharing decision; Social media; User characteristics; User type; Cluster analysis

We surveyed students (N = 69) to learn about their sensemaking goals, use of the tool to accomplish those goals, and perceptions of specific features. We interviewed students (N = 12) and TAs (N = 2) to assess the tool's impact on students' review processes and course instruction. Students discovered valuable feedback, assessed project quality, and justified design decisions to teammates by exploring specific icon patterns in the visualization. The interviews revealed that students mimicked strategies implemented in the tool when reviewing new feedback without the tool.

We then conducted an open-ended survey with 788 undergraduate students and follow-up interviews with students and clinical psychologists to understand how people perceived these messages and the factors they anticipated would drive their engagement. We leveraged those insights to revise our messages, after which we deployed our messages via a technology probe to 11 students for two weeks.

These technologies are rapidly being integrated into children's everyday lives, but their functions and implications are rarely understood due to their complex and distributed nature. The review provides a rigorous overview of the state of the art based on 107 records published across the fields of human-computer interaction, learning sciences, computing education, and child-computer interaction between 2010 and 2020. The findings show the urgent need on a global scale for inter- and transdisciplinary research that can integrate these dispersed contributions into a more coherent field of research and practice. The article presents nine discussion points for developing a shared agenda to mature the field. Based on the HCI community's expertise in human-centred approaches to technology and aspects of learning, we argue that the community is ideally positioned to take a leading role in the realisation of this future research agenda.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",computational literacy; computing education; emerging technologies; K-12 education,Artificial intelligence; Arts computing; Augmented reality; Engineering education; Internet of things; Virtual reality; Computational literacy; Computing education; Emerging technologies; K-12 education; Learning science; Learning settings; Machine-learning; Research agenda; State of the art; Systematic mapping; Human computer interaction

I find that #ActuallyAutistic Twitter discourses align with the neurodiversity paradigm, while dominant autism discourses in the academy align with the medical model of disability. Though both orientations towards autism research sometimes share research priorities, they represent fundamentally irreconcilable approaches to these priorities and autism, more broadly. I explore how autistics on Twitter interact with non-autistic researchers and how the tenor of these interactions varies according to which research paradigm a particular researcher subscribes. I conclude with a discussion of how HCI researchers interested in autism can operationalize these findings by approaching their work through the framework of crip technoscience.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In one project, Reimaging Work, we used a participatory game to engage stakeholders from social and economic justice organizations in Chicago. The other project, Future Design Studio, invited audience members at a futurist festival to create artifacts from the future and then invited improvisational actors to build worlds around them. We argue that a focus on counterfactual actions supports a more relational approach to understanding the politics of socio-technical systems and infrastructures, allowing participants to gain a meaningful understanding of the ways in which technology could be designed otherwise in line with ethics, values and social justice concerns.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",counterfactual artifacts; futures; Histories; prototyping; public engagement; speculative design,Chicago; Counterfactual artifact; Counterfactuals; Critical design; Future; Future designs; Politics of technology; Prototyping; Public engagement; Speculative design

While many in HCI and design have examined the impulse to solve problems-the solutionist or techno-solutionist mindset-we examine the logic that binds the solution and the problem together as a pair. Focusing on the timely and consequential problem of systemic racial injustice, we think through the paradoxical possibility that the pairing of the problem and solution (so often treated as the default in design and HCI) perpetuates the very conditions we seek to improve. With Calvin Warren's profound Afro-pessimism, we recognize how the tools used to solve structural inequities around Black life are constructed with inequities themselves. The problem-solution, therefore, is a dead end. We use this paradox as an invitation to rethink ongoing efforts to seek equity and justice more broadly, setting out a fragile but hopeful path for HCI and design.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",design problems; Solutionism; solutions; theory,Condition; Dead-ends; Design problems; End-points; Ontology's; Problem solutions; Problems and Solutions; Setting outs; Solutionism; Theory; Computation theory

Work in this area typically treats trustworthy AI as a problem of Human-Computer Interaction involving the individual user and an AI system. However, we argue here that this overlooks the important part played by organisational accountability in how people reason about and trust AI in socio-technical settings. To illustrate the importance of organisational accountability, we present findings from ethnographic studies of breast cancer screening and cancer treatment planning in multidisciplinary team meetings to show how participants made themselves accountable both to each other and to the organisations of which they are members. We use these findings to enrich existing understandings of the requirements for trustworthy AI and to outline some candidate solutions to the problems of making AI accountable both to individual users and organisationally. We conclude by outlining the implications of this for future work on the development of trustworthy AI, including ways in which our proposed solutions may be re-used in different application settings.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",accounts; collaboration; ethnography; explainable AI; organisational accountability; Trustworthy AI; xAI,Health care; Human computer interaction; Account; AI systems; Collaboration; Ethnography; Explainable AI; Health care application; Organisational; Organizational accountability; Trustworthy AI; XAI; Diseases

We conducted semi-structured interviews with General Practitioners uncovering their views and attitudes toward text automation. The main emerging theme was doctor-AI collaboration, addressing a reciprocal clinician-technology relationship that does not threaten to substitute clinicians, but rather establishes a constructive synergistic relationship. Other themes included: (i) desired features for clinical text automation; (ii) concerns around clinical text automation; and (iii) the consultation of the future.

Through critical reflection on a range of issues associated with post-colonialism and post-development, I examine the possibilities that various historical tropes might offer to the reinvention of the African perspective on innovation. This leads to the consideration of how engaging in critical discussions about the future dimensions of African HCI can allow for grappling with the effect of the coloniality of being, power, and knowledge. Developing on the ideas of futuring as a way of dealing with the complexities of the present - in this case, the coloniality of the imagination - the article ends by discussing three tactical propositions for ""remembering""future identities of African innovation where the values of autonomy are known and acted upon.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power - a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the ""conceptual glue""that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to ""normative""ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance.

Historians have identified patterns common to such periods including: The unity of accusation and action; condemnation as a show of virtue, and defense of the accused as collusion with enemies. These patterns are mapped to findings from social media research such as: Impulsive shares are easy to make but difficult to retract; angry posts travel fastest and furthest; likes and retweets express group identity and solidarity.

A Model of Contextual Factors Affecting Older Adults' Information-Sharing Decisions in the U.S.,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152590618&doi=10.1145%2f3557888&partnerID=40&md5=6514e6b74241d4553d6738193054dbbb,"The sharing of information between older adults and their friends, families, caregivers, and doctors promotes a collaborative approach to managing their emotional, mental, and physical well-being and health, prolonging independent living, and improving care quality and quality of life in general. However, information flow in collaborative systems is complex, not always transparent to elderly users, and may raise privacy and security concerns. Because older adults' decisions about whether to engage in information exchange affect interpersonal communications and delivery of care, it is important to understand the factors and context that influence those decisions. Our work contributes empirical evidence and suggests a systematic approach. In this article, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with 46 older adults aged 65+ about their views on information collection, transmission, and sharing. We develop a detailed model of the contextual factors that combine in complex ways to affect older adults' decision making about information sharing. We discuss how our comprehensive model compares to existing frameworks for analyzing information-sharing expectations and preferences. Finally, we suggest directions for future research and describe the practical implications of our model for the design and evaluation of collaborative information-sharing systems, as well as for policy and consumer protection.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Additional Key Words and PhrasesInformation sharing; contextual integrity; data flows; interviews,Consumer protection; Data flow analysis; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Additional key word and phrasesinformation sharing; Collaborative approach; Contextual factors; Contextual integrities; Dataflow; Information sharing; Interview; Key words; Older adults; Well being; Decision making
Uncovering Personal Histories: A Technology-Mediated Approach to Eliciting Reflection on Identity Transitions,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164298012&doi=10.1145%2f3504004&partnerID=40&md5=95ff146af03f9f988568e86127c14f18,"When studying identity transitions, interview participants can find it difficult to reflect on their transitions and recall specific details related to past experiences. We present a new approach to enable participant reflection on past identity transitions, and a means to fill in blanks by eliciting data that may not otherwise come up: showing participants sentiment visualizations of their social media data. After detailing our methods of constructing sentiment visualizations, we discuss our experiences using them in a study on gender transition. For most participants, the visualizations elicited substantial reflection, and enabled recalling forgotten data and new interpretations of transition experiences. We guide researchers on how to use this method when studying other identity transitions; this may be especially powerful for marginalized people who undergo substantial identity changes. This article proposes a way to uncover participants' personal histories, which can help HCI researchers to better understand and support marginalized people's experiences.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To advance recommender systems research beyond the traditional approach that ranks recommended products in descending, it is crucial to understand the cognitive processes that online consumers experience when they evaluate products in a sequence. Drawing on evaluability theory and the order effects perspective, we formulate a scenario in which two products are presented sequentially and each product has two attributes, one of which can be evaluated independently while the other is difficult to evaluate without comparison. Analyses show that in two out of the three cases examined, presenting the most recommended product in the second place will result in stronger consumer purchase intentions and willingness to pay. Research hypotheses are proposed based on the results of the scenario analyses and are empirically tested through three laboratory experiments. In Study 1, evidence for the hypothesized order effects is found for the settings with randomly assigned product recommendations. In Study 2, the same effects are observed for the settings with personalized recommendations generated by a collaborative filtering algorithm. In Study 3, it is shown that such order effects also exist in terms of the recommendation strength of recommender systems. These findings provide novel insights into the behavioral implications of using recommender systems in e-commerce, shedding light on additional means of improving the design of such systems.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",evaluability theory; laboratory experiments; Order effects; product rating; recommender systems,Cognitive systems; Collaborative filtering; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Purchasing; Evaluability theory; Laboratory experiments; Online products; Ordering effects; Performance; Product ratings; Product recommender system; Recommendation algorithms; Systems research; Traditional approaches; Recommender systems

However, it remains challenging to incorporate such tools into pathologists' practice; one main concern is AI's insufficient workflow integration with medical decisions. We observed pathologists' examination and discovered that the main hindering factor to integrate AI is its incompatibility with pathologists' workflow. To bridge the gap between pathologists and AI, we developed a human-AI collaborative diagnosis tool - xPath - that shares a similar examination process to that of pathologists, which can improve AI's integration into their routine examination. The viability of xPath is confirmed by a technical evaluation and work sessions with 12 medical professionals in pathology. This work identifies and addresses the challenge of incorporating AI models into pathology, which can offer first-hand knowledge about how HCI researchers can work with medical professionals side-by-side to bring technological advances to medical tasks towards practical applications.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",digital pathology; Human-AI collaboration; medical AI; meningioma,Diagnosis; Human engineering; Integration; Assisting tools; Design and evaluations; Diagnose system; Digital pathologies; Human-AI collaboration; Medical AI; Medical decision making; Medical professionals; Meningiomas; Workflow integration; Pathology

We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI.

Using a combination of ethnographic methods and discourse analysis, we identify the rhetorical strategies in these books and why they were successful in shaping our participants' ideas about web design. We find that the books exhibit a particular style of technical writing defined by a speech-like techno-masculinity. Despite their short shelf-lives, the books and their writing style contributed to the disciplinary identity of web design which exists today.

CDIS review patient charts in near real-time to improve clinicians' documentation, with the goal to make medical documentation more accurate, consistent and complete. CDIS collaborate with an AI-embedded ""Computer Assisted Coding""(CAC) system that scans records from the Electronic Healthcare Record and auto-suggests codes based on natural language processing. CDIS find the CAC's suggestions are often inaccurate - often humorously so. Still, they find the CAC to be a useful helper, like Robin is to Batman. This human-AI collaboration is contingent on several factors: the flexible integration of the AI into the workflow similar to the notion of unremarkable AI; supporting the CDIS' sensemaking; the CDIS' knowledge about the CAC being predictably unreliable, an experience by the CDIS of the AI's value; humans remaining in control; and ability to experiment with the AI, which spurs reflection and learning for these knowledge workers.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We conduct two experiments to demonstrate that reliance on a predictive algorithm following a substantial error is affected by (i) when the error occurs and (ii) how the algorithm is used in the decision-making process. We find that the impact of an error on reliance depends on whether the error occurs early (i.e., when users first start using the algorithm) or late (i.e., after users have used the algorithm for an extended period). While an early error results in substantial and persistent reliance reduction, a late error affects reliance only temporarily and to a lesser extent. However, when users have more control over how to use the algorithm's predictions, error timing ceases to have a significant impact. Our work advances the understanding of algorithm aversion and informs the practical design of algorithmic decision-making systems.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Algorithmic reliance; decision support; laboratory experiment; prediction error; timing of error,Decision making; Decision support systems; Human engineering; Timing circuits; % reductions; Algorithmic reliance; Algorithmics; Decision supports; Decision-making process; Laboratory experiments; Prediction errors; Predictive algorithms; Substantial errors; Timing of error; Errors

In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers' imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers' imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project's engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of ""assistance""systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of 'acceptance' as a frame for user-centered design.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",assistance systems; Embedded ethics; engineering practices; healthcare robotics; imaginaries,Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Engineers; Ethical technology; Health care; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Machine design; User centered design; Assistance system; Case-studies; Embedded ethic; Engineering practices; Engineering program; Ethical aspects; Healthcare robotics; Imaginaries; Shape designs; User engagement; Social aspects

Across the nearly 200-year history of domestic photography, this social reminiscence has been accomplished largely through photo albums. However, in the now common digital setting, albums are pushed aside for the endless film roll metaphor. In this article, we explore this metaphor through the 20-year history of proposed digital picture interactions from Human-Computer Interaction research, and compare this to ongoing interactions with modern picture tools. Through these, we reveal that this prominent design metaphor does not create space for social reminiscence, but does fit the novel use of immediate sharing seen across social networking. Furthermore, the endless and ever-growing nature of digital film rolls are not meaningfully browsable for either intended use.

Furthermore, end-users' ability to validate a system's performance often disappears following the introduction of AI decision-making. We present the MAP model to understand and describe the three stages through which medical observations are interpreted and handled by AI systems. These stages are Measurement, in which information is gathered and converted into data points that can be stored and processed; Algorithm, in which computational processes transform the collected data; and Presentation, where information is returned to the user for interpretation. For each stage, we highlight possible challenges that need to be overcome to develop Human-Centred AI systems. We illuminate our MAP model through complementary case studies on colonoscopy practice and dementia diagnosis, providing examples of the challenges encountered in real-world settings.

The S-BAN is a new handheld haptic interface that utilizes a parallel kinematic structure to deliver 2-DOF spatial information over a continuous workspace, with a form factor suited to integration with other travel aids. The ability to pivot, extend and retract its body opens possibilities and questions around spatial data representation. We present a static study to understand user perception of absolute pose and relative motion for two spatial mappings, showing the highest sensitivity to relative motions in the cardinal directions. We then present an embodied navigation experiment in virtual reality (VR). User motion efficiency when guided by the S-BAN was statistically equivalent to using a vision-based tool (a smartphone proxy). Although haptic trials were slower than visual trials, participants' heads were more elevated with the S-BAN, allowing greater visual focus on the environment.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesHaptics; navigation; shape-changing interfaces,Navigation; Virtual reality; Additional key word and phraseshaptic; Handhelds; Haptics interfaces; Key words; Kinematic structures; Parallel kinematics; Pedestrian navigation; Relative motion; Shape-changing interface; Spatial informations; Haptic interfaces

However, the potential to combine innovative HCI designs with the theoretical grounding and state-of-the-art interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised. In this article, we synthesise HCI work on emotion regulation interventions and propose a three-part framework to guide technology designers in making: (i) theory-informed decisions about intervention targets; (ii) strategic decisions regarding the technology-enabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the system; and (iii) practical decisions around previous implementations of the selected intervention components. We show how this framework can both systematise HCI work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Emotion regulation; mental health; review; technology-enabled intervention,Computation theory; Emotion Recognition; Human computer interaction; Emotion regulations; Human-computer-interaction designs; Informed decision; Interaction theory; Mental health; Mental illness; State of the art; Strategic decisions; Technology-enabled intervention; User emotions; Diseases

To investigate the opportunities of using a different programming paradigm than the imperative approach to learning embedded coding, we developed Flowboard. Students code in a visual iPad editor using flow-based programming, which is conceptually closer to circuit diagrams than imperative code. Two breadboards with I/O pins mirrored on the iPad connect electronics and program graph more seamlessly than existing IDEs. Program changes take effect immediately. This liveness reflects circuit behavior better than edit-compile-run loops. A first study confirmed that students can solve basic embedded programming tasks with Flowboard while highlighting important differences to a typical imperative IDE, Ardublock.

Despite the prevalence of AI analysis tools, there is no general theory describing how people make sense of what their models have learned. We frame this process as a form of sensemaking and derive a framework describing how data scientists develop mental models of AI behavior. To evaluate the framework, we show how existing AI analysis tools fit into this sensemaking process and use it to design AIFinnity, a system for analyzing image-and-text models. Lastly, we explored how data scientists use a tool developed with the framework through a think-aloud study with 10 data scientists tasked with using AIFinnity to pick an image captioning model. We found that AIFinnity's sensemaking workflow reflected participants' mental processes and enabled them to discover and validate diverse AI behaviors.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We present a study into the design space of an abbreviated style of text input called C-PAK (Correcting and completing variable-length Prefix-based Abbreviated Keystrokes) for text entry on mobile devices. Given a variable length and potentially inaccurate input string (e.g., ""li g t m""), C-PAK aims to expand it into a complete phrase (e.g., ""looks good to me""). We develop a C-PAK prototype keyboard, PhraseWriter, based on a current state-of-the-art mobile keyboard consisting of 1.3 million n-grams and 164,000 words. Using computational simulations on a large dataset of realistic input text, we found that, in comparison to conventional single-word suggestions, PhraseWriter improves the maximum keystroke savings rate by 6.7% (from 46.3% to 49.4,), reduces the word error rate by 14.7%, and is particularly advantageous for common phrases. We conducted a lab study of novice user behavior and performance which found that users could quickly utilize the C-PAK style abbreviations implemented in PhraseWriter, achieving a higher keystroke savings rate than forward suggestions (25% vs. 16%). Furthermore, they intuitively and successfully abbreviated more with common phrases. However, users had a lower overall text entry rate due to their limited experience with the system (28.5 words per minute vs. 37.7).

Postgraduate research (PGR) students are at risk of experiencing mental health concerns and this, with the often isolated and competitive nature of their work, can impact their sense of community and social connectedness. In response to these concerns, we designed Pears, a system to connect PGR students for regular ""pearings""(in-person meetings) and provide activities to promote reflection and conversation. A four-week evaluation of Pears with 15 students highlighted its potential to sometimes, but not always, facilitate peer support. Some participants would instead meet formally and according to their needs, others instead used the system to make new social connections. Additionally, some participants who faced work-related difficulties during the study found using the system contributed to their stress levels. We conclude by noting how technologies that encourage peer support can help build social relationships, providing an avenue to share similar PhD experiences and guidance for those new to the experience, while importantly raising awareness and an understanding for the need to take time for self-care. However, these technologies must be utilised carefully, and are not a replacement for other sources of student support in universities.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Creative and Progressive Interior Color Design with Eye-tracked User Preference,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152622905&doi=10.1145%2f3542922&partnerID=40&md5=d1fc1b195cdd4555be7fbb9cf8509f0e,"Interior scene colorization is vastly demanded in areas such as personalized architecture design. Existing works either require manual efforts to colorize individual objects or conform to fixed color patterns automatically learned from prior knowledge, whilst neglecting user preference. Quantitatively identifying user preferences is challenging, particularly at the early stage of the design process. The 3D setup also presents new challenges as the inhabitant can observe from any possible viewpoint. We propose a representative view selection method based on visual attention and a progressive preference inference model. We particularly focus on the progressive integration of eye-tracked user preference, which enables the assistance in creativity support and allows the possibility of convergent thinking. A series of user studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed view selection method, preference inference model and the creativity support mechanism.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",creativity support; Interior color design; user preference,Behavioral research; Color; Architecture designs; Color design; Creatives; Creativity support; Individual objects; Inference models; Interior color design; Selection methods; User's preferences; View selection; Eye tracking
A Bayesian Approach for Quantifying Data Scarcity when Modeling Human Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152127969&doi=10.1145%2f3551388&partnerID=40&md5=a4570511972dd345fbd234179f6196c5,"Computational models that formalize complex human behaviors enable study and understanding of such behaviors. However, collecting behavior data required to estimate the parameters of such models is often tedious and resource intensive. Thus, estimating dataset size as part of data collection planning (also known as Sample Size Determination) is important to reduce the time and effort of behavior data collection while maintaining an accurate estimate of model parameters. In this article, we present a sample size determination method based on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for a specific Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) model of human behavior, in two cases: (1) pre-hoc experiment design - conducted in the planning stage before any data is collected, to guide the estimation of how many samples to collect; and (2) post-hoc dataset analysis - performed after data is collected, to decide if the existing dataset has sufficient samples and whether more data is needed. We validate our approach in experiments with a realistic model of behaviors of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and illustrate how to pick a reasonable sample size target. Our work enables model designers to perform a deeper, principled investigation of the effects of dataset size on IRL model parameters.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Toward this end, we created the theoretically-grounded CIDER assumption elicitation technique, an educational analytical design evaluation method to teach inclusive design skills. CIDER (Critique, Imagine, Design, Expand, Repeat) helps designers recognize and respond to bias using the critical lens of assumptions about users. Through an 11-week mixed-method case study in an interaction design course with 40 undergraduate students and follow-up interviews, we found that activities based on the CIDER technique may have helped students identify increasingly many types of design bias over time and reflect on their unconscious biases about users. The activities also had lasting impacts, encouraging some students to adopt more inclusive approaches in subsequent design work. We discuss the implications of these findings, namely that educational techniques like CIDER can help designers learn to create equitable technology designs.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Additional Key Words and PhrasesHCI education; assumption elicitation; design methods; inclusive design; interface design education,Curricula; Design; Human engineering; Additional key word and phraseshci education; Assumption elicitation; Design Education; Design method; Design skills; Elicitation techniques; Inclusive design; Interface design education; Interface designs; Key words; Students

We explore the connection between the audience's physiological data and their experience during the performance, analyzing a multi-modal dataset collected from 98 audience members. We identify notable moments based on HRV and EDA, and show how the audience's physiological responses can be linked to the choreography. The longitudinal changes in HRV features suggest a strong connection to the choreographer's intended narrative arc, while EDA features appear to correspond with short-term audience responses to dramatic moments. We discuss the physiological phenomena and implications for designing feedback systems and interdisciplinary collaborations.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",dance performance; Datasets; electrodermal activity; heart activity,Physiological models; Wearable sensors; Co-designs; Dance performance; Dataset; Design research; Design-process; Electrodermal activity; Heart activities; Performance; Physiological sensing; Sensor technologies; Physiology

Based on our observations, we identify 17 multi-device management tasks that are important to teachers in this specific device configuration. We conducted a second study to investigate how teachers could perform these tasks with the help of a smartwatch.

Understanding the Importance of Cultural Appropriateness for User Interface Design: An Avatar Study,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152593585&doi=10.1145%2f3517138&partnerID=40&md5=ae26701c0e9b96ef85b3d01eba8d1b4d,"While previous research established that culture plays an important role in technology adoption, there is only limited work on the role of cultural appropriateness in user interface design for users from a specific background. In this study, we focus on the case of avatar design as a user interface element for facilitating positive user experience. Building on the theoretical lenses of social response theory and the ""Computers Are Social Actors""paradigm, we develop a research model to investigate how cultural appropriateness of avatar design is a vital driver for users' trust. We evaluate our research model by means of an online experiment (n = 313) in the context of online health advice for users from Saudi Arabia. The avatars differed in appearance (Arab, non-Arab), gender (male, female), and clothing (athletic, medical, everyday). Our results show that Arab avatars exhibited significantly higher cultural appropriateness than non-Arab avatars. Furthermore, participants were more inclined to select an Arab avatar (88.2%) that matched their gender (77.3%). Confirming the critical role of cultural appropriateness, our study demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the target audience in designing user interfaces.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Avatars; cultural appropriateness; human-computer interaction; Saudi Arabia; social response theory,Human computer interaction; Avatar; Avatar designs; Cultural appropriateness; Interface elements; Research models; Response theory; Saudi Arabia; Social response theory; Technology adoption; User interface designs; User interfaces
Increasing User Trust in Optimisation through Feedback and Interaction,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147142539&doi=10.1145%2f3503461&partnerID=40&md5=c2f624bb57aa085174f25ae0c3caff3f,"User trust plays a key role in determining whether autonomous computer applications are relied upon. It will play a key role in the acceptance of emerging AI applications such as optimisation. Two important factors known to affect trust are system transparency, i.e., how well the user understands how the system works, and system performance. However, in the case of optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution. Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a) They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b) They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying the solution returned by the system. We found that showing intermediate solutions can lead to over-trust, while interactive exploration leads to more accurately calibrated trust.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",feedback; HCI; human-in-the-loop optimisation; interactive optimisation; trust; vehicle routing,Human computer interaction; Vehicle routing; AI applications; Autonomous computers; Human-in-the-loop; Human-in-the-loop optimization; Interactive optimization; Loop optimizations; Optimisations; Systems performance; Trust; Work performance; Feedback

Prior work has examined interventions, such as deferring notification delivery to opportune moments, but has not systematically studied how users might prefer an intelligent system to manage their notifications. Hence, we directly probed Android smartphone users' notification preferences via a one-week experience-sampling study (N = 35). We found that users prefer mitigating undesired interruptions by suppressing alerts over deferring them and referred to notification content factors more frequently than contextual factors for explaining their preferences. Then we demonstrated the challenges and potentials of leveraging user actions to help predict notification preferences. Specifically, we showed that a model personalized using user actions achieved a performance gain of 39% than a generic model. This improvement is similar to the 42% performance gain using labels solicited from the user while using observable user actions causes no extra disruption.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",android; experience-sampling method; intelligent system; interruptibility; Notification; smartphone,Android (operating system); Intelligent systems; Ubiquitous computing; Android; Android smartphone; Contextual factors; Experience sampling; Experience sampling method; Interruptibility; Notification; Performance Gain; Smart phones; User action; Smartphones

So far, most systems have focused on sensing and presenting information to the user via screens to support the exertion experience. Interestingly, emerging technology can also act on the exerting user's body based on sensed information, granting researchers the potential to develop technology that not only ""presents""but also ""acts""on information throughout an integrated exertion experience. As a result, design opportunities surrounding computing machinery as contextually aware exertion partners are now available. However, there are currently no frameworks to guide the design of human-computer integration in an exertion context. To contribute to closing this gap, we designed three eBike systems to investigate different forms of integration with the exerting user and we studied the resulting user experiences. Based on the results of these three case studies, we present the first framework, including associated design tactics, to offer guidance on how to design human-computer integration in an exertion context.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",bike; cycling; exertion; Human-computer integration; whole-body interaction,Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Integration; Bike; Computer integration; Cycling; Emerging technologies; Exertion; Human-computer integration; Physical activity; Presenting informations; Sensing information; Whole-body interactions; Machine design

These benefits are known as the placebo effect. We report two experiments (Experiment I: N = 369; Experiment II: N = 100) demonstrating a placebo effect in adaptive interfaces. Participants were asked to solve word puzzles while being supported by no system or an adaptive AI interface. All participants experienced the same word puzzle difficulty and had no support from an AI throughout the experiments. Our results showed that the belief of receiving adaptive AI support increases expectations regarding the participant's own task performance, sustained after interaction. These expectations were positively correlated to performance, as indicated by the number of solved word puzzles. We integrate our findings into technological acceptance theories and discuss implications for the future assessment of AI-based user interfaces and novel technologies. We argue that system descriptions can elicit placebo effects through user expectations biasing the results of user-centered studies.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Enhancing Youth Self-Regulation Through Wearable Apps: Increasing Usage Through Participatory Design in Low Income Youth,2023,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146785152&doi=10.1145%2f3490169&partnerID=40&md5=d343e5e73624c73955ae07ee54dec724,"Managing attention, progressing towards goals, and monitoring behaviors are elements of self-regulation (SR). SR applications based on contemplative practices such as breath counting have demonstrated gains in field studies but have failed to engage youth without coercion. Prior research generated behavioral and neurological changes, but was disliked by youth. This three-part study includes a participatory design workshop, application redesign, and subsequent field deployment to understand how wearable devices can support self-regulation. Twenty-seven youth designed activities that revealed interest in and models of self-regulation that became part of a smartwatch app. Researchers revisited and redesign the application based on youth feedback, and then released the redesigned application (some of whom participated in workshops, some of whom did not). Redesigning the application to be responsive to youth needs resulted in higher levels of satisfaction than previously observed. Youth also used this application more often and reported higher use. Three design tensions persisted: (1) Breath counting applications as attention grabbing vs. attention cultivating and (2) breath counting activities as a relaxation activity vs. a mental workout, and (3) exposing youth to meditation and breath counting as a strategy for developing healthy minds vs. an institutionalized or compulsory required action. Activity occupied positions along these continua, which creates associated challenges for researchers. A fruitful design space exists for researchers to integrate attention focusing into activities that youth value, which can include stress reduction or mindfulness training, but also could be simply to improve their academic work. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

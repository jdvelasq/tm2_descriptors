"Advertising acceptance via smart speakers","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141000648&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-02-2022-0028&partnerID=40&md5=f88ec5d1d4efd5ec5797491ed86596a2","Purpose: The influence of technology on marketing communications is rising in both applications and value created. Artificial intelligence (AI) and, as a result, smart speakers are benefiting both brands and customers at many levels. In particular, AI opens up the possibility to establish human-like dialogs with customers and to advertise brands in a new and engaging way. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand why and how consumers would accept receiving advertising (ad) via AI-enabled devices such as smart speakers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 326 individuals participated in a study that explored the factors influencing ad acceptance in smart devices. A partial least squares-structural equation model technique was used to validate the results. Findings: The findings show that customer acceptance of ads via smart assistants is influenced by smart assistant usefulness and hedonic motivations. However, privacy risk moderates the relationship between smart speaker ease of use and smart speaker usefulness. Originality/value: This paper explores the main drivers of ad acceptance via smart speakers and goes beyond the existing knowledge of smart speaker acceptance to further explore how this can become an important channel for brands to communicate. © 2022, João Guerreiro, Sandra Maria Correia Loureiro and Carolina Ribeiro.","Advertising acceptance; Artificial intelligence; Marketing communications; Smart speakers; Virtual assistants",""
"Does banner advertising still capture attention? An eye-tracking study","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164489314&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-11-2022-0236&partnerID=40&md5=a1f1195a75a02e931536abe7e6b44286","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how much visual attention is given to banner ads embedded in Web page content dependent on whether the user’s task is goal- or not goal-oriented, as well as the interplay between attention, banner location, banner click and banner recognition. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a within-subjects design where 100 participants performed two tasks – reading a news and finding where to click next – on a Web page containing three banner ads embedded into the website content. The authors gathered behavioral and eye-tracking data. Findings: Consumers disregard banner ads when they are performing a focused task (reading news). Visual attention paid to the banners while reading – but not while free browsing – and banner location do not impact ad clicking. In addition, it is not necessary to pay full attention to a banner ad to be able to recognize it afterward. Practical implications: The strategy of embedding banners in the main content of a Web page leads to higher visual attention when consumers are browsing a Web page compared to a focused task (e.g. reading). It also increases ad recognition over time compared to benchmark levels for ads placed in traditional positions. Originality/value: Previous studies mainly assessed effectiveness of banners located at the top or lateral of a Web page. The authors used eye tracking as an objective measure of visual attention to banner ads embedded in Web page content and behavioral metrics to assess ad interest and measured ad recognition over time. © 2023, Aline Simonetti and Enrique Bigne.","Attention; Banner advertising; Eye tracking; Memory; Online marketing",""
"Advances in neuroscience and marketing: analyzing tool possibilities and research opportunities","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124459340&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-10-2021-0196&partnerID=40&md5=d69616ef8bad3700ce48f9b7e0b64f92","Purpose: This study aims to illuminate the contribution of neurophysiological techniques in the field of marketing and consumer decision-making and to highlight avenues and research questions that marketing researchers can take advantage of from neuroscience and psychology to inform marketing phenomena. Methodology: The authors first reviewed the roots and definition of consumer neuroscience. Then, the authors outlined the main characteristics of the most commonly used neurophysiological tools (namely, skin conductance, facial electromyography, electrocardiogram, eye-tracking, electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetoencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation) with a special emphasis on their advantages and weaknesses. Finally, the authors propose the development of research lines that could be implemented by marketing researchers with an appropriate application and understanding of tools and theories of neuroscience and psychology. Findings: The authors propose research questions to be addressed within four thematic areas: opportunities in product decisions (predicting product purchasing decisions, consumer responses to branding efforts and packaging), pricing, communication and retailing scenarios. The authors also incorporate insights into the complementarity of neurophysiological tools to traditional ones and situations in which these tools are useful for enhancing marketing theory. The authors finally shed light on the moral–ethical criticisms of this new branch of marketing. Value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research constitutes the first study in identifying the research opportunities that marketing researchers could take advantage from neuroimaging and physiological tools to inform marketing theory and practice. ©, Luis-Alberto Casado-Aranda and Juan Sanchez-Fernandez.","Ethical concerns; Marketing research; Neuromarketing; Neurophysiological tools; Research opportunities",""
"How do ecotourists co-create value on digital platforms? The moderating role of ecotourist typology","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159840927&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-02-2022-0018&partnerID=40&md5=aa4b8c6fa7b8ac3f6d5f97496f48c4d5","Purpose: This study aims to examine the process of value co-creation (VCC) on digital ecotourism platforms and the role of perceived platform usefulness and user participation behavior in that process. The study also seeks to determine the extent to which the typology of the ecotourist moderates VCC. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 420 users of a digital ecotourism platform participated in a study analyzing the factors that influence VCC. A mediation, moderation and conditional process analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses. A K-means cluster analysis was also used to classify the ecotourists into four groups. Findings: The results show that perceived platform usefulness has a strong influence on the generation of VCC and also on user participation behavior. In turn, user participation behavior is an important driver of VCC. This study also highlights the moderating role of the ecotourist typology in the formation of VCC on these digital platforms. Practical implications: This study offers managers of digital ecotourism platforms a means to identify and motivate those ecotourists with the necessary skills and characteristics to become true co-creators of value. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing knowledge on how value is co-created on digital ecotourism platforms, confirming the important antecedent role of perceived platform usefulness and user participation behavior, as well as the moderating role of ecotourist typology. © 2023, Laura Hernández-López, Salvador Del Barrio-García and Maria Belen Prados-Peña.","Digital platforms; Ecotourism; Ecotourist typology; Participation; Perceived usefulness; Value co-creation",""
"The influence of eWOM. Analyzing its characteristics and consequences, and future research linesLa influencia de eWOM.

Second, this paper aims to propose some elements of eWOM communications that might be further researched. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of relevant academic articles produced 97 works related to social communication theory, eWOM and new artificial intelligence trends in hospitality. Thereafter, potential avenues for future research were explored. Findings: The study results showed: valence, relevance, understandability and visual cues are the most important antecedents of message usefulness and the reader’s behavioral intentions; source credibility is the sender characteristic that most affects the reader’s behavioral intentions and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence is the receiver characteristic that most influences their attitudes and behavioral intentions. In addition, the study highlights four relevant aspects for future research. First, more research into online fake reviews is needed to better understand sender motivations. Second, companies should actively manage negative reviews. Then, the careful choice of platforms on which companies promote their products/services. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence in increasing the effectiveness of eWOM in the hospitality industry. Originality/value: This paper integrates – grounded on communication theory – results from previous studies about the central elements of communication (message, sender and receiver) and discusses the main trends in hospitality-related eWOM. In addition, the paper examines the potential of specific eWOM elements as future lines of research, in particular: fake reviews, strategies for dealing with negative reviews, the eWOM platform used and artificial intelligence applications. © 2021, Khaoula Akdim.","Artificial intelligence; Communication theory; eWOM; Fake reviews; Negative reviews",""
"Exploring innovativeness, need for uniqueness and brand tiers in the sharing economy","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195806935&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-11-2023-0309&partnerID=40&md5=ce3b76248be3eaa7e2704698b87dbca6","Purpose: In a context where the sharing economy (SE) plays an important role in the transformation of today’s business landscape, profoundly changing the behavior of consumers and many established companies, some companies have begun to adapt to SE by incorporating its value propositions into their business models. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study the role of consumer innovativeness, brand levels and the need for uniqueness on the way to attitudes and intentions to participate in SE. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected the data through an online user survey, achieving a total sample of 717. The data were first analyzed using structural equation modeling and then combined with the use of the PROCESS macro. Findings: The findings provide empirical evidence of the antecedents of consumer innovativeness in a SE context and its role in explaining consumer attitudes and intentions to participate in non-ownership consumption. Furthermore, they also demonstrate that brand tiers and the need for uniqueness moderate the relationship between intentions and participation. Originality/value: The results of this study contribute to the theoretical development of the SE by presenting the first conceptual model that considers including the brand tiers effect and connects it to two leading theories on consumer behavior (diffusion of innovations theory and uniqueness theory). In addition, the study’s findings provide valuable insights for sharing platforms and traditional companies that choose to participate in the collaborative economy. © 2024, Daniel Espinosa Sáez, Elena Delgado-Ballester and José Luis Munuera Alemán.","Attitude; Brand tiers; Consumer innovativeness; Need for uniqueness; Purchase intention; Sharing economy",""
"Sustainability claim, environmental misconduct and perceived hypocrisy in luxury branding","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138231882&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-02-2022-0012&partnerID=40&md5=4917f8a952909b98cdd3e4f904cf19f1","Purpose: This paper aims to examine consumers’ evaluation of and reaction to the coexistence of brand misconduct and sustainability claims through a series of studies. Design/methodology/approach: The research questions are examined across three studies. Consumer’s scepticism of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is considered the driver of brand distance. Brand hypocrisy is postulated to mediate the relationship between scepticism to CSR and brand distance. Furthermore, brand trust and desire for exclusivity are tested as moderators of brand hypocrisy and brand distance. Findings: The findings showed that environmental misconduct leads to perceived brand hypocrisy and brand distancing. When luxury brands take action to remedy their actions, the perceived brand hypocrisy and brand distancing decrease. In addition, brand trust and desire for exclusivity dilute the relationship between brand hypocrisy and brand distance. Originality/value: The findings show that, standing in a contradictory position, brands can still reduce the consumers’ perceived brand distance by building a strong consumers’ trust toward the brand. At the same time, relating the luxury consumers’ yearning for the exclusive products and services, the findings show that the consumers with a strong desire for exclusivity feel a lower level of brand distance even if the brand gets involved in misconduct. © 2022, Isaac Cheah, Anwar Sadat Shimul and Min Teah.","Brand communication; Brand distance; Brand hypocrisy; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Luxury brand; Sustainability",""

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through 231 face-to-face questionnaires completed by frontline employees in shopping centers. A structural equation modeling approach was applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results highlight the importance of integration efforts as external stimuli for enhancing employees’ perceptions about customer engagement behavior. Findings extend the stimulus-organism-response model by predicting responses that go beyond employees’ behavior to predict customer engagement behavior. Results also confirm the mediating role of attitudes toward marketing communications and synergy realization in the proposed model. Practical implications: Retailers should integrate their multiple channels and operate consistently and in coordination through them to develop employees’ perceptions about customer engagement behavior. Managers should regularly collect information from their employees as they represent an important touchpoint in omnichannel retailing. Originality/value: There is a gap in the omnichannel retailing literature regarding how integration efforts at a communication level may complement integration efforts at a channel level for developing customer engagement. This study addresses this gap by adopting a novel perspective using frontline employees as a source of information for assessing customer engagement behavior. It extends knowledge about how customer engagement behavior may be developed and strengthened from the employees’ point of view. © 2023, María Sicilia and Mariola Palazón.","Channel integration; Communication consistency; Customer engagement behavior; Employees; Retailers; Synergy",""

This requires the teaching of new competencies in marketing education, as also reflected in today’s accreditation requirements for business schools. Therefore, this paper aims to explore how current research into marketing education incorporates sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Through a bibliometric literature review – examining 71 publications using the bibliographic coupling method – the current research front in marketing education is analysed. Findings: This paper identifies seven trending topics in marketing education research that both highlight a currently prevalent sustainability gap in marketing education research and – when combined into a framework – help marketing education researchers and educators to address this gap. Originality/value: This paper extends the already established concept of education for sustainable development to include the concept of marketing education for sustainable development (MESD) for the first time. The MESD framework combines its raison d’être with guidance on how sustainable development should be taught and what the learning objectives should be for future marketing managers. © 2023, Chiara Hübscher, Susanne Hensel-Börner and Jörg Henseler.","Bibliometrics; Competencies; Marketing education; SDGs; Sustainable development",""

The influence of return policies on the relationship between customer engagement and customer citizenship behaviour was also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to examine the framework of the proposed study with data collected through a survey (n = 251) to examine the opinions of the respondents about the variables mentioned. The authors also assessed the proposed framework using predictive power assessment using PLS predict. Findings: The study results reveal that customers’ experiences of integration and flexibility in omnichannel retail are positively associated with their engagement. However, customer experiences of connectivity, consistency and personalization do not appear to affect customer engagement significantly in omnichannel retail. The return policy positively moderates the relationship between customer engagement and customer citizenship behaviour in the omnichannel fashion retail context. Predictive power assessment shows that the proposed model has high prediction accuracy. Originality/value: This study contributes to the marketing literature by investigating different dimensions of consumer experience collectively and its impact on customer engagement and citizenship behaviour.

But most studies concern the causes of an ad going viral, not its impact on brands. In this sense, this study aims to demonstrate and compare video ads' value drivers on brands and sharing, determining which antecedents maximize results on each, enabling the best ad performance for advertisers. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted with 368 respondents who watched viral video ads from five global companies on YouTube. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modeling in SmartPLS4. Findings: The results of this study demonstrated that product category involvement is essential for viral advertising. Furthermore, the entertainment value is the most relevant antecedent of sharing, but it does not affect brand equity; it is the social value responsible for brand equity. Practical implications: Marketing managers should create ads that simultaneously generate entertainment and social values, maximizing sharing and branding effects. However, if only one of the two effects (brand/share) is achieved, then the advertiser will fail to obtain maximum performance. Originality/value: The mainstream of viral marketing research is focused on antecedents of sharing. However, sharing is not enough to provide brand effects and return on investment of advertisement. This study reveals that different consumers’ values drive sharing and brand equity, suggesting that firms should consider a dual value generation strategy regarding the performance of viral video ads. On the other hand, this research conciliates the extant literature about the phenomena with the importance of product category involvement. © 2023, Flavia Braga Chinelato, Cid Gonçalves Filho and Daniel Fagundes Randt.","Brand equity; Sharing content; Video advertisement; Viral marketing",""

Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 uses a panel sample to establish the mediating role of attitude toward the brand between perceptions of brand coolness and brand loyalty. Study 2 is an experimental survey study to describe the moderating role of conspicuous consumption on the relationship between mass/niche brand coolness and brand love and between mass/niche coolness and attitude toward the brand. Study 3 is a conjoint analysis that delineates the distinct factors that consumers attribute to mass versus niche cool brands in the luxury fashion arena. Findings: This study demonstrates that attitudes mediate the relationship between brand coolness and brand loyalty. Conspicuous consumption only moderates the relationship between brand coolness and attitudes in the case of niche cool brands. In a realistic field experiment, the authors confirm the mediating impact of attitude and the moderating influence of conspicuous consumption. The authors also attempt to provide coolness dimensions that tend to be more associated with mass luxury brands and those more related to niche luxury brands.

The research model also consists of product involvement as the moderator. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the results of the pretest stages, the study included two stimuli, and respondents were presented with two different brand posts (i.e. two manipulated pictures and texts on the Instagram frame). A two-group comparison (positive emotional brand post vs negative rational brand post) between-subjects experiment (n = 214) was conducted. Findings: The results indicate that WOM and eWOM are more affected by a celebrity’s emotional brand post than a celebrity’s rational brand post. Furthermore, both types of WOM are more affected through high product involvement enhanced by a celebrity’s rational brand post than through high product involvement boosted by a celebrity’s emotional brand post. Practical implications: Managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram celebrity-based branding are provided. Practical implications are also provided in the form of evidence of how the impacts of two different brand posts on positive offline WOM and eWOM are affected differently through the moderation of product involvement.

The authors also aim to determine the extent to which the perceived usefulness of VAs improves the perceived privacy associated with their use and increases users’ intention to continue using them. Consumer technology innovativeness is included as a personal trait moderator, to compare the results between tech and nontech innovators. For this purpose, the authors use the framework of the uses and gratifications theory (U&GT). Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 467 VA users was conducted and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: The authors identify two main determinants of the perceived usefulness of VAs that influence users’ intention to continue using this technology, process quality and outcome quality. These two factors influence the continued use of VAs in different ways depending on the technology innovativeness of the consumers. The results show that tech innovators are oriented toward the interactive experience, and therefore, mainly value the process quality. In addition, nontech innovators are oriented toward a satisfactory response from VAs, and therefore, primarily value the outcome quality.

This study aims to investigate the influence of mindfulness on customers’ quality of life and the mediating role of service value, satisfaction and loyalty to the company in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Three hundred banking customers participated in the survey. In this study, partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the relationship between the variables. Then, complementary methods were used to assess the robustness of the PLS-SEM results. Findings: In this study, it was found that mindfulness directly influences service value, satisfaction and quality of life. Service value was also found to directly influence satisfaction. Satisfaction directly influences loyalty to the company. In addition, loyalty to the company, but not satisfaction, directly influences quality of life. However, this study did not find any evidence that service value, satisfaction and loyalty to the company mediate the influence of mindfulness on quality of life. Practical implications: Banking marketing managers need to ensure that their customers have an impressive moment-to-moment experience with the services provided to support improving their quality of life.

Design/methodology/approach: The information obtained through a personal survey to 382 local tourists was refined and subjected to structural equation analysis. Analyses conducted with SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 20 software confirmed the existence of interesting significant relationships. Findings: The results show that positive destination image and different experiences are considered to be the main elements that promote positive emotions and satisfaction for tourists, leading to a higher eagerness to spread WOM recommendations and to revisit a destination. The results also verify that interactions with the difficult-replacement services and with residents create strong positive EEs for female visitors, so that they are more willing to revisit a destination than males. Research limitations/implications: Eco-destination managers should provide more difficult-replacement services and create an enjoyable and unique experience for tourists to enhance their satisfaction and positive behavioral intentions.

It examines the roles of self-enhancement, identity signaling and social bonding as antecedents of consumers’ CSR engagement on social media. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach is used with a single-factor between-subjects experimental design in which the presence vs absence of CSR information on a company website is manipulated. The hypotheses are tested through structural equation modeling. Findings: Results show that after viewing the company’s CSR message on its website, consumers who generated more CSR associations were more motivated to engage with the CSR information to satisfy fundamental personality traits (need for self-enhancement) and social relationship motivations (social bonding), which increased their intention to share the information. Research limitations/implications: This study is restricted to CSR information on websites. Further research should consider what happens if such information is shared on social media, as consumers are more likely to spread CSR messages when they are shared by other public social network sites. Practical implications: The study highlights the relevance of including CSR information on websites and offers insights into the importance of considering consumers in disseminating CSR information. Consumers share information when they have personal motivation for doing so. Social implications: This study put the focus on the role of consumers in the diffusion of corporate information.

This study also aims to examine the mediating role of relationship marketing orientation (RMO) on the relationship of CSR activities and customer value co-creation behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The main problem of dichotomy between customers and the management was existing in banking sector so that’s why through purposive sampling, banking customers were selected for data collection through a self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The present study found that both local community-related and supplier-related CSR activities have a positive impact on customer value co-creation behavior. Relationship marketing orientation mediates between the link of CSR activities and customer value co-creation behavior. The strength of RMO in CSR supplier and customer value co-creation behavior is found to be more dominant. Research limitations/implications: This study is restricted to one country under-investigation; therefore, it can be replicated with a larger and more geographically diverse sample. Practical implications: This study offers insights to the banking sector that local community-related CSR activities contribute to the value co-creation behavior and minimize the social problems of Pakistan.

"Cyberaddiction to TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197460504&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-01-2023-0023&partnerID=40&md5=fd74ab1e45deea4ec3c64a4818719cb6","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to shed light on the determinants of TikTok cyberaddiction during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the resulting attitudinal and intentional reactions of users. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 305 young TikTok users was conducted to test the research hypotheses. Data was analyzed through a partial least sqaures approach. Findings: The results highlight the mediating role of cyberaddiction to TikTok in the relationship between psychological disorders (anxiety and loneliness) and attitude toward TikTok. Indeed, it was found that anxiety and loneliness contribute to TikTok cyberaddiction. The latter would have a positive effect on attitude toward TikTok, which decreases in the presence of fear of missing out (FOMO). It was also proven that attitude toward TikTok has a positive impact on attitude toward the brands promoted on this platform, resulting in an increase in purchasing intentions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore interesting to replicate it to see if the research model can be still validated in the absence of an emergency situation. Testing the model on a larger target, including older TikTok users, could also lead to interesting findings. Practical implications: Knowledge of the psychological factors behind cyberaddiction should not be seen as an opportunity to take advantage from addicted shoppers’ vulnerability. Managers should rather limit communication campaigns on TikTok during crisis periods, undertake retargeting actions by sparing vulnerable TikTok users and avoid stimulating anxiety and loneliness which can lead to cyberaddiction and compulsive purchases. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the central role of cyberaddiction to TikTok in the relationship between psychological disorders and users’ reactions, during a pandemic. It focused on the moderating role of FOMO on the relationship between determinants of cyberaddiction and attitude toward TikTok. Escape theory and attachment theory were used and adapted to the context of social media. © 2024, Souad Maghraoui and Lilia Khrouf.","Attitude; COVID-19; Cyberaddiction; Cyberaddiction-TikTok-COVID-19-FOMO-attitude-intention; FOMO; Intention; TikTok",""

Building on social identity and cognitive dissonance theories, this study aims to examine the Spanish consumer relationship with national brands originated in Catalonia considering the current conflicting circumstances in the region. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data by means of personal questionnaires, distributed among 277 Spanish consumers of Catalan brands of Cava. The data is analysed by using structural equation modelling and linear structural relations. Findings: After controlling for brand familiarity, the results of this study reveal that ethnocentrism negatively distorts consumers’ confidence in dual origin brands and highlight the role of identification and trust as brand love antecedents. It also reveals that ethnocentrism has a more profound impact on boycotting decision than brand love. Originality/value: This study is one of the few to capture the puzzlement created by the paradoxical nature of the brand’s duality of origin. Furthermore, it contributes to the marketing literature by examining the impact of ethnocentrism on two relationship variables (i.e. identification and trust) and exploring their joint impact on consumers’ decision to buy or boycott. The findings of this study can be helpful for companies facing boycotting behaviour triggered by ethnocentric consumer reaction towards dual origin brands. © 2020, Dalia Abdelwahab, Nadia H.

Design/methodology/approach: The data from two different cultures the UK (306 users) and Spain (307 users) have been collected and compared by performing multi-group analyzes (MGAs) across cultural context, age, gender and educational level using a structural equation modeling approach. Findings: Cultural context, age, gender and educational level moderate the effect of the deterrents and motivators on the attitude and participation in co-creation online: users from individualistic, masculine, with low uncertainty avoidance cultural contexts are expected to be more motivated and express a stronger positive attitude toward co-creation online; young male users exhibit a higher level of positive attitude and higher effect of the motivators toward attitude; on the contrary, old women are exposed to the negative effect of the deterrents; the individuals with basic educational level exhibit a higher level of the deterrents’ effect. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of the results across different cultural contexts requires further examination and cross-validation. Practical implications: The MGAs of two different cultures (Spain and the UK) and samples of different ages, gender and educational levels provide practitioners with information, which cultures and groups of users are expected to perform better in co-creation activities online.

This study aims to offer a conceptual model for understanding the linkages between the antecedents and consequences of subjective well-being in ridehailing services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a non-probabilistic sampling method and a pre-tested survey instrument, 450 responses were collected from January to March 2020. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings: Experience quality and perceived convenience are correlated with subjective well-being. Perceived value and personal innovativeness were not correlated with subjective well-being, as the former does not contribute to the latter’s development. Continuous usage intention significantly correlated with subjective well-being, followed by customer relationship proneness and advocacy. Regarding gender and age differences, men place higher value on customer relationship proneness than women, while women place higher value on subjective well-being than men. Older users value perceived convenience and customer relationship proneness in ridehailing services more than younger users. Practical implications: Understanding key factors contributing to user well-being in ridehailing would promote a more affordable mobility sector globally. This understanding would enable ridehailing businesses to create more effective business and marketing plans while prioritising user well-being, thus enhancing user happiness and reducing turnover rates. Originality/value: This research demonstrates how crucial it is for users’ well-being to have a positive experience and find the service convenient. It also highlights the importance of building strong customer relationships and examines how gender and age influence people’s adoption and use of these services. © 2023, Aijaz A.

However, prior quantitative touch research does not present a holistic perspective of haptics. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of haptic information that consumers attain from touch. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a qualitative research approach, semi-structured, depth interviews were conducted with industry experts. Findings: Based on the findings, this research proposes a conceptual model of consumer haptic perception consisting of seven key influences, namely, the effects of haptic sensation, haptic perception, the influence of individual factors, the influence of external environmental factors, the multi-dimensionality of haptics, haptic cue congruity and haptic dominance. Practical implications: This study suggests firms to understand the importance of consumers’ haptic perception as an opportunity to engage an individual’s heart and mind through information attained through touch. Originality/value: This is the first study in marketing to propose a conceptual model of haptics comprising several new haptic influences. This model contributes to the emerging literature of sensory marketing by providing directions for future touch research by capturing the dynamic nature of haptics. © 2021, Achini Tharaka Ranaweera.","Consumer haptic perception; Haptics; Sensory marketing; Touch",""

Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study uses the triangulation of projective methods, coupled with semi-structured interviews with 120 participants. The data was collected from major cities of Pakistan, using a convenient sample of 25 semi-structured interviews, 35 narratives and 60 sentence completions and constructions analyzed by performing thematic analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that the antecedents of the purchase of supersized food include price/quantity trade-off, hunger, liking and the social setting of consumption. Such purchase decisions also lead to consequences such as saving after purchase, health concerns, food waste, guilt and satisfaction. The findings also reveal the factors that play a dual role of an antecedent and a consequence: sharing, social status, quantity and leisure time. Practical implications: The knowledge of factors that make consumers select supersized foods can help marketers design deals that can control overconsumption and food waste. Instead of only focusing on the motivations behind the purchase of supersized foods, the authors also discuss the aspects of food purchase and consumption.

While its role in the fast fashion industry is prominent, its drivers and effects have not been comprehensively studied. This study aims to investigate the relationships between three psychological drivers (i.e. fashion-conscious, chronic shopping orientation and self-esteem), one behavioral driver (i.e. the average frequency of shopping), brand centrality and relationship quality in the fast fashion industry. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 250 fast fashion consumers was conducted and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. Findings: The study shows that fashion consciousness and chronic shopping orientation are positively related to brand centrality, whereas self-esteem is negatively related to brand centrality. The findings also show that shopping frequency moderates the relationship between fashion consciousness and brand centrality, and between chronic shopping orientation and brand centrality.

Drawing on affect transfer theory, the authors test for the mediating role of attitude towards the employee, which is proposed to mediate the effect of employees’ displayed emotion on customers’ satisfaction with recovery. As service recovery entails a critical service experience in which emotions can easily rise, this paper aims to highlight the pivotal role of employee-displayed emotions during service recovery. Methodology: A scenario-based experiment in the context of an airline service failure recovery (3 × 2 between-subjects design) manipulates frontline employees’ emotions (anger vs happiness vs no specific emotion) and the quality of the solution (bad vs good). Findings: Employees’ displayed emotions directly affect attitude towards the employee and indirectly affect service recovery satisfaction. Moreover, attitude towards the employee is affected more by the employee’s displayed emotion when the solution offered is bad compared to good. Practical implications: Employees’ emotions displayed during service recovery can enhance or damage service recovery strategies. Employees should control for negative emotions in the case of service failure, especially when unable to provide a good solution. Originality: Emotions displayed by employees can influence the customer’s service recovery evaluations. There is an interesting interaction between the quality of the solution and employees’ displayed emotions. Additionally, the mantra of “service with a smile” may not be valid in the case of service recovery: rather, employees should avoid displaying negative emotions. © 2021, María Sicilia, M.

Design/methodology/approach: To test the conditioned indirect effects, path analysis is used. Findings: The results indicate that both consumers’ value consciousness and shopping enjoyment have a positive indirect effect on mobile shopping intention. However, shopping enjoyment is related only through usefulness, whereas value consciousness is related via both usefulness and ease of use. The results also suggest the need to consider boundary conditions when examining the impact of personality traits. Practical implications: Mobile retailers need to conduct market segmentation based on users’ personalities when trying to increase their customer base. Originality/value: Despite the relevance of personality traits on individual behavior, studies on the effects that different aspects of personality have on the participation of individuals in mobile commerce are very scarce and show inconsistent results regarding their impact.

It conceptualizes and validates the relationship of brand pride with SBC, brand loyalty and oppositional brand loyalty and establishes the role of narcissism as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: Standardized scales, including a new brand pride scale developed by the authors, were used to collect data from 522 respondents. Covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model. Multi-group moderation analysis tested the differences in the proposed relationship between high and low narcissists. Findings: Results posit brand pride as a multidimensional construct with SBC as its significant antecedent. The findings also support most hypothesized relationships between brand pride and behavioral outcomes. In addition, the study confirms the moderating effect of narcissism on the relationship between brand pride dimensions and brand loyalty and opposition brand loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The study sample was from a developing nation – India. Similar cohorts from developing and developed countries could provide a unique cross-nation comparison. Practical implications: The role of brand pride in impacting brand loyalty and oppositional brand loyalty has significant implications for practice. Marketing communication to inculcate brand pride among consumers will significantly impact the brand’s profitability. Originality/value: Validation of SBC as a precursor to brand pride and the relationship of brand pride with brand loyalty and oppositional brand loyalty contributes significantly to branding theory and practice.

Design/methodology/approach: Through an experimental design study, Portuguese and Foreign participants were exposed to both traditional and nontraditional food pictures of a country and asked to evaluate their emotional and motivational responses while physiological responses of electrodermal activity were being continuously recorded. Predisposition factors of body dissatisfaction, food neophobia and food involvement were also evaluated given their potential role in predicting the responses to the visualization of the food pictures. Findings: This study found that local traditional food received a higher positive evaluation than nontraditional food with locals evaluating it even higher than foreigners. Higher feelings of arousal and desire as well as willingness to try in response to traditional food were also found as well as higher feelings of pleasure by locals. However, interestingly, and contrary to expectations derived from previous literature, emotion-motivational responses were not significantly different between locals and foreigners. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research addressed an identified research gap in the literature, being the first one evaluating the autonomic responses of consumers to traditional food by exploring how local and foreign consumers respond to traditional food versus nontraditional food using psychophysiological measures of emotion. © 2022, Paulo Rita, Patrícia Arriaga, Ana Moura and João Guerreiro.","Body dissatisfaction; Emotion-motivational response; Food attributes; Food involvement; Food neophobia; Traditional food",""
"How social CRM and customer satisfaction affect customer loyalty","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177564577&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-09-2022-0202&partnerID=40&md5=7ce79869cb877060ca7f5dd24f471cf4","Purpose: Based on relationship marketing theory, this study aims to test the effect of social customer relationship management (social CRM) on customer satisfaction (CS) and loyalty (CL). Design/methodology/approach: To assess the proposed framework, structural equation modeling was performed on the data of 314 automotive customers surveyed online. Findings: Social CRM dimensions [traditional CRM (TCRM) and social media (SM) technology use] have a direct and positive effect on CS. On the other hand, only TCRM has a direct and significant influence on CL, while the SM technology use effect seems to be indirect rather than direct. Indeed, the findings have provided empirical support for the contention that CS plays a mediating role between social CRM dimensions and CL. Practical implications: In the automotive sector and developing countries in particular, companies’ managers could increase CS and CL and consequently enhance their competitiveness and market share by adopting an effective social CRM strategy. From this perspective, companies should focus their social CRM campaigns on the most SM used by customers, offer personalized choices and improve customer experience, interaction and value co-creation. Originality/value: This paper enriches the understanding of how social CRM can affect CS and CL. The scales of social CRM, CS and CL were validated in the context of developing countries and the automotive sector. Furthermore, the direct and mediating effect of CS between social CRM (TCRM and SM) and CL was also confirmed. © 2023, Djihane Malki, Mohammed Bellahcene, Hela Latreche, Mohammed Terbeche and Razane Chroqui.","Automotive sector; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Social CRM; Social media",""

Design/methodology/approach: This study is an empirical analysis of citations and cocitations on a sample of 5,837 articles published in leading service journals (from 1981 to December 2020). Network analysis was adopted to analyze the data. This study is exclusive in conducting the inquiry at the individual publication level, rather than using the normal aggregated author co-citation analysis approach. Findings: The findings reveal that the main themes of service research centered on customer satisfaction, service quality, service-dominant logic, methodological foundations, market orientation and service encounter. Also clarified is the periphery domain that may become more important in the future (i.e. technology). The findings also present anchor points for conceptual framing and conceptual development – five main themes that are momentous to navigate theory discovery and justification in the knowledge domain. Research limitations/implications: It calls for a more academic effort to evaluate the service research by considering different epistemological paradigms, such as positivism, monologic and hermeneutic, to better understand the process and progress of the discipline. Practical implications: Through exploring the transformation of service research into a customer-centric model and technology-based service logic, this study offers possible implications for practitioners and further research areas for service researchers.

It draws attention to the beneficial effects of cultural components and digital intimacy on gamified mobile payment systems. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from Y, X and silver generation in Dalian, China. The users were well equipped with the WeChat pay features and had experience. The PLS-SEM software was used to assess the data. Findings: The findings show that consumer word of mouth and loyalty are positively impacted by perceived utility, fun, and enjoyment. Besides, gamification components like fun and playfulness have a favourable effect on how useful mobile payments are judged to be. It demonstrates how delighted and ecstatic users are with WeChat Hongbao. In addition, the positive moderation effect of intimacy on the hypothesised connections shows that all three generations are likely to accept gamified money features. These results provide a substantial contribution to our comprehension of gamification in the context of mobile payment services for all three generations. Originality/value: The study is distinctive because it focuses on how China’s three generations use WeChat Pay for routine transactions.

Furthermore, the moderating role of brand credibility in mitigating the negative effects of green marketing was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: A within-subject experiment was conducted to evaluate excessive versus minimal product packaging to test the proposed hypotheses. Data analysis was performed with SmartPLS 3.3.3, which analyzed data from 206 consumers. Findings: The results showed that EPP positively predicts greenwashing and green confusion. However, greenwashing has a negative impact on GBE. Brand credibility was also discovered to moderate the negative relationship between greenwashing and GBE, thereby reducing the negative effect of greenwashing. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that marketing managers should understand the consumers’ concerns for the environment, making product and brand strategies that promote environmental protection and sustainability.

Despite the many works that have examined this variable, given its strong influence on behaviour, it has generally been studied in association with other constructs, and no studies have focused on it in a specific way. Its definition, measurement and approaches to its role and usefulness are superficial and underdeveloped. After structuring and analysing the existing literature, the authors establish, (I) which aspects are of little use to the discipline, and (II) which research lines have the most potential and should be developed and studied in greater depth, to advance and complete the existing consumer knowledge framework. Design/methodology/approach: A search was undertaken for documents in the main databases in which the term “consumer knowledge” appears in a marketing or consumer context, and a critical and reflexive approach was taken to analyse the main contributions and to structure them by content blocks. Findings: Five main content blocks were identified. A set of research gaps were detected, mainly related to the lax conceptualisation of the topic, measurement problems and the scarcity of more useful works connected with business management, and several research lines are proposed that complement the existing framework to make it more complete and operational.

This paper examines the olfactory preferences of customers in the bakery department of a grocery store in the Slovak and the Spanish market. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of this study is to examine subconscious/unconscious preferences in the selection of aromas suitable for the bakery department in the Slovak and the Spanish market. In this case, it is not a classical qualitative sensory testing of the perception of fragrances. The aim is to identify the associations of scents related to the selected sales department through images of the selected aromas. A special platform is used to obtain subconscious/unconscious feedback, which allows online collection of implicit feedback using the software FaceReader 7. Findings: The authors noticed the different moods of the two groups of respondents when they answered the question about what they associate with the smell of bakery products. The Spanish respondents were slightly pleasantly disposed, while the Slovak respondents were slightly unpleasantly disposed. The smell of bakery products evoked more memories and emotions in the Spanish respondents than in the Slovak respondents, which can be explained by the higher pleasant mood. The main contribution of this work lies in the new opportunities to obtain feedback that can be used in marketing research and that rely not only on explicit but also implicit data. The extension of the methodological apparatus to implicit feedback presupposes some form of control of the data collected by the questionnaire. The use of biometric tools can represent an efficient alternative in terms of time and money to the use of neuroimaging tools in the selection/research of aromas for specific stores/departments. Research limitations/implications: It must be noted that the sample is small, and adequate conclusions cannot be made about entire population. Based on empirical findings and pandemic-related limitations, the authors plan to conduct similar research with real aroma samples and with even larger sample of tested respondents, considering weather, season, olfactory sensitivity (anosmia, hyposmia and normosmia) and participant fatigue (beginning and end of the week). Originality/value: Today, marketers are facing the greatest challenge of how to attract consumers’ attention. Every individual has a different perception of the shopping environment based on his own experience, beliefs and attitudes. This is why new marketing techniques and approaches are becoming increasingly popular in the marketing environment. © 2024, Jakub Berčík, Anna Mravcová, Esther Sendra Nadal, David Bernardo López Lluch and Andrea Farkaš.","Aroma marketing; Consumer neuroscience; FaceReader; Scent; Smell",""

So, this study aims to address the following question: does engagement with technology drive the use of technology?or does the use of technology create the engagement with technology? Design/methodology/approach: Based on the uses and gratifications theory, this study compares three alternative competing models that explain technology behaviour on a sample of 715 individuals, using the selection criteria proposed by Mathieson. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of three structural competing models on technology behaviour, namely, “use-and-engagement”, “use-to-engagement” and “engagement-to-use”, are presented. Findings: Findings show that the “use-and-engagement” model provides a better explanation of technology behaviour and is superior to predict technology behaviour, suggesting that both technology engagement and use could be considered as consequences.

Methodology: This study is based on a 3 (compensation level: 20%, 50%, 100%) × 2 (compensation type: refund, coupon) × 2 (service medium: offline, online) scenario-based experimental design. Findings: The offline and online customers exhibit different satisfaction for the respective values of both the immediate and delayed compensation types. Moreover, offline customers exhibit more trust in the firm when they receive a refund, whereas their online counterparts demonstrate a higher trust when provided with a coupon. Practical implications: For a service failure such as the one presented in the experimental study’s scenario, a lower (higher) value coupon will generate more (less) satisfaction compared to providing the same value as a refund. Firms will be better off by providing partial compensation in the form of a coupon, rather than a refund. Originality: Unlike most studies of service recovery, this research takes into account the perceived differences of various tangible compensations to provide a comparison of offline and online customers’ recovery preferences. Furthermore, the previous studies have not focused on trust restoration and assessed causes and effects of trust based on trust at one point in time i.e. trust after recovery.

This study aims to investigate the impacts of the quality perceived by hotel guests on their positive emotions, negative emotions, perceived value and satisfaction; verify the impacts of the price on perceived value and satisfaction; examine the impacts of satisfaction on WOM and eWOM; and test the moderating effect of hotel guests’ behavioural engagement on social networking sites (HGBE-SNS) on the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM. Design/methodology/approach: This survey included 371 guests who assessed their experiences at three Brazilian hotels. Structural equation modelling tested the hypothetical model supported by the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974). Findings: The quality perceived by hotel guests (stimulus) positively impacts perceived value, positive emotions and satisfaction and negatively affects negative emotions (organism). Price (stimulus) negatively impacts perceived value but does not affect satisfaction. Perceived value positively impacts satisfaction. Satisfaction positively impacts WOM and eWOM (responses). The HGBE-SNS moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that simultaneously demonstrates the relationships between perceived quality, price, perceived value, positive and negative emotions, satisfaction, WOM, eWOM and HGBE-SNS. Hotels must offer their guests high-quality services to positively impact’ perceived value, positive emotions, satisfaction and WOM. Low prices boost the perceived value but do not directly increase guest satisfaction. Satisfied hotel guests share their experiences via WOM, but high HGBE-SNS is crucial to boost eWOM. © 2023, Gustavo Quiroga Souki, Alessandro Silva de Oliveira, Marco Túlio Correa Barcelos, Maria Manuela Martins Guerreiro, Júlio da Costa Mendes and Luiz Rodrigo Cunha Moura.","ADANCO; Consumer behaviour; Emotions; Hospitality; S-O-R theory; Social media",""

This study analyzed 1,152 studies to identify the principal thematic areas and emergent topics, principal theories used, predominant forms of analysis and the most productive authors in terms of research. Design/methodology/approach: The articles for this research were all selected from the Web of Science database. A systematic and quantitative literature review was performed. This study used SciMAT software to extract indicators. Specifically, this study analyzed productivity and produced a science map. Findings: The findings suggest that interest in this area has increased gradually. The outputs also reveal the innovative effort of industry in new technologies for developing models for tourism marketing. Ten research areas were identified: “destination marketing,” “mobility patterns,” “co-creation,” “gastronomy,” “sustainability,” “tourist behavior,” “market segmentation,” “artificial neural networks,” “pricing” and “tourist satisfaction.” Originality/value: This work is unique in proposing an agenda for future research into tourism marketing research with new technologies such as BD and artificial intelligence techniques. In addition, the results presented here fill the current gap in the research since while there have been literature reviews covering tourism with BD or marketing, these areas have not been studied as a whole. © 2022, Sofía Blanco-Moreno, Ana M.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative approach to test the proposed model based on the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) theory. The non-probability purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from Pakistani mobile users through a self-administered questionnaire. Findings: The study results prove that VC alone cannot generate mobile users’ engagement. SA is the key in this regard, which has a relatively higher importance compared to SIC. Furthermore, the serial mediation effect of SA and SIC on CE shows that attractive sources are likely to induce higher SIC and subsequent CE. Practical implications: The results reveal that without a pleasing SA and positive SIC, mobile users skip the ads by perceiving them to be irritating or interruptive. Mobile ads might cost relatively less, but the advertisers should understand the significance of the SA toward minimizing the mobile advertising skepticism. Originality/value: Advertisers can enhance the user’s engagement on mobile devices by addressing both the SA and SIC in their VC. The combined effect of both the SA and SIC on CE has not been assessed before. Furthermore, this study has used the SOR mechanism to examine CE. © 2023, Muhammad Talha, Zonaib Tahir and Iqra Mehroush.","Customer engagement; Mobile advertising; Self-influencer congruence; SOR; Source appearance; Visual content",""

Design/methodology/approach: The participants were identified through a purposive sampling approach, and they were composed of consumers who purchased Korean-celebrity-endorsed products and services of a telecommunications company. The hypothesized relationships were gauged using a predictive approach as a research design via partial least squares (PLS) path modeling. Findings: The findings show that all hypothesized relationships are supported. In particular, social media interaction was found to have a substantial, positive and significant effect on self-disclosure. Moreover, self-disclosure has a considerably significant and direct effect on parasocial relationships and was found to indirectly affect the link between social media interactions and parasocial relationships. The results further reveal that social media interactions and parasocial relationships predict source trustworthiness, leading to brand credibility and loyalty.

Additionally, this paper aims to examine how product involvement moderates these effects. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 demonstrates the linkages between three consumer–brand relationships (i.e. brand love, brand attachment and attitude toward the brand) and their antecedents. In Study 2, by testing the nomological network of the antecedents and consequences of brand love, the authors extend the results of the previous study. Findings: Study 1 provides evidence that ethnic advertising has the strongest effect on brand love in comparison with other alternative consumer-brand relationship constructs. In Study 2, results show that only for low-involvement products, the perceived similarity of customers with Hispanic models in ads could lead to a higher positive attitude toward the ad. However, in the high-involvement condition, perceived similarity did not mediate the relationship between those constructs, which is in line with Elaboration Likelihood Model. Practical implications: From the practical and managerial perspective, this paper proposes that managers should concentrate on ads with ethnic cues, especially for low involvement products. Hence, it would be worthwhile for companies to consider ads with ethnic cues to effectively develop deep consumer–brand relationships. Originality/value: This paper investigates the effects of targeted ads on deeper relationships (e.g. brand love) and its behavioral consequences. Therefore, the authors show how Hispanic targeted ads could lead to deep consumer–brand relationships which encompass both the mind and heart of customers. © 2021, Rozbeh Madadi, Ivonne M.

However, scarce studies reveal the relationship between sales performance and brand relationship. The purpose of this study is both, from one side, to empirically demonstrate the impact of salesperson brand attachment (SBA) on sales performance and, on the other side, to identify the mediators of this relationship in small retailing. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted with a sample of 206 small retailers from different sectors of an emerging country. The proposed model was tested using partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS3. Findings: The results demonstrated that SBA is relevant to driving sales performance through two relevant paths – one following SBA–satisfaction–performance and one path following the SBA–commitment–performance. The model was able to explain 63% of the outcome performance. Practical implications: Regarding small retailers, where the owners, employees and managers have higher levels of interaction than the large national retail chains, the marketing executives must invest in improving the attachment to the brand and create emotional bonds and cognition between marketers and the brand. They must develop strategies to promote job satisfaction and organizational commitment because they determine performance. Originality/value: Despite the relevance of small businesses for economies worldwide and the importance of salesperson brand relationships, no study has been developed to demonstrate the impacts of such relationships on salesperson performance in retailing. Furthermore, in addition to the central role of organizational commitment in the sales research, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to mediate the relationship between brand attachment and sales performance. © 2020, Flavia Braga Chinelato, Cid Gonçalves Filho and Clodoaldo Lopes Nizza Júnior.","Brand attachment; Job satisfaction; Organizational commitment; Retailing; Sales performance; Salesperson; Small business",""

Design/methodology/approach: An experiment was conducted using the eye-tracking methodology, in addition to a self-administered questionnaire. Through eye-tracking technology, eye movements were recorded whilst participants explored a generic hotel website. The factors used in the analyses were the position of the banner on the website and participants’ experience as internet users. Findings: The findings showed that positioning a banner at certain locations on the webpage may lead to a better recall, which, in part, seems to result from the visual attention that such locations attract. The mediation analysis showed that the bottom-right and bottom-left positions have a negative effect on banner recall due, in part, to the shorter attention times and the smaller number of fixations those positions induce. Although the visitor’s level of internet experience affected his/her visual attention towards the banner, its impact on banner recall was non-significant. Results are discussed considering which variables produce greater effectiveness in capturing the user’s attention.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted with 252 actual m-banking users, and the partial least squares structural equations modelling was applied to analyse the data. Findings: The results reveal that ubiquity and gamification positively influence the perceived usefulness and entertainment, that is the utilitarian and hedonic perceived values. Furthermore, users’ self-congruence and innovativeness affect subjective norms and novelty-seeking, representing social and epistemic values. Except for the hedonic value, each value element impacts the overall perceived value, which in turn incites clients’ intention to continue using m-banking services.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory and qualitative study was undertaken based on a literature review and three focus groups with travelers and tourism and marketing professionals. Findings: The findings revealed that different perceptions precede a destination fascination among the three groups and that the construction of fascination is related to other variables. Through consulting the three groups, 12 variables were identified, and a framework was proposed addressing the background of destination fascination and how it relates to memorable experiences and the intention to (re)visit. Another important finding is the need for tourism professionals to collaborate with marketing professionals to meet tourists’ expectations. In addition, it was found that fascination can occur before visiting a place. Originality/value: This paper advances the literature on four points: it presents evidence that fascination can occur even before visiting a destination; it verifies which variables are related to the multidimensional construct of destination fascination and how this relationship is observed by the three distinct groups; it identifies how the construction of destination fascination occurs; and it explains how tourism and marketing professionals can help fulfill travelers’ wishes. © 2022, Rosângela Andrade Pessoa, Oderlene Oliveira and Lucas Lopes Ferreira Souza.","Attention restoration theory; Consumer behavior; Destination fascination; Intention to visit; Memorable experiences; Tourism",""

"Understanding mobile e-wallet consumers’ intentions and user behavior","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142276590&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-05-2022-0105&partnerID=40&md5=88c37d112e724d459ec1862b70dcbd74","Purpose: This study aims to investigate the factors that influence behavioral intention (BI) and usage of e-wallets by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with constructs, namely, mobile self-efficacy, perceived enjoyment and satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This quantitative study used partial least squares structural equation modeling on a sample of 576 mobile e-wallet users surveyed online. Findings: The key findings indicate that the model can explain 58.8% of the variance in behavioral intention and 53.8% in usage. Moreover, mobile self-efficacy has a significant influence on perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment significantly affects satisfaction, effort expectancy and performance expectancy. Furthermore, effort expectancy significantly influences customer satisfaction in contrast to performance expectancy. In addition, although performance expectancy, social influence and satisfaction significantly impact consumers’ behavioral intention, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions condition have an insignificant influence on consumers’ behavioral intention. E-wallet stakeholders can use the findings of this study to make strategic decisions regarding the e-wallet ecosystem. Originality/value: Although previous studies have independently addressed the impact of mobile self-efficacy, perceived enjoyment and satisfaction on consumers’ behavioral intention and usage behavior, the expanded framework with the possible relationships proposed in this study has never been adequately studied in previous research in the context of e-wallets in developing countries based on an empirical analysis.

"Hotel’s customer empowerment, environmental corporate social responsibility, and online customer value co-creation to attain sustainable development goals (SDGs)","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197400458&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-10-2023-0289&partnerID=40&md5=b1bc16fc7a45a46fc98ef26800abbdfe","Purpose: The hotel customers are conscious of the deteriorating environmental conditions and demand for online immersions. Hotels lack an exciting shift in customer behavior for augmented customer re-patronage intention (CRPI) especially in developing countries. This study aims to apply customer-dominant service logic (CDSL) to comprehend customers’ life-sphere contributing to some of the vital United Nations sustainable development goals (UN SDGs). In this essence, CDSL grasps the impact of customer empowerment (CE) and environmental corporate social responsibility (Env CSR) on customer re-patronage intention (C-RPI) with the mediating and moderating effects in Pakistan’s four- and five-star hotels. Design/methodology/approach: A deductive approach is followed in which an online survey of 400 hotel customers was conducted using purposive and snowball sampling techniques to understand the practice of C-RPI and UN SDGs. Findings: This study reveals that executing the UN SDGs in the hotel industry eventually boosts CE and Env CSR, further enhancing online customer value cocreation (O-CVCC) resulting in C-RPI. Both CE and Env CSR gain a complimentary/partial mediation by O-CVCC on C-RPI is also reported. Moreover, sensation seeking moderates the relationship between CE and O-CVCC. Yet, customer commitment does not moderate the relationship between O-CVCC and C-RPI. Originality/value: This study highlights that C-RPI (i.e. SDG 11) enhances when Env CSR is taken care of (i.e. SDG 13), customers are empowered (i.e. SDG 5 and SDG 17) and cocreated online (i.e. SDG 9). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first studies to empirically test the approaches in the hotel industry contributing to SDG 5, 9, 11, 13 and 17. © 2024, Badar (Imran) Imran, Ajmal Waheed, Arifa Tanveer and Hina Fayyaz.","Customer dominant service logic (CDSL); Customer empowerment (CE); Customer re-patronage intention (C-RPI); Environmental corporate social responsibility (Env CSR); Online customer value cocreation (O-CVCC); United Nations sustainable development goals (UN SDGs)",""

Hence, using terror management theory (TMT) and stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) approach, the authors aims to develop a new model to investigate the effect of crowd-checking technology on shopping anxiety, the perceived value of shopping experience and willingness to pay. Design/methodology/approach: Using a cross-sectional research design and with a help of an independent research company, the authors collected 1,000 valid responses from individuals residing in the UK. Findings: Results showed that crowd-checking technology cues reduce shopping anxiety, improve value perceptions and increase willingness to pay. In addition, the efficacy of technology in reducing shopping anxiety is moderated by customers’ shopping orientation. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first one investigating crowd monitoring systems used at the initial stage of consumers’ journey to show the number of consumers in-store in real-time. It contributes to the literature on technology applications in retailing by providing evidence that technology cues reduce shopping anxiety, which in turn enhances customer-perceived value from the shopping experience and increases the willingness to pay in stores with embedded crowd-checker technology. The study also extends the application of TMT in a new context. © 2023, Davit Marikyan, Eleonora Pantano and Daniele Scarpi.","Consumer behaviour; Crowd-checking technology; Shopping anxiety; Technological cues",""

Likewise, the mediating role of impulsive shopping and shopping intentions is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out with the results of a survey in which 450 respondents participated, and the data was analyzed by using structural equation modeling (SmartPLS 3.0 software). Findings: All the hypothesized links were significant and positive except for the relationship of self-esteem motive with impulsive shopping tendency, which was negative as hypothesized. Moreover, hedonic motive had a strong positive impact on impulsive shopping tendency, whereas, in contrast, utilitarian motive had a strong positive impact on shopping intentions. Practical implications: Managers should focus on functional value rather than emotional value to attract customers who tend to be utilitarian. In contrast, for customers who tend to be hedonic, the product offerings should be visually appealing, stimulating and inspiring, as well as have emotional value. Originality/value: This study investigates the roles of self-esteem and hedonic motives in impulsive shopping behavior. Moreover, by using the theory of planned behavior, this study highlights the roles of hedonic and utilitarian motives in attitude toward engaging in online shopping. © 2022, Indrawati Indrawati, Gadang Ramantoko, Tri Widarmanti, Izzatdin Abdul Aziz and Farhat Ullah Khan.","Hedonic motivations; Online shopping intention; Self-esteem motivation; Shopping behavior; Utilitarian motivation",""

This study aims to develop a comprehensive model explaining customers’ continuance usage of mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating both the pull (positive) factors of mobile payment and the push (negative) factors of cash payment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted on 508 mobile payment users. A quota sampling method was applied to collect the data. Then, the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. This study employed SPSS and LISREL software. Findings: This study reveals that four antecedent factors: favorable attitude toward mobile payment, social influence, facilitating conditions and unfavorable attitude toward cash payment, positively affect the continuance intention to use mobile payment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding also corroborates the effect of continuance intention on the actual use of mobile payment. Practical implications: This research provides valuable insights for formulating business strategies. The results indicate that mobile payment providers should not only consider the positive aspects of mobile payments but also the negative aspects of cash payment when encouraging the continuance usage of mobile payments to customers. Originality/value: This study is among the first to empirically test the effect of unfavorable attitudes toward cash payment on the continuing use of mobile payment.

However, consumer narratives may help cope with the stress associated with such waiting. This study aims to understand consumer waiting behaviours within online communities. Design/methodology/approach: Data was gathered following a netnographic approach from a Facebook brand community (FBC) by downloading and archiving the threads related to members’ waiting behaviours. This resulted in 91 pages of data, with 438 individual comments and 179 distinct threads. Findings: The data revealed that members of the sampled FBC exercised waiting behaviour. The authors confirm that waiting for a product is associated with both negative outcomes (frustration, boredom, etc.), but positive ones (create stronger ties with the brand and fellow members, etc.). Members of the FBC exhibited reduced consumer anxiety and stress during the waiting period. Research limitations/implications: This study found 13 waiting behaviours within the FBC and supports the idea that new value-creating behaviours are noticed within the context of FBCs. Originality/value: This study focuses on waiting within a goods-based context (waiting to be served has been examined predominantly within the service sector). The study explored the behaviours of consumers who use social media to complain about extended waiting periods to receive the product along with other consumer reactions to these waiting crowds to reduce the emotional pain associated with such delays. © 2020, Mahmud Hassan and Rumman Hassan.","Consumer narratives; Facebook; Netnographic approach; Online communities; Waiting time",""

Methodology: The stimulus–organism–behavior–consequence (SOBC) hypothesis is used to explain the mechanisms underpinning the discontinuity between intention and technology usage. A total of 394 questionnaires distributed to smartwatch users were analyzed, using convergent analysis, discriminant analysis and structural modeling. Findings: The IoT’s technical features, such as continuous connectivity and real-time value, serve as effective stimuli for smartwatches, positively influencing individuals’ responses and behavioral consequences associated with smartwatch usage. While IoT risks such as data, performance and financial have no negative relationship with the usefulness of smartwatches, data and financial risks have a negative influence on their ease of use. Additionally, as ease of use and usefulness have a positive impact on intention to use, users’ behavior is positively influenced by their intentions to use a smartwatch. Value: The study applies technology acceptance theory and the SOBC paradigm to smartwatches to determine if users’ intentions to use them impact their behavior. Furthermore, the research analyzed the technical elements of smartwatches in terms of IoT advantages and risks. © 2021, Tahereh Saheb, Francisco J.

Currently, one of the most influential omnichannel behaviors is research shopping in its two predominant forms: webrooming and showrooming. The purpose of this study is to determine the possible moderating effect of each of these behaviors from a cognitive-affective perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed theoretical framework was applied to a sample of 636 mobile phone users. Findings: The results indicated that research shopping moderated the intensity of the relationship between emotions and perceived value and between emotions and satisfaction. The analysis of the moderating effect of each concrete type of research shopping behavior indicated that negative emotions had a more intense negative effect on perceived value and satisfaction in the case of webrooming than in the case of showrooming.

Therefore, companies need to understand the effects of management responses to customer reviews. This study aims to explore whether it is worth responding to reviews and whether expressing gratitude enhances the effects of review responses. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses customer reviews and management response data from a sample of 766 Spanish rural lodging establishments listed on Toprural (www.toprural.com). Analyses are undertaken with NVivo and SmartPLS. Findings: Responding to negative reviews improves lodging establishments’ average ratings, but responding to positive reviews has no significant direct effect. Expressing gratitude in responses positively moderates the effects of review responses; this moderating effect is more significant for responses to negative than to positive reviews.

"How harmful are online firestorms for brands?: An approach to the phenomenon from the participant level","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083462042&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-07-2019-0044&partnerID=40&md5=493442b6d8785707a73e9d15db202961","Purpose: Adopting an exploratory approach, this paper aims to focus on the potential negative consequences that online firestorms (OFs) might have on consumer–brand relationships. Specifically, the authors focus on the individual level through taking a close look at the content that users generate during these attacks. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted content analysis to study four recent brand-related OFs that occurred on Twitter. Findings: The results show that brands are at the core of the users’ conversations, although other actors, such as competing firms, can also be affected. Negative comments greatly exceed positive ones. Actions against the brand, both passive (avoidance) and active (vengeance), emerged during the OFs. Research limitations/implications: The exploratory nature of the study could cast doubt on the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the number of OF analyzed is limited, although they represent an interesting variety of brand misconducts. Practical implications: Nowadays, brands are publicly scrutinized through social networks, as the networks enable users to speak out about brands’ perceived mistakes and wrongdoings. This paper confirms that managers should monitor, understand and try to respond to OFs to minimize their impact. Originality/value: Online firestorms are a recent phenomenon that has gained attention finally, as they can reach hundreds of users in real-time and can involve a huge amount of comments posted online against a brand. These attacks could severely damage the brand, even when there is no strong evidence of the posted content being true. This paper adds to the scarce literature on the topic and analyzes the negative effects for brands. © 2019, Elena Delgado-Ballester, Inés López-López and Alicia Bernal-Palazón.","Avoidance; Brand; Comments valence; Online firestorm; Revenge; User-generated comments",""

The empirical study was performed with information obtained from 125 firms and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Results suggest that the firm perceives benefits from the m-CRM use if it is technologically competitive, shows propensity to innovativeness, manages customers’ information and has employees’ support.

Design/methodology/approach – On evidence drawn from 1,016 consumers of wireless-enabled computing devices (e.g. netbooks and tablets) in Greece, partial least squares method is used to test the validity of the proposed hierarchical model. Findings – Results show that a lovemark measure can be conceptualized as a third-order reflective construct having respect and love as its second-order dimensions. In turn, respect reflects on brand performance, trust and reputation, and love reflects on brand commitment, intimacy and passion. The proposed measure presents a very good external validity as it can explain big portions of variance in consumer responses including repurchase intentions, positive WOM and willingness to pay a price premium. Finally, the proposed measure is used to classify eight well-known devices as products, fads, brands and lovemarks and identify the love styles associated with brand relationships.

Design/methodology/approach: This study combined the data envelopment analysis technique to measure advertising efficiency with multidimensional scaling (MDS) representation, thus offering alternatives for practitioners and organizations on how to evaluate social advertising performance. Findings: Investments on social paid advertising are an affordable and effective way both to promote postgraduate programs and create engagement with prospective students. Facebook advertisements maximize visibility, which improves social and online positioning and encourages student recruitment. Practical implications: Higher education institutions can efficiently promote their programs with a minimal social investment contributing to dissemination and engagement. Compared to other forms of traditional or digital advertising, social media ads can be efficient and affordable with wider segmentation and targeting options. Moreover, results are immediate and measurable and campaigns can be instantly modified to better suit the audience’s requirements. Originality/value: This study is unique as it offers a new, alternative way of measuring efficiency, in addition to the classic ratios of payment models in digital advertising that combine clicks and impressions, on a sector where there are few empirical studies.

An experiment was carried out with 618 participants, who were exposed to advertising of famous brand products or senior brands, and fictitious products with the same brands or junior brands. Participants were then asked to make some purchases with a real budget of US$5. The results show that exposure to junior brands reduces senior brand equity, i.e. results in trademark dilution, mediating a reduction in the purchase of senior brand products. In addition, similarity between junior and senior brands alleviates brand equity dilution, while consumer involvement with the product category of the famous brand has no moderating effect. The study aims to contribute to our understanding of trademark dilution, including the effect on purchase decision – a subject so far unexplored in the empirical literature. Moreover, the study pursues to highlight the importance of protecting well-known trademarks in order to avoid damage occurring not only in consumer perceptions, but also in firm's sales and brand financial value. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Blurring; Brand equity; Purchase decision; Trademark dilution; Well-known trademarks",""

First, it aims to clarify the moderating role of self-esteem (SE) and susceptibility to normative influence (SNI) in the relationship between brand love and brand loyalty. Second, the study proposes modeling the mediation role of brand love and outlining how SE and SNI affect the consumer-brand relationship. Finally, the study explores the impact of brand love on brand loyalty: the moderating role of self-esteem and social influences, as the literature regarding this is still lacking. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via an online survey, which yielded 218 responses. Structural equation modeling was used to predict the research model. Findings: The findings indicate that both SE and SNI mediate the relationship between brand love and brand loyalty. Additionally, consumers love the focal brands positively relates to SE and SNI. In return, SE and SNI lead to brand loyalty. The tight relationship of SE and SNI affects the connection between brand love and brand loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The data has been collected in Vietnam, which creates a limitation regarding the study’s cross-cultural nature and the economic context. Thus, the study should be conducted in different cultures and economies (both developing and developed countries) to enhance the generalizability in consumer-brand relationships. Practical implications: Brand managers should conduct more advertising in brand communities to enhance the influence of SNI and emphasize unique features of the brands, to attract consumers through the overlap of SE. Social implications: The findings can contribute to enhancing unique brand identity and self-motivation will increase consumer loyalty, increasing the revenue of a specific brand. Moreover, as acceptable peers contribute to making purchase decisions, boosting the brand community will maintain current consumers and attract additional potential consumers from the current consumer relationships.

The departments that manage high value-added projects are more susceptible to implementing virtual teams; the area of marketing and market research being one of them. However, the peculiarities of these teams present a real challenge for building trust within the team, with trust being one of the key factors for their success. Accordingly, this study considers various antecedent factors of trust toward leaders of virtual teams grouped in two blocks: the physical attributes (attractiveness) and the behavioral characteristics (justice and empathy) of the leader. Furthermore, the paper discusses how leadership style (transactional or transformational) can moderate the relationships between some of the previously mentioned variables. The results suggest a greater capacity for attractive, empathetic and just leaders to build trust.

The authors make a distinction between omni-channel customers, who make use of distribution services in both channels and omni-channel users, who make partial use of the distribution services of one channel to support purchases in another. This paper aims to identify the omni-channel behavior among the customers of a global fast fashion retailer dealing in a wide range of apparel and clothing accessories. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multinomial logit model, the authors perform a customer segmentation based on observed omni-channel behavior, considering the explanatory roles of demographics, distribution service features and customer service policies across the different retail channels. Findings: The authors observe that the key retail channel features for explaining omni-channel customer behavior are product accessibility, both in store and online; the assurance that goods purchased online will satisfy the customer’s needs and expectations; and the option to return goods found unsatisfactory. Practical implications: The results clearly show that the nature of the visits and purchases made by customers is determined by various components of the companýs customer service policy, which can, therefore, be used to guide the retailer’s segmentation strategy. Originality/value: Future lines of research should explore the economic implications of this customer segmentation.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of demand-based pricing, providing empirical results that reveal the validity of this pricing philosophy in the sport retailing industry. In particular, this study has identified the limits of acceptable prices for the products studied, selected the most appropriate method for pricing products suffering from high competition and compared the impact produced on price perceptions according to different retail environments to be able to relate changes in the acceptable prices ranges according to the geographical location of each point of sale, differentiating between rural or urban environment and type of client. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have carried out surveys of 350 customers in each of the three points of sale analysed. Therefore, there are a total of 1,050 interviewees, for the three products analysed. The direct method of acceptable prices setting is developed. In addition, ANOVA and t-test have been carried out to find differences between the three shops. Findings: One main finding is that the acceptable price range is not unique. Each point of sale has one that is distinct because it depends on many factors: the competition, the economic capacity of the closest residents, the location of the point of sale or the ability to attract customers. Originality/value: The foremost contribution of this paper is to demonstrate empirically how considering the local demand at setting prices would generate larger earnings, even for a small retail chain. The direct method of setting acceptable prices enables us to set the prices according to the demand. The best option is if these prices are above the costs. It can be noted that the prices should be set according to each shop, and a different price used in each point of sale to maximise profits and to adapt to what the typical customer of each shop is willing to pay, despite the products being the same and the points of sale belonging to the same retail chain. © 2019, F.

The structural model was analyzed using SmartPLS 3.2.7. Second, structured in-depth interviews were undertaken with three hotel industry experts to complement the conclusions of the quantitative study. Findings: The results show that when a customer trusts a hotel and identifies with its corporate values, CSR tweets generate CE toward the hotel. CSR communications made by customers reinforce the impact of CSR tweets on customer trust more than CSR tweets posted by hotels. Hotel industry experts give insights to explain these results in different types of hotels.

This can be explained by different models, including the theory of visceral factors and evolutionary psychology. Specifically, evolutionary theory analyses the latest reasons as explanatory variables of this behaviour. An evolutionary perspective was used to perform two experiments where individuals were exposed to pictures containing erotic stimuli. The first experiment, in which both men and women took part, shows that the influence of such stimuli on risk perception is different in the two sexes. The second experiment, in which only women took part, shows that female risk perception varies according to the subject's aims in a relationship. © 2015 ESIC & AEMARK","Consumer behaviour; Discount rate; Evolutionary psychology; Gender differences",""
"Increasing customer loyalty through customer engagement in the retail banking industry","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077199384&doi=10.1108%2fSJME-07-2019-0042&partnerID=40&md5=e1da591be26107e531c48bb415be5055","Purpose: This study aims to determine the main antecedents of customer engagement (market orientation, satisfaction, emotions and self-brand connection) and the relationship between customer engagement and customer loyalty in the retail-banking context. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model of effects is tested using dyadic methodology, based on 225 dyads (bank branch manager–average of five branch customers). The authors use structural equation modelling (EQS 6.1) to test the relationships. Findings: The results reveal a strong relationship between customer engagement and customer loyalty. Satisfaction is the main antecedent of customer engagement. Self-brand connection and emotions during the service also have a significant influence. Finally, branch market orientation has a positive influence on satisfaction and emotions. Research limitations/implications: The first concerns the transversal data used. Geographical context is the second limitation. Third, the study sample only included customers with experience of the financial services of a specific bank (online customers are not included). Finally, the dyads are based on the opinion of the branch manager, on one hand, and an average of five customers per branch, on the other. Practical implications: The combination of the branding strategy at the corporate level and the relationship marketing strategy at branch office level creates a situation in which customer engagement and customer loyalty can thrive. The communication campaigns designed to promote the brand image and associate brand values with the personality of the banks’ current and potential customers help to create an emotional bond that represents a switching cost for the customer. The moments of truth in branch offices are crucial aspects in the retail bank strategy. Originality/value: First, from the conceptual perspective, it establishes a direct relationship between customer engagement and customer loyalty. Second, it empirically tested Pansari and Kumar’s (2017) customer engagement framework, which establishes customer satisfaction and customer emotions as the antecedents of customer engagement. Third, the study took an innovative step in establishing two levels of customer emotions in the retail bank context: emotions generated by corporate branding and emotions that arise during the experience of purchase and consuming. Fourth, the study shows that the market orientation adopted not at the macro corporate level but at the individual branch level is crucial to the generation of positive relational outcomes in the service the customer receives. The fifth contribution is related to the fact that the research streams associated with market orientation and relationship quality have traditionally been studied in isolation. © 2019, Diego Monferrer, Miguel Angel Moliner and Marta Estrada.","Customer engagement; Customer loyalty; Emotions; Market orientation; Retail bank industry; Satisfaction",""

With time, the BPS, most cited work in brand personality, also faced criticism across dimensions. This paper aims to review the popular journals published after 1997 for criticism related to BPS. Design/methodology/approach - Papers using Aaker’s BPS without change/with change are identified and scrutinized for reasons for the usage of BPS. Papers on brand personality that have avoided BPS are also scrutinized for reasons of avoidance. Independent efforts of understanding brand personality without Aaker’s framework are also reviewed. In-depth study of all these papers is done to report the criticism of Aaker’s BPS. Findings - This review identifies the criticism of BPS and classifies it across six categories - definition, dimension, methodology, concept, words and generalizability related criticism. This paper argues that some issues such as definition, conceptual understanding of brand personality and methodology used to develop BPS need further attention of scholars. On the other hand, issues of dimensions, words used and generalizability can be attributed to evident reasons, such as culture andmeaning given to words because of native language. Originality/value - This criticism and interest in Aaker’s BPS are unprecedented. It has been 20 years since BPS was published. Many scholars have countered the Aaker’s BPS through their work; however, a comprehensive review covering all criticisms and issues of BPS is still missing in literature.

In addition, the study attempts to determine if there is a significant link between the online hotel experience and the subsequent offline hotel stay experience. Desing/methodology/approach - A self-report survey was conducted in a series of four-star hotels in Granada city. The questionnaire was focused on measuring online experience, offline experience and brand equity. For the analysis of the data, a structural equations model was developed. Findings - The results suggest that the experience during the hotel stay, contrary to that of the online purchase process, has an influence on hotel brand equity. Nonetheless, the online experience has a significant impact on the hotel stay experience. Practical implications - This study is of particular utility for hotel management given that, although it is a sector that for several years has integrated experiential marketing in its service strategy, there is little research analyzing the impact of such actions on the variables that are of interest to the hotel.

Nowadays, companies are making efforts to build their brands through storytelling. After reviewing the concept of story and some of the impacts that arise from storytelling, this exploratory research analyses the use of this practice by Spanish companies from six different sectors. Content analysis is applied to identify differences among companies that use or do not use storytelling, and the characteristics and elements used in 104 stories from 247 websites are analyzed.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through an online survey of 416 hotel customers. The proposed model was tested with structural equations modelling (SEM). Findings: The results suggest that brand experience in the hotel sector is a consequence of four dimensions: location, ambience, staff and Web, in that order of influence. In addition, the study confirms the mediating role of emotional attachment in the relationship between experience and WOM recommendations. However, the experience itself has a greater direct impact than the attachment.

In this context, the study aims to determine whether different user groups exist in this market and profile them. Methodology: Based on the information of 568 mobile service users, a research was developed in the context of a mature mobile services market – Spain. A behavior-based cluster analysis is developed by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), followed by two-step clustering. Then, an ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests are conducted to confirm differences among the obtained clusters. Findings: The study findings show that mobile service users cannot be perceived as a homogenous group, as different users with different behaviors coexist in this market. More specifically, four behavior-based segments emerge in the mobile service sector: “service connoisseurs,” “uninvolved pragmatics,” “potential switchers” and “delighted loyal”; “potential switchers” being the most challenging segment for mobile service companies. Value: This study reports mobile service users’ heterogeneity; and in turn, mobile service managers should consider customers as four different types, instead of considering them as one single customer. © 2020, Cristina Calvo-Porral and Luis-Miguel Otero-Prada.","Behavior; Cluster analysis; Cluster analysis; Mobile services; Users",""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the introduction of new research topics over 10-year intervals from 1960 to the present. These provide the basic body of knowledge that drives the field at the present time. Findings: While researchers have always borrowed techniques, they have refined them to make them applicable to marketing problems. Moreover, the field has always responded to new developments in technology, such as more powerful computers, scanners and scanner data, and the internet with a flurry of research that applies the technologies. Research limitations/implications: Marketing will adapt to changes brought on by the internet, increased computer power and big data. While the field faces competition for other disciplines, its established body of knowledge about solving marketing problems gives it a unique advantage.

It helps to understand which should be chosen depending on the target audience of the campaign. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines advertising effectiveness in these social media in terms of ad attitude, ad intrusiveness and loyalty intentions. An online survey was conducted with 303 social media users. Age and gender are proposed as moderators. Findings: The results indicate that Instagram Stories not only enhances consumer attitude toward ads but also increases perceived intrusiveness, compared to Facebook Wall. Millennials are more disturbed by Facebook Wall ads than non-millennial users. A triple interaction effect reveals that non-millennial men are more loyal toward Facebook Wall ads, whereas millennials of both genders and non-millennial women are more loyal to ads on Instagram Stories. Practical implications: Advertisers should be aware of the differential features and segmentation possibilities in social media to better address their target audiences. More precisely, the research findings suggest that professionals should focus on Instagram Stories when targeting millennials and non-millennial women, and on Facebook Wall when targeting non-millennial men. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to contribute to the literature on Instagram Stories as an advertising platform and compare its differential features with those of more established social media, such as Facebook Wall. © 2019, Daniel Belanche, Isabel Cenjor and Alfredo Pérez Rueda.","Ad effectiveness; Attitude toward the ad; Facebook; Instagram Stories; Intrusiveness; Loyalty",""

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 4,992 household shoppers living in Hong Kong, Germany, Norway, Spain and the UK. The questionnaire was distributed using a third-party consumer panel, and the fieldwork was conducted using computer-assisted Web interviewing. The approach was based on confirmatory factor analysis and measurement of invariance, as well as format analysis using a wording-syntactic and semantic descriptive method. Findings: The scale reflects an attitude-toward-object model approach. Its use has been heavily varied (in terms of wording, item semantics and the attributes to be measured). A two-factor structure that meets the metric conditions (reliability and validity) is found. However, the analysis of invariance shows that the scale behaves differently in different countries. Research limitations/implications: This scale offers a good starting point for measuring attitudes toward organic products. However, it requires refinement to adapt to consumer evolution and improve its metric validity. Verification of its applicability in cross-national studies is recommended. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that assesses the format and quantitative characteristics of this scale on a cross-national level. For scholars and companies with international interests, preventing the use of scales with poor properties at the transnational level can improve the design of future studies and save money through a more informed choice of attitudinal scale. © 2020, Francisco Sarabia-Andreu, Francisco J.

Design/methodology/approach: Given the existing literature on brand, multiple stages of studies were conducted as a part of the scale development process. The OFBR scale was validated by a step-by-step process following the scale validation methodology suggested in the specialised literature. Findings: The results demonstrate the 25 items of five unique factors that form the OFBR construct and confirm the strong validity of the construct. This finding suggests that the five-dimensional approach (online brand familiarity, online visual simplicity, online aesthetic attraction, online brand emotion and online social reputation) plays important role to form OFBR. Practical implications: A valid and reliable OFBR scale provides a foundation for broadening the understanding on the important constructs that form OFBR, which is essential for online fashion retailing. Knowledge of the crucial antecedents that influence consumers towards online fashion products can enhance marketers’ capability to position their brands towards their target markets. Originality/value: The relevance of this study lies in validating the scale for measuring OFBR for the first time in the literature on online fashion brand. © 2020, Muhammad Sabbir Rahman, Md Afnan Hossain, Md Rifayat Islam Rushan, Mohammad Tayeenul Hoque and Hasliza Hassan.","Brand; Fashion; Online brand recognition; Online fashion retail store; Online fashion retailing; Scale development",""

Design/methodology/approach: The data are based on 475 telephone surveys conducted among Spanish hairdressers. The authors have used ordinary least squares to estimate the empirical model. Findings: Pricing, services and communication (Web page and in-store communication) are the main drivers of customer loyalty. SMEs have to be cautious with the use of social networks to avoid damaging loyalty. In addition, those positioned at high-price segments should pay more attention to communication on the Web, and all companies should find a balance between in-store communication and the sale of products for use at home. Research limitations/implications: Further research should try to replicate the findings with data from consumers and firms. Practical implications: Service managers need to understand the optimal strategy to succeed in the market. The key insights of this study could also apply to other sectors, such as health, personal care and wellness services. Originality/value: Previous research focussed mainly on large companies, while the role of loyalty in the success of SMEs has been poorly studied, with focus only on the antecedents and the measurement of loyalty.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducted an analysis of a real case using descriptive statistical and regression techniques. Findings: The present study proposes the use of the so-called “sequential mixed-modes” in survey-based market research. This technique is based on the successive application of different information collection techniques (face-to-face, telephone and internet-based surveys); it offers four fundamental advantages: increased coverage rate; higher response rate; lower costs; and greater cooperation. Research limitations/implications: In addition to the normal limitations associated with conclusions derived from case studies, the data collection was carried out in only one autonomous community (Spain) and focussed only on one theme. Practical implications: Firstly, it was found that data collection through mixed sequential modes substantially increases response rates in online surveys. This is particularly important as, in recent years, data collection through the internet has become almost standard market research practice. Secondly, the sample that resulted from the joint use of the three data collection modes more accurately reflected the distinctive features of the universe under study. A third recommendation is that the use of internet-based self-administered surveys is especially promising with individuals with a higher level of education and among students. Originality/value: The decrease in the response rate is one of the greatest challenges of survey-based market research, given its impact on sample representativeness. This paper addresses this problem and exposes the advantages of the sequential use of mixed modes in the collection of information. © 2020, Miguel Blasco and Vidal Díaz de Rada.","Face-to-face surveys; Online surveys; Self-administered surveys; Sequential mixed-modes; Telephone surveys",""

Findings - The results evidence the presence of differences in the behavior of hotel chains relative to certification depending on their size, market segment, customer origin and the geographical concentration of their establishments. Originality/value - This research deepens in how the hotel chain characteristics affect the effectiveness of a quality certification. The consideration of two stages in investment decisions allows the authors to identify differences in the ex ante and ex post decision processes.

First is to explore the role of some customer personality traits in explaining customer satisfaction in mobile services. Second is to explore the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty of mobile services customers, mediated by attitude-to-brand considering the fierce competition and the fast industry growth. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a cross-sectional design and a survey of mobile service customers. For the empirical analysis, the structural equation models were applied (partial least squares). Findings: The results suggest that customers who are agreeable, neurotic and open to new experience are more likely to be satisfied with mobile services than other personality types. In addition, the satisfaction-loyalty link is fully mediated by attitude-to-brand. Hence, satisfaction is not a direct driver of loyalty in the mobile services business and loyalty is achieved when service providers simultaneously focussed on the customers’ satisfaction and their attitudes towards brands. Practical implications: The study identified the personality trait drivers of customer satisfaction and the path to customer loyalty in the mobile services sector. With this information, mobile service providers should be better able to target and retain customers. Originality/value: The study offers new insights into customer behaviour by using personality traits to identify requirements for achieving customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and attitude-to-brand. © 2020, Trevor Alexander Smith.","Attitude to brand; Attitude-to-brand; Customer loyalty; Customer personality; Customer satisfaction; Mobile services",""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper therefore defines a model relating brand beliefs (brand quality, brand image, brand familiarity and brand as a social signalling value), brand attitudes and brand purchase intentions. The model is then tested with a sample of different categories/types of consumer brands (local, global and glocal). The influence of the type of brand on these relationships is then analysed. Findings: The findings suggest that brand quality is the most important driver of brand attitude for any type of brand, and that the relationship between brand quality and brand attitude, as well as between brand attitude and brand purchase intention, is weaker for a glocal brand than for a local or global brand.

For this purpose, a proposed model is adapted to the field of study, integrating different models and theories. These theories have achieved broad support in the literature. With a sample of 333 consumers, we can conclude that consumer attitudes towards functional foods have a direct influence on the willingness to consume them. A healthy lifestyle has no effect on these attitudes, but lifestyle influences the willingness to use functional foods in a negative manner. We can also determine that certain motivators and barriers positively influence the healthy lifestyle.

Most of these studies have resulted in a better understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of the concept, as well as in the identification of some of its antecedents (consumer aspects and personality traits). However, in order to explain how brand love is created, this study focuses on anthropomorphism as a potential antecedent of brand love. Based on the interpersonal theory of love and self-expansion theory, our study tries to shed more light on the process under which brand love is built by focusing on self-brand integration as a key element in that process, and proposing anthropomorphism as the mechanism that helps that integration. Findings from the empirical study conducted amongst a sample of 256 individuals demonstrate that brand love is built, not only through the integration of the anthropomorphised brand, but also that anthropomorphism exerts a direct effect on brand love. The moderating effect of brand attitude is also analyzed. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Anthropomorphism; Brand love; Self-brand integration",""

The relationships among store image, familiarity with PLBs, consumers’ perceptions of PLB quality, risk, price consciousness and attitude towards PLBs are examined. Finally, the relationship between attitude towards, and willingness to buy PLB is explored. Design/methodology/approach – Self-administered questionnaire was distributed to shoppers at Carrefour operating in Cairo, Egypt. The data obtained from 265 respondents were examined using structural equation modelling (analysis of moment structures) version 22, which empirically test the hypothesised relations established in the research conceptual model. Findings – With the exception of perceived risk, the results suggest that all consumers’ perceptual and attitudinal factors affect directly or indirectly consumers’ willingness to buy PLB. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to international hypermarket/supermarket operating in Egypt. So the findings should be exercised with cautious while attempting to generalise the research results. Practical implications – Retail managers should focus on the enhancement of both store image and familiarity with PLBs to leverage consumers’ perceptions with respect to PLBs quality and risk to achieve differentiation and to increase sales. Originality/value – This is one of the few studies that investigate the role of familiarity with PLBs in a developing context. In doing so, it proposes that familiarity with PLBs directly affects consumers’ perceived quality and perceived risk, while it indirectly influences consumers’ willingness to buy PLBs. © Rasha H.A.

In particular, the impact of the media and groups is analysed through their influence on subjective norms. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modelling analysis of moment structures was used to propose and test a research model by means of data from a substantial size of female Generation Y consumers. Findings: The study’s results confirm that female Generation Y consumers have a favourable attitude towards beauty products and that this attitude is influenced by their subjective norms. Furthermore, the findings suggest that group influence, which includes the opinions of friends, family and peers and media influence both predict female Generation Y consumers’ favourable attitude towards beauty products via their influence on this segment’s subjective norms. Practical implications: These results emphasise the strategic importance of incorporating subjective norms, together with media and group influence into beauty product marketing communication campaigns targeting female Generation Y consumers. Given that this generation is known to be prevalent users of social media and often consult online peer product reviews, such strategies should also be extended beyond traditional media platforms to include social media, particularly social media influencers and online product review platforms, thereby tapping into subjective norms and group influence.

This study focuses on the brand personality of a political leader from the BJP Party brand (Bharatiya Janta Party). The development of a strong political brand personality is crucial for success at the polls. Little research has been dedicated to this phenomenon particularly beyond Western political and post-election contexts. Design/methodology/approach – The scope and development of the study required a qualitative approach. The theoretical frameworks of the study acted as the deductive base of the study. The insights of the respondents were the inductive base of the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with external stakeholders [voters]. In addition, semi-structured interviews were also adopted to capture the branding activities used by internal stakeholders [BJP]. Findings – The brand personality dimensions such as sincerity; agreeableness, competence, energy, openness, conscientiousness and emotional stability were clearly associated with a political leader. Negative qualities such as dictatorial attitudes and arrogance affected the political leader’s brand personality. Religious partisanship was another strong negative trait affecting the brand personality of the political leader. Originality/value – The study has an actionable framework for political brand personality in the post-election context. It offers negative qualities to be avoided in the development of the political brand personality of the leader.

Because of this, advertising practice is encouraging gender discrimination in disregard of objective criteria. This paper analyzes the effects of spokesperson gender and vocal pitch and their interaction, as well as the effect of listener gender on effectiveness in relation to a radio spot for a non-gendered product (blood donation). We conducted a 2 (male–female voices) × 2 (low-high vocal pitches) × 2 (male–female listeners) experimental design via 4 radio programs in which we inserted a radio spot in a commercial block. A sample of 987 Spanish radio listeners was used. Our findings contrast with the existing practice in advertising of preferring male voices, highlighting the need for objective criteria in the selection of voices. In fact, the results shows that vocal pitch has a direct effect which is more significant than gender in terms of unaided recall. Additionally, the results of the interaction effect between spokesperson gender and vocal pitch reinforce the use of female voices, as low-pitched female voices are precisely the ones that generate more favorable attitudes toward the ad and the brand. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Advertising effectiveness; Listener gender; Radio; Spokesperson gender; Spokesperson vocal-pitch",""

In addition, account following and product involvement are examined as possible moderators in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from online participants. The participants were Instagram users who already knew a popular influencer on the platform. The experimental design manipulated the types of picture posted by the influencer to observe customers’ reactions in terms of intention to interact with the influencer’s account and to look for further information about promoted products. Findings: The authors’ findings suggested that influencer–product matches in posts on Instagram encourage users to search for information about promoted products but do not affect their intention to interact with influencers’ accounts. Nevertheless, customers’ reactions toward an influencer’s posts differ based on whether they are followers of the influencer and whether they are highly or lowly involved with the promoted product. Practical implications: Both brands and influencers should properly manage influencer marketing actions. Brands should control influencers’ audiences and their involvement with featured products so that they are seen to promote them in a natural way. Influencers should endorse branded products that fit their own style; this will increase the interaction on their accounts.

This paper aims to address the consequences of excessive use of Instagram on the negative feeling of losing information when not connected and the emotional fatigue resulting from an overcharge with new information. The mediating role of addiction between Instagram overuse and the two outcomes is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 342 active Instagram users were used to test the proposed model, applying the partial least square equation modeling method (SmartPLS 3). Findings: Addiction partially mediates the impact of overuse on emotional fatigue and instastress. Addiction to Instagram was mainly due to respondents’ lack of control over the time spent on it resulting in incapability to reduce its usage. Social implications: Social networking site managers, educators, families and public institutions should promote an adequate use of Instagram, making users (especially the young) aware of the potential threats of its excessive usage. The control on the amount of time devoted to Instagram is a key factor for detaining overuse and addiction, as well as avoiding the negative outcomes analyzed in this research.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed an experiment based on an online survey to test the hypotheses formulated. The model’s causal relationships are established using structural equations. Findings - The image of stores that only offer their own brand is mainly configured by price consciousness and the attitude toward the private label. The private label purchase intention is strongly influenced by the store image and a favorable attitude toward the brand, and loyalty strategies should be aimed at securing a clear perception of providing real value. Practical implications - For retailers who only offer their own brands, an assortment with pricecompetitive PLs is key to the strategy of differentiating them from other retailers. It is reasonable to assume that, if retailers have a favorable image, customers transfer this brand value to their PLs and trust them. Customer loyalty strategies of these retailers should be aimed at ensuring that consumers clearly perceive that their assortment provides real value and that, although it is limited in terms of number of brands, it can meet all their needs. Originality/value - This research represents a significant contribution to brand management literature because, includes, together with loyalty to the store, its image and the PL purchase intention as consumer response variables.

This paper aims to examine the influence of relationship quality on rural destination loyalty, approaching this through the variables of trust, attachment and satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative methodology based on an on line survey conducted in Spain. The sample consisted of 464 tourists who participate in rural tourism. The analysis of the proposed model was carried out based on the partial least squares method. Findings: The results confirm that the model has a substantial to moderate explanatory capacity for overall satisfaction and loyalty, in which overall satisfaction acts as a mediator between the variables that make up relationship quality in reference to loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this research arise from the scarcity of works which aim to understand relationship quality in tourism destinations. To broaden results, it should be applied in other tourism destinations, products, services and experiences. Practical implications: Destination managers should give relationships a special role in their tourism development programmes in rural tourism contexts. Social implications: Rural tourism destinations and companies are generally small-sized organisations that need managerial tools. These can benefit from developing sustainable relationships.

An example of online curation includes organizing themed collections of product images on Pinterest. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework of online consumer curation, introducing this topic to the marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach: Through the analysis of the business and academic literature, as well as a careful study of many examples of online consumer curation, the authors present a framework for understanding online consumer curation. Findings: The actions taken by online consumer curators are similar to those of museum or art gallery curators: acquiring, selecting, organizing and displaying content for an audience. The motivations for consumers to engage in online curation include building/displaying their identities and making social connections with their online audience. One outcome possible for the audience that views the curation is gaining access to carefully selected and recommended content. Research limitations/implications: As online consumer curation is a new area of research, the authors suggest several marketing- and brand-relevant propositions that can be addressed in future research.

This experience is a fundamental starting point from which to develop marketing learning processes that flow naturally. Thus, it is necessary to examine the components that determine the individual’s experience and to explore consequences such as collaborative learning and marketing learning performance. Design/methodology/approach: To conceptualise the individual’s experience, this study focuses on her/his state of cognitive absorption (CA) and establishes a second-order formative structure made up of five components: heightened enjoyment, curiosity, control, temporal dissociation and focused immersion. The model is estimated with partial least squares modelling, using SmartPLS 2.0 software. Findings: The results confirm the significant weights of the components, with the exception of focused immersion, and support the influence of overall CA on the proposed outcomes. They also confirm that collaborative learning exerts a positive influence on the individual’s performance. Originality/value: This study makes three contributions. First, it holistically examines the individual’s experience during marketing learning and the importance of its constituent components. Second, it establishes what the consequences of the marketing learning experience are, taking into account both social and individual factors, that is, collaborative learning and individual performance. Third, Pinterest is proposed as a social network with great potential in marketing learning. It is a well-known network which includes very interesting features for learning contexts. Nevertheless, it has been little studied in research. © 2019, Miguel Guinaliu-Blasco, Blanca Hernández-Ortega and José L.

As such, this study serves to enhance existing insight into customer relationship management dynamics, with a particular focus on hospitality brands. Design/methodology/approach – The present study develops a theoretical framework that is empirically investigated by using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling analyses. Data were collected by using a self-administered questionnaire of 340 customers of four-and five-star hotel brands in India. Findings – The results suggest value congruity as an important driver of CBI, affective commitment and CBE within hospitality brands. The results also reveal CBI to act as a significant predictor of affective commitment, CBE and brand loyalty. Furthermore, affective commitment and CBE are the significant drivers of loyalty to hospitality brands. Research limitations/implications – The research is exploratory in nature and is restricted to four-and five-star hotel customers, thereby reflecting important limitations of this study. Given these issues, ample opportunities exist for further research to further explore and/or validate the reported findings. Practical implications – The current research provides new insights for marketing practitioners planning or implementing long-term customer relationship management strategi3es that centre on customer– brand identification, customer–brand engagement and brand loyalty.

Convenient sampling was employed to collect data through an online questionnaire from 335 adult customers of apparel brands Kaymu and Daraz. Utilitarian and hedonic attributes are utilized; reflecting higher order constructs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) via AMOS 21 was used. Modified S-O-R model explained considerable variation in online retailing. The study showed that consumers’ perception of utilitarian attributes and hedonic attributes are significant and positive predictors of cognitive and affective attitude. Similarly, cognitive and affective attitudes are significant and positive predictors of consumers purchase intentions. Researchers can use S-O-R model to better explain online purchase intentions. It was further concluded that online retailers should not only put a heavy emphasis onto utilitarian attributes but also take hedonic attributes in consideration while formulating online retail strategy. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Cognitive and affective attitude; Hedonic attribute; Online shopping; S-0-R Model; Utilitarian attributes",""

Nowadays, users can interact with companies and with other users; hence, it is considered important to study how social stimuli affect users. Drawing on the Stimulus Organism Response framework and Flow Theory, this paper aims to propose that the social stimulus (sPassion) has a positive effect on the organism (state of flow) causing positive responses from users (flow consciousness, trust and eLoyalty). Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected through an online survey. The sample consists of 771 users of social commerce websites, of which 51 per cent are male and 49 per cent female, aged between 16 and 80 years. The structural equation model statistical software EQS 6 was used to test the model. Findings - The empirical results confirm that passionate users are prone to experience state of flow, and, as a consequence, they are conscious of this optimal experience, resulting in an increase in trust. Originality/value - The originality of this research stems from analysing how users’ passion on social commerce creates an optimal experience that boost customers’ retention. © Carolina Herrando, Julio Jimenez-Martinez and M.","Customer retention; Flow theory; Social commerce; SOR model; sPassion",""

In these exchange systems members may adopt different roles as producers or as consumers of products and services. Furthermore, the participation in such systems may aim to achieve utilitarian or political and social goals. In this paper we focus on a particular type of consumer-to-consumer exchange system, timebanking. We posit that goals influence different forms of participation in these networks: political and social goals drive membership but economic goals lead to exchanges. We find confirmation for this assumption in a dataset of 255 self-administered questionnaires to members of Spanish timebanks. In particular, our contribution lies on further understanding the nature and intensity of members’ participation in consumer-to-consumer exchange systems, such as timebanking, in relation to the goals they set. We conclude that to better understand consumer-to-consumer exchange networks it is essential to, first, unbundle the membership from the carried-out transactions, and second, to separate the two roles that members perform in consumer-to-consumer markets as the goals attached to these may vary. Political goals may drive membership but not transactions. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Consumer-to-consumer exchanges; Exchange systems; Participation; Timebanks, goals",""

The online and offline channels are compared to determine which is perceived as leading to more impulsive buying. Design/methodology/approach - As the result of the literature review, three research questions are proposed and examined through an online self-administered survey with 212 valid responses. Findings - Results show that the offline channel is slightly more encouraging of impulse buying than the online channel; factors that encourage online impulse buying explain this behaviour to a greater extent than do discouraging factors; social networks can have a big impact on impulse buying. Research limitations/implications - Findings are limited by the sampling plan, the sample size and the measurement of some of the variables; only one product type is analysed. Further research is needed to confirm that shipping-refund costs and delayed gratification (traditionally, discouraging factors of online buying) encourage online impulse buying; clarify contradictory results regarding the role of online privacy and convenience. This research contributes to the validation of a scale to measure the influence of social media on impulse buying behaviour. Practical implications - Offline companies can trigger the buying impulse to a greater extent than online retailers. Managers must carefully select social networks to encourage impulse buying, Facebook and Instagram being the most influential; Twitter has the least impact. Originality/value - This study compares the impulse buying phenomenon in both the physical store and the internet. Moreover, the influence of social networks on impulse buying is also explored. © Laura Aragoncillo and Carlos Orús.","Impulse buying; Internet; Motivators; Physical store; Social networks",""

Design/methodology/approach - A structural equations model is carried out with a representative sample of 411 tourists from Tenerife (Canary Islands). Findings - Cultural sensitivity directly and positively influences the gap in the global image of the destination, so greater cultural sensitivity improves the post-visit image compared to the pre-visit image at a global level. Likewise, there are significant differences in cultural sensitivity according to the sociodemographic characteristics of tourists. Research limitations - Although this study is based on a single case (Tenerife) and the generalisation of the results must be treated tentatively, the developed model could be applied in other destinations. Practical implications - This study contributes to a better understanding of the influence of cultural sensitivity on the image gap in tourist destinations, as there is still little empirical evidence on the subject. Originality/value - The results of this study represent an advance in the literature, as there are few studies in the tourismmarketing literature that studied the effect of the cultural sensitivity on the image of a tourist destination. © Asunción Beerli-Palacio and Josefa D.

The proposed model considers the parents’ levels of regional identity and regional ethnocentrism as potential antecedents of ethnocentrism among their children. The results are based on 195 triads consisting of young consumers and their parents. The findings show that despite low levels of ethnocentrism among youth, parental influence is significant and greater than the effect of other variables. The exploratory analysis presented here supports the assumption that consumer ethnocentrism is a general tendency acquired during childhood through the process of socialization. © 2016 ESIC & AEMARK","Local products; Parental influence; Reference groups; Regional consumer ethnocentrism; Regional identity",""

To do this, an empirical study was conducted with two samples of consumers who were shown an advertisement about a socially responsible activity inserted in either a newspaper or a social network. The data were collected using a personal survey conducted with 623 consumers in Spain and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that the CSR perceived by the consumer changes depending on the medium used to communicate the socially responsible activity. If the socially responsible activity is communicated in a newspaper, the company-cause congruence influences CSR both directly and indirectly through corporate credibility. However, when communicated on a social network, the relationship is only indirect. In addition, the relationship between corporate credibility and CSR is more intense in the social network than in the newspaper. Moreover, there is corroboration of the influence of the company-cause congruence on perceived corporate ability in both the newspaper and the social network, with no significant difference noted between them. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK","Company-cause congruence; Corporate ability; Corporate communication; Credibility; CSR; Retail",""

"A Gender-Based Comparative Evaluation of O2O Food Delivery Characteristics: A Requirements Prioritization Approach","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146459400&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2023%2fv53%2fi1%2f172593&partnerID=40&md5=cc4722ad4f679df06d34a0b303d837ab","This article intended to assess enablers and deterrents to online-to-offline (O2O) food delivery (OFD) use from users’ and non-users’ perspectives at the sub-dimension level. The study aimed to parallelly evaluate these sub-dimensions for both genders and provide a self-comparison of preferences. An online survey was conducted to obtain users’ preferences. Two hundred valid responses were analyzed using the simple ranking method of the requirements prioritization approach for ordinal data analysis. The findings revealed that females required comprehensive product details, ease of interface use, convenience in transactions, and overall hygiene at all stages. Privacy violation was reported as the most significant risk perceived by females. Male OFD users asked for safe food packaging and a good delivery experience but perceived the product performance failure as a severe risk. The inability to access food quality online was the top reason to avoid OFD use. The findings will help OFD operators and food-tech start-ups improve their operations by addressing specific issues. The article is unique as it followed an approach different from just establishing linear relations by analyzing ordinal data using the requirements prioritization technique. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

"Perceiving the Consumer's Desire and Transforming it into a Business Model: A Case Study of Morning Fresh, India's No. 1 Hangover Cure & Detox Drink","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139259585&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2022%2fv52%2fi9%2f171983&partnerID=40&md5=e261474192f22668e9fc1a0569c716ca","An increasing number of Indians are drinking alcohol, but the latest study (""Alcohol Consumption in India,"" 2022) shows that the country is experiencing a rise in smart drinking, limiting consumption within limits, and only on social occasions. The study conducted across three North Indian states found that there is now an increase in the number of people who drink at casual get-togethers, festivals, or social occasions; 54% of the respondents said that they drank at such events, while 44% admitted to responsibly following rules and regulations regarding alcohol consumption. According to recent research, the burden of alcohol in India costs the economy more than the Indian government's whole health budget (Jyani et al., 2019). According to the findings of a study that was just recently published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, the economic loss that can be attributed to the negative effects of alcohol consumption accounts for approximately 1.45 percentage points of the total gross domestic product when tax receipts from the sale of alcohol are taken into account (GDP). To put this into perspective, the yearly expenditures of the government on health amount to around 1.1% of the GDP. According to the researchers' projections, the whole social and economic cost of alcohol-related health disorders in 2050 would be more than the entire gross domestic product of India in 2018, which was INR 219.5 trillion. This development places one company at an advantage in further promoting responsible drinking among liquor drinkers. Looking at such a number of consumers with the social and health impact, the owner of Healthline Private Limited foresaw an opportunity not only to start an exponential revenue-generating product, but also to ameliorate the health problems in youngsters, thereby also limiting their habits' ill effects on the society. The CEO of the company had a background of the F&B sector and was skilled in creative leadership, product innovation, and business development. This case examined how Healthline's owners transformed an opportunity into a successful business model by introducing the most innovative and acceptable product, ""Morning Fresh,"" and underlined how crucial it is to understand customer desires. The case also emphasized the marketing strategies employed to capture the maximum possible market cap. I took the data from secondary sources and published resources (from 2014 to 2021) to analyze the complete case from different perspectives. I also explored how a consumer's immediate needs and desires can be transformed into a successful business. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Therefore, the focus was to study the relative influence of different media on political attitude and political participation. A cross-sectional descriptive research design having a sample of 497 eligible voters was used. OLS regression analysis was used, and it was observed that media use for political information was a significant influencer for political participation, followed by political attitude, political knowledge, interest, and efficacy. Among all, social media was found to have a relatively higher significant positive influence, but traditional media cannot be ignored. The study results will contribute to the conceptualization of media behavior while considering multiple media for political information. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Though there are many studies in the destination branding literature, the evidence regarding the personality traits is still at the stage of progression, and approaches referring to multifaceted personality traits are unseen. After the pilot testing, a structured questionnaire was floated to 400 tourists who visited the selected destinations – a district in Tamil Nadu, India, between June 2019 and February 2020, where 327 responses were finalized. The questionnaire had statements measuring the destination’s personality traits and other questions on tourists’ characteristics. Combined mean calculation and multivariate results revealed that two personality traits, welcoming and friendly, were emphasized by the tourists and perceived in common. Also, personality traits such as spiritual and charming were found to be commonly perceived. The mean values also indicated the existence of multifaceted destination personality traits – some inherent and some perceived. Marketers and others thereof have been recommended on the branding and advertising strategies based on the outcome of this communication.

Convenience foods such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook products are the outcome of this shift from hunter-gatherers to convenience-seeking customers. The present study aimed at segmenting the convenience food market, particularly ready-to-cook food, based on food-related lifestyles. A segmentation study based on cluster analysis was applied to 16 identified food-related lifestyle factors resulting in four convenience food lifestyle segments – adventurous consumers (38.6%), uninvolved consumers (28.60%), relaxed consumers (25.23%), and convenience seekers (7.67%). In particular, convenience seekers and adventurous consumers can be treated as a target market for convenience food in India.

Therefore, this study examined the factors influencing electric car adoption behavior among Indian car users. Methodology: Both exploratory and descriptive approaches were used to accomplish the stated objectives. The study was conducted in two phases. In phase one, a sample including 200 prospective electric car buyers was approached to understand the critical factors leading to adoption. In phase two, conjoint analysis was used to decipher the utilities drawn by 300 consumers from nine combinations of price, recharge time, and driving range as attributes selected after reviewing literature and an unstructured interaction with potential electric car buyers. Findings: The study indicated the three preferred combinations Indian consumers value the most when selecting an electric car. Practical Implications: Results could offer crucial information to decision-makers and producers of electric vehicles so they could introduce this cutting-edge technology into the Indian economy. The findings of this study, particularly the conjoint analysis, could be used by manufacturers to determine the relative relevance of features that increase utility.

The founders thoroughly analyzed the EV industry and tried to ascertain whether they could produce battery packs specifically for the EV market. Since battery connectors were essential to a car’s operation, Ather’s team created tiny, portable charging connectors and was granted a patent. Because charging outlets were hard to come by and long-distance travel caused anxiety for customers, the company opted to concentrate on long-range battery life. Ather had to move quickly as rivals began to join the market with less expensive imports. Battery pack fire accidents exacerbated the issue. The case examined Ather’s team’s efforts to create and sell an electric car from the ground up, leveraging their retail background to increase sales despite several obstacles. Practical Implications: The case discussed the three main strategic decisions that startups must make: whether to “build versus buy” while maintaining quality, whether to focus on the customer experience as the best form of retail, and whether to focus on customers for the rest of their lives to foster loyalty and steady revenue streams.

Previous studies have examined the factors affecting electronic shopping adoption using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) in various countries. But in Nigeria, there are either very few or none at all. This study evaluated the UTAUT2 model and added two new elements to close this gap. Methodology: The study was descriptive and cross-sectional, and a purposive sampling approach was used to select a sample of 477 online shoppers. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data, and partial least squares (PLS) were used to analyze the data. Findings: The results of this study showed that the most important variables impacting behavioral intention were effort expectancy, enabling situations, hedonic incentive, habit, trust, and technology awareness. Price, social impact, and performance expectations, however, were not much valued. User behavior was influenced by trust and behavioral intention but not by enabling circumstances, habit, or technological knowledge. Practical Implications: The findings of this study have important ramifications for future researchers, retailers, marketing managers, and legislators. Originality: This experiment is distinctive since it is the first to incorporate technology awareness and trust into the UTAUT2 model in the context of online buying.

Predictions for beacons are optimistic; despite this fact, it is important to measure customers’ readiness and acceptance of this technology, as the failure rate of new product innovation is very high. Methodology: This study merged the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the technology readiness (TR) model for beacon technology. A total of five exogenous variables influenced five endogenous variables in this study. The five exogenous variables are optimism, innovativeness, insecurity, discomfort, and perceived risk. The endogenous variables are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, intention to use, actual use, and perceived enjoyment. A questionnaire was used to collect the data, and analysis was performed with 404 samples on AMOS-26. Findings: Significant findings of this study revealed that technology readiness led to perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness of using beacon equipment. Intention to use influenced the actual use of beacon technology, while perceived risk showed a negative influence on it. Practical Implications: This study addressed an important gap in the field of beacon technology and proximity marketing. This report would help retail managers develop strategies for beacon technology and its implications. They could work on areas such as risk, generating value propositions through beacon technology, and projecting using beacon technology as a fun activity. Originality: The findings of this study provide managerial insights for retailers operating in South Asian countries and would allow them to build more effective retail strategies to achieve widespread adoption of location-based retail applications. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Due to this, businesses are on the lookout for newer procedures that are practical both now and in the future. The utilization of digital and social media for marketing forms a subset of such practices that are contemporary yet pervasive. In fact, Whatsapp and Facebook have become the spearhead platforms for information dissemination, relationship building, and transaction handling for businesses around the globe. While considerable research provides insights into the adoption and acceptance of web technologies in different sectors, studies investigating the role of social media in developing dynamic capabilities for agribusinesses are scarce. Data inputs were drawn from 73 agribusinesses primarily using a quantitative approach and interpreted using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to address this issue. A qualitative inquiry through post-survey interviews was also used to strengthen the research outcomes. The findings pointed out that social media use results in greater exploitation over exploration capabilities in the study area. The possible reasons for this one-sided usage, such as lack of awareness and technical and human incapacities are explored, and a suggestion for developing ambidexterity is presented.

When the world suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian migrant workers in other countries returned to their home countries because of job loss or cost-cutting by industry owners. In that situation, women in the handmade industry emerged as new entrepreneurs. Research Design/Methodology: We used the descriptive research method for this study. The data were examined using a stratified random sampling technique and related tools and software, notably SPSS. The correlation and ANOVA statistical procedures were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Based on the data analysis and discussion, we discovered that strong methods for promoting the handicraft industry and women’s entrepreneurship could be devised to address the entrepreneurial dilemma.

The emergence of low-cost smartphones and falling internet rates make mobile apps more accessible to people in the lower-income groups. These apps are not only downloaded for entertainment and information, but they also appear to be increasing the income base. The thriving mobile app economy has unlocked opportunities for thousands of low-income customers for income enhancement. Many studies have been conducted to determine the acceptance of mobile phones amongst the bottom of pyramid customers, but acceptance of mobile applications is still in its infancy stage. The paper attempted to understand the acceptance of mobile-based applications among the bottom of pyramid customers in urban areas using the technology acceptance model. Primary data were collected from 296 urban bottom of pyramid customers. Following this analysis, the researchers observed that if the bottom of pyramid customers perceived the mobile application's usefulness for themselves, it resulted in a significant positive effect on attitude towards usage, which will lead to acceptance.

The edutech organization was founded in Mumbai in India and, within no time, accelerated its growth. The app developed by the company taught the kids falling in the age group of 6–18 years how to develop animations, commercial games, and online apps by applying the basics of coding. By October 2019, the company managed to grow substantially and had 500 teachers while achieving 100% student and revenue growth every next month. August 2020 saw the acquisition of WhiteHat Jr by Byju’s, and all was finalized in six weeks, and the papers were signed virtually. This was followed by an aggressive advertisement campaign, but it didn’t go well with users. The company started making efforts to improve its reputation, and by December 2020, it decided to stop the controversial ads. In an interview, the founder of WhiteHat Jr, Karan Bajaj, admitted that the company should not have emphasized employability for young kids in its advertisements. The challenge ahead for the company is to develop strategies for damage control, future growth, and expansion. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Corporate organizations are at the outset to conceive marketing strategies to address the evolving, perhaps critical consumer behaviour — revenge shopping in the marketspace and marketplace. Though this form of shopping emerged decades ago, the nature of the shopping pattern in these pandemic times has a distinct set of motives being witnessed among consumers. Accordingly, the research evidence in this arena is not adequately bestowed that contributes to marketing implications. Hence, this research note has been proposed to indicate the key perspectives of research possibilities in the arena of revenge shopping. Though the requirements of research outcomes are unexceptionally pondered, the most critical perspectives, such as marketing strategy, the role of hedonism, and the viability of the structural relationship between revenge shopping, consumer satisfaction, consumer engagement and loyalty, have been analyzed and inferred as research notes. The implications, primarily on the research perspectives, have been pointed out for the researchers’ fraternity.

A detailed literature review revealed interesting facts about the pre-studied antecedents of impulse buying. It is found that perceived risk, which is known to hinder consumers' impulse buying earlier, surprisingly appeared to facilitate consumer impulse buying during the infamous global pandemic. The shift happened due to the various psychological changes that consumers experienced during the pandemic. This research monograph is interested in documenting the findings on impulse buying during the pandemic because it is essential to understand consumer changes. The post-pandemic world of consumers' buying behavior and the pattern is likely to change. Researchers correctly pointed out to this concern that whether the changes that the pandemic has caused will sustain or not. Moreover, scholars have also estimated what changes are probable to appear in the consumers' buying process. This study extensively puts forward the detailed findings, facilitating researchers and practitioners to devise their course of action post the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Methodology: This study proposed a conceptual model for OGS, for which data from 453 respondents across India were collected. Furthermore, this study employed a sequential mediation approach and tested the proposed constructs’ direct relationships. Findings: This study revealed that CON significantly impacted PEOU and PU, while PEOU significantly influenced PU and ATT. SN also influenced PU. Additionally, PU significantly affected ATT, and ATT influenced OGPI. Moreover, PU and ATT as sequential mediators significantly affected the relationships among SN–OGPI, PEOU–OGPI, and CON–OGPI, out of which complete mediation was found for PEOU–PU–ATT–OGPI, and the other two were partial mediation. Furthermore, CON–PEOU–ATT–OGPI was also found to have partial sequential mediation. This study added to the literature on OGS by extending TAM with SN and CON, a hitherto under-researched area in this domain. Practical Implications: The study had practical implications for e-retailers. Grocery e-retailers need to focus on the CON aspects of consumers. Additionally, website design characteristics need to be focused on, which in turn would have an impact on the PEOU of the website, which would favorably impact consumer ATT OGS. Originality: This study sought to address a critical gap in the research literature on OGS by examining the collective impact of SN and CON on the TAM constructs. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

With culture, decisions differ, so an effort was made to understand why these religious practices were adopted. It was empirical research for which an open-ended semi-structured questionnaire was used. Hindu consumers filled out the questionnaire in a face-to-face interaction. Responses from 30 individuals were collected in descriptive form. NVivo 12 software was used to analyze the data. The word cloud and themes indicated that many religious practices were followed during festivals and other religious events. Consumers follow religious practices at festivals, weekdays, and other events. We observed that major decisions affected by adopting these religious practices were consumption, purchasing, services, and color preference. Consumers’ religious beliefs influenced all decisions. They followed religious practices due to their belief in God, religion, family teachings, myths, superstitions, health concerns, and family pressure. This study could be generalized by quantifying it in future research. The study also provided insights to companies about the significant role of religious practices in consumer decision-making. Companies can understand the religious practices followed and create a better consumer experience. The study was limited to Indian Hindu consumers, so an analysis of other religions is needed. The study is unique, providing a new perspective on understanding Hindu consumers. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Design/Methodology/Approach: After looking through 544 documents using a separate keyword search, a systematic quantitative review was done, and 159 pertinent papers were found from the Web of Science and Scopus databases up to 2021. The utilization of quasi-experiments in industrialized Western nations was the study’s main focus, followed by Asian nations, especially China and India. Few research used theoretical frameworks, and the quasi-experimental techniques used are restricted to treatment and control groups and the pre-post test approach. Findings: The majority of the research in this field, according to the study, has been conducted in developed Western nations, and the quasi-experimental techniques employed are restricted due to the employment of treatment and control groups and the pre-post-test procedure. The survey also discovered that a very small number of studies have used theoretical frameworks. Future research topics are suggested by the study, particularly the utilization of quasi-experiments with samples of women and LGBTI people. Practical Implications: Given that no studies in the literature have used this sample, the study offers useful guidance for conducting quasi-experiments with female and LGBTI subjects. The review sheds light on how consumer behaviour quasiexperiments are now being used in the sustainability field. Originality/Value: Given that it is the first review ever written on this subject, it is the first of its type.

The present study yielded valuable insights into the impact of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) features, both directly and indirectly, on purchase intention for online travel items through brand image. Additionally, the association between eWOM traits and purchase intention is examined, as well as the mediating effect of brand image. Methodology: A systematic survey was created and distributed to 854 internet-savvy participants who frequently purchase vacations online. The PLS-SEM software 3.3.3 was used to carry out the statistical analysis. Additionally, importanceperformance matrix analysis, or IPMA, was used to investigate the critical elements involved in determining customer intention. Findings: The study found that eWOM characteristics influence brand perception more so than consumers’ intentions to purchase online travel products. It was also demonstrated that eWOM characteristics were higher even if performance was less relevant. That being said, brand image was not as crucial as performance. Practical Implications: Marketers and decision-makers in the online travel sector should take note of the study’s conclusions since they can significantly improve a brand’s reputation. The results could be used to monitor sentiments and gauge their impact.

With the luxury industry growing, the counterfeiting industry is also seeing rapid growth. India’s trade has increased by 24% in the last two years. The research attempted to investigate the factors affecting consumers’ attitudes toward the purchase intention of counterfeit luxury products in South-East Bengaluru. The primary data were collected through an online survey questionnaire. Using the cluster sampling technique, a total of 309 responses were received, of which seven were rejected due to incomplete responses. Therefore, a sample size of 302 was seen fit to use for statistical purposes. Based on the identified factors, initially, a conceptual framework was developed, and the model was tested using JMP Pro 16 software. The research findings revealed that low-income group consumers tended to buy counterfeits more often. The ordinal position of birth played a significant role where first-born children showcased an unfavorable attitude. However, later-born children showcased a more positive attitude. Young adults showed an approved attitude toward counterfeits. The social class of students and employees showed an encouraging attitude toward counterfeits. Several personal and social factors were found to have a strong influence on the attitude toward counterfeits. From the findings, suggestions and recommendations have been drawn to assist genuine brands to frame better tactics to curb counterfeiting. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Methodology: A survey was conducted with 410 customers who stepped out from the organized retail stores after shopping for groceries. A conceptual model has been proposed based on the linkages established through the literature review. Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (23v) and Smart Partial Least Square (3.2.7v) were applied to run exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively. The hypotheses were validated through PLS structural equation modeling. Findings: The outcomes revealed that retailer personality partially mediated the relationship between retail service quality and customer reactions. Research Limitations/Implications: Due to the limited availability of resources, the generalizability of the results cannot be done. The results can be different in various cultural settings. Practical Implications: Improved retail service quality can be a consequence of exhibited humble and sophisticated retailer personality, resulting in enhanced customer reactions (customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty). Introversion and disingenuousness attributes of a retailer deteriorate the retailer’s personality and consequently cause harm to customer reactions. Thus, along with rendering good service quality, retailers should show a humble and sophisticated personality to gain improved customer reactions.

The current study, drawing parallel lines from SOR theory, investigated how the attitude toward EVs was affected by three psychological antecedents—utilitarian shopping value, conspicuous consumption, and lifestyle. Further, the study examined how this attitude impacted the intention of Indian consumers to purchase an EV and their ecological behavior. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study included 382 Indian consumers of EVs who constituted the sample population. A structured questionnaire was created to gather information from this sample. The SEM (structural equation modeling) approach was applied to draw conclusions from the data. Findings: The results indicated that out of three antecedents, only utilitarian shopping value had no significant relationship with attitude toward EVs. Also, the attitude was found to be positively related to purchase intention and ecological behavior. Implications: Manufacturers and marketers of EVs must include lifestyle and conspicuous aspects in their offerings. Moreover, they should work on enhancing the utilitarian value of EVs. Never should a person feel that he/she is paying more than he/she is getting. Special note for conspicuous consumers who are shedding huge resources to make a statement among peers. Originality Value: The current study was one of the prime ones to draw the impact of lifestyle, conspicuousness, and utilitarian values on attitudes toward EVs.

"Customer Engagement Marketing and Firms’ Deliberation on E-Word of Mouth Communication on Online Platforms: A Study on Millennials and Zoomers","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186450516&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2024%2fv54%2fi1%2f173380&partnerID=40&md5=178ba2ded37aa41850f3c17ecf301b7b","Purpose: Customer engagement (CE) has become extremely popular since social media emerged. However, there is disagreement over the proper definition, metrics, and operationalization of CE in social media and its implications. It is unclear how millennials and zoomers use social media and what tactics firms can use to improve CE. This study aimed to investigate and quantify CE for millennials and zoomers in social media. Methodology: We quantified CE through its three dimensions, namely Vigour, Absorptions, and Dedication and measured its impact on electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication. Using structural equation modeling based on 250 responses obtained using a purposive sample strategy, we evaluated the difference in CE across two generation cohorts. We also looked at the effect of the enterprises’ purposeful approach. Findings: There was no discernible difference in the relationship between zoomers and millennials regarding CE and eWOM. The intentional strategy of the companies had little effect as a mediating factor between eWOM and CE. Practical Implications: Our research provided profound insights into the use of social media by techsavvy generations through an exploration of the three dimensions of CE. It discussed how a customer adds value to any company through eWOM. This would allow the managers to involve customers in brand promotion through social media, segment the market, and develop more successful marketing plans. Originality: The study model examined the effects of eWOM communication, which is the first type, by combining the original CE components with the age cohort as a moderator and the firm’s strategy as a mediating variable. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The factors that propelled this buoyancy include rapid urbanization, changing lifestyles, less switching costs, and a rise in annual middle-class spending, which has made this sector highly competitive for retaining customers’ loyalty. A comparative study of three fast-food multi-national brands was conducted to evaluate service performance vis-à-vis customer preference to predict the basis of loyal consumption behavior. For measuring the service performance, two MCDM approaches were integrated with SERVQUAL methodology, that is, AHP & TOPSIS. The paper involved the identification of service quality dimensions and sub-dimensions relevant to fast-food service and then generating weights using the AHP technique, and then finally, establishing the ranking using TOPSIS. The findings revealed that food quality, timely service, clean and hygienic environment, availability of all menu items, consistency of taste, price sensitivity, friendly dealing, and soothing ambiance are the factors that bring loyal consumption behavior. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

We further intended to study the significance of PLBs in terms of enhancing profitability, perceived fashion value, and loyal customer base of fashion retailers through the lens of ‘Masstige Marketing.’ This novel approach of the application of masstige marketing for designing PLB plans gives a novel strategic consideration to fashion retailers in terms of curating strategically developed PLBs for their target audience. This study dwelt upon how strategically developed PLBs – by blending the mass appeal with prestige value and image – affected loyalty behavior, perceived fashion value, and profitability. Although this qualitative research was conducted from the perspective of the Indian retail sector, the findings applied to international markets as well since the strategic considerations towards PLBs are similar in both contexts. The findings showed that the smart PLBs – built by applying masstige marketing strategies – positively impacted customers’ loyalty and brand advocacy behavior. These PLBs will also help fashion retailers to enhance their perceived fashion value and have a profound impact on profitability. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Methodology: Quantitative data were collected from 542 life insurance policyholders in Karnataka by adopting a cross-sectional survey methodology. Findings: Multinomial logistic regression model estimated the channel of distribution (individual agents), trust, interaction intensity, information sharing, and income to influence the selection of life insurance products. Practical Implications: Insurance companies should revamp corporate culture that stresses the interests of the customers over that of agents and curtail adaptive sales practices of agents who sell complex products that do not cover customers’ insurance needs. The promotion of customer-oriented ethical sales behavior focusing on trust, information sharing, and higher interaction intensity is the need of the hour. Efforts should be made to counter systemic short-termism and educate customers on the necessity for long-term investments instead of surrendering the policy where they lose the entire investment. Given that the quality and frequency of insurance agent–customer interactions play a major role in investor decision-making, agents are expected to be responsive and offer personalized inputs to facilitate the purchasing process. Originality: The current study added to the body of evidence supporting the relevance of relationship-selling behavior in the context of ULIPs.

Employer branding not only helps in getting the best talent for an organization, but also reduces the cost of talent acquisition. Employees are not merely passive participants of the recruitment process; they aggressively seek information about the employers using secondary resources like blogs and social media pages of the company and are involved in the co-creation of the recruitment process. The study used a narrative review to identify the factors affecting employer branding. The study then used the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique and TOPSIS to rank these factors, hence identifying the importance of five factors for an employer. The study further performed conjoint analysis to identify the utility of the identified factors for employees. The narrative review of the studies identified salary, job security, training and development, work-life balance, and career progress. The study's results suggested a significant gap between employers' and employees' perspectives, which must be addressed.

A voice assistant, along with its in-built artificial intelligence, makes consumer and device interaction more humanlike and personal. Despite a promising debut in the Indian market, there has been limited research on the Indian consumers’ intention to use VA for online shopping. Most of the studies are exploratory in nature and lack a clear theoretical framework. This study aimed to tap the growing trend of the use of voice assistants in the Indian market. The study focused on finding what factors determine consumer intention to shop online using a voice assistant. How does trust upon a voice assistant affect the relationship between these factors and intention? This is a cross-sectional quantitative study. A convenience sample of 121 respondents participated in the study using an online structured questionnaire. The hypotheses testing was done using AMOS SEM. The tests confirmed that information quality and system quality impacted intention only when mediated through trust. Interaction quality, however, only had a direct effect, and no mediation through trust was determined.

The study would help in determining factors influencing consumer buying in a pandemic situation. The study hypothesized that psychological factors, perceived product scarcity, and prevailing social conditions (during COVID-19) would trigger PB behavior. This type of consumer behavior could be commonly seen during crises, catastrophic events, epidemics, natural disasters, and public and private health emergencies. Research Design: The type of research is descriptive and conclusive research. We adopted a cross-sectional and deductive approach along with the quantitative research method for evidence-building, accomplished the set research objectives, and gathered relevant data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for model validation. A model comprised of three exogenous variables (perceived fear due to COVID-19 and perceived product scarcity due to COVID-19, prevailing social conditions during COVID-19), one moderating variable (gender,) and one endogenous variable (PB behavior), validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and SEM. The sample size was justified using the mean method. A convenience sampling technique was used since the sample frame was unavailable. Findings: According to the CFA and SEM, PB behavior arises when negative emotions, including stress, anxiety, and general social unease, directly lead to the creation of fear, social conditions, and perceived scarcity considerations. This influences consumers to make larger purchases than they otherwise would. The gender of an individual plays a very significant role in influencing PB behaviors. The study determined that in the case of men, perceived fear (during COVID-19) positively influenced PB behavior (b = 1.008, p < 0.001), while in the case of women, the relationship between perceived fear and PB behavior (b = 0.177, p < 0.01), the relationship between perceived product scarcity and PB behavior (b = 0.243, p < 0.05), and the relationship between prevailing social conditions (during COVID-19) and PB behavior (b = 0.298, p < 0.001) were significant. Practical Implications: The results of this study would help in influencing retail business policies and understanding the customer better. The study would assist managers in understanding and forecasting the purchasing patterns of both male and female consumers in any pandemic scenario by utilizing the model’s links. The model might be further examined for a variety of samples, and the framework could be re-evaluated in the absence of a pandemic. Originality: This study provided an original scale for measuring the four-model construct to highlight the short-and long-term effects of consumer sentiments. The study was also original and unique in terms of three direct linkages and the moderating effect of gender.

This study looked at how views of “greenwashing” affected links between green brands and packaged foods in India. It also looked at how green concern and green skepticism function as moderators and mediators, respectively. Methodology: The study is based on a survey of 326 users of packaged food products. The questionnaire consisted of four major constructs: greenwashing perception, greenwashing skepticism, green concern, and green brand associations. The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was applied to conclude the data. Findings: This study showed that green skepticism acts as a mediating factor between the impression of greenwashing and negative associations with green brands. It was discovered that the moderator of green concern emphasized the detrimental effect of the perception of greenwashing on affiliations with green brands. Practical Implications: The results from the study may be used by lawmakers, regulators, and packaged food marketers to frame their environmental policies and practices to reduce green skepticism by providing proof of green claims and practices. Originality: The study was distinctive in that it examined green brand linkages from the viewpoint of the notion of greenwashing.

Methodology : The paper is theoretically positioned and qualitative in nature. Findings : We discovered that very few papers have investigated this topic. Neither green marketing nor political marketing researchers have identified the green marketing positioning strategy of political brands, nor have political marketing researchers focused on the seven Ps of a political brand. Political parties are implementing green marketing strategies in practice, but academics provide no evidence of this. Practical Implications : Following a thorough literature review, we concluded that political marketers or managers should continue exploring new voter segments, such as green voters. We advise researchers to focus on this area of marketing so that voter behavior can be studied more scientifically. Our study has limitations and leaves room for future researchers. More examples of green initiatives can be found while broadening the scope of research to include other countries.

The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between online procrastination (OP) and shopping cart abandonment (OSCA). Methodology: An online structured questionnaire was floated, and responses (n = 327) were collected from online shoppers of two countries (India and Ethiopia). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using IBM SPSS 25.0 and structural equation modeling (SEM) using IBM AMOS 23.0 were carried out. Findings: We observed mean level differences for OP and OSCA across annual income groups, number of sites used for online shopping, and frequency. The structural equation modeling results revealed a significant positive relationship (b=0.57, Adjusted R-Square=0.33) between OP and OSCA. Also, the multi-group analysis revealed that monthly spending levels for online shopping moderated the relationship between OP and OSCA. Practical Implications: By identifying the specific procrastination tendencies and their impact on cart abandonment, we contributed to understanding consumer behavior in online shopping contexts and provided actionable recommendations for reducing cart abandonment rates. Originality: Although the previous studies covered a broader range of factors, a specific examination of the direct link between procrastination tendencies and cart abandonment was lacking in the existing literature. Therefore, the current study addressed this research gap by investigating the unique contribution of online shopping procrastination to cart abandonment, providing a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

"The non-fungible token (Nft) marketplace: technological innovation and opportunities for creators","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172140184&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2023%2fv53%2fi8%2f172973&partnerID=40&md5=20684e8151a6eb852b437326a18cd87e","Purpose: The study concentrated on identifying several use cases for NFTs and analyzing their potential for creators in the marketplace. The purpose of this paper was to provide a foundational understanding of NFTs and their market applications. The current global market capitalization of NFTs is $40 billion, which is approaching the $50 billion global market capitalization of art. In India, Bollywood artists and athletes have their own NFT marketplaces to sell their merchandise. Methodology: The paper conceptually analyzed the use cases of NFTs and their market potential while emphasizing some trading-related issues. As the concept of NFTs is still in its infancy, there is a severe lack of research on NFT use cases. This paper attempted to resolve the lack of research in this field. Findings: NFT has the potential to create new opportunities for a creative market that has been hampered by a variety of factors related to issues of authentic ownership. NFTs enable artists to sell their products directly to all consumers. No matter how frequently an asset is transferred, NFTs provide secure transactions recorded on the blockchain. Due to the instantaneous global commerce of digital products, barriers no longer exist between artists and collectors. Creators may be eligible for royalties based on a percentage of future sales of their NFT artwork, depending on the terms of the licensing agreement. Practical Implications: NFTs have the ability to destabilize economies, cultures, and society as a whole. As with any new technology, NFTs have enabled the introduction of a new business model. Since there is no specific legal framework for NFTs in India, they are governed by contract law’s fundamental principles. Until cryptocurrencies are formally sanctioned, it is premature to estimate the impact of NFTs under the current circumstances. Originality: In contrast to previous research on NFTs, the current work expands upon conceptualizing NFTs and analyzes their market applications and issues. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

As time changed, media and politics changed, too. Therefore, it is important to understand how political cartoons are changing, especially when they are known to play a critical role in democracy. Comparison and analysis of political cartoons over time could bring about reasonable findings. The present research focused on mending this gap in the existing literature and analyzed the changing face of Indian political cartoons over the past decade. The present study was conducted on Editors of different editorials (English and Hindi) based in the Delhi-NCR region, India. Primary data were used in the study, wherein the interview method was adopted to collect the data in the form of interview transcripts. Herein, qualitative analysis was conducted wherein the interview method was adopted. The study’s findings threw light on how the face of political cartoons has changed over the past decade. The research findings could be used by practicing political cartoonists to update themselves. Further, the newspaper could also use this study to analyze how to keep the dying art of political cartooning alive. The research conducted on political cartooning is very limited, and the focus on changes in political cartooning is almost zero.

In a world marked by growing multiculturalism, media plays a significant role in the dissemination of information. Marketers are required to know the nature of the perception held by ethnic communities toward media. This is essential to provide tailored media content to respective targeted communities. Hence, the study was carried out to know the perception of ethnic communities toward communication media. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study was conducted using an exploratory research design on a sample of 1,200 units comprising 400 respondents from three ethnic communities selected, namely Bodo, Mishing, and Rabha. The study used a convenience sampling technique, and data were collected by a structured interview schedule. Attitudinal statements were used to record the responses. Multiple discriminant analysis was used for data processing. Findings: The study found that the Rabha community associated media with advertisement as a platform for choice alternatives of products and as an informer of offers. The Bodo community perceived media as the news channel through which information is circulated, but it is not always deemed to be authentic. Finally, the Mishing community perceived media as the educator of people, as the mobilizer of public opinion, and as the provider of information on the latest trends. Practical Implications: As ethnic communities form significant segments of target markets today, the findings are vital inputs for marketers to suitably use the right media for communication in the right perspective. It will consequently facilitate in providing tailored media content to respective communities being targeted by the stakeholders. Originality/Value: Although studies on consumers’ perception toward communication media are available, studies on the specific ethnic communities in the specific geographical region identified are rare. The research findings will go a long way in enlightening academicians as well as marketers who are related to this area and, thus, find it novel. Furthermore, people from the field of anthropology and mass communication may get vital inputs on the behavior of ethnic communities toward media. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The predictors of brand loyalty considered for this research study include product quality, service quality, price fairness, brand image, perceived value, customer satisfaction, and brand-switching attitude. Methodology: The study looked at seven independent latent variables: perceived value, brand image, customer satisfaction, price fairness, service quality, and brand-switching attitude. Additionally, the dependent variable chosen was brand loyalty, which is a result of both behavioral and attitudinal loyalty. The data gathered from 305 respondents via a questionnaire survey was analyzed using SmartPLS. Findings: According to the study’s findings, several factors were highly predictive of attitudinal loyalty, including customer happiness, price fairness, service excellence, and brand-switching attitude. Additionally, it was discovered that behavioral loyalty and attitudinal loyalty—a product of the conative, affective, and cognitive loyalty triad—were positively correlated. Practical Implications: The findings of the study suggested that simultaneously mapping marketing messages or communication by marketing managers with cognitive, emotional, and conative loyalty elements could lead to the successful creation of attitudinal loyalty. Originality: Unlike prior research on brand loyalty, where different brand loyalty determinants were studied in isolation, their impact on both attitudinal and behavioral loyalty is measured.

The behavioral intention adoption of mobile banking was studied through seven bivariate relationships: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, facilitating conditions, perceived security, cost, self-efficacy, and innovativeness in a global context, which have had a profound impact on the desire of people to adopt digital banking channels. The seven bivariate relationships were analyzed through a meta-analysis approach in a universal framework. The main findings were that location is a major contributor to heterogeneity in a comprehensive global framework. The main managerial implications of the paper are that the universal adoption of digital banking adoption is being significantly affected by location, and global strategists should, therefore, keep this constraint in mind while framing international policies and launching new digital products. Such products must appeal to the location to be successful. An important social link that the current research highlighted was that location has vital linkages with other social factors such as religion, caste, race, color, income, gender, education, family size, buying habits, and wealth, which need to be explored in detail for a better examination of the successful adoption of digital banking channels. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This study focused on the role of social media in influencing customer dissonance. The growing online purchases and product returns due to dissatisfaction have increased the importance of post-purchase dissonance. This fact induced us to undertake this study. Methodology : The data for this study were collected online via a questionnaire using Google Forms. We prepared the questionnaire after carefully reviewing the extant literature. Eight items were adopted from the scale developed by Sweeney et al. (2000). Using R software, multiple regression models were used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Finally, a structural equation model was developed to establish the model fit. Findings : In this study, we found that online purchases by themselves alone did not result in post-purchase dissonance. However, social media has been found to have a significant moderating role in precipitating dissonance. Practical Implications : The findings of this study are both important and straightforward. Firms should closely monitor social media. Social media can easily sway the cognitive balance that the customers may have reached before making a purchase. With the increased social media usage to check for products before purchases (Mason et al., 2021), it has become all the more important for firms to keep a close watch on social media. Originality : The study’s originality lies in the fact that the study considered the role of social media, particularly in online purchases. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Ugly produce does not refer to spoilt, rotten, or germ-infected fruits and vegetables. The basic premise of this study is from self-signaling and self-perception theories. The self-signaling theory states that when people make a choice, they disclose something of their character and personality not just to others, but also to themselves. Self-perception theory (SPT) developed by psychologist Daryl Bem asserts that people develop their attitudes by observing their own behavior and further concluding what attitudes must have caused it. Classically, consumers undervalue ugly produce because of altered self-perceptions; simply visualizing the consumption of imperfect produce acts as a self-indicative signal that negatively affects how consumers view themselves. Due to this, the unattractive produce, even though perfectly edible and with the same taste and nutritional value, is rejected by consumers merely based on shape or some other cosmetic blemish. We discussed the strategies adopted by Indian startups and organizations to reduce food waste. Deep discounting is the strategy followed by food retailers worldwide to sell ugly produce, however, this is not the best strategy as it leads to losses for both the retailers as well as the farmers. We suggested alternative strategies successfully followed by foreign retailers, such as spreading awareness, boosting self-confidence and esteem among consumers, attracting kids, etc., which can be followed by Indian food retailers for selling ugly fruits and vegetables. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Many challenges were posing a threat to the survival of this industry. So, the purpose of the present study was to conduct a structural analysis of the challenges of the fast food industry in India using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). Design/Methodology/Approach: Challenges of fast food industries have been identified from the literature, which was further endorsed for significance using responses from the domain experts through a structured questionnaire. The rationale of this paper was to apply ISM to develop a hierarchical structure among the vital challenges of fast food industries in India. The ISM technique analyzed the mutual interaction and ranking among the challenges. Furthermore, MICMAC analysis was applied to explain this dependence and driving power challenges. Findings: During the first phase of the research, an opinion survey of experts was endorsed. The challenges of “lack of fresh ingredients” and “availability of ready-to-eat meals” were dropped based on the t-test. ISM was applied to the validated challenges. Ten validated challenges were modeled into five levels. “Changing tastes of millennial customers” was found to be the most important challenge of the fast food industry, which appeared at the lowest level. The ISM model supported examining and building up a model of interactions, mutual influence, and relationships among the challenges faced by the fast food industry. Limitations: The research work bounded the study in India, and subjectivity in expert opinion might exist. Practical Implications: The study is relevant to fast food industry professionals, food delivery aggregators, and food processing and packaging professionals. They need to be aware of the lacunae, the importance of challenges, and their interdependence found out from the study for future courses of action. Originality/Value: The study investigated the core challenges of the fast food industry in India. Secondly, it had methodological novelty in the context.

There has been an accelerating shift in consumption patterns and consumer preferences for sustainable luxury products. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for changes in consumer behavior and adapting to a new way of living. Consumer trends have revealed that sustainability has become a key consideration in varied consumer segments when making their purchase decisions. Consumers’ drive for environmental stability, social responsibility, and ethical practices has well been reflected in their lifestyles today. Thus, companies are re-evaluating their products’ sustainability credentials and adopting a new paradigm of value creation to meet the changing psychological approach of consumers. This short communication delved into consumers’ psychological aspects that drive momentum towards sustainable luxury consumption. Here, the SHIFT framework (White et al., 2019) was adopted to highlight the subtle psychological facets of consumers that trigger them to embrace sustainable luxury consumption. The perspective presented a conceptual framework that indicated various psychological facets (atypicality, social desirability, life changes, need for uniqueness, self benefits, sense of accomplishment, pro-environment nature, personal experience of others, and consideration of legacy) of a consumer, which influence sustainable luxury consumption. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

At the same time, this research paper undertook iterative search techniques to finalize the net-reviewed research papers. The study excluded articles that were not pertinent or did not fall under the abovementioned criteria. Findings: The extensive literature review prompted structuring of the hedonism-mediated optimistic materialism-impulse buying (M-H-IB) research framework. We found that this model is logically valid and seeks future empirical investigation. This finding provides a microscopic view of the understanding of impulse buying. Practical Implications: Studies in consumer behavior are essential because it helps consumer researchers understand the deep-rooted motivations that impose a change in consumers’ characteristics and psychology. Understanding these changes becomes a key for marketers and practitioners to unlock the mist of need recognition among consumers and design effective marketing communications and advertisements accordingly to market their offerings successfully. This study proposed a model where hedonism, which happens to be a precursor to impulse buying, is conceived as a mediator in the optimistic materialism–impulse buying relationship. Originality: Unlike prior research, this M-H-IB model is essential because it can establish a closed-loop estimation of the influence of materialism and hedonism on impulse buying. Further, this approach enriched consumer research by attempting to reduce the lack of defined marketing models in the research community. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

"An Empirical Study to Identify Consumer Brand Relationships During a Crisis","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146483647&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2023%2fv53%2fi1%2f172592&partnerID=40&md5=f1b946f5e6fc09840dfaf9715bfd478a","Countless businesses exist only to serve the varying demands of the world’s customers, and those consumers find themselves constantly bombarded by an overwhelming selection of goods and brands. The brand distinguishes the company from its rivals and aids consumers in making educated purchasing decisions. However, when faced with a catastrophic event like the COVID-19 outbreak, consumers’ assessment criteria shifted in response to shifting priorities and circumstances. As a result, shoppers are rethinking their brand loyalties and choosing new ones. This article used the brand archetype framework to determine what factors customers value during times of crisis. It also used the brand archetype framework to identify the elements consumers consider important during a crisis. Data were collected from 207 respondents and using the Relative to an Identified Distribution (RIDIT) approach, the top-rated brand elements were identified based on level of importance or agreement. This study will help practitioners incorporate the identified elements into their brand image. Their subsequent actions will help them remain relevant and essential for their consumers, even in challenging situations. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

It also decoded how increased consumer focus toward sustainability has impacted the consumption of fashion brands. Methodology: Six consumption values and traits (i.e. the need for materialism, uniqueness, self-esteem, public selfconsciousness, social norms, and social media influence) were identified as critical factors based on a narrative literature review (NLR) of the status and sustainable consumption habits. Findings: We discovered unmistakable indicators that the luxury market is shifting toward a more sustainable paradigm. By choosing sustainable and organic options, consumers are showing fashion manufacturers more consideration. A shift in consumer values and characteristics (i.e. demand for materialism, uniqueness, self-esteem, public self-consciousness, social norms, and social media influence) is linked to a growing preference for sustainable fashion labels. Practical Implications: It was recommended that marketers address this paradigm shift in consumer values and traits by using sustainability as a key differentiator for luxury brands. Mindfulness may erode materialistic values so that brands may focus on “conscientious value” instead of “conspicuous value.” Our study is not free from limitations and allows scope for future researchers to test the conceptual model empirically. Originality: This study is an early attempt to evaluate the effects of sustainability concerns on post-COVID fashion brand consumption and the potential contributing elements. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The current study was conducted to find the dominant component of compulsive buying among youth. Design/Methodology/Approach: The Richmond Scale applied for data collection was found to discriminate between compulsive buying behavior and normal buying behavior. CBB was found in 169 of 469 youngsters (college students). SPSS 26.0 was used to do automatic regression to determine the best predictor of CBB among kids. Findings: The study discovered that buying undesirable and unplanned items were the best predictor of compulsive shopping behavior. Overall, impulsive behavior predicted compulsive buying behavior more strongly among young people. However, there was no variation in the compulsive buying scores among youth with CBB based on age or gender. Implications: As CBB is largely present among youth and is mainly triggered by impulsive buying tendencies, policymakers should formulate policies to curb the promotion of harmful products at the point of purchase. Originality Value: The current study focused on the compulsive purchasing habits of developing-country youngsters. Its novelty resided in the results, which imply that impulsive purchasing is a significant component of compulsive purchasing behavior. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Since the expectations and demands from luxury customers are different, this paper studied the effect of service quality provided by robots on customer citizenship behavior. Methodology: In the initial phase, qualitative research was conducted by interviewing people who had experienced SR in luxury hospitality settings. The second phase of the study was conducted based on the respondents’ themes. In the second phase, video clips of robots performing tasks like concierge and front-desk employees were shown to understand the customers’ perceptions. Findings: The study’s findings showcased the importance of communication quality between the inorganic service agent and humans. Simultaneously, the factors like problem-solving and trendiness did not have a positive impact on service quality. However, an interesting finding was that the perception of robot service quality positively affected consumer citizenship behavior in the luxury hotel context. Practical Implications: Luxury hotels have deployed SR in their operations in developed economies. Luxury hotels are renowned for their service quality, and by deploying SR, they are entering a new service industry domain. The results of this study showcased that communication ability, competence, and quality are significant factors in perceiving high-service quality by luxury consumers. Originality/Value: The research explored the impact of service robots in the luxury hospitality industry on consumer citizenship behavior toward the hospitality organization.

Different media urged consumers to “no bargain” and “vocal for local” to alleviate pandemic challenges. The self-interest and value-seeking customer behavior were contextually unsuitable with the fear of infection, reduced time for buying, scarcity, and price fluctuations. Did compassion influence a person’s buying behavior? This research investigated the validity of a compassion buying scale and found its demographic differences. Methodology: An online, anonymous survey with convenient sampling collected 551 responses during the second wave of the pandemic in Eastern India. The questionnaire sought responses to demographic and compassion buying measures. The compassion buying behavior scale was developed from relevant literature. The reliability and validity measures calculated from the obtained responses were in the acceptable range. Findings: The results indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, people did less compassion buying. Compassion buying indicated a U-shape curve by age and economic status. To enhance the scale, future research can include bargain intent, product characteristics, and psychographic characteristics. Practical Implications: Given the large informal market, vendor, and workforce in a developing nation like India, compassion buying is probably the key to the recovery and growth of various products and services typically offered by disadvantaged vendors. The role of compassion in consumption requires additional investigation during normal times. Originality: This study reported preliminary findings on “compassion buying” as a distinct aspect of consumer psychology, different from altruism. It complements responsible consumption, ethical consumerism, and sustainable development. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

A total of 1,361 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in 23 states and 4 union territories provide e-NAM services. It has been observed that only a few markets have been implementing the e-NAM services effectively. According to a literature review, farmers do not generally accept or use the e-NAM services. This study used the SERVQUAL methodology to quantify the relationship between service quality characteristics and the farmers’e-NAM satisfaction levels. Methodology: The SERVQUAL model was utilized to examine the association between farmers’ satisfaction and SERVQUAL dimensions. Primary data were gathered from farmers who were registered participants in the Telangana and Odisha e-NAM implementation markets. Approximately 241 samples were chosen by a basic random sampling method. The path model and confirmatory factor analysis were created using AMOS software. Findings: According to the study, farmers’ satisfaction levels are largely influenced by just three SERVQUAL model dimensions: assurance, reliability, and tangibility. Practical Implications: The Ministry of Agriculture must provide the State agriculture marketing authorities with the necessary policy guidelines in order to fortify the three highly consequential SERVQUAL dimensions in each e-NAM implementing market: Assurance (lessening of intermediaries, information of price and market conditions, assignment, grading, etc.), reliability (best price, inter-trading, e-bidding, etc.), and tangibility (computers, electronic weight, handheld machines, and restrooms).

First, it explained the relationship between service quality and benefit perception. Second, it studied the role of customers’ intent in the relationship. Following a descriptive design, data were gathered from a sample of 202 restaurant customers in Goa, India during the year 2017. Empirically validated tools were used for data collection. Data were statistically analyzed for direct as well as for moderated impacts using regression analysis and testing coefficient differences. Service quality was found to be positively impacting overall benefit perception. The impact of service quality on utilitarian benefits was stronger than that on hedonic benefits. While all five dimensions of service quality were found to be impacting utilitarian benefit perception, only tangibles and assurance dimensions were found to be impacting hedonic benefit perception. Customer intent, whether hedonic or utilitarian, moderated the relationship between service quality and benefit perception. A utilitarian intent positively moderated the relationship, while a hedonic intent moderated negatively. Besides its theoretical relevance, the study is also relevant for practice. The areas of practical relevance included market segmentation based on customer intent, service quality levers that influence utilitarian versus hedonic benefit perception, and adaptations in service design and delivery to address customer induced variability.

The research was conducted in Coimbatore-a potential and competing destination in Tamil Nadu, India between 2018 and 2019. Burgeoning global competition, emerging tourism-based business avenues, elevating foreign direct investments were the fundamental motives for this research. The objective of this research was to identify and validate a tourist motivation model inculcating the primitive factors such as destination image (cognitive and affective) and tourists' motives to travel. Literature review found that perceived cognitive and affective image had a significant impact on the tourists' travel motivation. Thus, these three factors were modeled conceptually. To validate the model, a structured questionnaire containing the necessary constructs measuring the required responses was floated to 570 tourists who visited the destination. However, the sample size was fixed to 448 after excluding the improper responses. Structural equation modeling was employed using SPSS AMOS software to validate the model hypothetically. The model fit was identified, and this study confirmed that both Cognitive Image and Affective Image had a significant impact on Tourists' Travel Motivation. Destination marketers are suggested to formulate marketing strategies that induce the existing belief about the destination in tourists' minds and experience being gained in the destination because belief and experience are related to motivation. Researchers are suggested to use this model as a base forfurther research by inculcating other constructs measuring the image aspects of the destination. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Researchers intended to address three primary research questions: How do the factors affect the prospective app users’ initial trust and adoption intention? Does initial trust mediate the relationship between trialability, perceived ease of use, subjective norms, and intention to adopt? Finally, how do Indian and Saudi Arabian consumers differ in their intention to adopt and the possible reasons? Methodology: Four hundred twenty-six potential e-health services users from Saudi Arabia and India were considered as the sample. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the same. Further, a multi-group analysis was undertaken to compare both samples. Findings: The findings suggested that trialability (TB) had a positive and significant impact on both initial trust (IT) and intention to adopt (IA). Perceived ease of use (PEOU) had a significant and positive impact on IA; however, it was not valid for IT. Subjective norms (SN) positively and significantly impacted IT and IA. Further, IT substantially affected IA. The multi-group analysis found that in the case of India, TB had a significant and positive impact on both IT and IA. In contrast, it did not positively impact IT in the case of Saudi Arabia. PEOU had an insignificant impact on IT for both the samples, and multi-group analysis was confirmed. For both samples, SN had a significant and positive impact on IT. IT had a significant and positive impact on IA for both samples. Finally, IT was a good mediator between TB and SN with IA.

They can achieve this by converting their weakness into strengths as they can be more flexible in marketing strategies than their competitors in the market. The purpose of this paper was to explore the marketing strategies of start-up companies in India with reference to entrepreneurial marketing. The research is based on a sample of 67 start-up companies operating in India using the mixed research method. Data collection were done using a semi-structured questionnaire comprising of quantitative and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 and AQUAD 7.0. The findings indicated that start-up companies see marketing as a vital function for their growth and sustainability. Companies are ready to adopt entrepreneurial marketing, and they were already using few of the entrepreneurial marketing techniques. We explored the marketing environment of start-ups in its extant form. The entrepreneurial practitioners as well as the owners of start-up companies may note that this research provides meaningful insights into the significance of their marketing-related activities. The study offers three distinct contributions pertaining to the marketing practices in start-ups: (a) Identifies the research gap within the existing research literature; (b) explains the marketing strategies by start-up companies; (c) compares and maps the marketing strategies with entrepreneurial marketing. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Various satisfaction measures like communication services, network issues, technology, price, brand image, and customer care services were analyzed. With the introduction of Reliance Jio in December 2015, the Indian telecom market got distracted and stimulated in Madhya Pradesh as Jio offered various free communication services, lower data packs, and free voice calls without roaming. This step of Reliance Jio created a cold war among the mobile service providerfirms and put immense pressure on competitors to offer similar services at comparatively lower prices. With the market moving forward, customer satisfaction has become mandatory for service providers to stay competitive in the market. This research study was exploratory in nature. Primary data were collected through a questionnaire from 500 mobile service users. Factor analysis was employed to analyze the data through SPSS 21.0 software, which was randomly collected from Bhopal (M.P.), India. Ten factors were identified out of 32 items of seven variables.

The web pages must be designed according to criteria such as web quality. The aim of this paper was the construction of a model for the analysis of the quality of the websites. We took as a reference the Index Web Evaluation (IEW). Four blocks were identified: Accessibility, speed, navigability/usability, and content quality. The model was used to analyze the websites of 25 Chinese airlines. For this, we attended to the items contained in this index, modified and expanded it, and adapted it to fulfill the objective of the study. According to the scores, the weights of each aspect and dimension, a ranking of the websites of the Chinese airlines was presented. The results indicated that intemational airlines had a better website. Accessibility was a weak point on the web. Within the category of navigability, the languages that the websites were translated into was another weak point for most companies.

Retail merchandising assists the retailers to attract shoppers and influence their purchase. Often, the merchandising updates are not escalated up the hierarchy ladder as they are much dynamic and spontaneous in nature. Top manufacturing FMCG companies like HUL, ITC, etc. took up this challenge of modern trade merchandising by maintaining manpower in organized retail stores to tap the cutting edge of competitive advantage. The key challenges of these merchandisers include - maintaining overall shelf health, frequency and consistency of restocking, tracking the competition actions in the store, eliminating the conflicting signages, remove broken displays, and display compliances. These FMCG companies have adopted a breakthrough innovation of mobile applications to overcome these challenges. This study is novel and investigated the sales performance improvement through mobile application technology. The research was conducted in two parts. Part 1 included structural interviews (one-on-one) with retail store managers and FMCG sales representatives. The results disclosed eight major attributes as store trend, competition update, personnel management, stock availability, demand creation, in-store visibility, new products launch and promo packs, and share of shelf to improve sales performance. Part 2 examined the significance of these eight factors through quantitative study by considering FMCG merchandisers as respondents.

The enabling and inhibiting factors were examined as a moderator between purchase intention and purchase behavior of consumers for green products. Data for the research were collected from 506 Indian consumers. It was found that facilitators (i.e. health, environment friendly, certification, minimum use of pesticides, superior quality, and recyclability) for selected green product categories significantly influenced the purchase intention and purchase behavior of consumers. However, with respect to barriers (i.e. high price, lower availability, lower promotion, lack of certification, lack of well-known brands, resistance to change), it was found that for organic food products and organic personal care products, there was an interaction effect, but for energy-efficient products, there was no significant interaction effect on purchase intention and purchase behavior of consumers for green products. The identified facilitators and barriers for selected green product categories can be helpful for the marketers in minimizing the ‘intention-behavior gap’ among Indian consumers for the purchase of selected green products. The study provides novel insights on the complex buying behavior of Indian consumers for selected green product categories using important variables, that is, facilitators and barriers as moderator between purchase intention and purchase behavior of consumers.

The gradual increasing focus on service element along with products to differentiate from the competitors and attract and retain customers is also an important step in this direction. However, it is at its nascent stage and requires attention of researchers. In the service segment of any industry, the chain of final success consists of a series of links: service quality and customer involvement, customer involvement and emotional satisfaction, relational benefits and customer satisfaction, loyalty behaviour and satisfaction. However, though a positive association between some of these links has been acknowledged, the role of customer involvement is still a less researched area. The paper, through empirical study, intended to examine various dimensions of these relationships with reference to service quality and customer satisfaction, with the main focus on the mediating role of customer involvement between service quality and customer satisfaction. The survey was conducted through a self-administered and closed-ended questionnaire to collect experimental data related to service quality from the customers.

Specifically, in developing countries like India, this change is disrupting the landscape of the retail sector with an intensity never seen before. To get an edge over competitors and to perform in a better way, it will be critical for retailers to understand the retail store attributes which attract the consumers and keep them coming back. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of grocery consumers’ perceived retail store image across various demographic groups in context of India was the basic purpose of this paper. For this, a survey of grocery consumers, who visited organized grocery stores to purchase groceries at least once in a month, was conducted. Initially, 500 consumers were approached to fill a standardized questionnaire, and 469 questionnaires complete in all manners were used for the final analysis. The factor analysis resulted in nine major dimensions of store image construct. Furthermore, with the help of ANOVA and t - statistics, it was tested if the demographic factors like age, gender, and marital status significantly affected the perceived store image of grocery consumers. In this study, significant differences emerged in consumers’ perception of store image dimensions based on age and marital status. In case of gender, no significant difference was observed on any store image dimension. The findings of this study would lead to an improved understanding of the linkage between grocery consumers’ demographic attributes and their perceived level of store image in the context of a developing country. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Companies are spending heavily on brand promotion and advertising to attract new customers. This research paper studied consumer innovativeness and lead user status (LUS) in adopting new products and services in Indian rural markets. Lead users are defined as customers at the leading edge of the market and who have a high incentive to adopt a new innovation. In earlier research studies, a construct like 'lead user status' was developed as a bimodal and discrete variable. This paper advanced the idea of lead user through redefining and validating the construct as a leading edge status (LES) and adapting the same to the Indian rural market context as a continuous variable. This helped in comparing LES with other behavioural adoption traits like individual dispositional innovativeness (IDI) and time of adoption (TOA) from the seminal work of Rogers (1962). This paper also studied the mediating effect of LES with the traditional measures like IDI, TOA, and other general characteristics by application of route path analysis in LISREL. A pairwise correlation also revealed interesting patterns among LES, IDI, and TOA and with demographic and psychographic consumer traits. The study validated a continuous construct of LES and further established that LES assumed a mediating role in explaining consumer innovativeness and adoption behaviour. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Methodology: The study was grounded on extensive review of literature. The study has explored insights on the significant variables which had a substantial contribution towards consumer acceptance of FFBs. Originality: It was identified that a clear dearth of research studies regarding consumer acceptance of FFBs is still missing in India. In the Indian context, the present study is the initial one of its kind and tried to address this research gap and developed a conceptual framework for consumer acceptance of FFBs.

The consumer has been provided with a plethora of options and offers. Unlimited talk time plans, data packages, voice and SMS plans, etc. have changed the way the telecom business operates. Mobile number portability (MNP) has been the biggest game changer. An understanding of consumers at length is thus imperative. This research paper focused on proper segmentation and profiling of consumer segments with an aim to provide sharper and focused marketing programs. The paper highlighted the emergence of two different types of consumer segments namely, the Conventionalist and the Techi. It would be immensely useful for telecom companies to understand consumers' tastes, habits, preferences, and personality with a view to link them with consumer purchase patterns. Both the segments were found to exhibit quite a few contrasting features and as such could be exploited for concentrated marketing communications. The results indicated that unless and until consumers are regarded as lifetime prospects, companies would find it very difficult to retain consumers. From chota recharge to unlimited talk time, companies have leaped milestones and come a long way, and this has been only possible because of effective segmentation of consumers on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioural bases/parameters.

Parsimonious motivational factors were derived based on the responses of spectators watching international sporting events backed by secondary data collected from research articles and case studies pertaining to sports event attendance behaviour and sponsorships. Qualitative data collected both from primary as well as secondary sources were used for content analysis. It was observed that sports events result in two types of involvement, mainly participation and attendance, which are influenced by economic, sociological, psychological, and motivational factors like age, leisure time, family size, health and weight concerns, personal growth, and affiliation. It was also observed that experiential sponsorship activation (ESA) reflects dimmersive brand experiences and encourages high levels of active participation.

In the absence of any published studies in the Indian scenario, the present study examined the consumption of the dating app, Tinder. In addition to understanding the motivations for Tinder use, user perceptions and experiences were also explored. The findings of the study are suggestive of a male-dominated user base. The study also found that physical appearance was the most popular factor which influenced a right swipe, which justifies the user interface of the app. In the light of the Tinder Motives Scales (TMS), the study attempted to understand the motivations for Tinder use. Tinder use for entertainment was found to be the most popular motive. The study also revealed that an overwhelming majority of Tinder users did not believe in the possibility of finding a long-term romantic partner.

This study was conducted in Malaysia and looked at the integration of sound effects into advertising to bridge the gap between the senses of sight, sound, and taste (Fried Chicken). The results demonstrated that sound effects influenced consumers' beliefs and purchase intentions more than music or silence. This research closes the gap on whether advertisers should use sound effects, music, or silence.

In this context, two types of models were taken into consideration on the basis of sources of information (i.e. analogous time series or conventional time series). A linear regression model and a Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model were fitted to data on Exxon Butyl price (EBP), Russian Butyl price (RBP), and Crude oil price (RBRTE). Results showed that the ARIMA model was superior to the regression model in case of predicting Butyl prices.

Twitter calls it an authentication sign, not the endorsement, and as per policy, it can be assigned only to the accounts of public interest. Still, it is an aspiration for many users, and many discussions keep happening around it. In this paper, a systematic review of academic and industry literature was done to study the user understanding and aspiration for the blue tick badge, its impact on the users and society at large, and the platform’s policy to award them. Results showed that the blue tick is the “status symbol” for Twitter users, and accounts with this badge are considered elite and influencers. This perception for blue ticks is not sentimental but has been crafted by the platform by keeping its supply low and restricted to famous account owners. Also, the study highlighted that there are no specific and clear guidelines on Twitter’s end for account verification and disproof. As a result, the platform comes at the center of controversy and public ire on several occasions. The results of the study also contribute towards building theory and drawing managerial implications for industry practitioners.

The current research suggested the consumption value theory to fill this gap, which will better explain consumer behavior toward grocery apps. The proposed model was tested using data from 436 users of grocery apps. The data revealed that all the consumption values positively and significantly influenced the intention to use grocery apps.

Perpetually, this has developed an addiction towards smartphones. Philanthropists and academicians are inclined towards knowing whether this habit is really an act of updating to make oneself more tech - savvy or whether such a habit makes any value addition to our lives. Henceforth, it was quite essential to investigate the effect of smart cellphone usage on behavioral issues of people and to determine what kind of changes are brought in an individual’s psyche and psychology due to excessive usage of smartphones. Previous studies focused more on understanding the different aspects of smartphone usage but rarely tried to determine what happens if anyone uses smartphones in excess. In our research, we established the triangulate relationship between smartphone usage, technostress, and conflict behavior. We determined whether smartphone usage leads to technostress impacting an individual’s conflict behavior or whether technostress mediates this relationship.

The impact of mobile based communication strategies among modern marketers are more commonly witnessed with the revolutionary growth of mobile applications and their usage. One of the significant developments of mobile technologies that prove to be beneficial to both businesses and customers is the introduction of mobile payment systems, otherwise known as mobile wallet applications. Despite many mobile wallet users in India, it is highly challenging for service providers to understand the motivations behind customers to be loyal because of divergent customer segments and their needs. Hence, this study aimed at identifying the factors that determine the mobile wallet users' intentions to continue using a specific service provider and how this behaviour would be different across the customer groups based on their usage. This paper proposed a theoretical research framework and validated the same with empirical data with the help of multivariate data analysis techniques, including exploratory factor analysis, t-test, and MANOVA.

To mitigate both the gaps, we carried out a principal component analysis to identify shopping oriented facets for Indian women consumers and in the second stage tried to relate the same in isolation with the mentioned demographic variables (namely age, income, and education) and brand loyalty. The results revealed that Economic Price Searching Behavior (EPSB) was one of the shopping orientation facets significantly associated with age, income, and brand loyalty; Quality Seeking Behavior (QSB) was another facet that was significantly associated with income and brand loyalty; and Value Deriving Behavior (VDB), as the last facet, was significantly associated with income and brand loyalty. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Findings: The top five attributes which emerged as critical to the tyre purchase decision were - quality, price, brand, safety, and reliability. Four unique segments emerged with unique attribute preferences. The first segment considered quality and price as the top attributes and no significant importance was attached to the other attributes. The second segment only looked at brand and quality while deciding on the purchase. The third segment looked at safety along with brand and price as the top decision attributes.

"Crop diversification and crop disposition in India: An inter-state analysis","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088585740&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2020%2fv50%2fi5-7%2f152117&partnerID=40&md5=cde3d582c5fe4ae5e43d05f4716b9334","Given the low productivity and earnings of Indian farmers, especially small and marginal landholders, it is pertinent to understand the constraints under which they operate and correspondingly address the same. Amongst several factors, farmers' earnings can also improve through crop diversification and conducive crop disposition channels, which involve fewer middlemen. This way, farmers can capture a greater share of value addition in the supply chain from farm-gate to consumer. With this backdrop, the present paper analyzed two specific objectives. First, to estimate the degree of crop diversification and the prominent ways in which crop disposition takes place across states and union territories (UTs) in India, and second, to analyze the relationship between crop diversification and variants of crop disposition in India. Four crop diversification indices were calculated, namely Gibbs and Martin, Herfindal-Hirschman Index, Simpson Diversity Index, and Bhatia's Index. The paper primarily used GM Indexfor further analysis. Channels of crop disposition were analyzed through six agencies, that is, local private agents, manáis, input dealers, co-operatives and government agencies, processors, and others. Our findings indicated the following: First, crop diversification remained 'low' to 'moderate' for most of the Indian states and UTs. Second, though crop diversification increased for several states and UTs during the two Rounds, the pace of improvement was slow. Third, crop disposition is generally undertaken through private agents. Fourth, the relationship between crop diversification and sale to 'mandis' was positive and significant, while that between crop diversification and 'sale to local private agents'was negative and significant. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The extended valence framework and UTUAT2 model were integrated to develop a parsimonious model comprising trust, perceived risk, performance expectancy, habit, and buying intention. The model was tested by employing structural equation modeling with a sample of 362 respondents from India. Findings: The relationship between trust and buying intention was found to be the strongest amongst all factors. All modeled predictors of trust were found to impact trust significantly, while perceived risk was found to have an inverse relation with trust. Research Limitations/Implications: The constructs presented in the model successfully explained the factors that impacted OFD platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The understanding of consumers’ responses developed in the study is a useful addition to the literature. Practical Implications: The study provides direction to promoters and marketers of OFD platforms to identify specific factors that can help boost the buyers’ intention to purchase during emergency situations. Originality/Value: The integration of two theoretical models: The extended valence framework and UTUAT2 is unique in the context of OFD platforms.

Accurate prediction of movie box-office revenues can reduce this market risk and inform the investment decisions regarding promotion of the movie closer to a film’s release or right after release. Studies have shown that chatter on social media platforms like Twitter along with certain movie-related factors can be useful in predicting success of movies. Sentiment of tweets for any movie gives important information about the consumer’s reaction and the polarity of these sentiments has been shown to have an impact on prediction of box-office revenues. This paper presented a novel Bollywood domain specific sentiment lexicon that delivered state-of-the-art performance for polarity determination of reviews. SentiDraw lexicon was built on movie reviews scraped from IMDB and calculated the sentiment orientation of these words by calculating the probability distribution of words across reviews with different star ratings. The results showed that SentiDraw lexicon delivered a superior performance compared to any other lexicon-based method. This significantly contributed in enhancing the prediction accuracy of box office for movies using textual data from Twitter for analysis. In fact, this study demonstrated an extremely parsimonious regression model that used only budget, hype factor, tweet volume, and polarity of tweets for a robust prediction of box office revenues even before the release of a movie. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Consumers preserve this brand knowledge in a non-conscious level of their mind. Marketers depend upon the use of multi-sensory metaphors to bring out that digged-in knowledge.

Further, innovations are a great way to enhance marketing function. Historically, pandemics and recessions led to more innovations and an overall improvement in life in the long term. The greatest of all pandemics, the Great Plague of 1331-1353, brought several innovations such as more parity in the society as compared to the past, and creation of modern science-based medicine. Pandemics and recessions in the past forced companies to innovate with fewer resources. COVID-19 is a great godsend opportunity to invest in innovations for marketing. It is a time to grow strategically as done by Airbnb, which started in December 2007, and used the recession of 2008 to make it big with its innovative ideas. Contrary to general perception, instead of stopping funding innovations during crisis times, great companies in the past put focused efforts and funds to come up with innovations during crisis times. Some companies are using COVID-19 as a shock therapy to kill the inertia against innovation. The increased risk perception has created opportunities for marketing innovations. The learning from the innovation examples in the 7Ps of marketing shared in the paper is that many companies and government departments have already come up with innovations to face the changed reality.

The study depicted in detail the reasons behind people's desire to purchase a mobile phone, the factors influencing people while making the purchase, and the factors that motivated them to make the final purchase decision. From an extensive study of the existing literature available, it was found that the factors that instigate buying behaviour have really shown a great deal of dynamism since the last decade. The fast-changing technology of mobile telephony has truly become the driver of this unsteadiness. Most of the existing studies have focused on factors like price, features, brand, service, brand loyalty, and operating system with respect to mobile phones. Yet, it is believed that the impact of such factors keeps changing from time to time. Hence, it was deemed justifiable to conduct an updated study on these factors and also consider any other mediating factors in order to help the industry as well as academicians to understand consumers better and design products accordingly.

Seven hundred and eight-six residents of the sub-district of Todaraisingh in Tonk, Rajasthan, participated in the study. A strong positive cognizance of the personalized communication was empirically confirmed. Furthermore, a high influence of cognitive response and sympathy towards the communication was found on the evaluative judgment of the participants that strongly influenced the intention to spread positive word of mouth and behavioral intention. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The research was carried out with a sample of common individuals/households residing in the Ghaziabad region. We collected the data using a structured questionnaire by using convenient random sampling technique. One-sample t-test was used to ascertain the significant attributes for the purchase of milk. To know the relationship between family size, family income, qualification, and purchase preference of milk categories, chi-square test was conducted. The study found that taste, price, easy availability, and brand were the significant attributes forthe purchase of packaged milk. It was found that family income and qualification played a very significant role in the consumers’ preference forthe purchase of packaged milk. Factors such as packaging, quality, and safe for health were found to be the non-significant factors for the purchase decision of packaged milk.

Before going for studies in marketing and spirituality in the Indian context, it is essential to first understand spirituality in the Indian context because India is a diverse country. However, there is lack of a pan – India study to understand the current state of spirituality. This research paper filled this research gap by studying spirituality in India's 36 states and union territories. The results showed differences across states and union territories, small states and big states, islands and mainland, and across different regions. Marketing professionals can use the findings of the study while designing the marketing strategy and marketing mix to reach out to the consumers in a better way.

In this context, the role of social media usage on online purchase intentions was examined in this paper. Though there are many studies on various factors influencing online purchase intentions, this paper focused on finding the impact of social commerce and social media usage on online purchase intentions. Questionnaires were sent to 500 respondents, who were social media users covering different parts of India. Their use of social media and social commerce constructs such as recommendations, ratings and forums, and their impact on online purchase intentions were measured. The results of multiple regression showed that social commerce constructs and social media usage had a positive effect on online purchase intentions. Thus, based on the research findings, it was suggested that companies should use social media platforms to engage their customers in such a way that they are online for a longer duration.

However, the main motive the consumers are looking forward is to buy a product which would effectively satisfy their requirements. If they find a product which satisfies their needs effectively, they buy it irrespective of whether it is a private label or a global brand. Even the price of the product may not be a major factor in such a case.

The supremacy of the Internet has paved the way for social media advertising, which is a revolutionary change in the marketing industry. Millennials are no longer the passive recipients of information, but themselves act as a source of information by actively voicing their opinions on different social media platforms through tweets, posts, blogs, reviews, videos, and much more. The millennials are diverting themselves away from traditional advertisement channels and are getting engrossed in the social media platforms for being up to date with all the latest information. The stupendous impact of social media advertising on our lifestyles compelled us to explore its repercussions on millennials's preferences. The paper attempted to examine the magnitude of social media advertising, and how different social media platforms were used by companies to influence the millennials's preferences. The paper was based on a descriptive and inferential research design and a close ended questionnaire was used to collect primary data from social media users. The paper revealed the respondents' preferences for using social media websites as they regularly read blogs, used social media platforms for comparison of different products, sought opinions of experts before buying a product, and the number of likes and dislikes had a significant impact on their choices. Also, the relationships between different demographic factors and social media advertising were explored, which can be effective for the marketers to frame their advertising strategies for varied target groups. © 2018, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Marketers tend to shell out mind boggling amounts to rope in celebrities for brand endorsements. Some Indian cricketers and Bollywood actors have become money minting machines as a result of this trend. The million-dollar question that begs an answer is: Are celebrity endorsements worth it? This question has intrigued many followers of marketing and has made the subject of celebrity endorsements a widely researched one. This paper explored the impact of celebrity endorsement announcements on the stock prices of the firms by examining 36 brand endorsement announcements. The celebrity endorsement announcements under study were made in India between 2008 and 2015. The standard event study methodology was followed to examine whether cumulative abnormal returns accrued to firms on the announcement day, (-1, +1) window, (-2, +2) event window, (-5, +5) event window, (-10, +10) event window, and (-40, +40) event window. The study found little evidence to establish that positive and substantial cumulative abnormal returns were accrued to firms when celebrity endorsement contracts were made public. Neitherthe firms in the consumer goods industry nor in the automobile industry were beneficiaries of celebrity endorsement contracts. The gender of the celebrity or the type of celebrity did not have any significant impact on the cumulative returns recorded by firms in different event windows at the time of announcement of such contracts. The returns recorded by firms that followed a corporate branding strategy as well as firms that followed a house of brands strategy were not statistically different from zero.","Advertising; Celebrity endorsements; Corporate branding; Cumulative abnormal returns; Event study; House of brands; Marketing; Stock market reaction",""

In this context, this study aimed at understanding the factors influencing the mobile wallet customers' satisfaction and motivations behind the continued usage of a specific service provider. Further, the study attempted to identify the differences in behavioural characteristics of mobile wallet users based on their gender. A conceptual model was developed to measure the impact of three significant variables, that is, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and confirmation on the post-adoption behaviour of mobile wallet customers. The data were collected from 325 mobile wallet customers through a popular online survey website. The analysis of data using structural equation modeling provided certain important insights, including the positive and strong influence of perceived ease of use on both satisfaction and continuance intention, and satisfaction was found to be the key factor that motivated mobile wallet users to continue using a particular mobile wallet application.

The present study attempted to do a comparative analysis between the effectiveness of advertisements with unconventional messages with that of normal advertisements. In this study, the hierarchy of effects model (Lavidge & Steiner, 1961) was used for measuring the effectiveness of the advertisements which added some unconventional flavours in the ads and delivered messages to break norms. An empirical study based on one-group pre-test post-test experiment was done in June - July 2018, where several unconventional advertisements were shown along with other conventional advertisements among a group of 115 viewers. A structured questionnaire having established scales was utilized to measure the effectiveness of unconventional advertisements in terms of three dimensions of hierarchy of effects model - cognitive component (awareness, knowledge); affective component (liking, preference); and conative component (conviction, purchase). Data were analyzed with the help of Excel and SPSS by using statistical techniques like mean, standard deviation, ranking, regression analysis, Z - test, and ANOVA. The results confirmed that there were significant differences observed in case of all three dimensions along with ad appeal, ad recall, ad references, message impact between the advertisements with unconventional messages and normal advertisements.

This study used structured equation modelling to determine cues that lead to e - loyalty, which eventually results in customers repurchasing from the same e-tailer. Data were collected from 317 online consumers using a structured questionnaire, which showed that product offerings, convenience, past purchase experience, and web-store environment had a significant impact on e - loyalty.

Similarly, the approach-avoidance behavior of customers was influenced by manipulating their moods with the use of scents.

For effective advertising, it is important to understand how consumers perceive different e-advertising formats. Previous studies have confirmed that consumers have significantly different perceptions across formats. The present study investigated consumers' perception of six e-advertising formats (banner ads, pop-ups, keyword search, sponsorships, interstitials, e-mail) in terms of five perceptual measures (information value, entertainment value, trustworthiness, offensiveness, and effect on product price). It was found that consumers' perceptions across e-advertising formats were different and each e-advertising format was perceived differently on each perceptual measure understudy.","Consumers' perception; e-advertising; E-advertising formats; Internet users",""

We developed a questionnaire using established scales of these constructs and took a survey in which a responder picked a brand and indicated his/her attachment to the brand; the other constructs were also measured through this questionnaire. The results indicated that there is a relationship among selected constructs developed for the psychology field, but that no relationship was able to be established between the marketing-area-developed construct of brand attachment and the plausibly related variety of psychology-area-developed constructs.","Anxious attachment; Attachment theory; Avoidant attachment; Brand attachment; Need to belong",""

The framework was tested with primary data by obtaining structural equation modeling results to measure the correlation among the constructs, and chi-square results and goodness of fit indices were also analyzed. We conducted a survey of 472 Indian nationals across India to collect primary data. Data analysis found a very good fit of our model and obtained support for almost all the hypotheses.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Data collected from 312 dissatisfied inpatients who were admitted and discharged from various 100+ bedded private and cooperative hospitals across Kerala revealed that a majority dissuaded from overt complaining behaviours despite dissatisfaction. Instead, they resorted to covert complaining behaviours like engaging in negative word of mouth with friends, relatives, or other inpatients ; switching behaviour ; exit ; or just keeping silent. Findings: Factor analysis revealed that 'powerlessness' and 'subservient' attitude perceived by inpatients in hospitals deterred them from overt complaining behaviours like voicing, seeking third party redressal, or legal action. Bivariate analysis found out that while a significant difference could be established between dissatisfied inpatients holding different levels of occupation, admitted to hospitals belonging to various zones and with different levels of medical awareness, no true difference was observed between respondents possessing different socioeconomic and demographic status, nature of action resorted, admitted in different types of hospitals, and various durations of hospital stay with respect to their levels of perceived disempowerment. Research Limitations/ Implications: The fact that patients are disempowered gives an upper hand to the provider, principally in a credence service like health care. As the respondents who participated in the survey opted to either switch provider or engage in negative word-of-mouth with friends and relatives than overtly complaining, their actions can be viewed as unfavorable from the health care providers' perspective. Practical Implications: Only if the hospitals know that they have caused some sort of discomfort or dissatisfaction to their customers will they get an opportunity to rectify their mistakes.

This study compared BUB to the existing fixed data (FD) approach. Random assignment allocated 608 respondents one of the three methods: ACA, ACBC, and a self-explicated scale. Though the predictive accuracy of the research method improved using the BUB approach, the current research was more important, as an illustration, of how product feature surveys can impact market shares earlier in a product's life cycle than is possible now with most forms of conjoint. Where brand managers can single out one or two popular features that the public is not aware of, marketing messages can increase sales without a product re-design. In the case of traditional conjoint surveys, brand managers are limited to predicting changes in market share that would result from a new combination of features, rather than changing beliefs about existing products. If a manager finds that his/her product has a popular feature that consumers are unaware of, that feature becomes the advertising focus. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.

This study revealed that the behavioual intentions primarily depend upon the attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. Loss of income, fear of losing a job, and lucrative incentives offered by insurance companies motivate agents to push the products by engaging in unscrupulous practices that violate the ethical norms. Hence, the sales managers should uphold a high moral attitude among sales agents, foster a diminution in unethical behaviour, and also provide extensive ethics training for establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with their customers to accomplish long-term profitability.","Agents; Commission; Customer orientation; Distribution channels; Insurance; Sales behavioral intentions",""

As far as dissemination behavior of the respondents is concerned, 'perceived quality of products in the video' and 'multimedia effect' were found as the two main factors (ranked 1st and 2nd, respectively) inducing the participants to forward the video of Amway products. To generalize the results pertaining to viral advertisements of brands, a second study was conducted on the same set of respondents to explore general factors which motivated them to share viral advertisements on YouTube, social networking sites, etc. These factors included Content of the Video & Feel Good Factor, Intellectual Stimuli, Multimedia Effect & Simplicity of Task, and Concern for Society. Among these factors, the factor: Multimedia Effect & Simplicity of Task had the highest mean score. However, the major findings of both the studies were similar, suggesting some important implications for marketers. © 2018 Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

For this study, subsistence marketplace was defined as composed of households earning less than $ 8000 per month and clustered in slum areas. A survey of such 600 households clustered in six different slum areas of Delhi was conducted. This study constructed the marketing - mix for non-core or compensatory construct of food items. This study not only redefined the marketing - mix, but also determined the impact of identified marketing- mix constructs on purchase satisfaction and analyzed whether the relationship was moderated by BOP consumers’ participation in the social network. The key findings emerged in the form of a redefined marketing - mix comprising of: Value of Offer, Convenience, Quality Food, and Social Sources of Information. A significant direct influence of marketing mix variables on purchase satisfaction was observed. The participation in the social network significantly moderated the relationship between consumers’ satisfaction and price-mix and promotional-mix elements. This study stressed the need to use the social network for ethical market exchanges. It marks an integral step towards the inclusion of the long-forgotten BOP market in the mainstream, thereby improving their standard of living.

However, due to a complex market scenario, intense competition, and ever-changing consumer dynamics, sustainability is skeptical. Hence, online retailers are extremely focused on the loyalty aspect of buyers. In the context of the same, it is pivotal for marketers to identify those factors that foster e-tail patronage behavior amongst online buyers. According to the National Statistical Survey, more than 50% of India's population is below the age of 25 years. Therefore, this study was designed to specifically examine the e-patronage behavior of generation Z, who form the core of India's population. The objective of this research was to explore those factors of an e-tail store that are pivotal in developing a sense of loyalty among online shoppers. Steered by the stimulus-organism-response model and existing literature, this paper investigated e-tail patronage behavior of generation Z consumers by emphasizing on three variables, namely; e-tail store atmospherics, e-tail service quality, and merchandise & patronage intentions. Survey data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire from a total of 371 respondents. The responses were analyzed using SPSS package 20.0. The results depicted nine prominent factors, which facilitate e-tail patronage. A significant correlation between the same and criterion variable was also revealed. The outcomes further revealed that e-merchandise elements were negatively associated with e-patronage intentions; rather, e-service quality and e-tail atmospheric components positively predicted consumer e-patronage. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

To combat this situation, green marketing was adopted by the entire supply chain. Retailers being a part of the supply chain retaliated by introducing green products in their product line. They pressurized intermediaries and manufacturers to upgrade their upstream performance of green marketing as well as influenced consumers to buy environment friendly and sustainable products. Their role as mediators between manufacturers and consumers created a positive response towards green marketing, which is evident in the literature. However, there was an existing gap regarding which factors provide the retailers a sustainable competitive advantage for selling green products. The rationale for the study was to pin down the factors that resulted in a sustainable competitive advantage for retailers.

Drawing on the sematic influence of type font framework, three independent experimental studies involving two types of typographical fonts • Pepita MT and Logan were conducted. Also, four primary colors were introduced in the study to explore the effect of color independently on brand personality and interaction of the same with typography and their synergistic effect on brand personality. Design/Methodology/Approach: A hypothetical brand name ""Tidame"" was introduced in the study. The brand name was invented and had no previous existence in the market place. All the hypothesized dimensions were tested on two different product categories-fashion apparels and glue stick. The Study 1 explored the effect of type of typography on brand personality. The Study 2 examined the effect of color on brand personality. The Study 3 probed how color and typography, when taken together, affected brand personality. A random sample of around 200 individuals was selected. Out of the received responses, 155 were complete responses. They were further analyzed statistically using SPSS 20. This research was carried out in between December 2015 and February 2016. Findings: Typography of the brand name, when independently taken, did not show any significant effect on brand personality. Color was a determining factor in brand personality in both the product categories. Also, the interactive effect of font type and color in forming perceptions of brand personality, especially in the case of fashion apparel, was evidently concluded. Research Limitations/Implications: The limitation of this research was the small size of the sample restricted to just one region of India. Practical Implications: The most important practical viewpoint of the study is that it provides the managers an understanding of color and typography in forming perceptions about brand personality.

As the milk consumers in the study area were very much concerned about the product oriented factors at the time of purchase of milk and milk products, utmost care and attention of the milk producers and distributors on these factors would certainly ensure maximization of profitability by exploiting the potential still untapped in this industry. © 2018 Indian Journal of Marketing.","Milk derivatives; Modern retail formats; Non-branded milk; Operation Flood; Value added versions",""

However, the effectiveness of these advertisements has been interrogated by many. Lower acceptance of advertisements has been one of the major challenges faced by the marketers. Henceforth, it is vital to understand the critical factors influencing the consumers’ attitude towards social media advertisements. This study thus identified and analyzed the factors influencing behavioral intention of the consumers concerning social media advertisements. The constructs like corporate reputation, emotional appeal, informativeness, creativity, irritation, and materialism were considered to affect the attitude, which in turn influenced the behavioral intention of consumers. The study was carried out in a semi-urban city of Karnataka, South India and the data were collected from 217 respondents. The analysis was carried out using the partial least square approach. The results indicated that the two factors - creativity and informativeness had a significant influence on the attitude of the consumers towards social media advertisements. The study further analyzed the moderating role of the factor- ‘gender1 between the identified constructs and attitude. The results revealed the existence of differences among the male and female respondents towards the advertisements. Further, based on these outcomes, appropriate practical implications of the findings were discussed. Subsequently, this study will certainly help in gaining better insights into the consumers’ perception towards social media advertisements and will assist the marketers in framing effective advertisement strategies. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Many local companies are often found to be impetuous in launching their own brands of a molecule that commands a luring market size and is on its growth trajectory. The huge number of oral Rabeprazole and Vitamin D3 brands can be cited as two of the many molecules in the market today, standing as testimonies to the fact. Today, we have 484 and 648 brands of Rabiprazole and Vitamin D3 brands, respectively in the market as updated in medindia.net [Med lndia(2016a) and Med India (2016b)]. Such typical ideas towards executing new brandregistrations and their subsequent market-launch has left its heavy toll on companies' marketing team for the dearth of any brand differentiation. Das (2010) observed that there is an enormous gap between those companies that claim to be customerfocused and those which actually are. Hence, not much value creation-either for the doctors or their patients-is made possible by most companies. With a view to create value for the doctors, we conducted this study by focusing upon one clinical-challenge area (i.e. lower extremity infections) to recognize the clinical needs around that and ascertain if a new injectable antibiotic launch with a targeted promotion in the indication would create a lucrative niche for a marketing company. Based on our findings, we concluded that ""need based target marketing"" may well turn out as the game changer for pharmaceutical companies. The most significant outcome of our study was the recognition of the possible lucrative niche market for injectable antibiotics that is presented by hospitalized patients with lower extremity infections (LEIs).","Injectable antibiotics; LEIs; Linezolide; Lower extremity infections; Piperacillin plus Tazobactum; Target marketing",""

The brands selected for analysis were Ambuja, UltraTech, Shree, JK, Binani, Nirmax, Wonder, Birla, and Coromandel cement brands. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique was used to plot a two-dimensional brand positioning graph using R. Besides positioning, this study also identified factors that are most influential in determining the choice of the cement brand selected by customers. The perceptual map showed three clear groups. Ambuja and UltraTech cement brands, which formed a group were preferred for major projects by engineers; Wonder, Coromandel, and Binani cement brands formed another group; and the rest of the brands clustered into a third group.

It explored the role of accessibility, corporate image, demographic characteristics, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, trust, and website quality in framing consumers' intention to use IB. Design/Methodology/Approach: Based on existing literature, 31 predictor variables were tested for the study. Cronbach's alpha test and factor loading estimates were used to assess the construct reliability and convergent validity of the scale. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire from a convenient sample of 250 retail bank customers. Exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression techniques were applied to the data obtained. Findings: Of the 31 predictor variables tested, 25 were found to be significant for the study. Additionally, out of the seven factors obtained, three of them were found to significantly impact IB-adoption in India. These were Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Trust, and Perceived Quality. The study also indicated low adoption of Internet banking in India. Practical Implications: The results affirmed the applicability of the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989). The three significant factors in the study can help in formulating customer engagement strategies to accept and use IB services in India. The utmost significant inference for the Indian banking industry is not only to provide hassle-free IB services, but to also build a relationship with its customers based on trust and provide a fast and easy to access website portal. Originality/Value: The model formulated established the level of acceptance for IB in India, which is a valuable contribution to the adoption theories across the globe.

The enthusiasm of the consumers has risen along with the pollution caused due to these festivities. Promotions by the marketers and fireworks industry further give a buoyancy to this fervour. Metros like Delhi are one of the first few where the pollution level during festivals has acquired dangerous proportions. In 2016, several festivals were concentrated in the month of October.

Multiple discriminant analysis administered in the research was able to make out the perceptual differences of readers based on their newspaper choices. The findings suggested the presence of two dimensions of discrimination among the newspaper brands - language simplicity and news credibility on one side and political bias and coverage of news on the other end. Language simplicity along with political reasons separated Malayalam newspaper brands from the leading English dailies, while the latter were favored in terms of the quality of news contents.

Today, with the availability of the Internet, smart phones, and tablets, the patterns of customer buying have changed. There are numerous apps and websites available to help customers find the right product, recommendations, offers and discounts at the click of a button anywhere, anytime. The boundaries of retail channels are eroding-a customer could be standing in a retail store and accessing information and offers available on a website. In the current scenario, shoppers are not just shopping online, but are merging their online and offline shopping practices. There are multiple channels available to customers and they, at a time, access one channel while in the middle of another channel, like accessing a mobile app from a store. Brick and mortar (B&M) retailers also face a continuous challenge from e-commerce retailers, who work with lower overhead costs and provide the best deals to customers on every purchase. Considering the paucity of literature and lack of adequate research on omni-channel in the Indian context, and emergence of implementing a true omni-channel strategy as a tool for the full integration of the offline and the online customer shopping experience, this study was undertaken to analyze the factors which influenced the purchase intent of the customer in omni-channel buying. Both qualitative and quantitative research was carried out to arrive at the variables, and hypotheses and statistical packages such as Excel and SPSS were employed to test the hypotheses. From this study, it emerged that in an omni-channel approach to consumer purchase intent by an Indian consumer, for it to be impactful, it must be supported by systems that make the order status visible to customers. There is likely to be a better buyer response if the product codes of the product across channels are the same. Further locationbased promotions positively impacted purchase intent. Companies would, therefore, benefit by adopting digital strategies that augment consistent product codes across channels, real time tracking of orders, and location based promotions based upon this research.","Brick & mortar; Digital marketing; E-commerce; Indian consumer; Multi channel; Omni-channel; Shopping behavior",""

To measure the dimensions of consumer based brand equity, a 13 item scale was constructed and validated using EFA and CFA. The scale exhibited convergent and discriminant validity. Measurement invariance test was conducted to examine the proposed brand equity dimensions as an indicator of the same latent variable for different airlines companies. Findings of the invariance test confirmed the equivalence of factorial measure across different airline brands. After the study, the model was validated through secondorder factor analysis.

Prior research in bundling as a new product introduction strategy primarily focused upon the role of functional attributes on consumers' evaluation of the bundle. However, in the context of brand extension and co-branding literature, it was inferred that in addition to the functional benefits, brands also provide symbolic benefits to the consumers, and studying symbolic aspects of this strategy is very essential. Therefore, the objective of the paper was to develop and propose a model that studied the roles of symbolic (self-congruity) and functional (functional congruity) benefits on consumers' bundle purchase intention when bundling was used as a new-product introduction strategy.

Five different constructs were extracted from literature for measuring intention to purchase hybrid cars in India, including seeking green products information, self image effects, social value of hybrid car purchase, emissions importance, and social value of green product purchases that is associated with owning a hybrid car in India. Partial least square structural equation modeling was incorporated to establish the relationship model. The results indicate that Indian consumers showed relatively high purchase intention towards hybrid cars. Our analysis found that seeking green product information, social value of hybrid car purchase, and social value of green product purchase is positively associated with hybrid car purchase intention among Indian consumers. However, self image effects and emission importance emerge to be negatively associated with hybrid car purchase intention.

The sustainable coffee production experienced a phenomenal growth over the past decade. However, the volumes of sales represent only a minor portion of production. Less than 25% of sustainable coffee produced was 'actually sold' as sustainable, while the remaining was just sold as 'ordinary' conventional coffee, without receiving any extra market benefits. Among the individual coffee certification initiatives, 4C (Common Codes for Coffee Community) signaled a more serious over-supply in the global market, wherein only 6% of its overall sustainable production was actually sold as sustainable over 2008-12. During the same period, Utz coffee certification could sell 25%, Rainforest Alliance (RFA) could trade 50%, and organic certified coffee could sell 55% of its standard-compliant production as sustainable. The study revealed that global sustainable coffee market is characterized by massive 'over-supply'; demand being a major constraint. Underpinning this issue is the need for sustainable coffee market. The current market challenge is to stabilize mismatch between demand and supply for sustainable coffee. From a sustainable development perspective, this remains a serious matter of concern for policy makers, public institutions, and multi-stakeholders to engage in market-based control mechanism in constructing effective 'supply- management base' as a strategy for price-stabilization and to enhance further sustainable growth. At a micro level in India, coffee certification is still at an infancy stage, contributing to just 2% of total global sustainable production. The Indian Coffee Board and apex coffee organizations need to work in this direction to encourage both sustainable production and marketing, so as to assist growers in assessing preferential market benefits, besides supporting high quality 'Indian coffee' being traded at both the global and domestic levels. © 2016.","Certification; Markets; Price premiums; Standards; Sustainable coffee",""

Often, it is mistaken as only creating discipline in the class, but it is about engaging students in a meaningful and effective learning environment through discipline. According to LaCaze, McCormick, and Meyer (2012), creation and maintenance of a productive classroom environment is what teaching competency primarily depends upon. Those teaching practices should be adopted/used that can make students learn effectively. In other words, teaching practices should be supported by evidence that they are effective. There are two major challenges here. One is to identify effective classroom management practices backed by evidence. Second is to categorize them in terms of their contribution towards learning. Categorization helps in chalking out a plan to effectively manage a classroom (Yadav, Jain, Shukla, Avikal, & Mishra, 2013). This paper identified effective classroom management practices through a thorough literature review followed by categorization of different classroom management practices' contribution in learning through Kano's model, which provides a two-dimensional view of service quality wherein components of service quality can be categorized in terms of contribution towards customer satisfaction, which is very significant as students do assess service quality (Gupta, 2016). This paper would help academia in improving learning of students in a typical business school classroom environment through categorization of evidence based classroom management practices.","Classroom management; Customer satisfaction; Evidence; Kano's model; Service quality; Teaching practices",""

The buyer may even alter his/her preference in case the options to choose from increase or decrease in a given frame. A significant area of contribution to this subject has been done by Prospect Theory (PT), which highlights the impact of the reference point's influence. The reference point enables a decision maker to evaluate the outcomes of his/her decision, that is, is the decision increasing my gains or reducing my losses ? Changes of frames, therefore, in substance altera decision maker's choice.

The research gap of mediating nature of associations and perceived quality and their role in converting the customers from the awareness stage to loyalty was the focus of this research. Customer based retailer equity is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct comprising of : retailer awareness, retailer associations, retailer perceived quality, and retailer loyalty. A questionnaire based survey was conducted among the female customers of the major apparel retail stores in Coimbatore. The empirical analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation among the four dimensions of retailer equity. The hierarchical regression analysis was carried out by meeting the four requirements of Baron and Kenny (1986) for the mediator variables. Retailer association and retailer perceived quality were found to be acting as mediators between retailer awareness and retailer loyalty relationship, as the effect of retailer awareness was found to be remarkably lower and became non significant in the final model. This research paper highlighted three important theoretical contributions to retailer equity. First, the paper empirically tested the retailer equity model in the Indian retail context. Second, it explained the interrelationships among the four dimensions of retailer equity. Third, the paper attempted to fill in the gap of retailer equity research by demonstrating the existence of potential causal order of relationships among retailer equity dimensions as in the brand equity literature. The conceptual and practical outcome of the empirical results is that the four dimensions can be bundled together as marketing strategies. Strong retail brand awareness will help the retailers to attract customers into the store for the first time. However, a customer is converted into a loyal customer based upon the strength of favorable associations created by the retailers and by meeting the customers' quality expectations. © 2016.","Customer based retailer equity; Hierarchical regression; Retailer association; Retailer awareness; Retailer loyalty; Retailer perceived quality",""

Therefore, understanding the rural consumer behavior and the process of decision-making has acquired significant attention and there has been a rise in the importance of private corporate big giants as the rural consumers started buying/consuming everything that was meant for the urban market. Keeping these changes in mind, the present paper tried to ascertain whether-there is any significant difference of opinion between the genders regarding the decision making process; the paper intended to find the different factors' (primitive) influence on the rural consumers and the places where these primitive factors influence; and also attempted to gain knowledge regarding the exclusive consumer decision making process of the rural consumer. The study took into account the opinion of 125 respondents from two taluks of Shimoga district, Karnataka. The data were analyzed with the help of SPSS v 20 software.

This case study attempted to find if a milk producer company can be an alternative to traditional milk cooperatives or if both of them can coexist? The study focused on exploring the structural and operative differences between two institutions, assessing their profitability, and identifying the constraints facing their development. The study will be useful to the management of both institutions. The study revealed that milk producer companies could be an available alternative to milk cooperatives. However, the presence of both in the study area brought more milk to the organized sector, reducing the exploitation of milk producers by private dairies and milk vendors in terms of prices, milk weighing, and timely payment. There is a win-win situation for the farmers, which can further be strengthened by strong coordination between two institutions. However, it seems quite difficult as both organizations operate in the same region, and therefore, business competition cannot be ruled out. The milk producer company, unlike a cooperative, makes payment through a bank account, which has created a strong perception of its transparent operations in the minds of milk producers. The same needs to be practiced by dairy cooperatives too. It was observed that traditional milk cooperatives paid slightly higher procurement price, but appeared not to attract milk producers. © 2016.","Dairy cooperatives; Gujarat; Milk procurement price; Milk producer company; Structural and operative differences",""

It is found in every home, whether upper, middle, or low class of society. Television viewing is quite common these days. Children today spend a maximum of their free time watching television where they are exposed to a large number of advertisements. They watch almost 2-3 hours of television everyday, which includes their favourite cartoons and other programmes. The number of TV running homes has come a long way; more than 100 million TV households have been accounted for so far. Accessibility to television is increasing day by day and has been accepted by the society. A variety of programmes are available round the clock. Many targeted programmes and commercials on television are attracting more and more number of children towards it. Television viewing brings about cognitive development and conveys knowledge, skills, and information to children. It encourages learning and imparts overall awareness. It brings about both theoretical and concrete thinking and initiates change in behaviour and attitudes. Hence, the beneficial and adverse effects of television is a matter of great concern. Television viewing has negative impacts too. It may place children in passive roles. It dissuades them from reading, playing, exercising, studying, and so forth. It decreases actual social communication and develops violent and destructive behaviour in children (Gupta, Saini, Acharya & Miglani, 1994). This study was conducted to take note of TV viewing behaviour among children from urban and rural areas of Goa. A sample of 200 children of 6-12 years of age across Goa was selected. It was found that more number of children in rural areas watched advertisements as compared to their urban counterparts. On an average, children watched 2 hours or less of TV daily; while on holidays, they watched TV for more than 3 hours. As age advances, children's interest towards television decreases. It was also observed that parents discussed about TV advertisements more with girls and older children and that too only when their children enquired about it from them. © 2016.","Children; Rural; TV advertisements; TV viewing; Urban",""

Such potential profitability has attracted the attention of marketers, who aggressively target children in their quest for markets and products. Marketers disregard the human aspects in the process of exploiting the vulnerabilities of children, leading us to the argument that 'marketing to children' is a reflection of 'institutional psychopathy'. Psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder involves major abnormality characterized by lack of empathy, inappropriate behaviour, and indifference to rights and feelings of others. When businesses, the powerful institutions of our society, exhibit these characteristics, they are termed 'institutional psychopaths'. In this paper, the diagnostic checklist for antisocial personality disorder issued by the American Psychiatric Association in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was applied to argue that marketers targeting children are in fact psychopaths, exhibiting psychological abnormalities. On application of the checklist, it was found that marketers targeting children scored a perfect seven on the diagnostic checklist, a definite reflection of 'institutional psychopathy'. © 2016, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

This can be attributed to negligible marketing communication of private labels. Thus, this study was aimed to know whether extrinsic cues like perceived private label quality, perceived private label price, perceived store image had any impact on attitude of customers towards private labels' quality and customer satisfaction. The results showed that perceived private label price and perceived store image, unlike perceived private label quality, positively affected attitude of customers towards private label quality, and eventually, customer satisfaction.

While software players are visible giants, remarkable consistency in improvement was found in manufacturing also, and some exceptional firms were found in the auto sector. Considering the vast pool of Indian marketing and other professionals - some may be effective in international markets - the FIOs should try to balance trade through scale-up in exports.

The main purpose of this paper was to compare three different quantitative forecasting methods and develop a monthly short term sales forecasting model specifically on shoes of A-Shoe Company, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Twelve months (December 2013 - November 2014) sales data (of different types of pair of shoes) was collected from the company. From quantitative forecasting methods, a time-series model, that is, moving average, weighted moving average, and exponential smoothing were used to predict monthly sales forecast for the month of December 2014. Trend equation was formulated by using the least square regression method; analysis was done along with standard error of estimate. Prediction interval limits at 95% level of confidence were calculated. Exponential smoothing forecasting method (with alpha value 0.1) was found to be fit when comparing different mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE). The forecasted shoe sales value was found to be within the prediction interval limits. ANOVA results revealed that the calculated value of F (9.34) was less than the table value of F (10.04). Hence, the null hypothesis (b = 0) is accepted. The resulting forecasting method can be used to provide a framework to forecast sales, specifically for national and international products and can position an organization's manufacturing services by designing the manufacturing service.","ANOVA; Confidence level; Quantitative forecasting methods; Sales forecasting; Shoe demand marketing",""

""Chief Minister Insurance Scheme for life saving treatments"" in Tamil Nadu is one of the innovative health insurance schemes introduced by Tamil Nadu Government in 2009 for below poverty line (BPL) families covering a population of 14 million with an annual income of INR 72000 (USD 1400 ; 1 USD = 50 INR in 2009) or less. The scheme was implemented through 663 hospitals (20 public sector hospitals and 643 private hospitals). This scheme assures treatment and saves peoples' lives from 51 types of diseases. This study is the second part of a study that is aimed at studying the public - private partnership in health care with specific reference to the ""Chief Minister Insurance Scheme for life saving treatments"" scheme of Tamil Nadu, India. While the first part looked at awareness and satisfaction, the present study focused on its impact through qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The study indicated the impact that the scheme has created in the lives of the people is significant. People who cannot afford treatment from the private hospitals are now highly dependent on this scheme for their health care needs.","Awareness; Chief minister insurance scheme; Government aided health insurance; Private public partnership (PPP); Satisfaction; Social marketing; Tamil nadu",""

Of late, however, the education sector has become one of the most sought-after businesses for both novice entrepreneurs as well as established players of corporate India. These are pouring money into the said sector to fetch reasonable return on their investment. The traditionally reliable state players too have started making efforts to add on to their image of reliable education providers. Already, it has become a debatable issue as to whether the private universities would be able to match the state owned universities on the reliability front and how will these counterthe extremely low fees being charged by them. State universities, on the other hand, also have a task cut out for them as to how these will counterthe excessive promotion being done by private entrants and deal with the tangibles created by the private players. The best way under the prevailing circumstances is to impart quality in educational services. The present study essentially aimed at assessing service quality as perceived by the students of selected state owned and private universities in the state of Haryana. Research Type: Empirical; Model Used: Self-Designed Findings: Both the sample state as well as the private university of Haryana had not yet come up to the expectations of the students on various service quality dimensions. Comparatively speaking, the relative position of the state university was better on the following fronts - service bonding, service value, service security, and service competence. The sample private university had a slight edge on service impressiveness and service promptness fronts. Practical Implications: The Indian education service providers should start viewing service quality from the viewpoint of the students and start bringing in necessary changes in their existing endeavours on the said front. Research Limitations: The technicalities involved in understanding the concept of service quality might have acted as a handicap forthe students in giving prompt and accurate answers to the questions at hand.","Service bonding; Service quality; Service value",""

The sequential aspect of entrance into the market leads to ""the first mover bias."" This leads to initial entrants' capturing large surpluses and removes the incentive for latter entrants to enter the market, resulting in less than full market penetration under complete information. The lack of information on the competing sellers, mixed with a signaling mechanism and an upstream commission for recruitment, creates an incentive to send false signals. This leads to entrants with resulting negative profits. Depending on the parameters of the model, this can lead to a very large percentage of participants to be negative earners with a small percentage reaping large rewards. These results indicate that stricter discloser laws regarding the number of participants and their earnings should be considered. Furthermore, if such laws are enforced, multilevel marketing firms will need to seek alternative payment schemes to ensure market saturation of their products. © 2015.","Economic model; Lack of information; Multilevel marketing; Sequential entrance",""

The state-owned telecom player Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) needs to wake up to the reality and realize the importance of satisfying and retaining the customers. The service providers design and deploy customer centric strategies not only to grab a huge amount of the market share, but also to sustain themselves in the long-term. Banks have relationship managers, airlines have frequent flyer programs, credit cards offer redeemable bonus points for increased card usage, hotels have personalized services, and telecom service operators provide customized services to their users. Relationship marketing is emerging as the core marketing activity for businesses operating in fiercely competitive environments. On an average, every business spends nine times more to acquire customers than it does to keep an existing customer with itself. Firms are now paying more attention to their relationships with customers to retain them and to increase their share of customers' purchases. Although customized as well as off-the-shelf technological solutions are available in the marketplace, businesses need to do a lot more than just adopt these solutions to implement customer relationship management (CRM) practices with the aim of reducing the gap between the company and its customers. Today, the Indian telecom industry suffers from major problems of customer attrition in the name of ""number portability"" because of multiple service providers or close substitutes with zero or less switching costs. Hence, it is inevitable for the companies to develop a CRM strategy that enables them to improve their customer database and also improves the number of loyal customers. In the light of this context, the present research attempted to study CRM practices followed by the major public and private sectortelecom service providers in India, that is, BSNL and Airtel.","Cost efficiency; Customer relationship management; Profit efficiency; Service quality",""

In Australia, free buses have been introduced in selected places to protect the nature of the city, but not for office commuters. Malaysia is unique in the sense that the free bus service is funded by the government as an alternative for commuting to ease the traffic woes. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors influencing the utilization of the free bus service since the free bus service is underutilized by 55% even after 2 years of its implementation in Malaysia. This study examined the relationship between five independent variables (predictors) namely, perceived ease of use (PE), perceived usefulness (PU), moral obligations (MO), subjective norm (SN), and financial incentives (FIN) on the intention to utilize the free bus service. From the current empirical study of 142 respondents, 60.6% were utilizing the free bus service, and 39.4% were non-users. The results showed that PE, PU, MO, and SN significantly influenced the intention to use the free bus service. It is worthwhile to mention that FIN did not statistically influence the intention to use the free bus service. It clearly indicates that people will not take it for granted anything that is given free of cost. The findings strengthen the application of the decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) in predicting Malaysian commuters' behavior. The research findings also indicate that people have started taking note of the environmental problems and the ultimate benefits of using public transport for primary travel to resolve traffic congestion issues. © 2016.","Intention to use free bus; Moral obligation; Perceived usefulness; Subjective norm",""

To meet this demand, the green revolution became the cornerstone of India's agricultural achievement that transformed India from a food-deficient to a self-sufficient country. This self-sufficiency was achieved through an indiscriminate and excessive use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Overexploitation of natural and non-renewable resources, indiscriminate and irrational use of synthetic inputs like chemical fertilizers and pesticides for producing more and more food products has impaired the ecological balance and has put the health of the consumers in jeopardy. Therefore, the apparent contradiction of necessity for nutritional safety on the one hand and environmental sustainability on the other made it inevitable to resort to alternative food products like organic food products. However, the growth of the organic food sector is not upto the mark in India due to lack of awareness among consumers. Thus, this study analyzed the consumers' level of awareness about organic food products in Coimbatore District. A disproportionate stratified random sampling method was used, and a total of 550 respondents were surveyed by using a questionnaire. The results showed that 40.5% and 38.4% of the respondents were aware and partly aware about organic food products, and only 14% of the respondents were highly aware about the same. Thus, awareness acts as a crucial factor in changing the attitude of consumers towards organic foods.","Consumer awareness; Green revolution; Organicfoods",""

This marketing strategy is slowly penetrating into the markets of developing countries and has the potential to become a driving force in the field of social marketing. Companies cannot hope to succeed in another country simply by applying the successful model of a different country. Corporations need to have country-specific data of consumers' opinions so that they can come up with appropriate marketing strategies. Since the contribution to the cause is directly related to the sales and profit, consumers can sometimes be sceptic about the companies' motives behind these strategies or choose to support them too. However, at the end, these strategies are extremely crucial in creating a pragmatic approach in luring the customers' choice in an extremely competitive environment.

Evidence pointed out at the homogenization of product-consumer relation as well as existing character- character and character - consumer relations across durables, non-durables, or other identified sponsors.

Flanker or fighter brands are mostly second-order brands after the main or flagship brand to have their own identity and deter competitors to introduce lower priced substitutes of the main brand of a company. The entire rationality of the flanking strategy rests on competitive strategies of a company and the intended positioning of a brand from consumer perceptions and behavior. There are many such success stories that are available in marketing literature. For example, Pentium & Celeron from Intel; Pampers & Luvs from P&G; Lays & Cheetos from PepsiCo; Nirma Beauty & Nima Rose from Nirma Limited, and so forth. However, flanker brands have their own set of challenges as far as proper positioning is concerned. If not done properly, it may cannibalize the flagship brand as confirmed in few unsuccessful stories. The current paper discussed different dimensions of consumer perceptions regarding the fighter brand (Nima Rose) vis-a-vis the flagship brand (Nirma Beauty) of Nirma. A qualitative ad content analysis (ACA) using qualitative analysis package AQUAD 7.0 was conducted to understand different dimensions of the brands understudy. Brand narratives from the audio-visual ad copies were gathered, transcribed, and re-storyed into meaningful frameworks across a comprehensive four dimensional model as suggested by Ringer and Thibodeau (2009) of The Verse Group. Brand stories have meanings and persuasions; however, images and aesthetics have feelings and immersion values embedded in the copies. A logical segregation of these elements from the copies could rightly explain the positioning variables of the brands.

The purpose of the present study is to study the motivational factors and experiences of the volunteers of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup held in India. The sample consisted of 153 volunteers from the 2010 Commonwealth Games and 161 volunteers from the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. To identify the motivational issues behind volunteerism, SVEMS scale was used and principal component analysis resulted in a four-factor solution. Volunteer satisfaction was measured using a 5-point Likert scale which consisted of three aspects of volunteer satisfaction as proposed by Farrell, Johnston, & Twynam (1998). This study showed that the satisfaction and motivation of volunteers were different for two different mega sporting events (single sporting event vs. multiple sporting event). The type of event for which volunteers are recruited plays an important role in deciding which factor will lead to a higher level of motivation and satisfaction for the volunteers. The organizing committee can place more emphasis on the satisfaction of the volunteers to enhance the overall experience of volunteerism to ensure that a bunch of committed volunteers are available for the next mega sporting event. Though studies in the European countries have identified the motivating factors behind volunteerism, as per our knowledge, no such study has been conducted in the Indian context to identify the motivating factors for Indian (sports) volunteers. The results of this study show that even in the Indian context, volunteer motivation and satisfaction do not depend on only one factor; rather, it is a combination of different factors which decides whether the volunteers will be satisfied from the facilities provided at such an event and whether they will be motivated to volunteer forsuch events in the future.","Experience; Mega-events; Motivation; Satisfaction; Sports; Volunteers",""

The interesting development in the field of marketing communications necessitates an inquiry into how consumers generally feel about ethics in marketing communication. An increasingly notable trend in the advertising industry is ""Celebrity Endorsements"". Against the background of celebrity endorsement theories and celebrity endorsement strategies, the research paper presents a new term ""celebrity ethics"" from the consumers' point of view. Essentially, it delineates the ""consumer perceived celebrity ethics"" as an important dimension of celebrity endorsements. More particularly, it lists celebrities who are perceived as highly ethical. Thus, we believe that the results may provide valuable inputs to advertisers as well as to socially responsible organizations that are seeking to rope in celebrities who would be ethically fitting to act as endorsers fortheir products orservices.","Celebrity endorsements; Celebrity ethics; Endorsement ethics; Perceived celebrity personal ethics; Perceived celebrity professional ethics; Source credibility; Trustworthiness",""

Importance of seafood labelling leads to better buying, better and balanced nutrition, ensuring only good-quality products are purchased by the consumers, and consumers are not deceived into purchasing sub-standard products. It was found that 92.5% of the consumers were aware of seafood labelling. Likert scale was used to rank the importance accorded to the details given on the labels of seafood products by consumers. The true nature of the product was ranked as the most important detail on the label by 100% of the respondents followed by the name of the fish/product by 97.5% of the respondents, and nutritional information was rated as the most important detail by 96.67% of the respondents. Origin of the fish/ seafood products was given the lowest ratings by 38.33% of the consumers. Furthermore, it was found that 69% of the consumers always read the seafood labels, whereas 7.5% of the consumers never read the same. Maximum likelihood estimates revealed that though the educational level of the respondents was the most important determinant of frequency of reading seafood labels, it showed a negative effect. Marginal effects of increase in income indicated an increase in likelihood of reading seafood labels more frequently; that is, always. The marginal effects in case of family size and awareness were the same. 95% of the respondents never came across any 'mislabeled seafood,' and 75% of the respondents demanded common seafood certification labels. To conclude, there is a dearth of awareness regarding seafood labelling in our country, and consumers need to be better informed about seafood labelling, its importance, and certifications.

Advertisers and NGOs today are very much familiar with the fact that the warning messages in TV commercials, hard-hitting headlines of daily adverts, and brilliantly made radio spots for public service messages can no longer lift up the spirits of the people. They also believe that nowadays, warning messages about social issues given by the conventional media can hardly get the desired response due to many reasons; therefore, the results are not pleasing. After observing the growing levels of social awareness and behavioral change in the present day consumers, advertisers have now decided to do something different on a social side to catch the attention of their consumers, and at the same time, do their bit for a good cause.

This paper attempted to investigate the influence of marketing strategies in determining the success of an enterprise while exploring market avenues for a small scale firm. The study is based on primary data collected by using a structured questionnaire. Various statistical tools like mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, chi-square, correlation, and factor analysis had been used for data analysis. Analysis of various factors influencing the internal and external business environment suggest that market aesthetics and its market demand were the most decisive factors which influenced the decision of entrepreneurs. Henceforth, it could be summated that while designing the marketing strategies for a firm, the MSMEs made an assessment of various market factors. However, the industry requires constant upgradation of information regarding the use of newer production technology and market requirements for survival in the market and for facing the global pressures.

However, attractive endorsers were found enhancing consumers' favourable attitudes in case of 'matching/congruent' attractiveness related products only. Therefore, the first objective of this conceptual paper is to frame propositions to demonstrate the congruence effect in case of spokes-characters too. Hence, in first part of the study, the propositions related to the impact of attractive/unattractive spokes-characters in terms of product types (attractiveness related vs. attractiveness un-related) have been framed. The second part of the paper is based on the 'distinctiveness' theory which says that an ad having certain stimuli different from similar ads would catch more attention of the target audience and would have a more favourable impact on consumer attitudes. Therefore, the second objective of the paper is to compare the ad- and product-based attitude of attractive human spokesperson and attractive cartoon spokes-characters in terms of product types.

Multiple regression was used for the analysis. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the levels of satisfaction in the domestic and foreign distribution channels. Findings: The results indicate that the financial dimension of satisfaction, which signifies the attractiveness of the relationship pertaining to matters like margins or return on investment, is the primary factor that drives commitment. In addition, it was found that channel member satisfaction with foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers was significantly higher than it was with domestic manufacturers. Practical Implications: This study recommends that domestic pharmaceutical companies try to take channel relationships to higher levels of collaboration, and attempt to build other dimensions of satisfaction along with the primary financial dimension. Engaging channel members on multiple platforms will build higher commitment as financial motives can easily be usurped by competitors. Indian pharma needs to focus on value added activities like marketing and distribution in orderto be globally competitive. Originality/value: The researcher was not able to find any other study exploring channel member relationships in the Indian pharma sector. Hence, this study can be said to be the first of its kind in the Indian pharmaceutical sector.","Channel member commitment; Channel member satisfaction; Pharmaceutical distribution channels; Pharmaceutical manufacturers; Pharmaceutical stockists",""

The growing competition also requires frequent innovations in the industry. High cost associated with frequent innovations may cause big setbacks to these companies if any new launch of a passenger car model fails to attract the customers' attention. A precise model specification, catering to the needs and aspirations of the customers, is.therefore, required. This paper is an effort to find out the factors that help the companies to customize their products as per varied customer needs, categorized on the basis of their socioeconomic classes such as age, city, occupation, income group, and their present car ownership status. The study investigated selected twenty variables as determinants of the customers' choice for the selection of a 1200cc car. Factor analysis (on the influencing variables) out of the said twenty variables was applied to the respective categories of customers. The analysis found varying factors that contributed differently in the customers' choice while selecting a 1200cc car. Considering these factors and their contribution, the passenger car companies, especially in the 1200cc segment, can incorporate appropriate specifications for innovation in their products.","Automobile industry; Factor analysis; Passenger car segment; Product customization",""

Retailing is gradually inching its way towards becoming the next boom industry. Organized retailing has ushered a total transformation of the whole concept of shopping in terms of consumer buying behavior. Shopping today is much more than just buying - it is an experience in itself. The retailing business in India has witnessed a huge growth due to the emergence of supermarkets as well as centrally airconditioned malls. Consumers are the major beneficiaries of the retail boom. The Indian consumer too is changing rapidly. They now have a choice to choose from a wide range of products, quality, variety, and prices. Consumers are now showing a preference for shopping malls, which enable them to shop a variety of products under one roof and offer a shopping experience in terms of ambience and entertainment. This research tried to examine the impact of shopping motives, demographical profile (age and gender) of shoppers on shopping behaviour: frequency of visits, time spent at the shopping mall, and amount spent on per visit. An attempt was also made to establish a relationship between shopping behaviour and patronage. The study results showed that shopping motives and shopping behavior of the shoppers differed by gender and generation (age group). The results also revealed that shopping behavior (frequency of visits and time spent at the shopping mall) had a positive relationship with patronage behaviour.","Hedonic and utility motives; Patronage behavior; Shopping behavior; Shopping mall; Shopping motives",""

The results of the two experimental studies showed that individual differences in need for tactile input affect purchase intentions depending upon the structure of the choice environment and familiarity levels of a brand. The well-developed knowledge structures for familiar brands allow consumers to access the diagnostic tactile cues from their memory in product assessment in an online environment. Conversely, for less familiar brands, the inaccessibility of predictive tactile cues in an online shopping environment reduces the purchase intentions. This study makes three important contributions. First, it showed that tactile inputs have a positive effect on purchase intentions in the touch environment, particularly for individuals with high levels of need for tactile input. Second, it posited that the lack of tactility can be overcome by offering familiar brands in the no-touch environment. Finally, it showed that for low need tactile input individuals, lack of tactility does not impede them from making online purchases. The paper discussed the implications of research findings and offered future research avenues along with limitations.","Brand familiarity; Online purchase; Tactile; Touch environment",""

The study found that net profit before tax had continuously increased from Rs.1754.20 lakhs to Rs.3526.03 lakhs (50.24% increase) during the last six years (2005-2010). The capacity utilization percent ranged between 74 to 79%. The financial analysis ratios, that is, gross profit to turnover was 32.63%, net profit to total turnover (27.99 %) and net profit after tax to total turnover (18.46%) were positive, return on capital employed was 10.32%, and current ratio was 1.42:1. All these economic performance indicators and financial ratios highlight the incredible economic performance and positive growth of agri-warehousing in Maharashtra. On the other hand, the warehouses are still facing a lot of constraints in their warehousing operations. The market potential for warehouse receipt financing in India was estimated at Rs.19000 crore, and also, negotiable warehouse receipt financing is facing quite a few challenges in India. Hence, the present study has suggested that training and awareness programs should be conducted for farmers, warehouse managers, and support staff; modern warehouses are the need of the hour; warehouses should complete accreditation, registration, and certification; high margins and stamp duty on warehouse receipt finance may be reduced for farmers and other depositors. Also, additional 35 million MT storage capacity may be created at the all India level by promoting private sector participation through various public- private partnership measures.","Agri-warehouses; Constraints; Economic performance; Maharashtra state warehousing corporation; Negotiable warehouse receipts finance",""

For better management of the insurance business, several Acts have been passed from time to time. Two noteworthy events in the history of life insurance are (i) the formation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India in 1956, which served as a monopoly till the year 2000 followed by (ii) the opening up of the insurance sector to the private players in 1999, who were given the permission to operate either single-handedly or as a joint venture with any other private player(s) and/or foreign partner. This drastic regulatory change brought an end to the monopoly status of LIC, and also encouraged the private players to enter into the insurance space. To keep pace with the fast-changing industry environment, one of the functions that is gaining strategic importance is the coming up of newer channels of distribution, which would spread the business to newer markets and serve the customers cost-effectively, steadily, and speedily. This exploratory research (which was carried out in the time period from May-July 2012) discusses the various distribution channels (that emerged in the deregulated period and changed the overall industry trend) operating over a period from 2005-06 to 2009-10. The researcher considered seven dominating private players in the life insurance industry to understand the recent patterns in distribution.

The study utilized a review of literature to propose a conceptual model that posits that: Tourists' experience is positively related to their overall satisfaction when service quality mediates the relationship. The model was examined in an empirical study with data from a survey conducted among 280 domestic tourists by utilizing the convenience sampling procedure from selected tourist destinations in Bangladesh. The constructs were then analyzed by using exploratory factor analysis, and validation was done through the use of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The findings of the study suggest that experience plays a significant role in tourists' satisfaction, while service quality plays a strong mediating role. The findings from this research provide a meaningful source of information about domestic tourists' experience and their expectations from the service providers. This paper demonstrated how service quality mediates the relationship between tourists' experience and tourists' satisfaction.

Furthermore, earlier studies predominantly considered players' explicit memory like brand recall and recognition while ignoring a salient unconscious measure, namely implicit memory. This paper provides a conceptual framework that explored the influence of advergame outcomes and messages on players' motivation and its subsequent impact on processing embedded brand elements. Conceptual fabric of the proposed model was derived from a motivational principle, regulatory focus theory, and implicit memory literature to explain how outcome-induced motivation influences players' nature of information processing, implicit memory, emotions, and brand and game attitudes.

The risk that consumers perceive in shopping online is multidimensional. Perception of risk by consumers depends upon various factors like their demographics, personality, shopping motivation, and so forth. It is, therefore, important for the online marketers to not only understand the sub dimension of risks that customers perceive in online shopping, but also the variation in the risk among individuals, so as to design proper risk mitigating strategies. In the present paper, an attempt has been made to understand the impact of various sub dimensions of risk (particularly financial risk, product performance risk, time risk, and delivery risk) on attitude towards online shopping and the variation in the perception of these two sub - dimensions along the two demographic factors, that is, age and income.

The study uses various tools, including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness, correlation, and regression for getting insights into the data. Econometric analysis, including auto-correlation, partial auto-correlation, augmented Dickey-Fuller test, vector auto regression, variance decomposition analysis, Johansen's cointegration, and vector error correction model were employed to find out the bivariate relationship between the variables under reference. The paper points towards the dependency of sales revenue and profit after tax on advertising expenses besides showing an obvious impact of sales revenue on profits. The paper provides significant inputs for further studies that may focus on adding more variables such as profits and firm value and study the multivariate relationship among them.","Advertising expenditure; Augmented Dickey-Fuller; Firm value; FMCG; Johansen's cointegration; Variance decomposition analysis; Vector auto regression; Vector error correction",""

We referred to a number of studies to check the impact of tourism, tourism policies and governance, analyzed techniques in tourism research, examined concepts of tourism, demand indicators, and many others. The purpose of the present study is to highlight the way developed and developing countries probe into tourism subjects and market their destinations. The present paper, with respect to worldwide tourism development, starts with analyzing the existing tourism situation, followed by tourism product development with a new approach. The next step is to measure the effects of tourism on the local economy as well as on the other sectors. For strategic decision-making, focus needs to be placed on statistical tools, which could be used for qualitative analysis in the tourism industry. After that, the focus of the study shifts to the importance of tourism in handling social issues. Next, the paper discusses the psychology of the consumers and the level of quality tourism services expected by them. The present paper could be utilized as a guideline for tourism development in a developing nation like India. In India, tourism development is in a nascent stage, where we are looking at basic tourist infrastructural facilities, where as in the developed countries, they look at the psychographic profiles of the tourists. Development of newertourism products and management profiles of such products need to be designed.","Accessible tourism; Altered tourism; Indigenous tourism; Sustainable tourism; Tourism research; Volunteering tourism",""

The importance of studying this behavior lies in its nature as a negative aspect of consumer behavior. Negative aspects of consumer behavior are necessary to study since they may provide guidelines to policy makers to combat and reduce their impact. Such studies can also contribute to the society's well being. The study examines the psychological motivations that lead to consumers' compulsive buying behavior. Responses of 200 respondents from Delhi were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Convenience sampling was used to reach out to the respondents. Both primary and secondary sources were used to achieve the objectives of the study. ANOVA, factor analysis, and correlation analysis were applied on the collected data to draw significant results. The present study confirms that consumers are strongly influenced by their role models and indulged in compulsive buying behaviour. Individuals who are high in public self-consciousness are quite aware about their public image and use luxury goods to enhance their stature in the society. Materialistic individuals often relate possessions of goods to happiness and thus indulge in compulsive buying behavior. It was also found that there is no relationship between gender and compulsive buying.","Compulsive buying; Consumer behaviour; Materialistic possessions; Psychological motivations; Role models; Social standing",""

The valuations of brands undertaken by Interbrand shows that brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, and so forth are valued at sums larger than their turnovers. However, all brands do not succeed in becoming highly valued brands. When it comes to succeeding with branding, one of the key aspects of branding has been winning the 'trust' of consumers. This paper sets out to focus on the various aspects that engender brand trust among consumers of organized retail stores in India through a survey of consumers and elucidates the factors retailers need to manage to enable brand trust. We collected data from 260 shoppers by using 16 variables. The collected data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with principal axis factoring. The findings indicate that the retail consumer brand trust in India is influenced by four factors - Customer Commitment, Reliability, Reputation, and Retail Environment. The managerial implications of the present study are that retailers need to adopt strategies that evince customer commitment and a very good shopping ambience if they wish to engender brand trust and create a large base of loyal customers.","Brand loyalty; Brand trust; Branding; Customer commitment; Retail environment; Retailers; Valued brand",""

The study also explores whether innovative marketing activities of firms targeted towards the rural consumers are meeting the criterion of affordability, accessibility, availability, and awareness. The present study addresses these research questions with the help of an exploratory study conducted across four villages in the state of West Bengal, India. The major findings from the study indicate that: 1) media used for advertisements or awareness differed across occupational categories, 2) grocery purchase is mostly on credit in contradiction to what is generally believed, 3) consumers were, at most, willing to travel 12 km to purchase grocery items, 4) consumption level may not be low, but low disposable income leads to purchases in small amounts, and 5) innovative marketing activities undertaken by firms in rural areas, though they meet the accessibility and awareness factors, are affected by problems related to affordability and availability, which act as major hindrances for the rural consumers.","Consumer buying behaviour; Correspondence analysis; Exploratory survey; Innovation; Rural",""

This study is a pioneering empirical research to understand the attitude toward CRMPs among young Indian consumers and the implications for marketers. The study found that the overall attitude of young Indian consumers toward CRMPs was very positive and therefore, young Indian consumers can certainly be a good market segment to be targeted by the marketers. Another important finding showed that the attitude of young Indian consumers toward the products associated with CRM was very positive and therefore, products used by young consumers can be selected by marketers for CRMPs. However, the findings provided two important cautions for marketers. The marketers should not charge higher prices for the products associated with CRM as it was found that a majority of the young consumers were not willing to pay a higher price for products associated with CRM. It was also found that the young consumers were skeptical toward the advertisements related to CRMPs and.therefore, marketers should understand that only genuine intent and commitment for a cause can make CRMPs successful and effective.","Cause related marketing (CRM); Cause related marketing programs (CRMPs); Consumer attitude; Consumer skepticism",""

"Global marketing systems in the dairy sector: A comparison of selected countries","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887194856&doi=10.17010%2fijom%2f2013%2fv43%2fi10%2f38354&partnerID=40&md5=3227846f51002deb9e8c5d3410e081df","This paper focuses on the global dairy sector in general, and milk marketing systems in particular. The dairy sector is multifunctional in nature, and contributes to sustainable agricultural development and food security. The global trade is dominated by developed countries, contributing to 62% of the imports and 92% of the exports. Global production and consumption are increasingly imposing pressure to produce and process more, keeping in the mind the aspects of quality and efficiency. The development of dairy markets is affected by access to milk markets and market distortions. Additionally, the development of dairy markets depends on the governments' involvement in regulating production and marketing of milk and milk products. In this regard, comparison of marketing systems across countries considering supply, demand, prices, and trade is important fora clear understanding of the complexities, performance, and challenges in the systems. The analysis indicates that although the production has increased over years in regulated (USA), deregulated (Australia), and informal (India) dominated milk markets, but consumption has increased only in the informal dominated markets. The processing is greater than 90% in Australia and USA, while this is only 18% in India, indicating backwardness of the Indian dairy sector. The farmers' share in consumers' basket is increasing in Australia, decreasing in USA, and is stable in India, representing a higher benefit to producers in deregulated markets and stability of the market in the informal sector dominated market. The milk prices are closer to the world market price in regulated markets as compared to the deregulated and informal markets, signifying higher regulation of production and marketing in USA. The self-sufficiency and performance of the Australian dairy sector is comparatively better because the dairy farms are competing in the international markets. The successful policy interventions in informal markets of Kenya and India indicates that these markets have the potential to improve income and employment, but impose constraints on quality and trade. These issues can be tackled by following an integrated approach in gradual conversion of informal to the formal sector through proper education and training, which has the potential for the overall development of the dairy industry.","Deregulated; Global dairy marketing systems; Informal milk markets; Regulated; Trade",""

The prime mover of this transformation will be new media. To understand this transition well and to be in sync with the nuances of mobility will be crucial to organizational success in the 21st century. In this paper, we have discussed how organizations can form brand communities on the lines of Benedict Andersons Imagined Communities. The paper also highlights the fact that the phenomenon of mobility seen today is not just a consequence of an information explosion, but is also a result of the nature of new media (the Internet and mobile) and its impact on social constructs.","Brand; Communities; Convergence; Emerging market; Imagined community; Internet; Mobile; Mobility; New media",""

However, in the current scenario, elements such as water, energy, transportation, and other variables have assumed considerable significance for the prospective clients seeking to purchase a place to dwell in. This present scenario is largely attributed to the fact that certain premium townships across India, which were once most sought after in the initial stages of launch, post handover, the end users had multiple grievances pertaining to their surrounding support systems such as road, electricity, health care, and so forth. This set of interrelated support systems that makes life easier and contributes to the functioning of the society and its activities is termed as infrastructure. The simplified definition of infrastructure is that it is a framework under which various systems and their components operate and deliver service to the end users. Human beings, over a period of time, have created support frameworks in order to sustain themselves in and around their dwellings. From establishing living spaces in and around sources of food and water, in the present times, accessibility and proximity to places of work have taken precedence.

Primary as well as secondary data were utilized in the study. The marketable and marketed surplus ranged between 95% to 97% on different sized farms. The sample farmers disposed of 85.74% surplus cumin seed in the Mandor regulated market, and only 14.26% of the surplus cumin seed was disposed in the villages to village traders. 53% was sold in the first quarter immediately after harvest (March to May), and the remaining 47% was marketed in the remaining three-quarters of the year (August to February). Small-size farmers disposed off theirtotal surplus cumin seed in one lot as against the medium and large-size farmers, who disposed off their total surplus in two and more lots. It was noted that 63% of the cumin produce arrived in the first quarter (March-May) of the year. The arrivals were 17.93%, 8.54%, and 10.02% in the second, third, and fourth quarters. Farmers got 10.36% higher price by selling cumin in the second quarter over the post-harvest season (peak season or first quarter).

The major constraints inhibiting such diversification efforts have been the inadequate marketing opportunities for such crops owing to their perishable nature. Thus, there is a need to evolve innovative marketing institutions that link farmers with the markets for speedy and remunerative disposal. One such agribusiness enterprise - PepsiCo - has recently emerged in the state. The marketing experience of potato growers with this agribusiness establishment in Jalandhar district during 2009-10 has been studied. The study reveals that the share of the farmers in the retailer's price under the traditional marketing system for potatoes was 42.29%, while the marketing costs as a percentage of the retailer's price were 25.08%, and the marketing margins were 32.63%. The net price received by the farmers while selling the produce to PepsiCo was about 48% higher. The sample potato growers dealing with the newly emerged agribusiness establishment realized a higher benefit-cost ratio for potato cultivation with minimum post harvest losses. To reap the advantage of the emerging agribusiness environment in terms of enhanced farm income, potato growers need to be more product quality conscious as these institutions only buy selected quality produce of specific size, shape, and colour. The requisite training/campaigns can go a long way in augmenting agribusiness potential to enhance farm income through crop diversification in the state.","Agribusiness; Agro-processing; Market channels; Market practices; Post-harvest losses; Potato cultivation",""

Their submissive and exploited image has cast a negative impact on the women's community all over the world as researched by different scholars with more emphasis on content analysis techniques of advertisements. However, this empirical research - conducted among women consumers like housewives and modern girls/working women residing in a cosmopolitan city - Delhi - discusses about their attitudes, reactions, and perceptions about the two major role stereotypes in Indian television advertisements, that is, submissive roles for housewives advertising household products and glamorous roles for modern girls advertising cosmetic products with examples. The paper also analyses certain hypotheses (whether the consumers would agree to a role reversal in these cases), examines the bias of the advertisers towards fair skinned models for cosmetics, and how do these commercials influence the respondents' purchase intentions, and so forth. The results show that women consumers are influenced by the advertisements for their purchase requirements; however, they not satisfied with the stereotypical nature of role portrayal and the bias towards fair skin in TV advertisements, and would welcome a reversal of roles for housewives and modern girls respectively. They would prefer an average Indian woman with dusky skin color in different advertisements; a point that could help marketers design their promotional strategies.","Consumers; Fairness; Female role portrayal; Purchase intention; Role stereotypes; Television advertisements",""

This study looked at how advertisers and advertising agency personnel perceived the culture prevalent among Indian consumers, the cultural dimensions of Indian advertising, and its impact on the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. This is a qualitative study conducted amongst senior advertising practitioners from advertising agencies and advertisers. In-depth interviews were conducted to study how the depiction of different stimuli in advertising like celebrity endorsements, humor, language, clothing, religion, patriotism, festivity, and lifestyle influence the culture of consumers. Other aspects like romance, technology, family, friendship, and environment were also studied. Hofstede's dimensions of culture were used to gain insights on the subject from practitioners. The research identified five waves of change that are transforming the culture of Indian consumers and this is reflected in Indian advertising. These waves have been discussed in detail as waves that bring a change in consumer culture, for a better life, a change to succeed, a change in traditions, a change in the concept of globalization, and a change in the perceptions of value for money. The paper concluded with an assessment of the challenges that advertisers face in dealing with the diverse culture that is prevalent amongst Indian consumers to create effective advertising.","Advertising strategy; Change; Culture; Traditions",""

Design/Methodology/Approach: Data was collected from 2365 women through a questionnaire that comprised of two sections. The first section comprised of 50 AIO statements based on which the respondents were profiled according to their behavioural patterns. The second section comprised of selected footwear and store attributes. The consumers were profiled into eleven clusters using factor analysis. The regression scores were used to assign the respondents to the respective components that were extracted through factor analysis. Reliability Test and KMO Test were conducted to check the reliability and adequacy of the sample size. Further, only those variables that qualified the collinearity test were alone subject to regression analysis. Through ANOVA test, it was observed that significant differences existed among the consumers within the clusters. Therefore, the AIO statements were considered as independent variables that were regressed against ten selected footwear attributes. Findings: The Results indicated that consumers with different behaviors had varied preferences towards footwear attributes. Practical Implications: The results of the study indicate that the manufacturers in the footwear sector should revisit their existing strategies and target the consumers on the basis of their behavior as the proliferation of the unorganized sector is very high in this sector. Original Value: There are innumerable literatures that focus on trade policies followed in the footwear market in international countries, treatment of workers in the footwear industry, therapeutic use of footwear, supply chain patterns etc., but hardly any significant study that explores the consumers' behaviour and their association towards their footwear preferences has been conducted. Behavioral segmentation has been used in many other products like apparels, insurance, real estate etc., but not in the footwear sector.

'Input dealer' is synonymously treated as 'Fertilizer dealer1. Given the high volume, high value of fertilizers, and the limitation of stocking space in relation to spurt in demand for fertilizers during growing season(s), the input dealers face the problem of deciding on optimal stocking pattern. This study addressed this crucial aspect considering the purchase pattern of different brands of fertilizers by farmers to determine the length of waiting time for fertilizer sale and optimal stocking pattern in Karnataka by using negative binomial distribution (NBD) and geometric distribution (GD). The retail purchase data (sales data) from the sale receipts of the retail outlet of Coromandel International Limited, Bada, Davangere, Karnataka, formed the database of the present study. The results indicated that NBD probability of purchase of fertilizer products varied from 0.35 to 0.62 depending upon the popularity of the fertilizer. The GD probability of purchase of any brand of fertilizer was 0.4, indicating that at least three farmers needed to visit the input dealer to get one unit of any fertilizer product sold. Both the NBD and GD were applied to find the optimal stocking pattern of fertilizers.","Fertilizers; Geometric distribution; Input dealers; Inventorying; Negative binomial distribution; Optimal stocking pattern",""

These differences have revealed a huge marketing potential for MNCs and other foreign investors, who try to explore rural regions for marketing opportunities. Thus, understanding rural consumer behaviour is very important for the marketers. This paper focused on the important factors that affect the rural purchase behaviour of FMCG products. The findings of this study indicate that price, brand name, quality, availability, packaging, and so forth were the important factors influencing the rural consumers' purchase decisions. The study also focused on the important aspects such as the effective modes of communication, reasons for switching brands, billing patterns, and satisfaction level among the rural consumers.","Consumer behaviour; FMCG products; Rural consumers",""

This study extended the extant literature by testing and validating the role of perceived CSR and affective identification on loyalty formation in the Indian context. It was also observed that CSR has a better scope to bring about affective ties with a company than conventional product attributes. The research suggested that marketers need to create engagement platforms with customers to create strong points of differentiation based on CSR, when consumers perceive parity on product attributes between competing offerings.","Affective identification; CSR; Customer loyalty; Product attributes",""

Findings: The results indicated that Indian consumers, like consumers in other countries, are reading nutrition labels and that these labels influence their purchase decisions. The research also indicated that quality and nutrition are the primary attributes which consumers seek from food products. Fat, energy, and the amount of cholesterol in food products were found to be the most frequently sought nutritional information, while environment related information was rarely pursued. Income level, education, and gender play a role in the usage of nutritional labels by the consumers. Consumers seek further simplification and standardization of food labels Originality/Value: The outcomes of the study will help Indian policy makers and food companies to understand the complexity of issues involved in nutrient labelling, and design strategies to maximize benefits from resources spent on food labelling.","Food labels; Nutrition; Processed food",""

Indian shoppers who had limited choices till a decade back are now exposed to a plethora of choices, which indicates a radical shift from a conservative mind set to a spending mind set. The present research study aims to understand and analyze the ever changing consumer behavioural patterns while shopping. The study involves comparing how the consumer characteristics vary while shopping food and grocery items and apparel in four state capitals of West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Jharkhand. The study covers a sample base spread across the four cities of Kolkata, Ranchi, Patna, and Bhubaneswar. Primary research forms the basis of this study. The data analysis as detailed in the research study turned up some predictable as well as surprising results. The paper concludes that for food and grocery purchase, location (nearness to home) was the prime consideration for the respondents of Kolkata and Bhubaneswar, while it was range for both - respondents from Patna and Ranchi. Ambience was the least important parameter for the respondent populations from the 4 state capitals. For apparel purchase, range or assortment was the most important parameter for the respondent populations from the 4 state capitals. The behavioural pattern of the respondents with respect to frequency of visit, preferred group size during shopping, and decision maker in choosing a shopping destination revealed a fairly uniform pattern across the state capital locations.","Anova; Chi square test; Consumer behaviour; Modern retailing",""

While retail practitioners are critically exploring alternatives to come up with innovative India-specific retail business models or formats, an account of the modern retail landscape in India comes handy. Hence, the present paper attempts to present an account of the current retail formats in emerging India as a collation of evidences and estimations available from literature and other sources of academic interest that could be used as a point of reference by indigenous retail theoreticians and practitioners.","Emerging markets; Organized retail; Retail",""

The study tries to identify five major retail constructs, that is, retail store environment, expansion and control over choice, store convenience, store information, and consumer involvement based on vast and quality literature. Furthermore, after reviewing the existing five models of retail constructs, a new conceptual model the ""Ws/ivas-Va/tef/ Consumer Empowerment Model"" is proposed. The proposed model tries to explain the combined effect of retail constructs resulting in the subjective experience of empowerment among consumers while shopping.

Green marketing not only includes consumer goods and industrial goods, but also the services sector. In the process of distribution of goods and services, both the manufacturing and the services sector contribute towards the ecological imbalance and loss of the ozone layer. However, the role of the manufacturing sector in this regard is more significant. The process of manufacturing and selling goods and services with the least threat to the environment is a big issue before the business houses. Green marketing requires awareness not only from the consumers (consumers and industrial goods users), but also from the manufacturers of such goods. Ultimately, green marketing requires extra cost, butthe stakeholders should be ready to bear that cost. Business firms have also started responding to environmental challenges by adopting and practicing green marketing strategies. The most important advantage of green marketing is that eco- friendly goods have a competitive advantage over other firms selling non- eco featured goods. At the same time, it should be noted that in the era of green marketing, each and every stakeholder should take part in this process as a social responsibility. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

It defines TPA as a, “Third Party Administrator who, for the time being, is licensed by the Authority, and is engaged, for a fee or remuneration, in the agreement with an Insurance Company, for the provision of health services.” Since the TPA is performing a task traditionally handled by the company providing the insurance, it can also be seen as outsourcing of the claim settlement process. Customers can directly deal with TPAs at the time of claim and the TPA will help with all the processes of claim settlement. A TPA renders a variety of services like networking with hospitals, arranging for hospitalization, claim processing and settlement.

Consumers perceive the brand as having superior quality because it has been endorsed by a credible source; this makes endorsement as one of the indictors of quality for any brand. Thus, it is important to study the role of celebrities and their effectiveness in advertisements. This paper aims to ascertain the role of celebrities & measuring the celebrities’ effectiveness for aspects such as image creation, attracting audience, surviving competition, overshadowing the product, etc. © 2012, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Kotler's model of purchase process incorporates five stages that are Need recognition, Information search, Evaluation of alternatives, Purchase decision and Post purchase behavior. Among these, the consumer purchase decision making is more complex and even more important for consumers today than it was in the past. Marketers often seek to learn how and why people shop, this insight helps them to produce and package their products accordingly and be competitive in global terms. To profile an individual's decision style, Sporles and Kendall in 1986 developed a Consumer Style Inventory (CSI), based on the consumer characteristic approach, which focuses on different cognitive dimensions of consumer decision making. They tested it on American female student groups, further retested it, and came out with eight characteristics. Since then, CSI has been extensively tested on consumers of different countries by different researchers. The objective of the paper is to review the different studies conducted since 1986 to 2010 so that further research can get some direction and can contribute significantly to academia and marketers as well. The studies are classified as those conducted in developed countries, countries with emerging economies and those drawing inputs from both. After reviewing the studies, it seems that five characteristics are indispensable to all consumers irrespective of country, gender, age, culture and religion. These are : High quality conscious consumer, Brand conscious price equals quality consumer, Recreational/Hedonistic consumer, Price conscious value for money consumer, and Confused by over choice consumer. Hence, it was concluded that Sproles and Kendall's inventory can be very well used as a basic model.","Consumer characteristics; Consumer style inventory; Decision making; Developed economies; Emerging economies",""

In this connection, the paper is an attempt to study the Indian discount couponing industry in terms of its modus operandi, competitive structure as per Porter's framework, business potential and growth. The results of the primary survey conducted in the paper reveal that the individuals' attitude to use discount coupons was skewed towards weekends and special occasions rather than on daily usage. It was also observed that the couponing sites have target audiences across geographies, ethnicities, gender and generations. Thus, the manufacturer of products and services are using the new success phenomenon of selling distress inventory to value conscious consumers.

Real estate prices and construction costs are rising, but the retail business is not growing enough to absorb these costs. Retail rents are down by 30 to 40 percent as compared to the peak of 2008 (CRISIL). Shopping malls, therefore, cannot mushroom without analyzing the basics like the catchment area, the spending power of the demography, and its business potential. The malls have to be situated in places where there is scope for shopping. Innovation is,therefore, necessary and the retailers must be encouraged to enhance their diversity of services, and food and entertainment options must be encouraged rather than enhancing the size of the mall/retailer engagement. Better mall management must create ambience and a hygienic and a clean environment must be created for family members to enhance the loyalty of the consumers.

Indeed, it has a hedonic approach, yet, it is quite valuable from the retailer's point of view. Many retailers face a problem - that in spite of strong footfalls, billing remains bleak, yet others have high billing proportion to footfalls. This research is an effort to solve this problem. It was hypothesized that numerous variables, controllable by retailers, are available inside a store and have the potential to influence impulse purchasing. An intercept survey at retail agglomerations in India was conducted, and detailed literature exploration was done to identify the in-store variables. These variables were reduced to ten in-store factors through factor analysis based on the shoppers' response towards them. Regression modeling was done to predict impulse purchase based on in-store factors. The in-store factors were found to influence impulse purchase significantly. The relative weight of these factors was also found so that the retailers could prioritize their resources. Out of these ten factors, a few were found to be acting covertly, whereas the others were well known to shoppers. If retailers know and properly manage these in-store factors, they could favorably influence impulse buying, leading to an improved footfall-billing ratio. A huge proportion of retail purchasing is known to be impulse driven. If retailers understand the antecedents of impulse buying, they could harness it to their benefit. Drivers of retail impulse buying are known to be multidimensional. Social, cultural, personal, situational - all contribute their bit in influencing impulse buying. This research focuses on store characteristics that are tools in the hands of retailers for influencing impulse buying.","Footfalls; Impulse buying; In-store factors; Research modeling; Retail consumer; Retailing",""

India assists 20% of the livestock population of the world, covering 2.3% geographical area.

Currently, number portability, dropping average revenue per user and a market approaching saturation presents challenges for cellular service providers. One of the fundamentals in branding is that a strong brand should give certain pricing powerto its parent company. This is not observed in the telecom industry as average revenue peruser is consistently declining. This paper highlights that the telecom service is becoming a commodity from the consumers' point of view. The only differentiation that may be experienced is the network availability and quality of coverage. Telecom service being a low involvement product with minimal differentiation; consumers would follow a learn-do-feel sequence in terms of their responses towards a telecom service brand. The quality of experience that the consumer has with the chosen telecom service provider is what is going to retain the consumer. Indian telecom service providers' focus would need to move from Customer Acquisition Numbers to Customer Lifetime Value. Service providers simply cannot afford to lose high-value subscribers.

Likert scale has been used to infer the opinion of the sample respondents on the importance level of facilities, and its satisfaction level with respect to destination Thoseghar. Researchers observed that Thoseghar is a memorable one-day trip covering the Thoseghar Waterfalls, Chalkewadi Windmill Farms, offers panaromic views of forts, valleys, and clouds, and the Urmodi Dam further enriches the one-day trip. There are more gaps in importance and its satisfaction level towards facilities like Traffic management, Public utility, Guide availability, Parking facility, Mobile services and Hygiene of wayside amenities, restaurants and Dhabas. These gaps are prominent requirements of tourist destinations to attract a large number of tourists. The research concludes that the authorities need to focus on Communication services (like telephone and mobile connectivity), Parking facility, Traffic management and General upkeep of hotels at Thoseghar.","Satara; Thoseghar; Tourist infrastructure; Waterfalls",""

This means that the demand for travel and tourism products will grow, and it can be marketed. The backwaters of Kerala are formed by 40 rivers that flow into the Arabian Sea from the Western Ghats. They are used forthe transportation of people and products between villages as well as towns. Today, they play a new role; the backwater tourismis one of the most important tourist products of Kerala. Cruising along the backwaters of Kerala in a houseboat is an enchanting experience for the tourists. In the whole world, similar type of tourism can be experienced in Netherlands only. This paper analyses the marketing activities, the various problems faced by tourism service providers and the perception of tourists towards backwater tourism in Kerala with the help of primary data. The analysis by using Garrett's ranking shows that parking of boats, unhealthy competition and lack of Government support were the first three main problems faced by the houseboat operators. Tourist's satisfaction with the main elements of tourism products was measured by using Likert's five point rating scale. A majority of the tourists were satisfied with backwater tourism and were dissatisfied with the lack of cleanliness of backwaters and hygiene factors.","Backwater tourism; Domestic tourists; Foreign tourists; Houseboats; Kettuvallom; Tourist perception",""

It resulted in the emergence of five factors viz. Core Features; Reliability and Cost; Ease of Operation; Memory, Aesthetic, and Response features; Brand Performance and New features. This seems to confirm the customer -value hierarchy model of five product levels namely Core Benefit, Basic Product, Expected Product, Augmented Product, and Potential Product as these levels match with the earlier five factors presented in the research study.

The most distinctive skill of professional marketers is the ability to create, maintain, enhance and protect brands. Brand equity being the added value of a product by virtue of its brand has both psychological and financial value for a firm. This paper attempts to examine the applicability of customer based brand equity model developed by David Aaker in the Indian context. A survey was conducted to collect the perceptions of consumers on jeans brands. Statistical analysis was performed to test the reliability of the scale, and the results showed Cronbach's coefficient value to be quite satisfactory, ranging from 0.66 to 0.80. Further, correlation analysis showed significant relationship of brand equity with all the four dimensions. Stepwise regression analysis found brand loyalty to be the most important predictor of brand equity followed by brand awareness, whereas perceived quality and brand association were found to be not significant. Thus, the study provides empirical evidence as to creating higher levels of awareness and high degree of loyalty is what is required in building superior brand equity in India. Overall, the findings indicate that Aaker's model may not be applicable in the Indian market, and further research is necessary to understand the dimensionality of brand equity in India.","Aaker's model; Brand awareness; Brand loyalty; Customer-based brand equity",""

Despite the tremendous potential - such as low property value, growing income levels, changing socio-economic profile, and a large percentage of young population, which promotes organized retailing, the growth of organized retailers in Visakhapatnam had been modest during the period from 2006-09. This prompted a study to establish the buying behavior of consumers from organized retailers in Visakhapatnam. Since the penetration of large format retail outlets in Visakhapatnam is less, even today, and since more and more organized retailers have opened up exclusive outlets for food and related items, the present study focuses on the purchase behavior of retail customers with respect to food items and general stores. The findings suggest that there are equal spaces for both organized and unorganized retailers in an emerging city like Visakhapatnam.

A survey, using a structured schedule, was conducted to ascertain the position of handicrafts marketing in Meghalaya. The survey revealed that cane and bamboo products have the highest demand followed by wooden products. The survey also showed that the market for handicrafts has not yet been optimally tapped. Unorganized structure of the market, unavailability of adequate quantity of quality raw materials, lack of credit, ineffective marketing channels, lack of proper pricing policy and advertising tools have impeded the growth of the handicraft sector. Realizing the importance of developing the industry to generate revenue and employment, the Government of Meghalaya has taken initiatives to organize the artisans into societies and clusters. Training facilities, financial and marketing assistance are also provided by the Government to the craftsmen. There are opportunities galore.

Research focusing on business-to- business relationships is likely to be male dominated and deal with male-male relationships. As such, it may not apply equally to other types of relationships (female-male or female-female). Similarly, most research in consumer relationship marketing is based on theoretical frameworks developed in western cultures. It is quite possible that the benefits received, or their importance, in firm-consumer relationships may be very different when considered in other cultural contexts.

When compared to stores where music was not played, it gave statistically different results between these two situations.

Changing consumers' lifestyle and increasing self-service has positioned product package as a tool to stimulate impulse buying and increase sales promotion. Chocolate is a product which is consumed irrespective of age barriers. Today, chocolate is marketed in different ways to different consumer segments and hence, packaging of chocolates is .therefore, critical. This study used a hierarchical cluster analysis approach to organize a group of 240 students into meaning clusters based on a combination of several independent chocolate packaging cues (cluster variables), which maximized the similarity of cases within each cluster while minimizing the dissimilarity between groups that were initially unknown. This was followed by one - way ANOVAto ascertain the significant differences between the groups on the classifying variables. Results reflected that cluster variables (""Price and purchase decision"") were of paramount importance in purchase of chocolate bars. Cluster variables ""Look for expiry dates,"" ""Colour and purchase decision,"" and ""Shape and purchase decision"" were significant across all the three clusters. Variables like ""Brand name and purchase decision,"" ""Packaging material and purchase decision,"" ""Picture and purchase decision,"" and ""Size and purchase decision"" were significant only for Clusters 1 and 2. ""Look for ingredients,"" ""Look for manufacturing unit's address,"" and ""Look for nutritional information"" were significant for Clusters (1,3) and (2,3). Thus, the study scrutinized the key packaging cues influencing 'student clusters'.","Chocolate; Cluster; Packaging; Product; Purchase",""

Retail industry in India is expected to rise 25% yearly being driven by strong income growth, changing lifestyles, and favorable demographic patterns. (www.business.mapsofindia.com) The network of retailers has reached every nook and corner of the country. So any product produced anywhere in the country can be easily accessed by the buyers from any location. Thus, the spatial convenience of Indian retailers is very high. According to ORG-MARG, the total number of all kind of retail outlets in India was 51,30,000 during 1996-97. This means that one retail outlet exists against an average of almost 190 persons.

It refers to the flawless application of information technology from the point of origin to the ultimate destination of the products along with the entire value chain; the business processes are carried out electronically and intended to accomplish the business goals effectively and efficiently. With the advent and mass acceptance of Radio, Television, Mobile, World Wide Web; electronic media have become the dominant marketing force and an important part of our life. E-commerce further led to the emergence of the ""market space"" - a virtual world of information paralleling the real marketplace of goods and services - that enables marketers to manage content, context, and infrastructure in new and different ways, thereby providing novel sources of competitive advantage (Rayport and Sviokla, 1994). With electronic marketing, one can think of business across the globe that was not possible earlier. In recent years, increasing numbers of businesses have been using the internet in their marketing efforts. The internet is unique because it offers dual advantage to businesses; it can be thought of as a market as well as a medium. Electronic Marketing can be interactive and relatively inexpensive than Traditional Marketing. Now-a-days, manufacturers of physical goods as well service providers (e.g. travel agents, real estate agents, business consultants, chartered accountants etc.) have found the internet to be key to their success. Whatever the potential of the channel for completing transactions, it is obvious that various marketing functions are present with which the internet can assist and play a very important role in establishing competitive advantage (Robbins, 2000). In the same line of thought, Rettie (2002) strongly advocated that the internet is creating a ""virtual culture"" which has its own form of manners (netiquette), members of society (netizens) and method of expressing emotions (emoticons) for those who have matured in the net generation. © 2010.","",""

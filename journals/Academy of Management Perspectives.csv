FOOLED BY DIVERSITY? WHEN DIVERSITY INITIATIVES EXACERBATE RATHER THAN MITIGATE BIAS AND INEQUALITY,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186568249&doi=10.5465%2famp.2021.0206&partnerID=40&md5=39ef616dc81a277f7710d766b7f19b1a,"To advance the discussion on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, we analyze the management literature and examples of advocacy practices inspired by the three DEI logics of moral justice, business case, and power activism. By identifying litigation, self-interest, and coercion as the mechanisms driving change within these logics, we show how the concept of diversity is approached differently in the three logics. Based on this discussion, we explain why diversity has taken precedence over equity and inclusion in both research and practice. We further show how the tensions between DEI logics inform diversity initiatives and exacerbate rather than mitigate bias and inequality. To rejuvenate scholarly and managerial debates around DEI initiatives and address managerial biases to focus on the wrong things, we discuss what could be learned from the rationales of such initiatives, including how one can be fooled into focusing on diversity at the expense of equity and inclusion. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
HOW WOKE WAS THE SYMPOSIUM ON WOKE ORGANIZATIONS? AN INSIDER PERSPECTIVE,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191704397&doi=10.5465%2famp.2023.0459&partnerID=40&md5=1c45e4c66a7fc0e0cb083bd19042bd25,[No abstract available],,
BEYOND COLLECTIVE ACTION: HETEROGENEOUS STAKEHOLDERS’ INFLUENCE ON FIRMS IN THE DIGITAL AGE,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186611067&doi=10.5465%2famp.2021.0124&partnerID=40&md5=00dfa729c4c8b75aa90dd418fdbaff49,"Have stakeholders increased their influence over firms’ behavior in the digital age? In a recent article in this journal, Barnett, Henriques, and Husted (2020) suggested that, contrary to expectations, digital media has limited the influence of stakeholders on firms as information overload and heterogeneous demands make it difficult for stakeholders to synchronize their interests and achieve one coherent and persistent voice. In this exchange we contend that, while the evolution of digital media has made it harder for stakeholders to achieve synchronicity, it has made it easier for them to achieve what we refer to as heterogeneous convergence. Heterogeneous convergence entails the progressive coming together of heterogeneous stakeholders around a broader demand for change while maintaining different identities and views. We argue that, through heterogeneous convergence, secondary stakeholders can exert strong pressure over firms. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
A PUZZLE OF KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS DURING PATENT LITIGATION,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196118219&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0148&partnerID=40&md5=692d563aef4ccafbeae9780ef6d540b2,"Patent litigation is an important component of a strong appropriability regime, critical for ensuring that firms can effectively protect their patented inventions. An issue that has mostly gone unnoticed in the innovation literature is the role of the rules and procedures of patent litigation in helping to create unintended knowledge spillovers. Using an inductive approach, we examine where, what, and how spillovers occur in the litigation process. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge spillovers can happen throughout the litigation process, and benefit not only the defendant but also the plaintiff. Furthermore, we show that the knowledge spilled over is often about proprietary methods and procedures utilized by a litigant to bring about an innovation, above and beyond the knowledge already in the patent. Based on these findings, we develop a framework for how knowledge spillovers happen during litigation, offering a more nuanced perspective on how strong appropriability regimes work. Finally, we suggest a number of directions for future policy development in this arena. © 2024 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,
A PLACE FOR CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND WOKENESS IN DIVERSITY STRATEGIES,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196065318&doi=10.5465%2famp.2023.0015&partnerID=40&md5=2f66ba073cf4f09461a8e9f6baaf3073,"In this exchange, we respond to David A. Waldman and Jennifer L. Sparr's (2023; henceforth referred to as W&S) assertion that critical race theory (CRT) is incompatible with the goal of diversity and unity.Other responses in this exchange have noted thatW&S's critique of CRT is based on opinion pieces that misrepresent CRT rather than on CRT scholarship. We extend those rebuttals by elaboratingwhat CRT positively contributes to diversity strategies and how it is relevant to future research.We first discuss the core tenets of CRT, which W&S do not critique in their paper.We then explain why, contrary toW&S's article, paradox theory and positive organizational behavior (POB) do not provide a rationale for rejecting CRT in diversity management. Specifically, we explain why a paradox perspective requires learning from CRT, and how POB prevents examination of negatively oriented behaviors like discrimination and racismthatmake diversitymanagement challenging and paradoxical. We explain why the aforementioned limitations make W&S's recommendations inappropriate for organizations that pursue diversity management for equity and inclusion (DE&I) not just for unity. We conclude with a discussion of how CRT can inform evidence-basedmanagement ofDE&I and guide future research. © 2024 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,
"RETHINKING ""WOKE"" AND ""INTEGRATIVE"" DIVERSITY STRATEGIES: DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION-AND INEQUALITY",2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191288825&doi=10.5465%2famp.2023.0013&partnerID=40&md5=abd928afea90a8808b7761b019bd5ba2,"Diversity and inequality are interrelated, so diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are controversial-but in a different way than Waldman and Sparr (2023) suggest regarding ""woke"" and ""integrative"" diversity strategies. I argue that Waldman and Sparr give insufficient attention to the link between diversity and inequality, and thereby offered a false dichotomy about DEI strategies. I outline the main arguments by Waldman and Sparr and challenge their claims about DEI strategies. I argue that DEI is about social, not personal, identity, that is about intergroup relations, not individual differences. I explain why the past is part of the present. I further challenge the claim that DEI is grounded in critical race theory (CRT), explain the origins and intent of CRT, and discuss its distant relationship to how DEI is practiced in organizations. I challenge the claim that DEI strategies lead to excessive victimhood and insufficient merit on the part of marginalized groups, and I discuss the overlooked bias for White men. I clarify both paradox theory and positive organizational behavior theory as used by Waldman and Sparr. Finally, I compare Waldman and Sparr's model of integrative DEI strategies with alternative ways to address the link between diversity and inequality. © 2024 Academy of Management.

CIVIC WEALTH CREATION: BYPASSING MONOPOLIES THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196119648&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0105&partnerID=40&md5=a1669e557d943c87834bd3cbd0204788,"The market power of monopolies can severely restrict citizens' freedom of choice. In the case of utilities, often portrayed as natural monopolies, such power may result in high prices and unreliable or absent services, especially in marginalized communities such as low-income neighborhoods or remote rural villages. While government regulation has been the traditional remedy to curb natural monopolies' power, in this paper, we address a different solution: monopoly bypassing through collective action. We present two types of monopoly bypassing-partial and complete-through the lens of civic wealth creation (CWC): the generation of social, economic, and communal endowments that benefit communities. Through our analysis of three water and sanitation utility services cases, we demonstrate howCWC is used to catalyze the collective action of engaged citizens to effectively bypass monopoly power. The cases highlight the three stakeholder categories involved in CWC initiatives-communities, enterprises, and regimes of support-and illustrate how they act collectively to provide credible market-based solutions. © 2024 Academy of Management.

RECRUITMENT DECEPTION AND THE ORGANIZATION OF LABOR FOR EXPLOITATION: A POLICY–THEORY SYNTHESIS,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186582621&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0043&partnerID=40&md5=f1ea2b4b3890d825ac31fa89087d4b72,"Responding to policy initiatives on fair recruitment and the eradication of recruitment fees, and research calls to focus on the labor supply chain, we provide a synthesis of scholarly and policy work on the issue of “recruitment deception” and its role in the organization of labor for exploitation. Recognizing that this topic is not explicitly theorized in management research, our analysis draws together concepts, arguments, and insights from across the social sciences and policy arenas to provide clarity on the meaning and prevalence of recruitment deception, with explanations on where and how it occurs, the actors involved and the mechanisms and tactics through which it is enacted. Attention is drawn to the key tactics and strategies labor recruiters use to exploit the labor of migrant workers; namely, misinformation, recruitment fees, identity document confiscation, debt, and grooming or trauma-bond recruiting. These tactics are organized into four exploitative capacities that we argue characterize a regime of enmeshment that starts with the abuse of vulnerability and then advances into recruitment deception, exploitation, and coercive control. The article concludes with an overview of initiatives and areas for future research that can help to reduce recruitment deception and pave the way for more responsible recruitment practices. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS AND THE STUDY OF EMERGENT DIVERSITY EFFECTS,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186591127&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0231&partnerID=40&md5=f07d45a1e32af13708a74a34403881b4,"Foss and Klein (2022) have written about diversity and inclusion initiatives as an emergent phenomenon connected to the actions of organizational managers. We agree that understanding the emergent effects of diversity is an important topic for study with expansive policy implications. However, Foss and Klein’s view of diversity movements and their implications appears to be based on several questionable assumptions and largely ignores or dismisses extensive micro-organizational and psychological research that has already investigated these phenomena. We examine some of these assumptions and their implications, and provide insight into how future research on emergent diversity effects could examine the impacts of various assumptions and potential trade-offs across organizational levels to inform policy through stronger science. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
CREATING VALUE THROUGH SUPPLY CHAIN ORCHESTRATION AS A BUSINESS MODEL,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186626967&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0001&partnerID=40&md5=bf67f26949b7db769cde8aa9546396d4,"Supply chains are widely studied as carriers of value, but their potential to create value remains underappreciated. This study conceptualizes supply chain orchestration as a business model that allows a firm to create value in a supply chain with high market uncertainty by matching demand and supply more effectively than the present norm, and without relying on product innovation. Building on contingency theory, this study theorizes supply chain orchestration and articulates three defining qualities of its activity system. Next, it describes the evolution of this business model: its creation requires architectural market knowledge; however, sustained belief in the architectural market knowledge, ironically, can hinder its adaptation to changes in the firm’s environment and lead to its abandonment. The study, I hope, will promote management practice and research at the largely untapped intersection of business models and strategic supply chain management to foster novel value creation by orchestrating supply chains. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEMS POLICY FORMULATION: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185809778&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0047&partnerID=40&md5=eec82acb8944a514b49f0fe2b2badac8,"Encouraged by the ubiquitous belief entrepreneurship’s value as a source of economic growth, for many governments developing entrepreneurial ecosystems has become elemental to their development strategies, representing a prominent trend in public entrepreneurship policy. However, the entrepreneurial ecosystems field is recent, undertheorized, and fragmented, limiting its capacity to explain the effects of entrepreneurial ecosystem policies. Advancing research is crucial for advising policy makers on how to formulate effective entrepreneurial ecosystem policies that are decisive for developing ecosystems. Lacking such solid and coherent theoretical foundations, entrepreneurial ecosystem policies risk being ineffective, while policy makers tend to simply replicate entrepreneurial ecosystem policies from other entrepreneurial ecosystems. We aim to address this issue by providing guidance on key parameters to inform the formulation of entrepreneurial ecosystem policies. The development of entrepreneurial ecosystems requires customizing a mix of policies adapted to the unique characteristics of each ecosystem, promoting the quality of entrepreneurship to ensure the allocation of resources to productive use, and addressing the complexity of entrepreneurial ecosystems with a holistic policy approach. Based on our findings, we present a conceptual framework and discuss three parameters for policy formulation: top-down versus bottom-up formulation, support to systemic versus framework conditions, and holistic versus siloed approaches. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
CRITIQUING THE BACKLASH AGAINST WOKENESS: IN DEFENSE OF DEI SCHOLARSHIP AND PRACTICE,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188253612&doi=10.5465%2famp.2023.0066&partnerID=40&md5=0a9172300a7bf55e51806507b6c3186d,"In the last few years, we have witnessed growing backlash against ""wokeness"" from numerous actors. Indeed, politicians, social commentators, corporate executives, and academics have all taken aim at the concept. In this Exchange article, we respond to the recent criticisms laid against ""woke"" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) scholarship and practice from researchers in the field of management, focusing particularly on those claims that have been expressed recently in this journal. We find particularly troubling the potential for anti-woke academic rhetoric to function as intellectual scaffolding for ideological and political efforts that undermine the hard-earned legal and organizational advances in the area of DEI made over the last several decades. We contend that, while such work is ostensibly framed within a broader critique of ""wokeness,"" the arguments put forward by its authors are, in actuality, directed toward challenging organizations as sites where the privileges attached to membership in socially dominant groups are normalized and reproduced. Our discussion addresses three foundational areas of concern: (a) the conflation of ""woke"" with DEI scholarship and practice, (b) the misrepresentation of organizational DEI efforts, and (c) the under-appreciation of the importance of organizational inclusion for stakeholders. We elaborate on the implications that emanate from this backlash against ""woke"" DEI scholarship and practice, including the undoing of progressive social policies and the concomitant legitimation of populist rhetoric. © 2024 Academy of Management.

THE END OF JOBS? PARADOXES OF JOB DECONSTRUCTION IN ORGANIZATIONS,2024,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187939448&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0236&partnerID=40&md5=6f08cdc12dcfcbd407b5d95c446a44c7,"As organizations seek more adaptive workforces, they are increasingly embracing ""deconstructed"" jobs as an alternative to traditional jobs. In these emerging work structures, jobs are broken down into tasks and projects, and matched with the knowledge, skills, and abilities of workers in the internal labor market. Despite the burgeoning popularity of job deconstruction as a new organizing paradigm-a supposed panacea for rigid organizations and their entrenched employees-our article challenges this oversimplified view. We identify several interdependent, persistent paradoxes inherent in deconstructed jobs, and examine how organizations can navigate their consequences. In balancing the human side of job deconstruction, we propose a way forward that brings workers' experiences into the discussion, advocating guardrails that can shield workers while facilitating productive outcomes and mitigating potential adverse impacts. We conclude by suggesting key directions for future research on job deconstruction as an important new frontier in the study of work and organizations. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Much criticism derives from skepticism regarding organizations' true motivation for engaging in social activism, which some consider antithetical to business purposes. More specifically, an awareness of, and active attention to, social issues are posited to derive from firms' interests in creating an appearance of social consciousness to acquire resources or boost their own reputations. Drawing upon impression management theory, we explore performativity (i.e., inauthentic or insincere activity designed to make a positive impression on others) in diversity management. We present a typology for examining how organizational investment in and communication of diversity management influence stakeholder impressions and other outcomes. We also consider enabling conditions that may alter the likelihood of performativity in their actions. Based thereon, we offer a research agenda for examining impression management as a motivation for diversity management and understanding variability in firm approaches. We offer practice recommendations for engaging in diversity management to activate positive change and transform organizational structures and cultures. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Yet, the world has witnessed increasing indifference toward honesty over the past several years and stood by while dishonest leaders rose to positions of power and influence. This article provides novel theorizing to explain the rise of dishonest leaders. We theorize that intergroup conflict elicits a zero-sum mindset, leading people to focus myopically on how their in-group can triumph over an out-group. This focus leads people not only to engage in dishonesty, but also to judge dishonesty more positively in others-including leaders. Specifically, when dishonesty is used to defeat an out-group, it is perceived as a signal of competence and parochial benevolence, despite being costly in the long run. As a result, people knowingly support (e.g., elect, follow) dishonest leaders. In the present article, we integrate recent findings in organizational behavior, moral psychology, political science, and sociology to build this theory. We conclude by discussing new strategies that individuals and organizations can implement to promote honesty. Ultimately, this research deepens our understanding of honesty and the forces that promote and impede its development in leaders and their followers. © the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

A CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETING LOGICS ON SELECTING FOR FIT,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174836512&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0163&partnerID=40&md5=b38293193f2ee14251e3de0ebc1f3d55,"Fit plays a key role in organizational entry decisions. However, selecting staff based on their anticipated fit is vulnerable to bias, potentially leading to inequality, stratification, and polarization. First, we focus on person-organization fit and critically examine arguments for and against the hegemonic perspective that selecting for person-organization fit is an effective, responsible, and ethically appropriate approach. This is a controversial subject with bifurcated positions. On the one hand, there should be benefits for employers and employees, such as increased performance, productivity, motivation, and engagement. On the other hand, there are some potentially major downsides, such as subjective bias, reduced diversity, and fears that greater homogeneity will bring about organizational dysfunction. We reveal that two forms of fit, organizational fit and interpersonal fit, have been conflated, and recommend disaggregating them. Second, we critically examine person-job fit and demonstrate that it too has both positive and negative sides. We produce a consolidated version of these different elements of “selecting for fit” that integrates the various literatures and informs policy. We advance five practical recommendations to improve the use of fit in personnel selection that help to realize its inclusive promise and minimize its deleterious effects. © the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN NPOs: HOW THE NATURE OF WORK FACILITATES MORAL LICENSING,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174853572&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0026&partnerID=40&md5=bb68b450a40eb8a94a32e3e23e106e02,"Nuñez and Ollo-Lopez (2022) recently outlined how organizational dysfunctions and characteristics or behavior of a harasser explain the occurrence of sexual harassment in nonprofit organizations (NPOs). In this Exchange I highlight that the nature of the work that is performed in such NPOs is an additional, important risk factor that might facilitate sexual harassment due to moral licensing processes. Specifically, I argue that the prosocial nature of the work that is often conducted in NPOs functions as a driver for moral licensing and the occurrence sexual harassment in two ways: (a) potential harassers will be more likely to engage in sexual harassment due to their history of past moral behavior, and (b) observers will be more likely to tolerate such instances of sexual harassment because they perceive these harassers in overly positive manner. I end this Exchange by discussing potential avenues for future research and appropriate actions. © the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

BEYOND THE BRAVE NEW NUDGE: ACTIVATING ETHICAL REFLECTION OVER BEHAVIORAL REACTION,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179603287&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0162&partnerID=40&md5=071fc80d1f57f6216fc433e60106ce5b,"Behavioral intervention techniques leveraging reactive responses have gained popularity as tools for promoting ethical behavior. Choice architects, for example, design and present default opt-out options to nudge individuals into accepting preselected choices deemed beneficial to both the decision-maker and society. Such interventions can also employ mild financial incentives or affective triggers, including joy, fear, empathy, social pressure, and reputational rewards. We argue, however, that ethical competence is achieved via reflection, and that heavy reliance on reactive behavioral interventions can undermine the development of ethical competence over the long term. Specifically, drawbacks may occur through motivational displacement, dependency, moral crowding out, loss of personal autonomy, and reactance. We introduce complementary cognitive boosting techniques designed to stimulate reflective cognition, as a more promising long-term strategy for instilling ethical behavior. One such approach is the moral self-awareness motivational construct, which incrementally leads agents to increasing levels of ethical reflection. We explain why ethical boosting approaches present more edifying and durable alternatives to reactive behavioral interventions, and offer suggestions for social and organizational policy.

We argue that the pursuit of legitimacy for both hard and soft regulation can lead to a dynamic interplay between, and reinforcement of, the two regulatory forms. Legitimacy is about the right to exist. The objective of the present article is to provide theoretical insights into the mutual reinforcement of hard and soft regulation from a legitimacy perspective. We discuss four mutually reinforcing effects that impact the respective legitimacy of hard and soft regulation. Our article contributes to the literature on global business regulation, particularly as it pertains to the discussion on whether voluntary or mandatory forms of regulation should be pursued. In addition, it yields implications for global business regulation, for organizational policies on and engagement in soft regulation, as well as for policy-making.

However, new methods take a long time to be diffused and adopted. The most common contemporary methods used in management research are similar to those used decades ago. Drawing upon theories of knowledge diffusion and adoption, we identify four barriers to the slow propagation of methodological innovations: (a) insufficient knowledge or skills, (b) inadequate adoption of technology, (c) outdated norms, and (d) inefficient incentives as well as inapplicable journal and professional organization policies. Then, to show the usefulness of the four-barrier framework for understanding slow diffusion and adoption, we focus on three selective methods and data innovations: Collection of Web-based (aka big) data, utilization of video-based methods, and use of computer-aided text analysis techniques. Our aim is not to create a “gold rush” for new methods or accelerate methodological and theoretical speed for their own sake, but to expand our collective methodological toolkit to develop and test more robust, replicable, accurate, predictive, and credible theory that will result in better-informed and more effective policy-making.

Although we expect most reviewers to act ethically, the drive for academics to increase their citation counts creates a potential incentive for reviewers to seek citations of their own work, presenting a potential reviewer COI. With citation counts serving as an important part of most university and journal rankings, the integrity of the research review process has far-reaching implications. This study analyzes journals’ communication to reviewers regarding coercive citation requests and COIs in general, with 205 survey responses from editors of major management or marketing journals, and an assessment of a randomly selected subset of 30 leading journal websites. The majority of journals did not discuss reviewer coercive citation requests or COIs, nor have any obvious processes to screen for it. We discuss the factors that foster an environment conducive to coercive citation requests and identify easily adoptable changes to review formats to address the problem. We also discuss the need to examine the triad of relationships among authors, reviewers, and editors, taking a systems approach. We encourage attention to balance of power and cocreation. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Unfortunately, diversity initiatives have the potential to focus only on diversity while essentially neglecting an equally important element: unity. This is problematic because diversity and unity represent an organizational paradox in terms of being seemingly contradictory yet interdependent elements that persist over time. In line with this notion, we identify two prototypical categories of strategy to address diversity: (a) woke and (b) integrative. “Woke strategies” take a single-edged approach to diversity, whereby concerns for diversity are pursued without concern for potentially detrimental effects on unity. Conversely, “integrative strategies” simultaneously activate the advantages of both diversity and unity while neutralizing their downsides. In support of this reasoning, we also refer to positive organizational behavior theory that would suggest that “woke” strategies may run counter to the development of psychological capital on the part of both minority and majority group members. Despite the arguments in this article, it is clear that further research is necessary to better understand these alternative approaches to diversity, as well as their effects on individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. Thus, we conclude with a consideration of research needs, as well as practical and policy implications. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
WHY DO COMPANIES GO WOKE?,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179816162&doi=10.5465%2famp.2021.0201&partnerID=40&md5=10db4b876fb24c34f912075f9d8ff63c,"""Woke""companies are those that are committed to socially progressive causes, with a particular focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion as these terms are understood through the lens of critical theory. There is little evidence of systematic support for woke ideas among executives and the population at large, and going woke does not appear to improve company performance. Why, then, are so many firms embracing woke policies and attitudes?We suggest that going woke is an emergent strategy that is largely shaped by middle managers rather than owners, top managers, or employees.We build on theories from agency theory, institutional theory, and intraorganizational ecology to argue thatwokeness arises frommiddlemanagers and support personnel using their delegated responsibility and specialist status to engage in woke internal advocacy, which may increase their influence and job security. Broader social and cultural trends tend to reinforce this process. We discuss implications for organizational behavior and performance, including perceived corporate hypocrisy (""woke-washing""), the potential loss of creativity from restricting viewpoint diversity, and the need for companies to keep up with a constantly changing cultural landscape.

In this Exchange, we posit that their article yields potentially harmful conclusions for DEI. We write this commentary to clarify definitions, bodies of literature, and diversity strategies. Maintaining scholarly standards is particularly important in diversity research because inaccuracies have real-life implications for some of society’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
GOVERNING LARGE PROJECTS: A THREE-STAGE PROCESS TO GET IT RIGHT,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149733875&doi=10.5465%2famp.2021.0129&partnerID=40&md5=eee6a074832fee1615d62cea0531cc2a,"Private and public megaprojects—whether new plant facilities, IT systems, railways, or the Olympics—frequently entail dramatic cost and schedule overruns. Root causes are behavioral biases, such as optimism and deliberate deception, accompanied by principal–agent issues and a lack of project-related skills. Through a three-stage process—forecasting, organizing, and executing (“FOX”)—we organize and offer solutions to mitigate the cognitive biases and agency issues planners and policy-makers face in large projects. Following the FOX process and building on behavioral decision theory, we review evidence for the accuracy of “reference-class forecasting,” which considers comparable past projects to forecast a current, planned project. We provide evidence for reference-class forecasting performance and recent methodological extensions, such as similarity-based forecasting. Then, considering the relevant literature, we offer organizational solutions to reduce unfounded optimism and deception, including debiasing techniques and specific measures to curb principal–agent issues. Finally, we suggest combining a project modular design with speedy implementation for faster, better, cheaper, and lower-risk execution. Overall, we offer an original, holistic theoretical view that addresses both behavioral and strategic elements of how to debias large projects, along with direct practical implications and advice for those who manage megaprojects with increasingly high stakes and risks.

Organization and management theories implicitly assume this institutional environment is given, fixed, and exogenous to private firms. We challenge this assumption and consider the institutional environment as the result of political struggles between different actors (including private firms) who, if successful in this struggle, will define a particular property rights regime. We maintain that private firms can endogenously create the institutional environment by legitimizing an existing one that protects their property rights or by delegitimizing (and seeking the replacement of) another one that threatens their property rights. Our study combines insights fromhistory, political economy, and organization andmanagement theories and shows the benefits for organization and management scholars of studying long-term processes in light of classic works that sought to understand howpolitical and economic orders were created. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Static models in competition economics prioritize efficiency gains from cost savings even though welfare gains from innovation are much larger. Competition economics could benefit from the integration of strategic management and innovation economics. Management scholars have the opportunity to properly introduce and apply concepts such as isolating mechanisms, capabilities (and their development), and ecosystem competition into the policy debate. If management scholars invest the time and effort to understand current competition policy models, they may be able to reengineer them in a manner that leads to a better understanding of dynamic competition, a more nuanced view of the nature of economic rents, and better metrics for assessing competitive effects. These should in turn lead to better public policy. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

As a result, they must grapple with the question of whether to team up with a “surrogate entrepreneur” to provide the business-related competences that they lack. Yet, the answer to this question is not straightforward, as it often links to other critical questions, such as when in the entrepreneurship process a surrogate entrepreneur is needed, as well as who the “right” surrogate entrepreneur should be. Regrettably, extant theorizing on entrepreneurial team formation has not provided answers to these questions. To overcome this key practical and conceptual gap in knowledge, this study proposes a process model that offers several new theoretical insights for research on entrepreneurial team formation. First, it informs the process that underpins the decision to add a new team member—a decision-making process that precedes the search for a new team member and that, despite its importance, has been largely overlooked by prior research. Second, it challenges the comprehensiveness of existing theorized team formation strategies, and proposes a new strategy in this regard—the resource-exploring strategy—that can be employed when the market opportunity for an invention is not yet known. Finally, it contributes to human capital theory by illustrating that the value of a human capital endowment depends on when this endowment is added to the team, as well as who holds this endowment. Important implications for policy and practice are discussed. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We also note a bifurcation between management scholarship and practice in this area that hinders cumulative learning and cross-fertilization to inform practice and policy questions. In this paper, we introduce the RAFFT framework, composed of five interrelated themes that underpin messiness (rules, agency, feedback, frames and tensions) and are grounded in knowledge triangulated across thought worlds from research and practice. Supported by illustrative examples from research and practice, we present this heuristic framework as both a diagnostic tool and an intervention repertoire. We hope that this framework can serve as a starting point for further development by researchers and practitioners working more closely together to build cumulative knowledge.

PERSON–SKILL FIT: WHY A NEW FORM OF EMPLOYEE FIT IS REQUIRED,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162913208&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0024&partnerID=40&md5=5d9db63e3a4d8e8a1fd8e07297050ff3,"Significant recent changes in labor affect organizations, managers, and employees; we do not yet fully understand the depth and scope of these changes. For example, although previous research on person–job and person–organization fit is helpful, it has struggled to provide clarity when the very nature of work and jobs is changing and new types of work are emerging. To contribute to the literature on person–job and person–organization fit, this paper proposes a conceptual model that explains the ways in which individual, job, and organizational factors interact with diverse work environments. Specifically, I show that a new work environment generates a new form of employee fit, which I call “person–skill fit.” I argue that changes in the constructs that contribute to employee fit (e.g., competencies, trust, commitment, and values) may generate a fit gap that manifests in the form of a managerial gap. Firms should address this gap to improve their dynamic alignment with new forms of work. This framework offers potentially valuable new ways of assisting managers and organizations in their efforts to adjust to the changing nature of work and to transition from standard management practices to new management practices to achieve improved outcomes by utilizing the person–skill fit model.

We advance three alternative pathways that take a systems view to address the limitations of the current EUM. Considering alternative pathways is critical because the EUM as currently constructed is not sustainable. These pathways provide possible ways forward with more desirable outcomes for the myriad of university stakeholders, not just the elite universities and their star scientists. Specifically, each proposed pathway considers the inputs, processes, and outcomes for each pertinent stakeholder group. Our research imparts important policy implications for institutions tasked with commercializing scientific discoveries and policy-makers challenged with developing high growth, sustainable models.

A CONFIGURATIONAL THEORY OF GENERALIZED EXCHANGE IN STAKEHOLDER-ORIENTED FIRMS,2023,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159560186&doi=10.5465%2famp.2022.0034&partnerID=40&md5=6a07b3332723b4da82c761b415e3484c,"Recent developments in stakeholder theory have refined our understanding of value creation via bilateral reciprocity. Generalized exchange is another important micro-foundational mechanism in value creation, but because of the potential for free-riding it is surprising that some stakeholders contribute more resources to a firm’s value-creating nexus than would be expected based on contractual obligations, and even beyond what bilateral reciprocity would predict. This paper aims to identify the minimum conditions that promote generalized exchange in a firm’s value-creating nexus. Because generalized exchange is causally complex—it can occur in multiple contexts and through various combinations of explanatory factors—a configurational theorizing approach is applied. We identify four combinations of attributes that consistently promote generalized exchange and limit free-riding behavior, such that generalized exchange can make a net positive difference in a firm’s nexus: the entrepreneurial logic (high rewards, strong institutional drivers), the conformity logic (powerful sanctions, strong institutional drivers), the influencer logic (powerful sanctions, individual or firm drivers), and the identification logic (high rewards, individual or firm drivers). This work provides an important additional explanation for why stakeholder-oriented firms tend to have higher performance, and can also help managers devise policies for increasing the amount of generalized exchange exhibited among their firm’s stakeholders.

Our analysis suggests that transaction risks and uncertainties motivate managers of private equity-sponsored leveraged buyouts and liability insurers to cooperate and change the ""rules of the game"" using creative customized contracts. The transformation of embedded institutional logics enables contracting parties not only to realize gains from collaboration but also from concessions that radically alter custom and practice. Our analysis suggests that the use of RWI in private equity transactions is both a determinant and consequence of institutional change in financial markets. We conclude that the private equity-RWI relation is a classic case of experimental institutionalism in action. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Responding to calls for an integrated approach to geopolitics and corporate strategy, we employ interdisciplinary insights from international relations, international business, and nonmarket strategy to explore how the rapidly changing geopolitical environment rooted in the U.S.-China rivalry affects corporate diplomacy of multinational enterprises. We define corporate diplomacy as the nonmarket strategies of firms that respond to and shape country diplomacy and international relations. We (a) examine how the U.S.-China rivalry has led to a transition in country diplomacy away from liberalism and toward realism, (b) evaluate the broad consequences of that transition for corporate diplomacy, and (c) develop a framework to assess corporate diplomacy under realism through the dual lens of geopolitical realism and institutional multiplicity. Specifically, firms must address global governance gaps (multilateral level), contradictory stakeholder pressures (bilateral level), a liability of origin (in the host country), and the rising importance of alignment with national security priorities (at home). We show that in the new geopolitical world rooted more heavily in realism, active corporate diplomacy remains important. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Although firms face growing pressures to address social problems that often are attributed to capitalism, firms also face intense pressures to maximize shareholder returns. In response, we outline key attributes of stakeholder-oriented leadership that can help managers address these new social demands. We also identify stakeholderbased strategies that firms are enacting to tackle these challenges, how lack of trust affects the impact of these strategies, and how strategic leadership is critically important to their effectiveness. We argue that a more widespread, consistent, and concerted effort to integrate social and financial missions, and to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders, is needed to mitigate the loss of trust in capitalism. We conclude with managerial, theoretical, and public policy implications, including a discussion of the trade-offs between private sector and government-mandated solutions to social problems. © 2022 Academy of Management.

This article describes the circumstances in which this outcome is likely to occur and howworkplace policies that rely solely on cultivating intrinsic values at the expense of monitoring and extrinsic controls may fail or have a contrary effect. It recommends integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic approaches together, and redefining professionalism as a deeper concept that includes a set of consistently repeated practices rather than a character trait. © 2022 Academy of Management.

While the concept has grown in popularity over the years, its application to a diverse set of research questions has rarely advanced its theoretical development. We stress test the relational competition concept to better evaluate its claim as a new view of competition in today's culturally and institutionally complex world. In particular, we assess the construct validity of relational competition and identify two issues hindering its theoretical development. The first stems from its reliance on an outdated linguistic theory, the Whorfian hypothesis. The second arises from inadequate construct clarity. As a result, although relational competition is an interesting concept, its validity as a theoretical construct remains questionable, thus weakening its claim to be a fundamentally new view of competition. We close by proposing three avenues for further scholarly development of the relational competition concept as well as outlining policy implications. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Some free-market economic theorists argue that cronyism is separate from capitalism, the dominant economic system, and that it is incorrect to conflate the two. Such arguments advance the idea that to reduce cronyism, governments should minimize taxation, regulation, and other forms of intervention. I argue that, although logically coherent in the abstract, this would be harmful in practice, primarily as regulation is a democratic expression of a society's will to restrict harmful forms of extraction, production, and consumption. Moreover, government intervention is often necessary to address economic and environmental inequality, something that continues to worsen in many advanced economies. I suggest two alternatives to radically free-market approaches to reducing cronyism. First, a small government approach that builds on libertarian socialism and anarchism, and second, a contrasting 'big-government' approach that adopts a mission-based framework to empower government by reducing public-private dualisms. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Since then, a flood of SH cases has severely impacted the image and reputation of the nonprofit sector. NPOs have been accused of attempting to cover up SH and, in some cases, of leniency toward the harassers. However, these claims have not been rigorously investigated. In this paper, we study the role and behavior of harassers and argue that they may target organizations operating in the nonprofit sector owing to specific conditions that enable them to avoid detection and punishment. We argue that an environment advantageous to those who perpetrate harassment is created by several exogenous (nonorganizational) factors, such as the vulnerability of aid recipients, the lack of legal protection of volunteers, and, in some cases, the cultural tolerance of discrimination against women. From this novel perspective, traditional anti-SH policies that focus on reacting to harassment and supporting the victim are viewed as necessary—but insufficient—approaches to the problem. We therefore propose a series of complementary policies that enable NPOs to adapt their operational environments to curb SH. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We also show that this research, often in a more applied and phenomenondriven mold, enjoys more recognition in other disciplines. We argue that Nyberg and Wright's critique is caught up in powerful disciplinary norms fetishizing a narrow set of elite journals to gauge research impact. Those norms also account for their recommendations' emphasis on (re-)theorizing or ""reimagining""capitalism and society at large. We argue that these measures would reinforce our discipline's preoccupation with novelty and ""interesting research,""and its inattention to developing pathways to impact. We propose a less restrictive but also less abstract research agenda that is ultimately focused on real-world impact. We outline an adaptive, participatory and transdisciplinary research paradigm designed to generate useful, actionable management knowledge for catalyzing climate action.  © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Although this aim is venerable, I contend that the advanced conceptualization undermines this aim in two ways. First, when conceptualized as a dynamic capability, corporate foresight represents an ideal that overstates firms' abilities to manage the future-potentially evenwith doubtful implications for policy-makers in the face of doomsday scenarios. Second, this conceptualization downplays the future, rather than putting it center stage. In response to these conceptual fallacies, I propose practice-based examinations of ""future-making""as a more promising platform for focusing attention on how actors actually, rather than ideally, engage with the future. This, then, calls on management scholars to take the future more seriously as an important but underresearched temporal category, and offers a more solid foundation for designing policy initiatives that aim to grow firms' preparedness for doomsday scenarios.  © 2022 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We found that policy implications are underutilized and not part of OBHRM's zeitgeist because only 1.5% of articles (i.e., n = 61) included them, suggesting that OBHRM risks becoming societally irrelevant. Societal irrelevance may result in lower perceived value-added, less prestige and status compared to other fields that do offer implications for policy, and less support regarding research funding. However, we see potential for OBHRM research to make meaningful contributions to policy-making in the future because we uncovered several areas that do offer some policy implications, such as labor relations, leadership, training and development, justice and fairness, and diversity and inclusion. We offer a dual theory-policy research agenda focused on (a) designing empirical studies with policy-making goals in mind; (b) converting existing exploratory and explanatory research to prescriptive and normative research; (c) deriving policies frombodies of research rather than individual studies; and (d) creating policies based on integrating theories, fields, and levels of analysis.We hope our article will be a catalyst for the creation and implementation of research-based policies in OBHRM and other management subfields. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Attacks on health workers and facilities exact a toll on civilian access to care and, in aggregate, population health status. A variety of humanitarian organizations provide essential services to augment limited state capacity. Yet, humanitarian organizations often work in parallel even in the same conflict-affected contexts. We use a high-reliability organization lens to examine violent attacks on the health care programs that humanitarian organizations operate in fragile states. More specifically, we examine an extant construct of coupling through qualitative evidence of collaborative relationships and creative problem-solving under stressful conditions. We find three salient features from qualitative data: trade-off between security and field access, transfer of risk to local actors, and marketization of aid. We find that these three features drive humanitarian organizations to act nimbly within countries to prioritize their organizational reliability across countries. While stabilizing the individual organization, these features create disincentives to interorganizational coordination at the cluster level and are agnostic to output (i.e., health care provision) reliability. We hope our study will sensitize readers to several issues facing high-reliability health care in times of war.  © 2022 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

The scant papers focusing on the prolonged character of the detrimental relational dynamic have taken a within-dyad perspective, largely ignoring within-person, group, or other external influences. Addressing these gaps in the literature, we introduce the barriers model of abusive supervision. This model posits a hierarchically organized set of obstacles that make it difficult for followers to escape the abusive supervisor, explaining why abuse can continue over long periods of time. Specifically, we present an onion-type model, in which the follower has a central position and each subsequent layer represents a more external cluster of barriers to leaving the abusive supervisor. Ranging from external to internal, these layers are: barriers in the larger societal context (Layer 1; e.g., ambiguous laws), barriers in the organizational context (Layer 2; e.g., unclear policies), barriers due to the abusive supervisor (Layer 3; e.g., isolating followers), and barriers within the abused follower (Layer 4; e.g., implicit leadership theories). We hope that our model inspires future research on the sustained nature of abusive supervision and provides practitioners with the necessary background information to help abused followers escape their supervisors.  © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

The question is not if our current order will end, but what policies might delay the inevitable. To ask this question we have taken a longue durée and institutional theory perspective to investigate how another complex society, the Classic Maya, both succeeded to avoid collapse and yet centuries later failed to prevent their own doomsday. Integrating new highly detailed archaeological and palaeoecological data with institutional theory paradigms we develop case studies of managerial and policy responses just prior to the final ClassicMaya collapse and one some 600 years earlier in which institutional entrepreneurship was used to avoid a collapse. We draw four policy directives from our case studies regarding (i) acceptance of potential imminent collapse, (ii) vulnerabilities now confronting our institutions and logics, (iii) the razor's edge of transformative institutional entrepreneurship, and (iv) the threats of ""statusrivalry""spirals. We finally take the risky step of examining our contemporary situation. Here, we observe that two of our central institutions, democracy and capitalism have become our greatest weaknesses driving cycles of short-term decision making, hypercoherence, and inequality. We suggest that without significant yet very careful modification of institutions and logics this will lead our apogee into our collapse, as those central institutionsmay become destabilized and delegitimatized.  © 2022 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

In contrast to previous literature, I argue that a given technological discontinuity can be both competence-destroying and competence-enhancing. I advance this argument by developing the concept of a competence ecosystem: the total collection of competences that supports the operation of a particular incumbent technology. Atechnological discontinuity can destroy competences in some areas of this ecosystem, while simultaneously enhancing competences in others. Therefore, ""doomsdays""for some incumbent firms in the ecosystem are coupled with ""new dawns""for others. I illustrate this varied pattern of competence destruction and enhancement with a detailed discussion of three contemporary technological discontinuities: video streaming, electric vehicles, and the advent ofmessenger RNA technology for vaccines. I draw implications for future research from these cases, emphasizing the positive feedback loop connecting technological discontinuities and the competence-destruction and enhancement patterns that they generate. I also derive implications for management practice and business education, with the dual goals of improving managers' predictions about the impact of technological discontinuities, and enhancing students' understanding of the nuances of technological innovation.  © 2022 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

In this paper, we suggest that there is more at stake than the issue of relating theory to practice, that we need to consider how we generate knowledge and think about its relevance. We argue that at the heart of such an endeavor lie critical ontological and epistemological considerations: first, the need to rethink our self–Other relationships—the nature of the relationship between ourselves as scholars and community members; and second, the need to generate more situated and relational forms of knowing-from-within that address social and environmental issues. Drawing on the work of critical sociologist Michael Burawoy, we elaborate four approaches to generating knowledge within organization and management studies (OMS), arguing that a public organization and management studies approach offers one way of making our work matter, requiring us to move from being spectators of the world to becoming actively engaged with multiple Others in generating knowledge and action. We discuss both the challenges and opportunities of a public OMS, offering examples of how we can become more actively engaged. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Corporate foresight is defined, situated in the broader epistemological underpinnings of futures studies, theoretically inscribed in the dynamic capabilities' framework, distinguished fromrelated constructs, and deconstructed in its main components. Its main antecedents and outcomes are elaborated, and further research directions are discussed. It is argued that corporate foresight is of fundamental relevance to strategy and management scholarship due to four reasons: (a) corporate foresight can integrate with, enrich, and expand the dynamic capabilities framework by considering an additional, underinvestigated, future-oriented firm capability; (b) the emergence of corporate foresight is an organizational phenomenon, closely aligned with the contingency theory of the firm; (c) corporate foresight can favorably affect important organizational outcomes including learning, creativity, innovation, and performance via a mechanism to create competitive advantage that has not been previously explored by strategy and management scholarship; and (d) further investigating corporate foresight froma strategy and management point of viewopens a rich research agenda.  © 2022 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Capitalism is blamed for a variety of economic and social ills. We argue that these critiques are often misguided because they often confuse capitalism with cronyism, which is a system of government favoritism toward particular firms. We begin by outlining the basic principles and advantages of capitalism as a system of economic exchange, and we explain how cronyism is antithetical to the basic tenets of capitalism. We then delineate various forms of cronyism and explain how cronyism diverts resources from more productive uses, undermines government institutions, insulates firms from market-based competition, and discourages innovation, economic growth, and social welfare over the long term. We further argue that the failure to differentiate capitalism from cronyism has contributed to the view that capitalism itself is unjust, rigged to benefit the politically connected, and responsible for various harms that can and should be attributed to cronyism. The article concludes by demonstrating the negative consequences of conflating cronyism and capitalism for research, teaching, and practice, and by making suggestions to thwart cronyism. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

NATURAL MONOPOLY PRIVATIZATION: MINIMIZING REGULATORY TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN RENT EXTRACTION AND INNOVATION,2022,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125274769&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2019.0170&partnerID=40&md5=ee2a1f038429e2321526e909f41dc685,"Privatizations of state-owned enterprises are associated with significant gains in efficiency postprivatization, born from both exposure to product market competition and improved managerial incentives resulting from ownership structure changes. However, for some important industries—such as utilities—that are natural monopolies, privatization alone will not engender product market competition. We argue that regulation which induces firms to innovate new products, services, and processes that reduce costs are crucial for privatized natural monopolies. We compare the innovation-incentivizing effects of the two major regulatory regimes, the rate of return (RoR) regulatory model and the price-capping (PC) model. We argue that RoR regulation inhibits innovation in privatized natural monopolies by discouraging managers from minimizing costs and making long-term positive net present value investments. In contrast, PC regulation can induce innovation, but may not prevent utilities from extracting rents from consumers. We discuss trade-offs between discouraging both innovation and rent extraction by adopting RoR regulation, or facilitating innovation but allowing rent-extraction by adopting PC regulation. We present a normative solution, “induced-lag rate of return” regulation, which offers a middle-ground solution to this trade-off problem. This novel regulatory structure allows firms and managers to benefit from long-term innovative investments while maintaining competitive pressure on prices. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

While the outcomes of these tax exemptions are often positive, there are value-detracting situations in which the cost of granting the tax exemption is likely to exceed its benefits. To date, explanations for these value-detracting situations remain scattered and discipline-centric. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to clarify the conditions under which tax-exempt nonprofits detract value from society. We survey 15 years of tax-exempt nonprofit scholarship, across nine disciplines, and identify three value-detracting conditions: policy-making and regulation intemperance, nonprofit management and governance distraction, and detection and prosecution inconsistencies. These three conditions interact and reinforce each other, compounding the value destruction to society. Overall, our findings offer important policy insights regarding the unintended consequences of tax exemptions, and our framework can be used to identify negative-return situations. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

Digital assets have brought about a new kind of firm-level internationalization. Those assets operate as firm-specific advantages (FSAs) throughout the firm’s value-creating processes. The dark side refers to the new challenges and costs associated with such globalization, especially those related to overestimating the nonlocation-boundedness of FSAs and to underestimating the need to engage in novel resource recombination as a complement to the extant FSA reservoir. It demands the same attention we want to give to supposed opportunities and benefits. Our research question addresses how to achieve the desirable, balanced conceptual focus on the bright and dark sides of digital globalization, aligned with mainstream contingency thinking in international business research. We first describe the key components of the bright side, namely a higher digital intensity of the MNE’s asset base and the related FSAs supporting digital globalization. We subsequently provide an overview of the main components of the dark side.

Moreover, the opportunities that platform-mediated markets offer not only attract enormous numbers of entrepreneurs but also support the growth of entire ecosystems of producers, sellers, and specialized service providers. The increased economic and business significance of digital platforms has attracted myriad studies exploring their power dynamics and general impact. This research has largely overlooked the power imbalance that entrepreneurs experience as members of the platform ecosystem, and provided little guidance on how these far more numerous firms should compete. Drawing upon power-dependence theory, we show that the power asymmetry in the relationship between the platform and its ecosystem members is intrinsic to the economics and the technological architecture of digital platforms. We conceptually analyze the sources of this power, and we unravel the novel component of risks that emanate from this imbalance. Our analysis suggests that the conditions of engagement for platform entrepreneurs are so different from traditional entrepreneurship that these entrepreneurs are more usefully termed “platform-dependent entrepreneurs” (PDEs). Further, we explore the strategies that PDEs are developing to mitigate their dependence. Finally, our study provides a framework for policy-makers that are considering regulating platform-organized markets. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

This exchange argues that platform firms may treat entrepreneurs differently on other platform types—particularly ones where complex relationships may cause participants and platforms to become mutually dependent, or where the platform’s position depends less on extracting revenue directly from participants. I suggest that particular business models might facilitate the use of alternative strategic actions that are more benign toward entrepreneurs. These situations can determine additional boundary conditions for this emerging entrepreneurship theory. I provide examples from three platform types where alternative platform behaviors can be observed: platforms based on a sharing economy model; platforms that cultivate product lines or a wider ecosystem of services; and platforms that build communities to support their business model. These situations can mitigate platform firms’ tendencies to treat platform participants as pure revenue sources (and can promote different treatments of platform participants). Many business models involve complex multi-actor relationships that can be designed to create different ways of generating revenue. These design affordances can then support broader strategic actions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

With more than 50 years of scholarship on global mobility, international business (IB) scholars should be well positioned to address this challenge. Yet the field’s historic emphasis on expatriates has resulted in dominant assumptions and perspectives that are not relevant for other groups moving across borders. Empirical path dependence has caused significant conceptual blindness. Focusing primarily on expatriates who, in fact, represent an extreme case of international transitions has resulted in conceptualizations of international adjustment that are partial and incomplete. These conceptualizations overly rely on individual- and organizational-level factors at the expense of critical macrolevel factors. Extending the domain of IB scholarship by examining the contrasting extreme case of refugees opens up the field to new theorizing and a broader, more accurate conceptualization of international adjustment. Studying the international adjustment of refugees exposes previously taken-for-granted assumptions and generates insights that will allow IB as well as general management scholars to develop more robust theories and urgently needed practical interventions. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

We then draw out and illuminate three pathways indicative of applying a positive lens: resource unlocking, capacity creating, and strength building. In closing, we invite scholars to consider applying a positive lens to their own area of inquiry to bolster understanding of flourishing within and across organizations by offering a set of questions to help them determine if their own domains of inquiry might be ripe for a positive lens. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
Artificial intelligence as augmenting automation: Implications for employment,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121025980&doi=10.5465%2famp.2019.0062&partnerID=40&md5=2a51a1359b344575af27e2c3661442ae,"There has been concern that artificial intelligence (AI) may cause significant unemployment; however, proponents say that AI augments jobs. Both of these positions have substance, but there is a need to articulate the mechanisms by which AI may actually do both, and, in the process, transform the balance of work available. We examine economic studies of automation’s impact on employment and skills, illustrating the favoring of nonroutine skills over the routine, and a hollowing-out of middle-skill jobs. We then use case evidence of AI and automation to show how AI is augmenting automation to the same effect, allowing firms to modularize and control routine work. The remaining work tends to be nonroutine and low-skilled (allowing for further replacement in the future), or high-skilled. We illustrate the dynamic effects that occur when AI is combined with other key technologies, creating economies of scale and scope for firms. Through augmentation, the resulting employment structures may also have lower quantities of high-skilled work. This depends on advances in AI, and its ability to replace more complex forms of work. We end with a call for more critical conversations between society and business, and on what business schools should teach. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
A feminist perspective on conducting personally relevant research: Working mothers studying pregnancy and motherhood at work,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116221973&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0087&partnerID=40&md5=9e4347c2c83b0cfb6b57f53dec4d2917,"While often focused on theory building and intellectual credibility, management scholars have rich, complex lives outside of academia. Their non-work lives may inform the phenomenon they choose to study, the research questions they ask, and even how they engage with the field. We suggest management scholars may benefit from becoming more transparent about the connections between their lives and their research, and about how these connections inform the research process. Drawing on feminist methodology, we reflect back on our experience as working mothers researching pregnancy and motherhood at work. In so doing, we uncover four complexities that arise when conducting research that connects to one’s personal experience. We label these complexities: (a) engaging personal and professional selves, (b) managing power dynamics, (c) integrating emotional and rational understanding, and (d) advancing theory and practice. In examining our research process from the perspective of feminist methodology, we also identify tactics researchers can engage to navigate these complexities. We conclude with a discussion of how editors, reviewers, and authors can enhance the rigor and legitimacy of personally relevant research. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

The liminal researcher: Being not quite the center of attention,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116277307&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0086&partnerID=40&md5=f465f748532f407512fb0f5ae7711ab5,"Liminality refers to being “betwixt and between” (Turner, 1967). We draw on boundary theory to propose and elaborate upon the notion of “liminal researchers”—the in-between status we hold when we conduct research that is personally meaningful or in highly familiar settings, despite the fact that we are not actually a member of the group being studied. Indeed, being a liminal researcher in organizational studies denotes dwelling on the boundary of the group or phenomenon being studied and puts us in a position to be neither fully in nor fully out of the entity or topic of interest. To further develop these ideas, we draw on our personal and professional experiences as parents and researchers of individuals with developmental disabilities. We reflect on management-related projects that we conduct on students and workers with developmental disabilities and how a highly reflexive stance facilitates our research. Throughout, we use a boundary theory lens to explore being liminal researchers and provide strategies for authors, editors, and reviewers. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
The undervalued power of self-relevant research: The case of researching retirement while retiring,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116226646&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0083&partnerID=40&md5=343e9f81011f55aff0b4a54b97313730,"For decades, management research training has emphasized objectivity, typically considered an arm’s-length distance between the research topic and the researcher’s personal interests. This emphasis has led scholars to avoid research topics of deep personal relevance—or at least to avoid acknowledging such relevance. We argue that this headlong pursuit of objectivity has led the field to vastly undervalue what we call self-relevant research: immersive field research on a topic with which the researcher has significant personal experience, and which is important to the researcher’s self-identity. To illustrate, we draw on our own current experience in a team of scholars doing self-relevant research on retirement. We argue that embracing self-relevant research can enhance the richness, validity, and methodological diversity of management research, and can be essential for understanding phenomena involving unusual experiences, high degrees of emotionality, or identity issues. We discuss the advantages and challenges that arise when researchers have a deeply personal connection to the research topic, and we describe measures researchers can take to leverage advantages and mitigate challenges therein. We also highlight the value of engaging in group self-reflection in the course of collaborative research of this type, and discuss implications for the field and individual researchers. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
When objectivity is out of reach: Learnings from conducting research with commercially sexually exploited women,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116223536&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0088&partnerID=40&md5=b24d8b01d332a92c5aa90d51df268351,"Leveraging my personal narrative, stemming from conducting research in a personally relevant context with marginalized participants, I use standpoint theory and a posttraumatic growth lens to provide insights about how researchers might learn and grow from a rejection of traditional objectivity in such settings. Specifically, I highlight my experiences in volunteering at, and then collecting data within, an organization that aims to improve the lives of women who have been commercially sexually exploited. By sharing my narrative, I hope to destigmatize the acknowledgment of personal connections with participants prior to, during, or after data collection, particularly in contexts involving marginalization, to drive conversations that better address the emotional and psychological realities of completing this important but challenging work. To that end, I argue that actively addressing the limitations of objectivity under these circumstances might provide researchers with opportunities for positive scholarly growth. By allowing researchers to have honest discussions about their connections to participants and the emotions that surround their work, they may become better equipped to conduct research that benefits the field, while gaining valuable skills and insights.

Too close or optimally positioned? The value of personally relevant research,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116225037&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0009&partnerID=40&md5=1ea48c340ab5893aa8e7a625f98d5349,"Much of organizational research is inspired by the real-life experiences of scholars. Yet pervading our field and much of social science is a stigma against engaging in personally relevant research, defined as research that addresses questions in which scholars are personally invested or involves a population to which they belong or in which they hold a personal interest. Scholars are routinely cautioned about pursuing such projects, and those who choose to do so are often advised to conceal or downplay personal connections in their published work. This hesitation is grounded in assumptions that scholars cannot maintain objectivity while addressing issues of personal significance, so the quality of such work is suspect. On the contrary, this symposium argues that, when navigated effectively, personal connections to one’s research reinforce its trustworthiness and may enhance rather than detract from its quality and impact. In this symposium six diverse research articles offer valuable insights developed from authors’ experience of conducting personally relevant research. We discuss the challenges, opportunities, implications, and importance of personally relevant research for scholars, reviewers, and society. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
Urban farmers and cowboy coders: Reimagining rural venturing in the 21st century,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121042304&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0157&partnerID=40&md5=656d8f2c08c15414b737677efbd90aca,"Across the social sciences, there is a growing recognition that rural innovation and entrepreneurship are at the frontlines of responding to increasing dynamism and complexity in social, cultural, and economic environments. Yet, a review of the disparate literatures on rural venturing reveals that this research has largely escaped the attention of management and entrepreneurship scholars. Our analysis suggests that scholarly progress has been forestalled by three interconnected research practices: gap-spotting scholarship, decontextualized theory-building, and an allegiance to binary oppositions. In response to the challenges posed by these practices, this article identifies three alternative, multiparadigmatic research tools to enhance the effectiveness of management scholars in contributing to multidisciplinary fields of inquiry such as rural entrepreneurship: problematization, hybridization, and contextualization. Through the application of these tools, we develop new avenues to consider the complex interplay between community, space, and place; novel innovation pathways; the power of traditional values and contexts; and the varied nature of modern business venturing. Our work also contributes fresh perspectives on the manner in which management scholars can offer more effective conceptual leadership in multidisciplinary fields to theorize complex phenomena.

In the heart of a storm: Leveraging personal relevance through “inside-out” research,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068344134&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0089&partnerID=40&md5=974538ba9bb70eb12d44470498bc3efe,"By considering our experiences of a crisis at our own organization—the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal at Penn State—we argue for the value of leveraging diverse, personally relevant insider views to better understand difficult-to-study organizational phenomena, including those that are ambiguous, contested, or emotional. Researchers tend to study organizational dynamics from the outside in, seeking a dominant dispassionate interpretation. In contrast, we advocate for inside-out perspectives that give voice to introspective and reflexive views—including of researchers themselves—to account for cognitive and emotional experiences of those directly affected by events. We encourage researchers to overtly reflect on their cognitive and emotional responses to research. Such personally engaged research comes with potential biases, which researchers must mitigate. Yet such research also has distinct advantages. Researchers working from the inside out are motivated and positioned to employ deep, long-term, real-time engagement, with access to many types of sensitive data that are often unavailable to outsiders. Researchers for whom events have direct personal relevance as insiders to a phenomenon or organization, thus, have the means to bring different and deeper insight and richer understandings to organizational research by including their experiences. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
"Something old, something new: Reframing the integration of social capital into strategic HRM research",2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089465977&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0028&partnerID=40&md5=6f007b803275dfa9d9bb247ce3d3730c,"Relationships drive numerous organizational capabilities. While this is generally acknowledged, many of the most widely used frameworks guiding research and practice in human resource management (HRM) do not explicitly incorporate social capital and social network factors in their designs, despite recognition that relationships are influential. In this paper, we argue for an explicit integration and application of social capital mechanisms in strategic HRM frameworks. We illustrate how a relationship lens can contribute to strategic HRM thinking at the individual level using extensions of the job characteristics model, at the group level by enhancing the design of effective work groups, and at the organizational level by augmenting the HR architecture. Further, consistent with the emerging co-evolution perspective on microfoundations of organizational outcomes, we propose that social capital and its development should be considered an input to HRM policies and practices, an element in implementation processes, and an outcome of HR activities. The proposed ideas both fill a gap in current strategic HRM theory and practice and challenge some of the basic assumptions guiding much of the work in this area. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

The Project collected survivors’ oral histories, a data type that is a mainstay of qualitative research, and subjected their narrative data to statistical analysis to detect aggregated trends. In this paper, the authors discuss the process of straddling the dichotomies of insider–outsider and qualitative–quantitative, and address the “myth of informed objectivity,” and the need for hybrid research structures with the intent to innovate in humanities projects such as this. In presenting key learnings from the project, this paper highlights the tensions that the authors faced between positivist and interpretivist methods of inquiry, between “insider” and “outsider” categories of positionality, and in the quantification of qualitative oral history data. The paper concludes with an illustrative example from one of the lead authors’ past research experiences to suggest that the tensions of this project are general in occurrence and global in applicability, beyond the specifics of the Partition case study explored here. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

We refer to this agreement process as “construct convergence.” While construct convergence is essential for theorizing, we suggest there may also be negative, albeit unintended, consequences of construct convergence. In this paper, we explore this tension. We rely on an example from our work–family enrichment research, along with exemplars of other construct development paths, to identify the drivers of construct convergence and illustrate how construct convergence may inhibit construct evolution that integrates new theoretical perspectives and is attentive to shifting organizational and work realities. We conclude with a discussion of how scholars can better manage the tension between construct convergence and construction evolution so that we continue to build robust theory that remains connected to contemporary management practice. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,
To mean is to be perceived: Studying the meaning of work through the eyes of others,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076886063&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0156&partnerID=40&md5=37d59586834a5e190178d2243f293232,"Social scientific research on the meaning of work has depended mostly on workers’ own reports. These reports have contributed to our understanding of what makes work meaningful. However, research has treated the meaning of work as an individual-level phenomenon evaluated from a worker’s perspective. This empirical path does not capture how meaning is influenced by the perspectives of others. This paper asserts that research based on personal observations and experience limits our understanding of the meaning of work. We use accounts from third-person perspectives to show how meaning is perceived by someone other than the worker. We advocate the use of novel data sources that consider the meaning of work seen through the eyes of others. We develop two examples: the collected oral histories in Studs Terkel’s Working and the “Portraits of Grief” from the New York Times, narratives based on interviews with relatives and friends of 9/11 attack victims. In both cases, diverse people reflect on the place of work in a meaningful life. Third-person perspectives offer unique insight and practical guidance on what work means and how it is viewed by others. These views also mirror broad societal values about the importance of work in life. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

Although we agree that social media platforms have weakened stakeholder influence in certain conditions, such is not the case for all firms, all stakeholders, or all situations. Drawing from sociocognitive and self-determination theories, we contend that (a) independent, owner-managed small firms present a context wherein information overload is rendered less of an issue because the information about the firm is more salient to locals; (b) stakeholders can be motivated to influence firms via social media platforms, which facilitate the collective engagement of local community members; and (c) uncertain economic circumstances (e.g., COVID-19) activate stakeholder information searches, which often occur through social media. Together, these three conditions enhance stakeholder power and influence. We also contemplate how, even under these conditions, stakeholder influence may change over time vis-a-vis the issue–attention cycle and societalization. We conclude our Exchange with a call for more research on stakeholder influence over independent, owner-manager small businesses. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

In this article, we offer a platform-based view of competition in digital markets, present three distinct types of platform markets, the key elements affecting the value of a platform-based service, and the competitive logic that shape competition in these markets. We introduce the concept of platform identity to delineate the platform’s technological and market profile delineating the platform’s competitive identity domain and distinguish it from platform size (which reflects the scale of its user and complementor network). We argue that each platform has a unique identity, and comparisons of rival platforms along these two strategic dimensions—platform size and platform identity—help to explain the nature of competition in digital markets and explain the unique competitive dynamics that depart from mainstream competitive theory’s predictions. Our framework also helps to identify cases where the market boundaries and competitive domains become contested because of platform competition, leading to market convergence. We discuss how the proposed framework can enrich and extend existing theory on competitive dynamics to the context of digital markets, and offer a foundation for future research. r Academy of Management Perspectives",,

The efficient management of attention facilitates performance when individuals must think and act quickly and adaptively, or when job demands are novel and time is constrained. In organizations, these executive functions may be especially relevant for how successful leaders and managers perform in their several roles and how they further organizational goals. Yet, organizational behavior research has largely neglected an executive functioning lens. The present work illustrates how the core facets of executive functions inhibition, working memory, and shifting have implications for leadership and management outcomes by influencing common leadership tasks: decision-making, planning and monitoring, problem solving, negotiating, and innovating. Our goal is to supplement prevailing explanations of these tasks (e.g., general intelligence and job knowledge) with this executive functioning lens. We provide strategies for organizations to assess and bolster these executive functions in their leaders and managers and urge future organizational research to consider the important role of executive functions involved in the selection, training, and management of leaders and managers. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We synthesize reports from the mass media, academic literature, and the results of a Delphi study to provide a preview of the potential for automating technologies to affect the work of business researchers. The results indicate that many current technologies can be applied to further automate researchers’ tasks, and that scientists in automation and artificial intelligence are actively working to do so.

In doing so, we explicate why the focus on commitment HR practices has hindered our understanding of the horizontal fit of HR practices. We suggest that this is problematic in light of recent research demonstrating that control HR practices independently affect performance and may interact with commitment HR practices to affect performance. Additionally, we provide guidance for future research that incorporates both commitment and control HR practices. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

While finance scholars have focused on understanding what firms activist hedge funds target and the performance repercussions of their campaigns, management scholars have largely ignored this important constituent. Based on our extensive research on the context of hedge fund activism, we here provide a research agenda that articulates the opportunities for management scholars to conduct investigations into this important phenomenon. By shedding light on the dynamics of hedge fund activism, management scholars have the opportunity to provide greater clarity as to whether these activists are shareholder champions or if they undermine the long-Term strategic health of companies. © 2021 Academy of Management.

Governance implications of attracting external equity investors in private family firms,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102622428&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2017.0204&partnerID=40&md5=b236454f9efe724f2c4221097846e27e,"While research has commonly assumed that business-owning families are concerned about the preservation of control, families are increasingly seeking cooperation with external investors to accomplish firm-or family-level goals. In this paper, we provide a conceptual configuration of the different governance scenarios that may arise when family owners attract outside capital. Combining two important family objectives (a) to provide liquidity either to the family or to the firm, and (b) to cede or to retain long-Term family control we identify four scenarios with different governance implications and preferred types of external investors. Our analysis increases understanding of the evolving structures of ownership in private family firms, the effectiveness and efficiency of governance arrangements in family firm external investor cooperation, and the increasingly heterogeneous private equity funding landscape. © 2021 Academy of Management.

Searching for competitive advantage in the HRM-firm performance relationship,2021,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083440289&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2018.0065&partnerID=40&md5=49e2b37b84650888044938b48d30f391,"Although the strategic human resource management (SHRM) stream of research has made impressive progress in recent years, the majority of it has become centered on the “universalistic” relationship of a particular kind of human resource system, most commonly labeled as a “high-performance work system,” with firm-level dependent variables. We argue that a broader perspective on strategy applied to human resource management (HRM) leverages strategic factor market theory within the resource-based view of the firm to suggest novel kinds of research questions for SHRM. In particular, we highlight four specific underresearched areas of inquiry for SHRM: (1) HRM capabilities, (2) intangible strategic assets, (3) the “market” for HR practices, and (4) complementarities. Our discussion of these topics shares a common emphasis on the causes and consequences of firm-level heterogeneity with respect to HRM. The strategic perspectives discussed in this paper suggest new ways to consider where, in the relationship between HRM and firm performance, such heterogeneity and, relatedly, competitive advantage through people, may be found. r Academy of Management Perspectives",,

And while the theoretical premises that underlie these concepts remain useful and intuitively compelling, the lack of empirical evidence to support them proves problematic. Part of the reason, we suspect, is that current research on fit and alignment does not fully reflect realities of contemporary organizations or the practical challenges faced by managers. We argue that HR researchers have an opportunity to reframe concepts of fit and alignment to better reflect the complexities and dynamics of contemporary models of strategy and organization. We suggest that an ecosystem perspective can help us study the processes of alignment, not just its static features. It can help to depict the interactions among elements of the workforce compositions, capabilities, and cultures. Because these interactions are myriad and constantly in flux, HR researchers might approach alignment in an evolutionary way whereby practices are constantly changing and then being reintegrated into the system to assure consistency and synergy. The benefit of doing so might reinvigorate research on strategy and HR. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

However, managing stars is decidedly difficult. Scholars have not yet appropriately addressed this practical problem. Much of the issue pertains to interpreting our theoretical models that convey human capital from a static perspective. By combining incomplete contract theory with human capital research and theories of strategy, we show how existing theory can provide a framework for solving problems related to managing stars while also offering a platform for further research within the strategic human capital field. To do this, we recap extant theory and examine how stars create value for an organization by codeveloping firm-specific capital while simultaneously developing general human capital. In addition, we provide a practical dynamic value appropriation framework to illustrate how the employer and the employee determine who captures the value stars create as they go through the employment life cycle. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

We draw on and extend multiple agency theory and examine three types of asymmetries that may undermine the interest alignment of GPs and LPs: Asymmetries of power, information, and incentives.

These studies have attempted to explain whether firm performance is associated with “best-practice” or “best-fit” human resource management (HRM) practices. The focus on internally consistent (horizontal fit) HRM practices is better characterized as tactical implementation than as strategic formulation. In the latter, HRM leads rather than follows the firm’s long-term responses to shifts in the firm’s competitive and market environment. In this paper, I propose an attention-based view of the firm to reframe SHRM research and policy to support a strategy formulation based on environment conditions (vertical fit).

Collectively, the three papers in this symposium contribute to this effort through a reconsideration of the content of the HR systems we study, an expansion of the strategic bases against which we consider the vertical fit of HR systems, and a more explicit incorporation of complexity and change into our understanding of both the horizontal and vertical fit of the HR “ecosystems” in organizations.

Thus, in this paper, we begin the conversation on angels and institutions and provide a framework for studying the post-investment governance role taken by angels amid institutional variation. First, we provide a review of the research conducted on angel-centered corporate governance. We then explore how the regulative, normative, and culturalcognitive institutional domains may influence angel governance arrangements. Within these domains, we isolate how the extent, frequency, and mode of angel engagement with the target venture can be shaped by the institutional environment. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We challenge this position by describing several perils of such a move. Our conceptual framework rests on the assumption that ""opportunity"" is best characterized as an umbrella construct capable of unifying competing and complementary theories. We propose that dislodging the concept would subject the field to at least four perils: The peril of a displacement of ends in entrepreneurship research, the peril of increased myopia about the enactment of opportunity, the peril of ambiguity all over again, and the peril of disconnection from practice. We argue that leveraging opportunity as an umbrella construct is a more fruitful path, and we identify increasing representational inclusiveness, the possibility of evangelistic action, and heedful interrelating as important advantages of this course of action. These benefits suggest that focusing on opportunity as an integrative umbrella construct offers a way forward for entrepreneurship research. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Neither tack provides a strong justification for abandoning the concept of opportunity in the field of entrepreneurship. Indeed, the concept of opportunities has forced entrepreneurship scholars to be clearer about their assumptions, has focused attention on Knightian uncertainty and the process of forming and exploiting opportunities, and links entrepreneurship research with some theories in the field of strategic management. It seems likely that opportunities will continue as an important concept in the field of entrepreneurship for some time. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Yet to capture value, firms also need to consider how to govern their cooperative efforts and prevent unintended knowledge leakage. This paper develops a novel framework for researching this paradox of openness, which combines an organizational boundary with a relational contract design perspective. First, we extend prior literature by arguing that value is not created only by optimizing resource bundles through external search processes (i.e., competence boundaries). Instead, value can be created by managing interdependencies with external parties (i.e., power boundaries), aligning open innovation activities with the organization's identity (i.e., identity boundaries), and coordinating diverse transactions in an open innovation portfolio (i.e., efficiency boundaries). Second, we propose that relational contract design is an important alternative to formal appropriation regimes and discuss how contractual mechanisms derived from a relational perspective can enable value capture in an open innovation context. Finally, we discuss how firms can strategically manage configurations of firm boundaries and contract design via a set of dynamic capabilities. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

The language and time of an academic stance sidestep defining aspects of the entrepreneurial experience: Its indeterminate situations, instrumental role of language, and role of knowledge as guide to action. Seeking attunement with these aspects, this paper outlines the evolution of opportunity from language dependence to language independence within a process of transition from individual aspirations to social structure. This opens up promising research directions, in which the scholar-entrepreneur relationship is redefined in terms of solidarity rather than objectivity. Alongside the traditional emphasis on theoretical contribution, research could seek design and phronetic contributions in an open-ended search for better ideas for coping with a contingent reality. © 2020 Academy of Management.

We take the external enabler perspective several steps further. We develop a new framework that conceptualizes external enablers in terms of their characteristics, roles, and mechanisms and detail their implications for entrepreneurial action and outcomes. We argue that this framework provides a more productive perspective for theorizing about the influence of external, actor-independent factors on venture creation processes than discovery theory's notion of objective, preexisting opportunities. At the same time, it is compatible with the dynamic-agentic view of new venture creation proposed by varieties of creation theory. For researchers who are interested in instances of societal change from a sociological or historical vantage point, the framework facilitates theorizing across such instances and about the microfoundations of aggregate-level changes. Additional domains that can benefit from our new framework include design- and strategy-oriented research and practice. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Using behavioral theory, we adopt a dynamic perspective on changes in board composition and evaluate the extent to which decision-making processes change accordingly. To complement the theoretical development, we examine four cases of social enterprises that changed their boards in response to the pressures of marketization and professionalization. We suggest that radical changes to board composition are necessary to govern the dual logics. Furthermore, attention to the organization's bylaws is important to address the effects of bounded rationality and the formation of a dominant coalition in the board's decisionmaking processes.

Even secondary stakeholders now have the ability to engage mass audiences, but the likelihood of success of most stakeholders' efforts to alter firm behavior has been constrained amid the torrent of information flows.

We add innovation error (type IV), action errors (type V and type VI), and the cascading iatrogenic error of the seventh kind (type VII), a dangerous source of irreversible organizational iatrogenesis. While many undesirable outcomes result from uncontrollable interaction of exogenous black swans with unavoidable endogenous ignorance, many are the result of controllable endogenous factors such as poor choices, faulty tactics, poor vision, ""gung-ho""attitudes toward action, lack of patience, ignorance, and faulty data analysis. Our framework clarifies for leaders where and why to drill down in the decision process to lower risk of uncontrollable iatrogenic outcomes. © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
"Allegations of mistreatment in an era of harm avoidance: Taboos, challenges, and implications for management",2020,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091120941&doi=10.5465%2famp.2018.0144&partnerID=40&md5=8ffd5331366c02fdf99242fc51bdf2da,"The contemporary culture of harm avoidance sanctifies the role of the victim, which creates a suite of challenges for managers and researchers attempting to address impartially allegations of harmdoing. We contend that victimhood sanctification compromises our understanding of mistreatment largely due to three forces: 1) a shift toward hypersensitivity, which expands the definition of mistreatment, 2) cognitive shortcuts that cast actors as either victims or perpetrators, and 3) victims' role in experiencing or perceiving mistreatment. Of interest are allegations of nonphysical harms that may manifest as individual-level mistreatment or as systemic-level mistreatment based on identity group membership (e.g., women). We argue that victimhood sanctification and prioritizing employees' subjective experiences are incompatible with the impartial study of mistreatment and with fostering organizational harmony. We suggest solutions, including accepting a level of human imperfection and mutual culpability, addressing fears of accusations, de-escalating competitive victimhood, and promoting workplace harmony as a shared responsibility of all parties. We maintain that empirical investigations, open discourse, and data-driven understanding of these challenges, even if unpalatable, are necessary to inform the best practices that generate long-term peace, not just short-term safety. © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Little progress has been made to improve corporate governance outcomes despite repeated calls for change from activist shareholders, arbiters of good governance, and government regulators. We argue that the problem lies in the need for any corporate governance innovation to be recognized as legitimate from the outset, which is unlikely given that innovation itself is inherently illegitimate. We examine the legitimacy shortcomings of a number of corporate governance innovations, assessing them according to the categories of pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy. Failure to achieve multiple categories of legitimacy destines the innovation to contention and limited application, while gaining two or more suggests that the innovation will be widely adopted. We close with a call for greater conceptual and functional flexibility to allow firms to experiment with various corporate governance innovations and react more dynamically to changing firm and environmental conditions. © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Extending organizational boundaries through outsourcing: Toward a dynamic risk-management capability framework,2020,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091045742&doi=10.5465%2famp.2015.0191&partnerID=40&md5=56e16af63259455f49a072d7c77605eb,"Pressure to maintain organizational profitability in an increasingly uncertain business environment is driving executives to seek competitive advantage by increasing their dependence on outsourcing, consciously taking on the associated additional risks. While risk management around outsourcing is traditionally perceived as preventing bad things from happening, this paper extends this view to align it closer to the board and executive leadership strategic agenda, enabling them to consider the full spectrum of potential opportunities that outsourcing could create for their organizations, particularly those that are more radical or transformational in nature. Building on insights from the dynamic capability theory and empirical data collected via survey and follow-up interviews of top executives, we offer a framework that encompasses two new capabilities integral to managing service providers: (a) the capability to have a broader perception of risk in outsourcing that recognizes opportunities that these risks present in addition to the threats and hazards and (b) the ""asset orchestration""capability to develop more mature risk-management mechanisms that enable organizations to maximize the opportunity while addressing the risk. The framework provides multi-industry perspectives on gaining competitive advantage and risk mitigation through a newer and more dynamic approach to outsourcing and related risk management.  © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Our aim is to address the complexity and ambiguity surrounding anger at work and simultaneously offer a more balanced perspective of its potential. First, we clarify features of the anger experience, examining its intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social-cultural layers as well as differentiating various forms of workplace anger using the dual threshold model (Geddes & Callister, 2007). Second, we address key misunderstandings operating in organizations with regard to anger by reviewing research that illustrates why expressed anger is allowed and found to be appropriate (even beneficial) in certain circumstances and less so in others. Third, we challenge anger's reputation as a negative emotion by reexamining management literatures that have traditionally eschewed anger, those that have embraced it, and potential areas where anger can shed new light on future research. Finally, we propose that organizations offering ""appropriate space""for anger expression can take advantage of its potential to promote constructive conversations and needed change. © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We argue that focal firm employee-based resources shift as a result of internationalization by considering the specific case of knowledge workers in internationally expanding firms. We theorize that increased mobility of employees drives these resource shifts within focal firms. By highlighting the central role mobility plays in firms as they expand, new research questions arise that would help increase our understanding of this bidirectional strategy-resource relationship-questions that move beyond the notion that resources drive strategy but also that resources change in association with strategy implementation. Our paper encourages a new perspective on the unintentional impacts on betweenfirm resource heterogeneity that originate from organizations' shifts in scope, scale, and strategies.  © 2020 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

As part of this special symposium on innovations in corporate governance, this paper focuses on ventures as a novel governance configuration. It explains how venture governance mitigates some fundamental corporate governance issues, such as the agency problem; the presence of external directors who have limited motivation and insufficient sectoral knowledge, and are consumed by onerous compliance matters; and boards' formal structure and large size, which limit effective communication and information processing. But while novel features of ventures mitigate these fundamental issues in public firm governance, three new governance issues emerge in ventures: (1) the ""principal problem,""(2) customers as a source of external governance, and (3) lack of formal board structure. The paper presents evidence and observations on how these new governance issues are addressed in innovative ways by venture boards.

It's not just about the mafia! conceptualizing business-society relations of organized violence,2020,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098591971&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2019.0029&partnerID=40&md5=df842d0c73a7659ace5564cab0bbed6f,"While there is some scholarship in management and organization studies on forms of organized violence, it has rarely focused on the role of organized violence within wider business-society and governance relations. In this article, we argue that conceptualizing the role and capacity of the state is still paramount, precisely because it is normally the state that holds a monopoly on violence. Yet this state monopoly has been continuously eroded as private firms and civil society actors are increasingly involved in paramilitaries, trafficking, mafia-like and terrorist organizing, and other forms of organized violence. To help management and organization scholars appreciate and make sense of these dynamics in contemporary economic affairs, this article puts forward a conceptualization of business-society relations of organized violence. We develop six propositions that seek to understand organized violence within what we call the governance triangle of state-firm-civil society relations. These propositions give rise to three ""doomsday scenarios"": 1) rise of military dictatorships, 2) rise of private security monopolies and oligopolies, and 3) rise of civil wars. We conclude the article by outlining the implications of such a violence-based view for management and organization scholars.  © Academy of Management Perspectives 2020.",,

Will there be competition for scarce resources? Will they collaborate in reconstruction? While we cannot research these questions directly, we can find clues in four places. First, there are historical examples of apocalyptic events. Second, social identity theory offers explanations of group behavior. Third, there have been studies undertaken of group dynamics in extreme contexts. We discuss the limitations of these three sources, before turning a fourth-a fictional account-in search of ideas. Adopting a narrative theoretical lens, we consider ""the theory on offer"" in the television series The Walking Dead, which portrays a zombie apocalypse. We find that group behavior is shaped by the nature of survivor group composition, and by the properties of the doomsday context that they face. We demonstrate the potential for the emergence of a dark, violent side of group behavior. We illustrate a methodological solution to the problem of researching extreme contexts using ""speculative fiction.""

While a host of fears (e.g. fears of failure, rejection) have been explored theoretically and empirically in the entrepreneurship literature, the dominant approach to examining fear has mostly been individual and situation specific across a limited time frame-i.e., ""little-f""fears. We aim to explore whether entrepreneurship works the same way in the context of ""Big F""Fear (i.e. the fear of ""impending doom""that exists across large populations simultaneously, over an extended period of time) as it does under normal conditions. In doing so, we draw on construal-level theory to explain how entrepreneurs' perceptions of their psychological distance to the effects of an LMC relate to affective (i.e., Fear) and behavioral (i.e., entrepreneurial activity) outcomes.  © Academy of Management Perspectives 2020.",,

Measures taken to protect public health have threatened the global economy, necessitating economic stimulus in most countries and reconfiguring the role of business in society. Will the role of business in society return to normal after COVID-19, or will it be reconfigured in enduring and impactful ways? We use Alexander's (2018, 2019) theory of ""societalization""to examine how socially disruptive extreme events affect the role of business in society. To address this, we apply societalization to the revelatory example of COVID-19 and evaluate its impact on society. Our analysis of the societalization of COVID-19 in the United States shows that concern regarding pandemic disease has moved from the governmental inside to the civic outside, placing strain on society and leading to regulatory response and a significant societal backlash. We discuss three scenarios regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the role of business in society, suggest that societalization provides useful insights into other socially disruptive extreme events, and identify implications for future business and society research. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2020.",,

Increasingly, such collaborative creativity is affected by advanced technology such as mobile technology, virtual communications, and algorithmic computing. We use a temporal lens to study the potential of advanced technology to influence collaborative creativity. Prior studies have found that inner time and social time are critical for collaborative creativity. To creatively and purposefully contribute to collaboration, inner time-a temporal capacity to reflect on actions, meaning, and consequences over time-is required. Also necessary is social time-the time spent with others-to practice giving and taking of multivocal ideas and perspectives. What has not been well scrutinized in the organization and management literature is whether advanced technology might suppress both inner time and social time. In this paper, we advance futureoriented conjectures on the potential role of advanced technology on such temporal capacity. Included in our projections is a futuristic doomsday in which advanced technology has extinguished inner time and social time and hence curtailed collaborative creativity.

In this study, we examine international multisectoral partnerships (IMSPs), one of the policy interventions introduced to incentivize the antibiotic innovation necessary to avoid such a scenario. Based on insights from three recently launched antibiotics IMSPs, we present their key features and argue that such partnerships represent a novel type of organizational form and governance, different from others discussed in previous research. Specifically, antibiotics IMSPs are interorganizational structures showing great governance complexity, strong centralized control, strict boundaries, and formalization of roles and rules. We discuss how antibiotics IMSPs differ from other partnerships dealing, for instance, with the environmental global challenge, and their usefulness in other contexts where similar uncertain, risky, urgent, and complex tasks need to be faced.

What happens after they do? Despite accumulating evidence on the causes and consequences of ethical and unethical behavior in non-negotiation situations, surprisingly few attempts have been made to examine these issues systematically within the negotiation context. This is problematic because it contributes to the somewhat stale viewpoint that unethical negotiation behavior is both inevitable and uniformly harmful. It also impedes progress in both the negotiation and the behavioral ethics literatures and limits our field’s ability to train ethical negotiators. As a step toward refreshing the field’s perspective on the causes and consequences of ethical and unethical negotiation behavior, the current symposium assembles four papers by leading scholars of ethics and negotiation. Collectively, they aim to provide a bird’s-eye view on the numerous causes (e.g., moral character, ethical fading, environmental cues) and surprisingly diverse consequences attending ethical and unethical negotiation, both reviewing current knowledge and looking to the future. Overall, we suggest that unethical behavior is not inevitable in negotiation nor necessarily detrimental for either negotiator.

Specifically, we challenge empirical and theoretical investigations that have conceptualized deception as an unethical, dichotomous construct (e.g., honest or deceptive) and have studied deception as informational, lies of commission in single-shot experiments with unfamiliar counterparts. We highlight the importance of characterizing deception as a multidimensional construct, and we focus on three dimensions of deception: intentionality (self-interested or prosocial), content (informational or emotional), and activity (omission, commission, or paltering).

However, the conversation has focused on individual factors that could assist women in their leadership journeys. In this paper, we draw on research about gender stereotypes in three streams (“think manager—think male,” the glass cliff, and childcare) to argue that the who, what, and when of leaning in as presented in this book are problematic. Our synthesis of the literature leads us to conclude that gender stereotypes form subtle systemic barriers to the advancement of significant numbers of women into these roles at the group level. To circumvent these stereotypes, increasing the representation of women in senior leadership roles is a necessary first step, not an eventual outcome. We illustrate our point with an example from the Canadian federal government. To change the numbers of women in top leadership roles, individuals in powerful positions in organizations (mainly men) need to make the proportional representation of women in senior leadership roles a priority—one that is enforced through measurement, tracking, and reinforcement. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Why are self-help books with career advice for women popular?,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065135585&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0152&partnerID=40&md5=f20721963b6a1a566f2059d480bb9f5c,"Self-help books with career advice for women who aspire to leadership are popular. This popularity is somewhat surprising, in that the advice appears to take us back to the “fix the women” approach to career advancement of the 1960s and 1970s. Sheryl Sandberg’s (2013) Lean In is a vivid example of this popular genre. In this paper, we use Sandberg’s book to examine why a focus on personal agency is resonating with so many women. We explain the success of Lean In from the working woman’s perspective, comparing and contrasting the academic and popular literatures. We then reflect on the relevance of individual action as a catalyst for change in relation to the more difficult-to-change barriers to women’s advancement at the interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. We conclude by reflecting on what the popularity of the self-help literature tells scholars about future research directions and the dissemination of their findings. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Lean in versus the literature: An evidence-based examination,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065135059&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0156&partnerID=40&md5=d2acaef58815fe10b5fc95be9cce8495,"In this article, we provide an evidence-based analysis of the main ideas put forth in Sheryl Sandberg’s immensely popular book Lean In. In doing so, we bring the management and psychology literatures to bear on her key pieces of advice and determine which assertions are supported, which are refuted, and which need additional management research. We use research on stereotype threat, psychological withdrawal, mentoring, leadership identity development, self-efficacy, and leadership styles to examine Sandberg’s key claims. Overall, our findings suggest that some of her arguments are supported by scientific evidence while others lack empirically based support. We discuss both gaps in the existing literature and practical implications that emerge as evidence-based strategies for both women and the organizations in which they work to combat gender-based stereotypes and discrimination. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Bounded ethicality and ethical fading in negotiations: Understanding unintended unethical behavior,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065130509&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0055&partnerID=40&md5=11c43c11a01f05f1030771f3963f302e,"The business scandals of the past several decades have led to the rising importance of ethics as a topic central to management scholarship. Behavioral scientists in particular have been attracted to the topic in far greater numbers, and the study of ethical decision making has emerged as a core subfield (Messick & Tenbrunsel, 1996). This paper draws on that framework and applies it to negotiations, arguing that not all unethical behavior is intentional; rather, negotiators fall prey to bounded ethicality, engaging in behavior that is contradictory to their values without realizing that they are doing so. We further argue that ethical fading—when individuals do not see the ethical implications of the situation or their action—is central to explaining why this occurs. Relying on past empirical research, we identify negotiation cues that have been linked to unethical behavior, and explore how they make a negotiator particularly vulnerable to ethical fading, resulting in subsequent unethical behavior. We discuss several opportunities for future research in the negotiation discipline and other disciplines that draw on motivated social exchange or assume intentionality, and conclude with a call for scholars to define normative standards as they pertain to negotiator ethics. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Moral character in negotiation,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065133972&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0051&partnerID=40&md5=0931dfba49550bd5481d918b1a7b4a84,"In this article, we discuss the role of moral character in negotiation and identify open questions and promising directions for future scholars to explore. We advance research in this area by introducing a dyadic model of moral character in negotiation that highlights the joint influence of each party’s moral character on negotiation attitudes, motives, and behaviors. We discuss the implications of our model and conclude that personality science—especially the study of moral character—has great potential to enhance research and practice in negotiations. Our hope is that this work will accelerate theoretical development and empirical studies that address the question of how moral character influences negotiation processes and outcomes—from pre-negotiation (e.g., planning, selecting negotiating partners) to actual bargaining (e.g., bargaining tactics, concessions) to post-negotiation (e.g., deal implementation, long-term consequences, relationship building and maintenance, reputations)—and provide a springboard for future studies on this topic. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Deceptive negotiating: The role of the environmental cue,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065131848&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0126&partnerID=40&md5=7932477225ae5703810440264e001982,"Recent psychological research on deception has focused on environmental cues—features of the physical and temporal environment (e.g., money, mirrors) that can influence an individual’s decision to deceive. Although research on the social situation of negotiation has examined numerous reasons why negotiators deceive, it has not often explored the role of environmental cues. The current paper seeks to draw greater attention to environmental cues in the literature on deception in negotiation. After synthesizing the psychological evidence on environmental cues and deception in individual decision-making situations, I translate that evidence for the social decision-making situation of negotiation and the more general set of social decision-making situations in organizations (using mergers and acquisitions as an example). Ultimately, theoretical overlap between the deception and negotiation literatures leads me to conclude that environmental cues could have an even greater influence on deception in social decision-making situations, suggesting that scholars of negotiation and several other management topics would benefit by considering the surrounding physical and temporal environment. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Using a structuration theory lens that focuses on the processes of structural change and views agency and structure as a co-creation, we examine whether and how entrepreneurial companies in the natural and organic products sector have worked to expand and infuse their sustainability goals and practices around the acquisition process. We find support for a process wherein multiple parties engage in structural change to overcome market failures and adverse incentives. We observe how the dynamics of lost battles, Trojan horses, open gates, and wars won are yielding positive outcomes for these firms' sustainability goals. Early acquisitions in which entrepreneurial firms' sustainability missions deteriorated (lost battles) gave way to acquisitions in which such firms used innovative means to instill their values and practices into their acquirers (Trojan horses). Moreover, the acquiring firms increasingly embraced the sustainability orientations of their targets (open gates). Perhaps most important, the acquisition process led to fundamental shifts in institutional structures that drove behaviors and enabled these firms to achieve their goals (wars won). © 2019 Academy of Management.

Drawing on the five articles featured in this symposium-and focusing especially on their protagonists or actors, the actions these actors take, and their achievements-we begin to conceptualize an impact entrepreneurship perspective. Following the tenet of e pluribus unum (""out of many, one"") and adhering to the doctrine that diverse, decentralized human effort can improve the world, our impact entrepreneurship perspective refers to the development of solutions to grand challenges, in a financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable fashion. All in all, then, this symposium provides a starting point to discuss, conceptualize, study, interpret, and enrich our understanding of impact entrepreneurship and collective action to address grand challenges. © 2019 Academy of Management.

A framework for exploring the degree of hybridity in entrepreneurship,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077314981&doi=10.5465%2famp.2018.0013&partnerID=40&md5=0ac5758e28801fb72b83e6f565edb5c1,"In this paper, we problematize the growing literature on hybrid organizing to demonstrate that research on hybrids and entrepreneurship can benefit from considering the degree of hybridity in organizing the exploitation of potential opportunities for the creation of both economic and social value. Recent work has moved beyond discrete categorization of organizations as hybrid (or not) to conceptualize hybridity as a continuum anchored by a strong social logic at one end and a strong economic logic at the other end. We take the conceptualization of hybridity one step further by acknowledging that organizations can differ in the relative importance they ascribe to the economic logic vis-à-vis the social logic and that both the economic and social logics can be held at varying levels of intensity. The main purpose of reconceptualizing the degree of hybridity is to develop a framework for future research. This framework highlights the importance of understanding how entrepreneurs can both directly and indirectly (through the co-construction of potential opportunities) influence the degree of hybridity, and how differences in degree of hybridity affect organizational outcomes in terms of success and failure in creating economic and social value. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Civic wealth creation: A new view of stakeholder engagement and societal impact,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077330936&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0060&partnerID=40&md5=c5074d538824b94deb6494f2d067d5fe,"Positive societal change happens when community members, supporters, and entrepreneurially minded agents come together to aggregate resources and build new capacities. To explain and inform how societal impact happens across categories of stakeholders, we set forth an integrative framework of civic wealth creation to account for the social, economic, and communal endowments generated by local communities. Our framework shifts the conversation to a ""civic"" level of analysis that captures the variety of local settings where many societal change initiatives take place-in neighborhoods, villages, and communities where the people who are being helped are intimately involved in creating and implementing the solutions. Civic wealth extends beyond the material resources and physical assets of a community to include intangibles such as health, happiness, and social justice. We draw attention to the importance of citizen engagement and entrepreneurial commerce in the discourse surrounding contemporary societal change efforts. The civic wealth creation framework offers scholars and practitioners across disciplines a new lens through which to view societal impact. © 2019 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

We argue that the management literature has a limited and biased view of silence, and contend that it can have value for employees and the organization. We discuss the functional value of silence in organizations and how it can be a strategic response to destructive and unethical leaders. Indeed, we argue that both voice and silence have functional value. Drawing on the see-judge-act model, we describe why and when employees become silent or choose to “break the silence,” and we explain that both silence and voice have the ability to confront or resist destructive leadership.

New information technology and implicit bias,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070390440&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0079&partnerID=40&md5=aecfcdb36d24679ceab5b1343da8b54a,"In this paper, we perform a review of relatively recent empirical research that relates new information technology to biased thinking. Based on this review, we develop a framework that suggests a number of implicit associations (i.e., unconscious linkages between phenomena, such as “women are nurturing”) that relate new information technology to a variety of attitudes held by both organizational decision makers and average users of such information technology (e.g., “new information technology is superior to older information technology”). Our framework proposes a set of three underlying beliefs about new information technology (that new information technology is mysterious, nonhuman, and complex) that may underlie the implicit attitudes and biased thinking we identified. These underlying beliefs suggest that biases related to new information technology are distinct, in important ways, from most interpersonal biases studied in organizations. Given these findings, we suggest an agenda for future research that may enhance our ability to understand and mitigate biases related to new information technology in organizational settings. ©  Academy of Management Perspectives",,

However, so far the literature has primarily focused on leaders’ strategic behavior, largely ignoring followers’ strategic behavior. In this paper, we take a follower trait perspective on strategic follower behavior, specifically focusing on how followers’ dark triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) influence their strategic behavior. We argue that dark triad–related strategic follower behavior is likely to have negative effects for fellow organizational members and the organization as a whole. We also present “red flag” behaviors that may signal followers’ tendencies to engage in shady strategic behaviors, then put forward factors that may mitigate or increase the occurrence of shady strategic behaviors by followers scoring high on dark triad traits, focusing especially on follower attributes and specifics of the organizational context. Finally, we discuss if and how followers’ dark triad traits could benefit the organization and highlight emerging issues in research on strategic follower behavior. ©  Academy of Management Perspectives",,

Yet entrepreneurs often play an active role in tackling environmental issues and developing sustainable solutions for them. Whereas a rising literature on sustainable entrepreneurship seeks to investigate how they do this, rigorous microfoundations for such investigations do not yet exist. With a view to developing such microfoundations, we reanalyzed Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom's historical case study of governance structures for managing water basins in the Los Angeles area. Our analysis allowed us to bring together Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework and effectuation to show how effectual entrepreneurs transform market failures into sustainable solutions by self-selecting stakeholders. The resulting integrated model of collective action serves both as a practical guide for entrepreneurs seeking to tackle sustainability issues and as a theoretical framework for researchers to develop rigorous microfoundations for future empirical work. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Society continues to increase the proportion of some demographic groups within organizations, but the notion of tokens continues to be relevant, as many women, men, racial groups, and those who identify with intersecting identities find themselves numerically underrepresented in the workplace. We systematically organize and analyze recent work on the consequences of being a token for women, men, and racial minorities to address challenges and identify opportunities for future research. We highlight gaps and ambiguities to provide clarity and momentum for future research in this area. Further, we identify and propose the consideration of potential measurement, individual, and contextual contingencies that may influence the outcomes of being a token. These critical contingencies shed light on the potential variations in the outcomes associated with being a token. ©  Academy of Management Perspectives",,

But is this characterization accurate or universal? We assert that the transition toward environmentally beneficial practices within an industry is a journey that involves the contributions of numerous stakeholders. When there is no powerful central actor, we maintain that industries can still transition toward environmentally beneficial practices through multiple forms of collective and entrepreneurial action. Drawing from entrepreneurship, sustainability, and institutional theories of change, we analyze and discuss the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard for the commercial building industry. We present theory related to four phases of the transition: 1) initiation of new practices through effectual entrepreneurship, 2) adoption of new practices through voluntary standards, 3) legitimation of new practices through framing, and 4) commercialization of new practices through new market entrants and alternatives. We advance a new perspective on the industry evolution toward more environmentally beneficial practices that illuminates how industry change may be institutionalized through the complementary actions undertaken by diverse actors. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Pipelines and their portfolios: A more holistic view of human capital heterogeneity via firm-wide employee sourcing,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070375013&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0071&partnerID=40&md5=4f141913c1dc430e3b760aaea83130f4,"Scholars use the term pipelines to encapsulate many ways that firms target talent sources. Yet pipeline scholarship is fragmented to date, so we have few answers for several salient questions: Why do pipelines exist? What are their attributes? And what are their implications for firms? In this paper, we explore these questions. Based on an extensive literature review, we first distill the commonalities and core attributes of pipelines and then develop a theory-driven typology to ensure a consistency in understanding. Next, we suggest that a common theoretical justification runs through the uses of pipelines: Pipelines address labor market imperfections confronted by firms when they staff positions, counterbalancing the seemingly detrimental reduction in candidates that pipelines engender. We use this insight to theoretically delineate why different types of pipelines exist. Finally, we discuss how firms develop unique combinations, or portfolios, of pipelines to ameliorate the range of imperfections that they face to manage talent sourcing across the enterprise. In total, our paper describes how firms strategically manage pipeline portfolios, why firms turn to them to accumulate talent, and how they create between-firm heterogeneity of human capital resources.

Adapting to grand environmental challenges through collective entrepreneurship,2019,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066830957&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0056&partnerID=40&md5=3acab02d22611e702c03d8ece92249ee,"Businesses are increasingly participating in cross-sectoral partnerships to reduce their environmental impacts on society. At the same time, some are pursuing more entrepreneurial ventures to stimulate environmental innovations. Environmental issues, however, are evolving into grand challenges that could create massive disruptions to organizational and societal systems that transcend the interests or influence of individual firms. As such, successful adaptation to these challenges will require innovative solutions that leverage the resources and capabilities of all relevant actors. Drawing from research on cross-sectoral partnerships and environmental entrepreneurship, we propose collective environmental entrepreneurship (CEE) as a strategy to facilitate adaptation to changing global ecosystems. We explain how cross-sectoral partnerships can overcome some of the constraints facing individual sectors in developing innovative adaptations to grand environmental challenges. Further, we show how these initiatives can institute governance arrangements that help individual sectors reconcile their diverging interests. We then apply these insights to three cases where governments, private interests, and nonprofits have collaborated to adapt to the physical impacts of climate change through innovative partnerships and draw implications for how this construct could be applied to other global challenges facing society. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Dual-process theories have occupied the center ground of this literature. However, in recent years, the field of psychology, in which these theories originated, has differentiated two fundamentally different categories of dual-process theory: default-interventionist and parallel-competitive. These alternative conceptions are predicated on incommensurable assumptions, but management and organization studies (MOS) researchers are seemingly oblivious to this important distinction, risking the development of a body of work that is fundamentally incoherent because it is predicated on psychological foundations that are untenable. Whereas default-interventionist accounts have tended to dominate MOS, we argue that parallel-competitive formulations offer a more nuanced and realistic depiction of organizational decision makers as thinking and feeling beings, as reliant on inspiration and the skillful management of emotion and intuition as on cold, calculative cognition. We explore the implications of our arguments for multiple streams of research, spanning strategic management, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, and human resource management, united by the desire to explicate more comprehensively the behavioral microfoundations and neural substrates of managerial and organizational decision making. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Scholars in the field of positive organizational inquiry are engaging in meaningful work on the processes, practices, and attributes that enable optimal human and organizational functioning. Much of this work incorporates the concept of virtue as an integral part of positive organizing. However, we argue that the efficacy of this scholarship is undermined by poorly defined and misconstrued conceptualizations of virtue that vary widely in their scope and perspective (Gotsis & Grimani, 2015). This article draws on the philosophy of Aristotelian virtue ethics and the deep ontological framework of critical realism to articulate a clear definition of virtue and a five-factor framework for determining what is virtuous in which contexts. These contributions provide the foundation for a stronger virtue-based perspective in positive organizational inquiry. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

In this respect, we promote a focus on the processual constitution of international entities across time and a reconceptual-ization of IB as the amalgamation of local and international forces.

Our paper sufficiently accounts for how uncertainty influences action and moves beyond entrepreneurship as a deliberate cognitive process. In so doing, this paper constitutes a counterweight to the extensive examinations of positive personal attributes in entrepreneurship research.

Reflections on scientific misconduct in management: Unfortunate incidents or a normative crisis?,2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058040088&doi=10.5465%2famp.2015.0167&partnerID=40&md5=0871079f13028bfef5d670387a77f28b,"Taking as our starting point Merton’s (1942/1973) defense of science facing pressures from totalitarian regimes, we argue that today’s challenge to the integrity of management scholarship does not come primarily from external demands for ideological conformity, but from escalating competition for publication space in leading journals that is changing the internal dynamics of our community. We invited nine scholars from different countries and with different backgrounds and career trajectories to provide their brief views of this argument. Following an introduction that summarizes the argument, we present their different reactions by dividing and introducing the work into those who took a broad field-level perspective, those with a more macro view, and those who suggested possible remedies to our dilemmas. In conclusion, we note that questionable research practices, retractions, and highly publicized cases of academic misconduct may irreparably damage the legitimacy of our scholarship unless the management research community airs these issues and takes steps to address this challenge. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
"Unicorns, gazelles, and other distractions on the way to understanding real entrepreneurship in the United States",2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053849405&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0123&partnerID=40&md5=90f6507122266cb60a390f21fbc42cca,"Dazed and confused by the wild hype surrounding “gazelles” and “unicorns,” entrepreneurship researchers have focused on the “black swans” of the entrepreneurial world, even though IPOs and venture capital financing of firms are extremely rare events. Despite the rarity of IPOs and obtaining venture capital, entrepreneurship conferences and journals have been filled with papers on various aspects of the process of “going public” and “VC networks.” Fortunately, in the middle of the Silicon Valley mania, other scholars have been paying attention to the more mundane aspects of business start-ups—the ordinary business starts, numbering in the hundreds of thousands for businesses with employees. The purpose of this article is to address what we believe to be scholars’ misplaced attention on the extreme and their neglect of the mundane in the study of entrepreneurship. Correcting the misperception that has been introduced through selection biases favoring growing and profitable firms will give scholars and policymakers a more accurate and policy-relevant picture of entrepreneurship in the 21st century. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Stress processes: An essential ingredient in the entrepreneurial process,2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050308016&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0184&partnerID=40&md5=853be480496561419f9ca1d300d878ba,"The entrepreneurial process is associated with high uncertainty, and uncertainty is a major source of stress. Therefore, a core aim of entrepreneurs is to reduce uncertainty to allow the entrepreneurial process to unfold. However, entrepreneurship scholars have insufficiently addressed stress processes that may be associated with this uncertainty. We argue that uncertainty is the concept connecting both the entrepreneurial and stress processes. We discuss the links between these two processes in terms of (1) opportunity recognition, (2) opportunity exploitation, and (3) associated outcomes. We then illustrate how future research should incorporate the interaction between the two processes using a morphological box and discuss how such research would change the way we specify entrepreneurial process models and study entrepreneurial behavior. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Entrepreneurs’ mental health and well-being: A review and research agenda,2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050281247&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0001&partnerID=40&md5=4d18dbe88b1dfd62c5e4c01deb025d01,"Interest in entrepreneurs’ mental health and well-being (MWB) is growing in recognition of the role of MWB in entrepreneurs’ decision making, motivation, and action. Yet relevant knowledge is dispersed across disciplines, which makes what we currently understand about entrepreneurs’ MWB unclear. In this systematic review I integrate insights from 144 empirical studies. These studies show that research is focused on three research questions: (1) Do different types of entrepreneurs differ in their MWB? What are the (2) antecedents and (3) consequences of entrepreneurs’ MWB? The review systematizes evidence on known antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurs’ MWB but also reveals overlooked and undertheorized sources and outcomes of entrepreneurs’ MWB. The review provides a mapping and framework that advance research on entrepreneurs’ MWB and help to position entrepreneurs’ MWB more centrally in management and entrepreneurship research. It calls for researchers to go beyond applying models developed for employees to understand entrepreneurs. Instead, the findings point the way to developing a dedicated theory of entrepreneurial work and MWB that is dynamic, socialized, and open to considering context and acknowledges variability and fluidity across entrepreneurs’ life domains, as well as the centrality of work for entrepreneurs’ identity. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We organize our analysis around the two dominant perspectives on BGs: institutional voids (IV) and entrenchment/exploitation (EE). We suggest that the empirical evidence does not entirely support either perspective, and neither fully predicts what we sometimes observe: namely, that BGs not only persist and thrive, but also sometimes do so as internationally competitive firms. This indicates that a more contextualized approach is required, and we propose a conceptual framework that can guide future thinking. In so doing, we take explicit account of two key factors relevant to the dynamics of BG evolution: the state’s capacity to create market-supporting institutions and the ability of business groups to adapt to evolving institutions. Our framework accommodates the possibility of multiple outcomes, including ones consistent with the IV and EE perspectives, but also ones consistent with the internationalization of BGs, including those from emerging markets. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Entrepreneurship addiction: Shedding light on the manifestation of the “dark side” in work-behavior patterns,2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052103298&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0185&partnerID=40&md5=beb7adc20c12e8d654ae769522bc0cfe,"We examine the notion of entrepreneurship addiction, the compulsive engagement in entrepreneurial activities. We address what is unique about this type of behavioral addiction compared to related work-pattern concepts of workaholism, entrepreneurial passion, and work engagement. We identify new and promising areas to expand understanding of what factors lead to entrepreneurship addiction, what entrepreneurship addiction leads to, how to effectively study entrepreneurship addiction, and other applications where entrepreneurship addiction might be relevant to study. These help to set a research agenda that more fully addresses a potential “dark side” psychological factor among some entrepreneurs. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and entrepreneurship,2018,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050291351&doi=10.5465%2famp.2016.0144&partnerID=40&md5=2efb9d422f011fef4e9e3e44065f1937,"Several empirical papers have reported an association between attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and facets of entrepreneurship. While much research has documented that adults with ADHD often are impaired in the occupational domain and have difficulties maintaining full-time employment, these recent papers intimate that entrepreneurship may represent an attractive occupational option for adults with ADHD. Indeed, adults with ADHD who are entrepreneurs anecdotally report benefiting in their entrepreneurial endeavors from their ADHD. From this perspective, symptoms and traits associated with ADHD might be beneficial, not impairing. This paper discusses ADHD theory and clinical characteristics of adults with ADHD and how both may translate to entrepreneurship, then reviews the existing data that have been published on the association between ADHD and entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial orientation. These data suggest that hyperactivity symptoms (and not inattentive symptoms) may be more responsible for the reported associations between ADHD and aspects of entrepreneurship. At this point, the research on ADHD and entrepreneurship is too nascent to propose practical implications, but this paper suggests potential directions for future research and policy. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, mounting evidence suggests that while difficult and expensive to produce, much of the knowledge this science generates goes uncommercialized. Given the benefits companies and their shareholders could derive from corporate science, we analyze the factors that lead to failure to commercialize it. Specifically, we propose that institutional, knowledge, capability, agency, organizational design, and cognitive forces combine to cause this failure. Further, we integrate the different theoretical perspectives related to each of these forces to delineate the factors that impede the commercialization of corporate science and clarify their implications for future research, public policy, and managers. Drawing parallels with university-based research, we also highlight the importance of science as a source of value creation, an issue that has been relatively underexplored in the management literature despite its value to firms, their stakeholders, and society. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

However, we still lack theoretical and empirical evidence on the link between the commercialization of public science and broader societal impacts. Specifically, despite a large body of evidence on the determinants of science commercialization, mainly addressed in the literature on academic entrepreneurship, the consequences of such activities remain less explored. In this article, we seek to fill this void by viewing science commercialization as a means rather than as a final outcome. Instead of mapping the direct outcomes of the science commercialization process, mostly achieved through entrepreneurial activities, we see science commercialization as an enabler of broader societal impacts. This article outlines a research agenda on the societal impacts of science commercialization by extending current theories, data, and methods and exploring the need to consider ethical concerns and who is benefiting from these impacts. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

However, there is a flipside. Evidence suggests that people with mental disorders can flourish and productively contribute to society through entrepreneurship. This paper explores the relationship between mental disorders and entrepreneurship. It builds a research agenda to propose that researchers explore the role of mental disorders in the entrepreneurial context. We show how such research will advance this new field of research, but also how it can develop novel insights and theories in entrepreneurship and contribute to theories on the psychology of work, career choice, and clinical psychology. © 2018 Academy of Management.

To stimulate discussion and encourage further studies, this paper offers a much-needed overview of prior research on teams in the context of academic spin-offs. By examining studies from 1980 to 2016, our review shows that extant work has focused primarily on the human and social capital endowments of academic entrepreneurs, while much less attention has been paid to team formation and evolution and team functioning. Based on a critical assessment of the status quo, we discuss open research questions and suggest that scholars need to account for the temporal context of academic spin-offs and for the type of technology that is commercialized. Furthermore, we encourage research on founder identities and the creation of social good via academic spin-offs, as such research would allow scholars to push significantly beyond the traditional view of academic spin-off teams, which emphasizes personal wealth creation, licensing incomes, and financial profit. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

Findings from a large set of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate that people diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as well as those with subsyndromal forms, show personality traits such as high ambition, confidence, and positive affectivity, even during well periods. Intriguingly, a parallel, distinct literature documents that these same personality traits are related to greater likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur and of succeeding as an entrepreneur. We will describe research on whether mania risk is linked to entrepreneurial intent, entry, and income, drawing on findings from two small surveys and one epidemiological study. As those findings regarding the link between mania risk and entrepreneurship are mixed, we present a model in which some specific personality traits tied to mania risk might also be related to entrepreneurial intent and entry. In a small study, we find support for key personality traits that overlap. We discuss implications of these findings and some key issues not considered in this study, and suggest directions for future research. © 2018 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Most of this research focuses on institutional, economic, and demographic variables from a macro perspective, rather than examining micro processes that may be associated with academic entrepreneurship. The literature also tends to stress formal, as opposed to informal, mechanisms of academic entrepreneurship. We assert that a consideration of various micro-level processes is also useful for improving our understanding of academic entrepreneurship. We draw heavily on the organizational behavior literature to consider how micro processes, specifically processes associated with identity, motivation, leadership/championing, education, work-life balance, and organizational justice, may help explain scientists' engagement in academic entrepreneurship.

We review five intermediaries commonly mentioned in the ecosystem literature: university technology transfer and licensing offices; physical space (incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces); professional services providers; networking, connecting, and assisting organizations; and finance providers (including venture capital, angel investors, public financing, and crowdfunding). Specifically, we explore how these various intermediaries function and provide complementary and related services in support of scientific commercialization through entrepreneurship. After defining intermediation, we review the literature on each organization type, providing a definition and considering the contribution of the intermediary and the related policy implications.

This paper suggests that sleep plays an important role in both. With respect to entrepreneurial motives, I draw from sleep research to suggest that sleep problems may increase entrepreneurial motives by prompting many of the same behaviors as clinical ADHD, and by precipitating and/or mediating the effect of several mental health conditions, including depression. With respect to entrepreneurial means, however, I draw from the same research to suggest that sleep problems are likely to undermine several abilities important for the successful founding of an entrepreneurial venture (alertness, creativity, and social competence). Thus, despite facilitating the desire to become an entrepreneur, sleep problems may undermine an entrepreneur's ability to thrive as an entrepreneur. Overall, the current paper explores the three-way relationship between sleep, mental health, and entrepreneurship, focusing on the important influence of sleep problems on entrepreneurial motives and means. The conclusions integrate existing research and pave the way for new research on the role of sleep in entrepreneurship. © 2018 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

The fact that knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms publish their innovative ideas seems counterintuitive because publishing discloses ideas important to their market position. The literature holds at least two explanations for why such firms publish: Firms use competitive publication logic to invalidate or preempt intellectual property protection, and (more recently) scholarship holds that entrepreneurial firms use accretive publication logic to attract financial resources, enhance the reputation of in-house scientists, and obtain new technologies critical to the development of new products. After offering explanations as to why knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms publish, we examine the benefits and costs of doing so, examine under which conditions firms should publish, and articulate implications for future research. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

The potential influence of ADHD looms large in the field of entrepreneurship as a spate of recent studies suggests a positive relationship with creativity, entrepreneurial orientation, and new venture initiation. While offering significant progress in destigmatizing aberrant conditions, extant scholarship has left unanswered questions regarding ADHD's influence on formation, development, and outcomes of new ventures.

When applied to science-based innovations, exaptation refers to the emergence of functionalities for scientific discoveries that were unanticipated ex ante. We explore how exaptation can be induced through narrative properties (relationality, temporality, and performativity), and how serendipity arrangements such as exaptive pools, exaptive events, and exaptive forums can be structured to maintain, activate and contextualize scientific discoveries. We close the paper by discussing the implications of exaptation for academia, industry, and policy. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,

It argues that assessments of capability among senior-level women may focus primarily on their potential (or actual) maternity rather than on performance. As a result, such women are often excluded from prestigious assignments. First, the paper observes hidden tendencies, within higher echelons at work, to classify maternal bodies as taboo. Drawing on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas, the paper notes how maternal bodies among senior-women may be identified as “social pollutants” and a danger to productivity (Douglas, 1966). Second, the paper suggests how the marginalizing of senior-level women relates to medicalization of maternal bodies, which are described as governed by fluctuating hormones throughout and beyond the reproductive years. Such medical descriptions spill over into organizational contexts, and senior-women are treated as lacking competence to make rational judgments. The paper suggests that further research is required to explore deeply ingrained attitudes that associate maternal bodies with lowered cognition. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We highlight that although this response can be motivated by organizational, legal, and psychological factors, blame can be detrimental to the organization and its employees when it occurs in a spontaneous and nondeliberative manner, which we label swift blame. We argue that swift blame can involve distorted perceptions and judgment, exacerbate conflict, Erode employee engagement, and stifle organizational learning. We further argue that managers have a special responsibility to thoughtfully and carefully consider how they react to perceived wrongdoings. Drawing from dual processing theory of cognition, we propose that managers can respond more effectively by adopting perspectives that slow down these tendencies and promote more thoughtful reactions. To this end we highlight research opportunities for three alternatives to swift blame: (a) a no-blame approach, (b) systems of inquiry and accountability, and (c) mindfulness training. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Yet negotiators from some low-trust cultures use Q&A, negotiators from some high-trust cultures use S&O, and negotiators from some cultures achieve low joint gains through Q&A or high joint gains through S&O. To explain these anomalies, we propose an integrated framework involving three constructs from cultural psychology: cultural levels of trust, tightness-looseness, and holistic versus analytic mindset. Specifically, we propose that the interaction between trust and tightness-looseness can explain cultural differences in the use of negotiation strategies, while the interaction of these strategies with holistic versus analytic mindset can explain cultural differences in the effectiveness of negotiation strategies. In sum, we extend the boundaries of current research to develop a cultural rationale for anomalies in extant research, encouraging negotiation and management researchers to consider new constructs as their research ""goes global."".",,

The ambiguous nature of their employment status and its implications for worker well-being have attracted substantial controversy, but to date most empirical research in this area has focused on the market efficiency of a single platform rather than on workers themselves and related human resource management issues. Research progress will require understanding how online labor platform work differs from other types of nonstandard employment arrangements, as well as critical differences across labor platform firms in how work and workers are managed. This paper proposes a conceptual classification framework to facilitate research on the attitudes, experiences, and outcomes of workers who use these platforms. We explore how labor platform firms’ operational choices shape how control is allocated across workers, clients, and the firm, and how they influence workers’ autonomy, incentives, and degree of economic dependence on the firm. Implications for theory development, research, and managing worker–firm relations are discussed. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Crossing the chasm and over the abyss: Perspectives on organizational failure,2017,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040328858&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0018&partnerID=40&md5=d01950a2755078fcf9c2f9f80ef68b84,"In this paper, we present an integrative perspective on organizational failure by conceptualizing three levels of failure-organizational learning processes (which can give rise to simple failures), organizational planning processes (which can give rise to complex failures), and strategic capacity for organizational agility (which can give rise to catastrophic failures)-as a Guttman-like model of escalating dysfunctions. Simple failures are the result of learning deficiencies stemming from single-loop decision making and weak learning competencies. Complex failures are caused by structural rigidities and intelligence pathologies. Catastrophic failures are a result of weak knowledge inclusiveness and weak organizational platforms, which occur from a downward spiral of events stemming from simple and complex failures. Areas for further study are suggested. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

The existing literature, however, reveals mixed findings and lack of clarity as to whether, when, how, and why time management leads to critical outcomes such as well-being and job performance. Furthermore, insights relevant to time management are scattered across various disciplines, including sociology, psychology, and behavioral economics. We address both issues by synthesizing and integrating insightful elements from various fields and domains into three novel perspectives on time management. First, we draw on the sociology of time to describe two key concepts: time structures and time norms. We illustrate how time structures and time norms operate at the team, organizational, and national levels of analysis in influencing time management outcomes. Second, we draw on the psychology of time to show how individual differences including time-related beliefs, attitudes, and preferences affect the way people manage time and, consequently, time management outcomes. Third, we rely on the behavioral economics literature to describe how cognitive biases influence individual time management decisions. Integrating insights from a diverse set of fields results in a better understanding of past research and allows us to reinterpret conflicting results prevalent in the time management literature. Finally, we offer directions for future research and discuss implications for how organizations and individuals can implement interventions resulting in a stronger and positive relationship between time management and desirable outcomes.",,

The three most prevalent perspectives in mainstream organization development (OD) literature understand resistance as something within the individual's psychological disposition, in the social context, and between change creators and acceptors. The habitus-oriented approach presented here, on the contrary, understands resistance as a social practice built into the system and produced by social agents' (individuals and groups) habitus, a cognitive construct that represents not the personal or the social roots of resistance but the combined dialectic roots of the two. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

A key objective of the JOBS Act was to allow new ventures in the United States to go public and raise growth capital more easily and cost-effectively than before. The aim of this paper is to discuss the implications of the JOBS Act for initial public offerings (IPOs). We argue that the JOBS Act gives rise to important spillover effects that may create ambiguous consequences for firms' IPOs. The central question is whether the JOBS Act's mandate of facilitating fund raising can come to fruition and, if so, which features of it may lead to shifts in capital markets in entrepreneurship. Our paper begins to address these questions and aims to serve as a catalyst for future academic work in this area. r Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Changing the perspective of virtual work: Building virtual intelligence at the individual level,2017,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019760709&doi=10.5465%2famp.2014.0120&partnerID=40&md5=ec56f62b4dfd92aece82f6268bc74eb0,"There is evidence that much virtual work takes place beyond traditionally studied contexts, arising organically as part of ongoing work flow. As this unstructured virtual work becomes increasingly prevalent, it becomes more important to determine what factors are needed for an individual worker to be successful in a virtual work environment, and how to prepare individuals for virtual work. In this paper, we suggest the need for a modified perspective on virtual work that shifts the focus from the phenomena and effects of working virtually to the individual behaviors and skills needed to succeed. We develop a summary of critical success factors in virtual work based on a compilation of theoretical and empirical findings from multiple streams of virtual work research, differentiating between those that are relatively fixed for the individual worker and those that can be influenced or changed through training and individual development. We show how these factors inform the overall process of individual adaptation to virtual work and suggest a cognitive mechanism underlying this adaptation, which we call virtual intelligence. We then outline a multilevel agenda for future research that could further knowledge on ways the individual virtual worker can be successful. r Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Scholars have proposed varied and sometimes confounding solutions to this challenge. We offer a novel approach by arguing that a firm's ambidexterity is a strategic choice that must be contextualized in the competitive dynamics of the firm's referent group. We digress from conventional organization-centric contextualizations and introduce an appropriately specified construct-relative ambidexterity-to address this need. We characterize the viable relative ambidexterity space (VRAS) where ambidexterity choices are made, and we offer a versatile framework to help researchers and practitioners explore organizational ambidexterity. We close by demonstrating how the framework offers opportunities for new streams of scholarly research on ambidexterity. r Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Observers have cited the need for more research on implementation, and thought leaders have called for the use of interdisciplinary approaches. Thus, we explore strategy implementation from the perspective of relational capital and human capital resources (in which relationships are especially important) and the development, bundling, and deployment of these resources to create strategic capabilities. Our discussion of implementation is unique in that we explain how it can be improved when guided by service-dominant logic (SDL) from the marketing field. We show how the emphasis of SDL on the exchange of service (rather than transactional interactions) and the manifestations of a service perspective-such as enduring relationships, collaboration, co-creation, open dialogue, trust, and status minimization-can facilitate the bundling and deployment of human capital resources for effective strategy implementation. We explain how SDL can facilitate implementation in the context of interdependencies, business ecosystems, and interactions across organizational boundaries.

We find that empirical research has frequently adopted an event-based perspective on CEO succession, which is contrary to the practical evidence regarding CEO succession as a continuous process. In the second part of our paper, we develop a future research agenda for the CEO succession process. We specifically address the role of board-CEO collaborations and potential frictions during the CEO succession process. Our suggestions will help researchers gain a better understanding of boards' governance of executive succession processes.

Globally, scholars are increasingly pressured to publish in top journals, compelling editorial boards to recruit more individuals - including those with less experience - to meet the demand. Furthermore, the validity of the social sciences is under scrutiny in light of ethical violations, article retractions, and calls for more relevant research. At the epicenter of this conundrum lie journal editors, those who adjudicate the quality and potential of submitted research. With these issues as backdrop, we report an inductive study of how journal editors come to understand the notion of theoretical contribution. Working with a data set of editorial decision letters and interviews with editors at two top management journals, we provide critical insight into how new editors, despite not yet having the requisite experience or knowledge to make expert judgments, experience being labeled experts by their scholarly community - a phenomenon we label ""novice experts."" We find that the process of making sense of theoretical contribution differs for novice experts than for those with more experience. Given the rise in less experienced editors, our data suggest that now is the time to rethink the hows and whys of knowledge dissemination at the heart of our profession. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

By integrating insights from the emerging BoP literature with extant research on the replication of organizational routines and templates, this study examines how the distinctive conditions of the BoP affect the development and replication of scalable business solutions for the world's poor. In particular, we identify key distinctive conditions of the BoP and develop an organizing framework of the mechanisms that facilitate the development and replication of viable and scalable business templates there. Our analysis contributes to BoP research by advancing understanding of the role of templates in economic and social development at the BoP as well as to research on the replication of organizational routines and templates by delineating the distinctive conditions and mechanisms that affect the development and replication of templates at the BoP. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Using top-tier law firms as an illustrative case, we demonstrate how career path changes, initially made to address work-life balance concerns, had the virtuous side effect of enhancing innovation capacity. Our study fosters dialogue between PSF research and broader innovation theories, based on four contributions. First, we build much-needed conceptual clarity about what innovation means and the forms it takes in the context of PSFs. Second, we show that exploration and exploitation are not orthogonal but are connected and mutually reinforcing in PSFs. We conceptualize an Innovation Loop that captures the continuous morphing of one into the other. Third, we draw attention to the neglected role of career pathing as a determinant of innovation capacity by facilitating seamless transitions between exploration and exploitation. Finally, we demonstrate how changing career paths are not a necessary evil but create win-win solutions to both accommodate work-life preferences of staff and enhance innovation capacity for the firm. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We underscore the importance of two dimensions of technology policy: (1) state funding for research and (2) state protection of intellectual property (IP). We then illustrate how interactions between these two dimensions of technology policy influence (1) the corporate entrepreneurship (CE) strategies through which firms innovate and adapt and (2) the political strategies through which they attempt to influence and secure the benefits of technology policy. Given differences in the goals, incentives, capabilities, and relative power among the various players affected by technology policy, our discussion contributes to a more thorough understanding of the dynamic interplay between government institutions and firms, the potential complementarity (and substitutions) between firms' CE and political strategies, and interdependent effects of state funding for research and IP protection across different international environments. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

For example, where classic theory considers discretion the avenue through which agents exercise self-interest at the expense of their principals, alternative perspectives identify discretion as the reason some principals enter an agency relationship in the first place - to take advantage of agent expertise and to respond to uncertain contingent events. This paper examines relationships in which agents enjoy considerable discretion and have limited, conflicting, or ambiguous guidance from their principals, characteristic of many governance and organizational settings and professional relationships. It draws on observational research in two intensive care units, where principals (patients) lack capacity to specify their objectives and cannot control, monitor, incentivize, converse with, or fire the agent charged with making life-and-death medical decisions on their behalf. Observing agents at the bedside provides a rare opportunity to understand - in real time - how agents fashion appropriate actions to take on behalf of principals with whom they cannot communicate and who rarely gave them sufficient guidance. Managers not infrequently must act for another without clear or authoritative direction. Insights from the study of medical decision-makers inform diverse literatures that feature extreme delegation to the agent. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

These ""sociopolitical issues"" are vastly different from corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, as they are divisive, emotionally charged, and institutionally contested social issues. In this article, we explore sociopolitical issues and develop a distinct model that relies on multiple theoretical perspectives - agency theory and a push-versus-pull perspective of stakeholder theory - to provide complementary or at times competing explanations for firm involvement in such controversial issues. We also explore the contexts (or facilitating institutional environments) that enable management to get involved in sociopolitical issues.

We then categorize such paradoxes as those that are inherent in leadership behavior per se, and those that are increasingly common in organizations. Based on this categorization, we outline four key paradoxes: (1) maintaining a strong sense of self while simultaneously maintaining humility, (2) maintaining control while simultaneously letting go of control, (3) stressing continuity while simultaneously stressing change, and (4) pursuing corporate social responsibility (CSR) for the strategic purpose of enhancing profits while simultaneously pursuing CSR for morally based purposes. In so doing, we consider the challenges in dealing with paradoxes and how such paradox-savvy leadership can be distinguished from, but still work in concert with, more classic approaches, such as situational/contingency leadership. We view our article as speaking to a broad range of management scholars, including those who are interested in leadership phenomena across organizational levels. In addition, beyond scholars, we view this article as being of concern to practitioners who have a continuing interest in new ideas for leaders and their development. Specifically, we suggest methods or strategies by which leaders can learn to effectively handle paradoxes. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Viewing managers as embedded agents whose social structures are subject to manipulation by policy makers, we illustrate how individual differences can be infused into policy research to glean insight into how and why policy changes affect decisions, such as where to locate new ventures. We consider how the effects of sociopolitical situational attributes (e.g., level of regulation, support services for business, cost of living, and natural and cultural amenities) are influenced by individual differences such as the manager's position (entrepreneur or corporate executive), political party identification, and political values. Our illustrative investigation suggests that individual differences can systematically influence the efficacy of public policy and therefore deserve greater scholarly attention. We conclude by articulating the benefits of an embedded agency approach to researching entrepreneurship public policy. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Most of the literature has an economics orientation, but we also review relevant literature from other social sciences, including management research. The review helps identify a number of conceptual, theoretical, and empirical gaps, calling for further research. For example, the literature narrowly identifies entrepreneurship with start-ups and self-employment; does not theorize many potentially relevant inter-level links and mechanisms; and suffers from sample limitations, omitted variable biases, causality issues, and response heterogeneity. We argue that theories in management research, such as the resource-based view, transaction cost economics, and strategic entrepreneurship theory, can fill some of the conceptual and theoretical gaps. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
Untapped riches of meso-level applications in multilevel entrepreneurship mechanisms,2016,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987816169&doi=10.5465%2famp.2015.0137&partnerID=40&md5=f84ba885d0b043938e5a6d58f76ccd20,"Entrepreneurial action is embedded within a variety of complex social structures, not all of which can be as easily defined or measured as macro-institutional or micro-individual characteristics. Nonetheless, these multilayered structures collectively hold rich insights- before now underexamined-into the actual causal mechanisms that affect entrepreneurial actions and outcomes. To address this problem, we call on researchers to broaden their levels of analysis and direct their focus to meso-level structures. Although meso-level social structures are widely studied independently, these intermediate levels are seldom integrated into existing multilevel models. We argue that meso-level structures offer untapped riches for enhancing multilevel entrepreneurial mechanisms and discuss how social groups, associations, and other collectives operating at a meso level can play a more distinct, integrative role between the two ends of the institutional spectrum. To provide practical guidance for pursuing such investigations, we adapt Coleman's bathtub model to form a robust framework that integrates micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis. Our framework helps alleviate the shortcomings produced by an overdependence on either solely macro- or micro-level entrepreneurial mechanisms and offers fresh insights, as the intermediate level is more deeply integrated into this new framework. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Indeed, entrepreneurship drives net job growth in the United States, the European Union, and some Asian countries. Yet the United States has experienced a decline in entrepreneurial dynamism since the 1970s, and some European countries continue to struggle to build a culture of entrepreneurship despite significant policy efforts. At the same time many developing countries are experiencing a net rise in entrepreneurial activity, leading many to wonder about a specific aspect of the institutional environment, what the economics and public policy literatures call economic freedom (EF): a summary measure capturing the freedom to engage in economic activity without undue restrictions or subsidies. The papers in this symposium focus on EF, each offering a specific perspective on how scholars can theorize and study the effects of institutions and institutional change on entrepreneurship, and the effects of entrepreneurship on institutions, at and across different levels of analysis. © 2016 Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Using an institutional perspective, this conceptual manuscript advances competitive dynamics theory by developing a framework of organizational hostility. The framework profiles NMPs according to their propensity to engage firms; it also classifies firms based on their vulnerability and initial reaction to NMP attacks. Corroborated with a mathematical model (detailed in the appendix), the conceptual framework explains why and which NMPs are most hostile to firms, why some NMPs issue threats while others strike out at commercial firms quickly and without warning, and which firms are most vulnerable to such hostility. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

The search has led an increasing number to focus on approaches that involve broad-based ownership models as key tools for creating community wealth. There are many models of enterprises that have a fundamental purpose of benefiting workers and communities. These include employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)-owned companies, cooperatives, community development corporations, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), municipally owned enterprises, social enterprises, B corporations, and others. This paper provides an overview of these different community-based forms of business ownership, how to use them effectively, and what benefits the different forms can provide. Additionally, the paper highlights novel ways to combine these forms into comprehensive community-building strategies as with Market Creek Plaza in San Diego and the Cleveland model of networked worker cooperatives in Ohio.

This article illustrates a way of researching alternative economic futures by identifying chains of enablers in Denmark and other Nordic countries by which society and business can co-develop and capture capabilities to take on new roles in globalization. The paper focuses on institutional enablers that have made possible novel forms of work organization and business models. These institutional enablers are capacitating on the ""supply side"" by enabling labor to take an active part in shaping enterprises supported by social welfare services (training, childcare and eldercare, support for housing, etc.). Being generally inclusive of social movements, welfare states have also helped identify new needs on the ""demand side"" such as toys, aids, technologies, and buildings for childcare and eldercare, environmental protection, alternative energy and energy saving, health, and city planning. This is illustrated by a number of firms that supply products that solve societal problems, and that have used their capabilities to become multinationals that engage in active co-development with firms and institutions in foreign countries. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

However, such ""recency bias"" may significantly limit a firms innovation potential and prevent it from realizing the benefits of past knowledge. We argue that the temporal dimension of innovation deservesmore research attention. Combining prior research on innovation, dynamic capabilities, and family business, we conceptualize a new product innovation strategy called innovation through tradition (ITT) and identify its underlying capabilities of interiorizing and reinterpreting past knowledge. We analyze and discuss the illustrative cases of six long-lasting family businesses (Aboca, Apreamare, Beretta, Lavazza, Sangalli, and Vibram), exemplifying how firms that build long-lasting and intimate links with their traditions can be extremely innovativewhile remaining firmly anchored to the past. These examples help readers visualize theoretical concepts and recognize the potential advantages of past knowledge in terms of value creation and capture. We develop an agenda for future research aimed at improving our understanding of the temporal search processes involved in the ITT strategy, within and outside the family business field, and thus contribute to innovation and organizational learning studies. Managers of nonfamily firms can learn from the family businesses that successfully use ITT to create and nurture a competitive advantage and emulate them by leveraging rather than discarding tradition. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

As an exhaustive review of this literature revealed mixed and partial evidence, we compared the individual corporate environmental performance and disclosure of the 100 most international nonfinancial firms in the world to those of 16,023 firms in their industries and a group of selected firms similar to those in the group of the 100 most international in our sample. Our results show that although the top international firms have a much better record of environmental disclosure than the firms within their industries and the matched pairs, the top international firms actually show worse environmental performance than their peers. The results suggest that the top international firms seek legitimation for their environmental activities by means of voluntary disclosure. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

This article argues that we are observing a regime shift in the transaction costs of organizing that disfavors traditional corporations. Accompanying this shift is the emergence of low-cost, small-scale production technologies that will allow locally based universal fabrication facilities. In combination, these changes are compatible with new forms of non-corporate enterprise. While corporations are basic units of production in many theories about the economy, they should be regarded as only one hypothesis about how production is and can be organized. Traditional alternatives to the corporation include producer and consumer cooperatives (e.g., Land o' Lakes, REI) and mutuals (e.g., State Farm, Vanguard). More recent possibilities include commons-based peer production (such as Linux and Wikipedia) and ""platforms"" that connect buyers and sellers (such as Uber and Airbnb). The raw materials are available for more democratic and locally oriented enterprise.

In addition to markets, hierarchies, and clans (the standard repertoire), democracy should be added as a viable and efficient form of organization, particularly for the modern knowledge-intensive economy. In fact, even using established organization theory and organizational economics, democratic governance would constitute a superior structural alternative under such conditions. Based on this theoretical argument and more than a decade of empirical research on the organization of new knowledge-based firms, as well as the governance of innovative activities in established firms, this paper advances a set of propositions articulating the efficient mix of governance mechanisms defining such democratic structural alternative; they include ""partnership"" rather than ""exchange"" employment contracts, ""democratic"" allocation of decision and control rights, negotiated rent-sharing, and open boundaries. The potential and due applications of these practices to situations where knowledge contributions are present but not prominent are highlighted. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

It describes corporate conduct in the international arena, particularly in challenging political and social environments. Management scholarship and practitioner literature have focused on the communication processes and instrumental benefits associated with corporate diplomacy, exploring and explaining how managers negotiate stakeholder relationships to achieve a firm's profit-oriented goals. We enrich the current understanding of corporate diplomacy by viewing it as an umbrella concept that encompasses scholarship from political corporate social responsibility, international relations, diplomacy, and peace studies. We also suggest that corporate diplomacy includes the political role that multinational enterprises play in addressing social issues and governance gaps affecting less developed and potentially conflict-prone host countries where they operate. Based on this approach, the concept of corporate diplomacy builds on the premise that multinationals have an expanded role and responsibilities in terms of global governance and that the practice of corporate diplomacy can play a role in resolving social or political conflicts, leading to wider societal benefits beyond corporate profits. To illustrate our concept of corporate diplomacy, we focus on the governance gaps addressed in the literature on peace through commerce, discussing instances where firms implement corporate diplomacy through peacemaking or peacebuilding to accomplish both private and public goals in conflict-prone regions. We conclude with the practical implications of corporate diplomacy as well as suggestions for research to further develop a richer understanding of corporate diplomacy. © 2015 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

OB theories, constructs, and processes must be heard within the strategic human capital conversation because many of the questions being pursued by human capital scholars will benefit from consideration of OB constructs and phenomena. Simultaneously, OB scholarship will be significantly advanced by considering the context of strategic factor markets and reaching beyond performance to competitive advantage. This paper calls for a union between OB and strategic human capital resources within a new domain of scholarship called STROBE: STRategic Organizational BEhavior. A STROBE-based view leads to several novel observations: Many OB constructs and phenomena are resources that are also inherently firm-specific and lack efficient factor markets; OB resources may be valuable, rare, costly or difficult to imitate, and difficult to substitute; and OB resources may form complementarities with human capital resources that render all such resources firm-specific. Given these observations, OB resources may be a stronger determinant of competitive advantage than human capital resources. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2015.",,

Based on literature reviews in political science, economics, and peace and conflict studies, we find support for an alternative conceptualization to the conflict/post-conflict classification that we term the ""buffer"" condition. We suggest that existing research supports the proposition that the private sector is the most effective actor in promoting peace in areas experiencing the buffer condition. And we encourage researchers to investigate the most effective ways for business to promote peace under such a condition. © 2015 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

However, studies also show that many employees do not feel safe speaking up and often choose to remain silent about the issues or problems they encounter at work. We argue that providing employees with voice opportunities is not only likely to have positive effects inside organizations but is also likely to be essential in building positive organizations that contribute to the development of human potential in our communities and societies.We elaborate the microlevel processes by which employees' experiences with trying to speak up in the work domain may ""spill over"" into nonwork domains of their lives.

Toward a theory of perceived firm-specific human capital,2015,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941198816&doi=10.5465%2famp.2014.0112&partnerID=40&md5=6d8e871e4654075cf6ebad6111d68117,"Strategy research suggests that firm-specific human capital is a source of sustained competitive advantage, at least in part because it may constrain employee mobility. However, it is also typically assumed that employees are reluctant to invest in firmspecific skills because such investments may come at the cost of developing general skills, thereby reducing their attractiveness in the labor market. This creates a theoretical paradox: Employee investment in firm-specific human capital is crucial for value creation and appropriation, yet there is believed to be global underinvestment in firmspecific skills. We argue that the logic behind this theory depends on the assumption that firm-specific human capital is accurately and objectively perceived among labor market participants and that relaxing this assumption significantly limits conclusions that can be drawn about competitive advantage. The key takeaway is that perceptions of firm specificity, even if inaccurate, can be more important than objective firm-specific human capital in determining the likelihood that firm-specific human capital can be a source of sustained advantage. By relaxing the assumption of strong-form labor market efficiency, we develop propositions regarding how firms can facilitate and manage perceptions of firm specificity, thereby increasing the likelihood that a competitive advantage can be sustained. In doing so, we help reconcile some of the differing assumptions in micro and macro work on human capital and employee retention. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2015.",,

This presents a unique and timesensitive opportunity to explore and challenge these core assumptions and, specifically, to evaluate whether these assumptions mesh with the lived experiences of practicing managers. We argue that now is the time for the field to ground itself in practical phenomena so that its insights moving forward can be both academically rigorous and practically relevant. In this paper we illustrate the problems of theory for the sake of theory by systematically comparing the assumptions required in firm-specific human capital theory against the lived experiences of workers and managers. We then identify several phenomena that present new and useful opportunities to expand theory in the strategic human capital domain. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2015.",,

Partnerships for peace and development in fragile states: Identifying missing links,2015,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954465788&doi=10.5465%2famp.2013.0122&partnerID=40&md5=5f274b0a3783d20b9989c78c31bbfa19,"Literature on partnerships has grown rapidly in the past decade across different disciplines. However, despite conceptual attention to the value of strategic multistakeholder collaboration to promote peace and reconciliation, challenges posed by post-conflict fragile contexts have barely been considered in empirical studies. In this article we contribute by bringing together debates from different partnership literatures and providing an overview of existing, relatively limited research insights on partnerships for peace in fragile states. We present a typology of different levels (local, national, and international) at which collaboration takes place and different types of partnerships (philanthropic, transactional, engagement, and transformative). This is illustrated with specific attention to Africa, where most fragile states are found, and to partnerships with transformative potential. The analysis suggests that the lowest-level (i.e., local) partnerships tend to exclude the national government, while the most recent international, multilaterally driven collaboration has not included business; national cases are most transformative but incidental and not yet leveraged internationally. Despite the interconnected nature of conflict and fragility issues, linkages between partnerships and partners at different levels are largely missing, offering potential for further development by a broad spectrum of scholars and thought leaders. Insights from extreme and unconventional contexts thus have relevance for management research more generally. © 2015 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
Who captures the value created with human capital? A market-based view,2015,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941219345&doi=10.5465%2famp.2014.0152&partnerID=40&md5=bdd4d156672f72db750c8d7653e32a77,"When firms create value with employees' human capital, who captures this value - employees or their employing firms? This paper explains that the answer to this question depends both on the type of human capital deployed and characteristics of the labor market from which the firm hired the employees. When labor markets are highly competitive, individuals will capture more of the value their general human capital and discretionary firm-specific human capital creates, and firms and individuals will share the value created by required firm-specific and co-specialized human capital. When labor markets are less competitive, who captures the value created with a particular type of human capital depends on the reasons why the labor market is less competitive and each party's bargaining power and negotiation skill. The paper closes with the implications of the theory developed in this paper for human resources, organizational behavior, and strategic management scholarship and practice. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2015.",,

However, many of the phenomena and outcomes related to human capital, such as recruiting and onboarding, teamwork and communication, knowledge management, and employee satisfaction are also dependent on social capital and the relational networks that exist among employees. Social network analysis is a methodology that has so far been underutilized within the human capital field, but it is uniquely suited for helping researchers and practitioners understand the complex relationships that are driving organizations. This article provides an introduction to social network analysis and explains how it can be applied to both research and practice, with the goal of developing new ways of thinking about human capital, social capital, and the important interaction between the two. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2015.",,

However, our understanding of how individuals evaluate opportunities remains fragmented, with research spanning fields of study and using different terminology for similar concepts. Building on recent research suggesting that rule-based reasoning underpins how individuals evaluate opportunities, we integrate and synthesize the literature on opportunity evaluation and suggest rule-based reasoning as an overarching theoretical framework to understand opportunity evaluation across fields of study. Specifically, we illuminate how environmental factors, opportunity-related cues, and individual differences coalesce as one uses these factors as judgment rules to discern the personal attractiveness of an opportunity. Further, we explain how managers and entrepreneurs individuate opportunities, demonstrating why different individuals apply different rules and thus view similar opportunities differently. We conclude with implications of rule-based reasoning for opportunity evaluation across a broad set of management disciplines and offer directions for future research. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

These developments have led many authors to refer to the idea of the global factory. But little attention has been given to who has control over the geographically dispersed activities - or, to put it another way, about the governance of the global factory. Have the changes in the global location of economic activity come about primarily through the growth of locally owned firms in the emerging economies, or through increased FDI by MNEs from the advanced economies, or through the proliferation of outsourcing arrangements coordinated by firms in the advanced economies? These control/governance issues have profound implications for the capture of the profits/rents earned in global value chains, and hence for the global distribution of income. This paper explores these issues, and considers who has benefited most from the contemporary phase of globalization. © Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

This article is intended to help expand our thinking via a journey along a ""self-leadership high road."" After reviewing what we already know about self-leadership, this paper goes on to investigate ways that research and practice might move to a higher level. The concept of higher-level self-leadership (supported by the metaphor of a self-leadership high road) is addressed in terms of the degree to which self-influence processes are characterized by authenticity, responsibility, and increasing capacity. Authenticity encompasses the significance of addressing higher-level standards (e.g., considering the why and what of self-influence beyond the how). Responsibility is viewed in a way that is consistent with commonly understood elements of corporate social responsibility. Capacity centers on the expansion of self-leadership potential, which can bolster results reflecting authentic and responsible ends. Specific facets of higher-level self-leadership that are discussed include the pursuit of virtue, collaboration as a self-leadership strategy, and self-influence of emotions. In addition, the paper addresses health and fitness, elements of the physical environment (e.g., colors, scents, music, and sounds), and failure. © The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

The objective of our paper is to open the black box of NIH by providing an in-depth analysis of this frequently mentioned yet rarely understood phenomenon. Building on recent research in psychology and an extensive review of the management literature on NIH, we first develop a framework of different sources classifying knowledge as ""external."" We then discuss how a perception as ""external"" may trigger the rejection of this knowledge, even if it is useful for the organization. Differentiating various functions of an attitude, we hereby identify possible trajectories linking NIH with such biased individual behavior and decision making.

First, using recent surveys from sub-Saharan African countries, we document that individuals identify with their ethnic group as often as with the nation, pointing to the salience of ethnicity. Second, we focus on the various historical and contemporary functions of tribal leaders (chiefs) and illustrate their influence on various aspects of the economy and the polity. Third, we elaborate on a prominent dimension of ethnicity, that of the degree of complexity of precolonial political organization. Building on insights from the African historiography, we review recent works showing a strong association between precolonial centralization and contemporary comparative development both across and within countries. We also document that the link between precolonial political centralization and regional development, as captured by satellite images of light density at night, is particularly strong in areas outside the vicinity of the capitals, where due to population mixing and the salience of national institutions ethnic traits play a lesser role. Overall, our evidence is supportive to theories and narratives on the presence of a ""dual"" economic and institutional environment in Africa. © The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Drawing on qualitative and quantitative studies, we explore the complexities associated with how men experience fatherhood in the context of their work, and examine workplace and professional norms that may inhibit them from being the kinds of involved fathers they espouse a desire to be. We find that involved fathering has positive work-related outcomes that can benefit organizations. More involved fathers experience greater job satisfaction and work-family enrichment and less work-family conflict, and they are less likely to think about quitting their jobs. Although we find that more involved fathers have lowered career identity, this is offset by perceived managerial support. Our findings offer important practical insights into the benefits of fostering supportive workplaces for fathers. © The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We identify four predominantly African contextual dimensions (acute poverty, informality, colonial history, and ethnic group identity) and explore their influence on the way social ventures perceive themselves and on their choice of activities. Our empirical study of 384 social enterprises from 19 sub-Saharan African countries suggests that ethnic group identity and acute poverty levels influence both self-perception and activity choices, the country's colonial history influences only self-perception, and informality has no significant influence on either. These findings point to the need to consider both self-perception and the choice of activities in defining social entrepreneurship. Our study also highlights the importance of African contextual dimensions for understanding social entrepreneurship, and underlines the added value of incorporating insights from African data into management research more broadly. © The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Acqui-hiring is the acquisition of small companies primarily to gain access to their employees and has been proliferating according to publicly available data. While this trend has received considerable attention from practitioners, scholars have not systematically explored these acquisitions or explained how they fit into the corporate strategy of the acquirers, mostly Silicon Valley-based technology companies. We use a hand-collected dataset to document recent trends in acqui-hiring and present two case studies to provide insights into how acqui-hiring works in practice. We then draw on prior work in strategic management on dynamic capabilities to explain how acqui-hiring relates to the broader set of strategies firms employ to sustain competitive advantage. Specifically, we present acqui-hiring as one example of asset orchestration-an important dynamic capability embodied in top management and implemented in the management of human capital. Finally, we outline potential directions for a more comprehensive and systematic research agenda on acqui-hiring. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,
Second-order dynamic capabilities: How do they matter?,2014,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919614864&doi=10.5465%2famp.2013.0093&partnerID=40&md5=800705722e67d8250777045d9a338d86,"Similar to the fairly well-established distinction between substantive capabilities and dynamic capabilities, a further distinction can be made between first-order dynamic capabilities (which have been the subject of much interest and debate over the past two decades) and second-order dynamic capabilities (which have received considerably less attention thus far). Based on a large-scale survey study in the context of strategic alliances, this paper empirically examines second-order dynamic capabilities in two ways. First, I find that, for the most part, the performance effect of second-order dynamic capabilities is indirect and mediated by first-order dynamic capabilities. Second, results show a negative interaction between first-and second-order dynamic capabilities, suggesting that they function as substitutes in affecting performance outcomes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between levels of the dynamic capabilities hierarchy. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,

In this paper we provide an overview and synthesis of existing and emerging research on responsible leadership and propose a unifying framework for explaining leaders' propensity to engage in two types of socially responsible behavior: ""do good"" and ""avoid harm."" The framework models the linkages among individual, situational, organizational, institutional, and supranational influences on responsible leader behavior and describes the mechanisms by which these factors may affect a leader's decisions and actions. Our analysis suggests that ""do good"" and ""avoid harm"" behaviors are conceptually distinct categories, with different psychological bases and different antecedents that predict them. Further, we find that individuallevel and contextual factors combine and interact to influence responsible leader behavior, and a key aspect of the environment in which leaders act and make decisions- situational strength-moderates the relationship between individual-level factors and a leader's propensity to engage in ""do good"" and ""avoid harm"" behavior. In addition to providing directions for future research on responsible leader behavior, this article has several implications for practice, specifically how to select, train, and develop socially responsible leaders. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

In this article we first define shared leadership and how it is linked to the notion of responsible leadership. We elaborate on the risk of irresponsibility in leadership, which can result from a purely hierarchically based and centrally concentrated influence that does not allow for the natural balance fostered by shared leadership processes, and illustrate this risk through a brief description of irresponsible leadership practices observed in Nigeria by the first two authors. Subsequently, we clarify specific actions that hierarchical leaders can take to facilitate the ongoing development of shared responsible leadership and avoid irresponsible leadership, provide multiple examples of shared responsible leadership based on recent ethnographic research on shared leadership, and offer some concluding thoughts to shape future research and practice regarding responsible leadership. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We present a conceptual map that provides a comprehensive appreciation of hubris antecedents-symptoms-strategic choices-feedback performance main cause effect relationships. Our proposed conceptual map draws on the idea that managerial hubris is one of the determinants of CEO judgments, strategic choices, and organizational performance. We also show that managerial hubris has a good side and a bad side and identify the implications for strategy formulation and implementation. By doing so, the study not only provides a multidisciplinary introduction to hubris that is tailored to scholars, but also distills a suite of suggestions for managing hubris symptoms and traps that may prove valuable to practitioners. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,

We argue that the intrafirm network is likely to affect two firm-level outcomes: coordination and adaptability. Prior research has shown formal structure to be a useful tool for reshaping organizational networks, but we argue that firms vary in their rates of network responsiveness. When formal organizational structure is changed, as in a reorganization, or when targeted individuals undertake job changes, some firms will experience a rapid reshaping of their networks; in other firms, the network will respond more slowly to the new formal structure. We posit that slow network responsiveness may provide coordination advantages via compensatory fit, whereas fast network responsiveness may facilitate more rapid adaptability. As such, a firm's rate of network responsiveness is a heretofore unexplored source of dynamic capabilities. We illustrate these ideas using case data and empirical examples. We view network responsiveness as a useful means through which the internal network structure of a firm drives ambidexterity, dynamic capabilities, and firm performance. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,

This paper provides an empirical documentation of dual-purpose capabilities through the examination of how one such capability-production planning-developed. The historical analysis reveals that much of the learning involved in developing the capability occurred at the field level in a professional association and that the general efforts to professionalize also influenced its evolution. This analysis extends current learning-based models of capability development by showing how an external locus of learning shapes the content of what gets developed. It also highlights how the sociopolitical processes involved in the jurisdictional battles between groups influence the nature of the capabilities developed. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,

We suggest a solution to this problem in the form of an illustrative metaphor-what we call the ""organizational drivetrain."" Our drivetrain represents a theoretical model aimed at combining different views of the definition of dynamic capabilities by explaining how routines and simple rules interact. This shows that it is possible to advance the development of the framework by combining divergent understandings into a coherent whole. We conclude by offering specific recommendations for how to achieve a greater unity of understanding and move the field even further forward. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2014.",,

Specifically, firms should enter into a cooperative agreement, such as a strategic alliance, before they eventually decide to buy out a partner. In this paper, we first review the theoretical arguments supporting such an approach and then provide evidence showing that staged investments in mergers and acquisitions are far less frequent than theory predicts. We analyze a sample of 24,495 global transactions that occurred between 1995 and 2010 and find that firms stage mergers and acquisitions in only 1.26% of all deals. This figure changes little after we control for transaction- and environmentallevel considerations.

Picking up from their discussion on corporate governance, this paper raises four issues. First, different kinds of corporations should have different kinds of governance policies. In particular, large global corporations are so important and so distinctive that they deserve special thought. Second, humanity must set priorities among goals. Governance policies that enable an individual corporation to operate effectively right now may cause long-term harm to humanity and the earth, and policies that benefit humanity and the earth may harm individual corporations. It is not clear who should set such priorities. Third, ideas about governance should consider technological and social changes that are propelling corporations toward entirely new forms. Much of the debate about corporate governance has focused on issues relating to 20th-century organizations and 20th-century societies, and significant changes in governance will take decades to take effect. Last, boards of directors exercise rather weak governance in comparison with governance by managerial hierarchies. Thus, it is more important to improve managerial governance. As commercially and politically neutral institutions that emphasize open, fact-based discussion, universities could usefully enhance the quality of governance by senior executives as well as outside stakeholders. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Despite significant scholarly investigation into open innovation's importance to firms' R & D strategies, a deep theoretical understanding of the open innovation framework remains elusive. This study contributes to this burgeoning literature by providing new theoretical and practical underpinnings of the open innovation framework. Specifically, we conduct a comparative case study of two global banks to articulate the theoretical underpinning of this approach in the micropractices and microfoundations of the two firms. Although all organizations practice some combination of internal and external sourcing of innovation, we find that there is a tendency for these practices to fall into two broad categories: inside-out open innovation and outside-in open innovation. Our comparative case study formalizes these two forms of open innovation as mechanisms to align global and local search in a service industry context. We found that the two banks' deployment of open innovation processes produced strong results including greater top-line growth and bottom-line efficiency gains, albeit by two distinctly different strategies, offsetting the many headwinds that crippled their peers during the past five years. We end this study by translating our results to possible avenues for future theoretical development and empirical investigation. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

However, the protection of multiple stakeholders' interests poses substantial implementation problems. This paper explores a novel approach to such protection, based on the creative use of random selection procedures in appointing stakeholder representatives to the board. These procedures are the foundation of demarchy, a form of governance that was successfully used in ancient Athenian democracy. The paper presents advantages and disadvantages of demarchy, develops a corporate governance proposal that combines demarchy with representative voting, and addresses key issues concerning its implementation. It is suggested that the use of demarchy opens new avenues for stakeholder involvement in corporate governance. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Furthermore, given that the stakeholder theory perspective holds that what happens to one stakeholder influences other stakeholders, does this sort of consistency vis-à-vis a firm's customers also influence employee productivity? We empirically investigate the influence of organizational authenticity-defined as consistency between a firm's espoused values and realized practices-in the context of a merger, and specifically during post-merger integration. Our findings show that a lack of organizational authenticity in terms of both under-promising and over-promising to both employees and customers is associated with lower productivity, which in turn is related to long-term merger performance, thus affecting outcomes for shareholders. These findings support the importance of authenticity and should therefore be of interest to executives responsible for ensuring the consistency between what a firm says and what it does, as well as those who participate in and study the merger integration process. In particular, we propose stakeholder theory as a helpful lens for examining the merger integration process as well as other joint actions such as strategic alliances. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We elaborate on the theoretical logics of leverage and architectural openness, both of which underpin all four streams of platform research. We further discuss three distinctive leverage rationales exhibited in different platform variants-production, innovation, and transaction-and illustrate how platform ecosystems combine aspects of all three. We explain the metalogic of architectural leverage to facilitate the purposive manipulation of platforms, providing a link between platform design features and sources of leverage. This provides a model that allows the different platform types to be placed into context with others.

Much of this interest is based on the so-called ""big idea"" that first brought widespread attention to it-an idea popularized by Goleman's best-selling book Emotional Intelligence (1995), in which he claimed that emotional intelligence (EI) can matter more than the intelligence quotient (IQ) in predicting important life outcomes. Despite the appeal of this idea, recent metaanalyses indicate that emotional intelligence has not lived up to its promise. What are the implications of these findings for emotional intelligence research and for people interested in applying EI research to their organizations? We suggest that the predictive validity of emotional intelligence can be enhanced by refining the construct through the incorporation of three well-established principles of psychological processing: (a) dual-process principles that capture automatic and deliberate processing, (b) motivational principles that highlight the importance of goals for processing social-emotional information, and (c) person X situation principles that delineate how context influences the way people think, feel, and behave. We discuss the implications of this reconceptualization for emotional intelligence theory, research, and practice.",,

We review existing research, paying particular attention to the different micro-, group-, meso-, and macro-level factors that motivate acquisitions. We conclude that the link between turnover and post-acquisition performance is more complex than implied by existing studies. Retaining executives may lead to higher performance in some acquisitions, as existing studies suggest. However, there are good theoretical arguments for the opposite view; namely, replacing executives may be an equally important source of value creation in other acquisitions. We develop a framework that provides guidelines for understanding when and under what conditions retaining or replacing target executives may contribute to acquisition success. A research agenda that considers acquisition context and the short-, intermediate-, and long-term performance consequences of leadership instability in acquired firms is suggested as a means of moving this research domain forward. The decision to retain or replace target executives is largely a matter of context. Existing studies have not yet captured this complexity.",,

Our findings suggest that attributions have consistently demonstrated effect sizes that are comparable to more commonly utilized predictor variables of workplace outcomes. Expanding on these findings, we argue that attributions are an integral part of individuals' cognitive processes that are associated with critical organizational outcomes.

Subsequently, we discuss narcissism's relationship with leadership effectiveness, and propose a Narcissistic Leaders and Dominance Complementarity Model, which examines the dynamic interaction of narcissistic leaders' characteristics with those of their followers to predict leadership effectiveness. Finally, we suggest four areas of management that may benefit from incorporating narcissism as a determinant of their respective organizational outcomes of interest: international management, social issues in management/corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, and negotiation.",,

We explain, however, that acute size differences create distinct entrant-incumbent dynamics. Normatively, we show how, when, and where micro entrants are most likely to penetrate markets dominated by large incumbents. Conceptually, we expand resource partitioning and mutual forbearance theories by relaxing their assumptions and then remeshing their logic, thus offering nuanced insights on entrant-incumbent relations when size differences are very large. Contrary to the creative-destructive hypothesis, we evince that market penetration is more likely when micro entrants either solidify large incumbents' positions or target small niches that are inconsequential for large incumbents. Reactions to micro entry are also influenced by contextual factors- when large incumbents operate in value networks that expand through integration or modularity.",,

First, corporate social responsibility is not systematically correlated with companies' economic fundamentals. Second, opportunistic managers are incentivized to distort information provided to market participants about their firms' corporate social responsibility. Either causal force, by itself, makes it difficult for market participants to interpret information about corporate social responsibility accurately. This greater noise in financial markets typically invites more noise trading, which in turn leads to excess market volatility (among all publicly traded firms) and, in a particular context of social-institutional processes and structures, to excess market valuations of firms that are widely perceived as socially responsible. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

However, organizational ambidexterity studies have been conducted in a wide variety of industries and methodological settings, and the empirical results have been mixed. The purpose of this article is to systematically examine the organizational ambidexterity-performance relationship to reconcile the mixed results of prior research. By conducting a metaanalysis of prior studies on organizational ambidexterity and performance, we find that positive and significant Organizational ambidexterity-performance relationships are to a large extent moderated by contextual factors and methodological choices: Organizational ambidexterity is particularly important for performance in nonmanufacturing industries and at higher levels of analysis. Also, the performance effects are stronger when ""combined"" measures of organizational ambidexterity and perceptual performance are used and when a cross-sectional or multimethod research design is applied. Our meta-analysis findings advance the field of organizational ambidexterity by revealing some of the moderators in the organizational ambidexterity-performance relationship, thereby providing a more fine-grained understanding of the effects of organizational ambidexterity on firm performance in prior studies.

While a great deal of information has been gleaned about the importance of organizational citizenship behaviors in the workplace, the nature of work has fundamentally changed; with this shift, the nature of organizational citizenship behavior for modern workers is also likely to have changed. Thus, the field is ready for an evolution in how we conceptualize organizational citizenship behavior that considers the contemporary nature of work. We carried out a multistage qualitative study designed to provide an understanding of a new generation of organizational citizenship behaviors as expressed at Google, a high-innovation, fast-paced firm, characteristic of the new form of work common to the high-technology industry and knowledge economy. Our findings indicate that some established organizational citizenship behavior concepts map onto knowledge workers' conceptualizations of such behavior. However, other common, historical forms of organizational citizenship behavior were deemed irrelevant in this context, and a set of new behaviors that had not surfaced in previous research emerged. These findings offer insight into the kinds of behaviors necessary for success in the new world of work. We discuss the implications of this research for employee and organizational performance in the knowledge economy and introduce an initial instrument to assess these new forms of organizational citizenship behaviors. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

However, the relationship between eldercare responsibilities and work outcomes is understudied, especially in the management literature, and the results are inconclusive.

This paper makes the case that a suitable individual-level foundation can be found only in an account of individual psychology that gives due weight to habit and clearly distinguishes habit from deliberative decision making.

Over the past three decades, numerous studies have examined transaction cost economics' assertion that the costs surrounding exchanges, called transaction costs, direct managers' decisions about whether to organize activities via market, hybrid, or hierarchy, and whether organizing this way enhances performance. By aggregating the results of 143 studies via meta-analysis, we take a step toward better understanding the extent to which transaction cost economics' core predictions are supported and whether more recent theoretical developments shed additional light on organizing decisions. Our results reveal that transaction cost economics explains organizing decisions and resulting performance, but the size of the effects reveals that there is still much to learn. Overall, our findings suggest that transaction cost economics must be augmented with other perspectives to explain how firms organize economic activity. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

We examine this proposition in the cases of behavioral theory of the firm, transaction cost economics, organizational institutional theory, and population ecology theory. In each case we find that important new advances can be made in these maturing theories by incorporating both rational and reasonable models of behavior. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

Building on this insight, we argue that a key reason why strategic goals matter to firm performance-that is, firm-level value creation and value capture and sustained competitive heterogeneity-is that such goals influence value creation rooted in employee motivations. Unfolding this idea allows us to generate new insight into the relations among value creation, strategic leadership, and strategic goals. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

In this paper we first (briefly) review the history of the microfoundations discussion and then discuss what microfoundations are and are not. We highlight four misconceptions or ""half-truths"" about microfoundations: (1) that microfoundations are psychology, human resources, ormicro-organizational behavior, (2) that borrowed concepts constitute microfoundations, (3) that microfoundations lead to an infinite regress, and (4) that microfoundations deny the role of structure and institutions. We discuss both the partial truths and the misconceptions associated with the above understandings of microfoundations, and we argue that questions of social aggregation and emergence need to be center stage in any discussion of microfoundations. We link our arguments about microfoundations and aggregation with closely related calls for new areas of research, such as ""behavioral strategy"" and the domain of multilevel human capital research. We discuss various forms of social aggregation and also highlight associated opportunities for future research, with a specific focus on the origins of capabilities and competitive advantage. © The Academy of Management 2013.",,

We show that the effects may vary between buyout types and that it is inappropriate to regard most private equity leveraged buyouts as a zero-sum game with value transferred to shareholders at workers' expense.

Briefly, private equity governance makes owners into active managers and makes managers behave like owners. As such, private equity is often regarded as a more ""entrepreneurial"" form of governance than that associated with the publicly traded corporation. We argue for a balanced view in which private equity is best regarded as a governance structure that, like all forms of organization, has benefits and costs that vary according to circumstances. Building on the ""judgment-based"" view of entrepreneurship, we note that managers of privately held firms, as owners, exercise a strong degree of entrepreneurial judgment over the use of assets, unlike salaried executives of publicly held companies. At the same time, however, privately held firms are often constrained from pursuing potentially attractive profit opportunities by the nature of their debt obligations. Private equity is not a panacea, and buyouts do not necessarily generate the typical outward markers of innovation such as patents, employment growth, and the establishment of new enterprises. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

Specifically, we provide a conceptual configuration of private equity firms along two dimensions: their financial structure emphasis (the strategic use of debt versus equity among private equity portfolio firms) and the diversified scope of their portfolio firms. Using these dimensions, we create a typology classifying private equity firms into short-term efficiency niche players, niche players with long-term equity positions, diversified players with focused groups of portfolio firms, and shortterm diversified efficiency-oriented players. We also use resource dependence theory and resource-based theory to form our model, and discuss theoretical and managerial implications as well as public policy suggestions. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,
Microfoundations of management: Behavioral strategies and levels of rationality in organizational action,2013,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84888584042&doi=10.5465%2famp.2012.0091&partnerID=40&md5=d3d3cbdab5051f96e6189763b309aa48,"Behavioral strategies are a potentially promising microfoundation of management research. Organizational scholars are investigating strategies involving momentum, feedback, inference, and anticipation, and evidence is mounting for each one. These strategies are interesting because they reflect how boundedly rational decision makers reach different levels of collective rationality in organizational action, and they have consequences for organizational learning and adaptation. They also serve as windows into decision-making processes and sources of puzzles that can guide direct investigation of decision-making processes. The combination of evidence, consequentiality, and generative power for future research argues for giving behavioral strategies a role in the microfoundations of management theory. © The Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,
Much ado about nothing?

Management researchers have reinforced this assumption by propagating concepts such as the queen bee syndrome and by neglecting to provide balanced perspectives with accounts of conflict among men at work. We suggest that observers are inclined to problematize conflict among women at work relative to conflict among men, and that this tendency might be partly responsible for perceptions that women have difficulty working with one another. We provide empirical evidence to support this notion. We first review the literature on conflict between women at work and address its shortcomings to set the stage for our study. © Academy of Management Perspectives 2013.",,

This paper focuses on corporate political ties, which are boundaryspanning personal and institutional linkages between firms and the constituent parts of public authorities. To help address the inconsistency of past research findings on the value of corporate political ties, we offer a contingency perspective by developing an integrative framework incorporating market environment, nonmarket environment, and interorganizational and intraorganizational factors that condition the value of corporate political ties, and identify potential operating mechanisms that may erode their value for a focal firm. We conclude by developing suggestions for a future research agenda.",,

Leveraging the existing political markets literature, we predict regulatory uncertainty from the novel interaction of demand- and supply-side rivalries across a range of political markets. We argue for two primary drivers of regulatory uncertainty: ideology-motivated interests opposed to the firm and a lack of competition for power among political actors supplying public policy. We align three previously disparate dimensions of nonmarket strategy-profile level, coalition breadth, and pivotal target-to levels of regulatory uncertainty. Through this framework we demonstrate how and when firms employ different nonmarket strategies. To illustrate variation in nonmarket strategy across levels of regulatory uncertainty, we analyze several market entry decisions of foreign firms operating in the global telecommunications sector.",,

In this paper, we review the dominant paradigms in contemporary nonmarket research and report on the key insights and findings from those perspectives. We use this review to suggest that the integration of institutional and strategic perspectives provides a logical path for the continued development of nonmarket strategy research going forward. Looking ahead, our premise is that institutional perspectives will have an increased relevance to nonmarket scholarship, particularly with the increasing importance of emergent economies to international business. As companies are required to invest more in nonmarket practices, and adapt those practices to unique country contexts, we anticipate that research will increasingly draw from multiple conceptual paradigms and perspectives.",,

I tackle this long-standing management question using a new methodology from finance. I study the effect on firm-level value, rather than employee-level productivity, to take into account the cost of increasing job satisfaction. To address reverse causality, I measure firm value by using future stock returns, controlling for risk, firm characteristics, industry performance, and outliers. Companies listed in the ""100 Best Companies to Work For in America"" generated 2.3% to 3.8% higher stock returns per year than their peers from 1984 through 2011. These results have three main implications. First, consistent with human resource management theories, job satisfaction is beneficial for firm value. Second, corporate social responsibility can improve stock returns. Third, the stock market does not fully value intangible assets, and so it may be necessary to shield managers from short-term stock prices to encourage long-run growth.",,

It may also help to provide a better understanding of the deteriorating reputations of firms and their leaders as perceived by society as a whole and of what might be required from leaders to strengthen the bonds with society. However, the precise manner in which leaders interpret and actually display responsibility is not altogether clear. This lack of clarity coincides with the varying perspectives of responsible leadership that occur in the literature, and it may contribute to the lack of systematic research on how such leadership may ultimately affect firm- and societal-level outcomes. Based on a qualitative analysis of 25 business leaders and entrepreneurs, we identify four orientations that leaders may use to demonstrate responsibility and implement corporate social responsibility. We show how these orientations vary according to the breadth of constituent group focus and the degree of accountability toward others. Further, we discuss both research and training implications associated with the different responsible leadership orientations.",,

Second, boards may resist shareholders' intervention in pay setting and, as a result, manage compensation disclosures to ensure a passing shareholder vote. Consequently, Say on Pay may not only fail to remedy suboptimal pay but also legitimize it.",,

Our experiences showed that the paradoxes underlying the relationship between research and practice make bridging this gap difficult. We argue that the reason why the research-practice gap endures is that bridging it is beyond the capabilities and scope of most individuals, and we call for the creation of intermediary organizations like the Network for Business Sustainability.

After an extensive reading of the literature, I conclude that strategic human resource management researchers as a group deserve a D to F grade on all three dimensions. Among the problems are an overreliance on knowledge areas and perspectives pertaining to the internal dimension of organizations and management (e.g., strategy, psychology, and organizational behavior) and too little attention paid to those areas and perspectives dealing with the external dimension (e.g., economics, industrial/employment relations, and the macro side of sociology).

Based on a sample including 384 of the 550 most highly cited management scholars in the past three decades, results show that scholarly impact is a multidimensional construct and that the impact of scholarly research on internal stakeholders (i.e., other members of the Academy) cannot be equated with impact on external stakeholders (i.e., those outside the Academy). We illustrate these results with tables showing important changes in the rank ordering of individuals based on whether we operationalize impact considering internal stakeholders (i.e., number of citations) or external stakeholders (i.e., number of non-.edu Web pages). Also, we provide tables listing the most influential scholars inside the Academy who also have an important impact outside the Academy.

On average, we find that in manufacturing American, Japanese, and German firms are the best managed. Firms in developing countries, such as Brazil, China, and India, tend to be poorly managed. American retail firms and hospitals are also well managed by international standards, although American schools are worse managed than those in several other developed countries. We also find substantial variation in management practices across organizations in every country and every sector, mirroring the wide spread of productivity and profitability within industries. One factor linked to this variation is ownership. Government and founder-owned firms are usually poorly managed, while multinational, dispersed shareholder, and private-equity-owned firms are typically well managed. Family-owned firms are badly managed if run by family members compared with similar family-owned firms run by external CEOs. Stronger product market competition and higher worker skills are associated with better management practices. Less regulated labor markets are associated with improvements in incentive management practices such as performance-based promotion. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",,

Illuminating the peculiarities of the German, European, and U.S./American models from a comparative perspective makes the shape of strategic human resource management in Germany clearer: It is clearly distinct in that it focuses on employment practices associated with traditional values such as high investment in training, long-term employee development plans, job protection, and collaboration between employer and employee on various levels. However, Germany shares some characteristics with human resource management models in other European countries, and there is also evidence that it may be adopting some U.S./American strategic human resource management practices, which are sometimes considered best practices beyond the United States. Later in the paper I outline an agenda for future research and review implications for management practice and education.

The benefits of persisting with paradigms in organizational research,2012,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859074470&doi=10.5465%2famp.2011.0125&partnerID=40&md5=1a90790534d9a2be9435d547eb9213b1,"According to Thomas Kuhn, most scientists conduct their research within the existing paradigm, rarely overthrowing it in a paradigm revolution. Similarly, we argue the merits of persisting with existing paradigms for organizational studies, through paradigm continuity, paradigm elaboration, and paradigm extension. In paradigm continuity, the existing paradigm is prosecuted fruitfully. We discuss two of the possible ways: refinement of the protective belt and synthesis of existing models. In paradigm elaboration, the existing paradigm becomes more complex and may give rise to a new variant, which can substantially change it. To illustrate the fruitfulness of the concepts of paradigm continuity and paradigm elaboration, we use new research findings from an old organizational theory research paradigm: structural contingency theory. In paradigm extension, ideas from the core of a paradigm-in this case, the research methodology paradigm-are projected out to form the core of a new theory, here the recently created statistico-organizational theory. Finally, we call for a dialogue between proponents of paradigm persistence and those of paradigm revolution. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",,

It has unique conditions that make it one of the most attractive contexts worldwide for doing business, but it also faces serious challenges that severely underscore these opportunities. We apply a simple framework of analysis to describe the Latin American business environment and detect research opportunities. For that, we focus on four aspects of the region: (1) the institutional context, (2) the macroeconomic environment, (3) the consumer profile, and (4) the natural resource endowments. We summarize firms' strategic choices that result from this context and analyze their consequences for new business creation, incumbents' survival and growth, and sources of competitive advantages. We conclude by outlining a management research agenda. © 2011 The Academy of Management, All rights reserved.",,

It begins by articulating the relational philosophy, in particular the Chinese tradition of thought in which all entities are conceived to exist within the context of one another and in which integration, balance, and harmony are sought over distinction and comparison. It examines how this relational mindset shapes interpersonal relationships, communication, and temporal considerations. Lessons are then drawn for leadership, strategy, and organization for both Eastern and Western businesses. We argue that the shortcomings of many Western companies stem from too little attention to relational considerations, while those of many Eastern companies are caused by excesses and distortions of the relational perspective. The relational approach provides an ideal path toward an ""ambicultural"" mode of management, one that avoids dangerous extremes, takes the best from both East and West, and is attainable by all organizations.

They suggest, however, that managers must avoid dangerous extremes and that an ""ambicultural"" approach that combines elements of Eastern and Western philosophies is likely to be far more effective than either approach in isolation. This commentary challenges some of Chen and Miller's contextual assumptions about the East versus the West. At the same time, it also lends support to their central tenet-that is, the imperative for an ambicultural approach. I do this by providing an in-depth analysis of the two contrasting philosophies (the relational and the transactional perspectives) and note that, while each approach has major advantages, each also suffers from some serious-almost pathological-limitations. Importantly, however, the advantages and limitations of the two approaches complement each other. Thus, an integrated approach has the potential to significantly mitigate the hazards associated with either approach in isolation. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

Herein, we examine the contributions of strategic management and entrepreneurship to SE. Building on a previous model of SE, we develop an input-process-output model to extend our understanding of the SE construct. We examine the resource inputs into SE, such as individual knowledge and skills. In addition, we explore the resource orchestration processes that are important for SE and the outcomes, including creating value for customers, building wealth for stockholders, and creating benefits for other stakeholders, especially for society at large. Individual entrepreneurs also benefit through financial wealth, but other outcomes such as personal satisfaction and fulfillment of personal needs (e.g., self-actualization) may be of equal or even greater importance. Therefore, we incorporate in the model of SE multilevel outcomes that motivate entrepreneurs.",,

To address this gap, this paper examines common breakdowns in implementing four process models of organization change: teleology (planned change), life cycle (regulated change), dialectics (conflictive change), and evolution (competitive change). Change agents typically respond to these breakdowns by taking actions to correct people and organizational processes so they conform to their model of change. Although this strategy commands most of the attention in the literature, we argue that in many situations managers and scholars might do better if they reflected on and revised their mental model to fit the change journey that is unfolding in their organization.

Russia has not been given as much attention as BRIC nations such as India and China in either academic research or the popular business press, despite its being a global energy giant and major natural resource player as well as a member of the G8 economic powers. We analyze research on Russian business and management published over the past two decades, draw implications for Russia's future in the global economic community, and offer directions for future research. Our basic conclusion is that Russian managers have relied excessively on informal institutions, including personal networks, to conduct business due to the void created by the weak legitimacy of the country's formal institutions. A major implication is that by continuing to rely on informal institutions in the context of a formal institutional void, Russia may well fall short of becoming a fully participating member of the global economic community, and may remain for some time as an unbalanced, corruption-ridden, natural resource-based economy.",,

The key exhibit in support of their assertion is an angel agent in the form of Pierre Lefaucheux, the CEO of Régie Renault in early postwar France. Lefaucheux is shown to be a model agent, refreshingly free of the symptoms that afflict the archetypal economic agent of neoclassical agency theory. In this counterpoint, I provide a more restrained view of angel agents, question their wider presence and argue that one angel agent does not negate the overall theory of agency, and conclude by noting that the angel agent model has never really gained wide currency. Finally, I note that the inability of Renault to remain profitable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s raises questions about the longevity of programs left in place by well-intentioned angel agents.",,

It is particularly relevant now because many firms are required to implement open innovation, despite the difficulties associated with managing these activities. After providing a definition of open innovation delimiting it from open source, an overview of prior research is given, which identifies the following important topics of earlier open innovation research: technology transactions, user innovation, business models, and innovation markets. In light of current controversial debates about the value of the open innovation framework, we evaluate the literature and assess whether open innovation is a sustainable trend rather than a management fashion. On this basis, we present a conceptual framework that provides the foundation for discussing critical open innovation processes and their implications for managing open innovation at the organizational, project, and individual level. Thus, we assess the multilevel determinants of the make-or-buy, integrate-or-relate, and keep-or-sell decisions in opening up the innovation process. Then, we propose a research agenda based on this conceptual framework with particular emphasis on the organizational antecedents and performance consequences of open innovation and on important research design issues. Finally, we discuss implications for management education and practice, and we provide a conclusion and outlook. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

In particular, there is no reason for cross-national correlations of prosperity and happiness to equal the correlation of prosperity and happiness over time within any particular nation.

The paper focuses on international evidence. We report the patterns in modern data, discuss what has been persuasively established and what has not, and suggest paths for future research. Looking ahead, our instinct is that this social science research avenue will gradually merge with a related literature-from the medical, epidemiological, and biological sciences-on biomarkers and health. Nevertheless, we expect that intellectual convergence to happen slowly. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

Whereas practitioner-oriented publications have claimed that EI is the sine qua non of leadership, academics continue to discuss EI's relevance for understanding leadership emergence, behavior, and effectiveness. Here we critically review recent empirical evidence to constructively frame what has become a contentious debate about the relevance of EI. We also identify unresolved issues and highlight future research directions that may promote our understanding of EI's role for leadership. We close with a practical discussion of possible applications of EI in leadership education, training, and development. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

This has left providers and researchers with an inadequate conceptual toolkit for improving safety. To rectify the resulting crisis we consolidate fragments of management research into a comprehensive and integrative framework of how patient safety is produced and sustained through safety culture. Safety culture involves actions that single out and focus safety-relevant premises and cultural practices that reduce harm. This entails (a) enabling, which consolidates the premises for a safety culture; (b) enacting, which translates consolidated premises into concrete practices that prioritize safety; and (c) elaborating, which enlarges and refines the consolidation and translation. We close by discussing the implications of our framework for future research on key issues such as efficiency-safety trade-offs, interactions among components of the framework, and feedback loops.",,

Business reality has transformed from ""West leads East"" to ""West meets East."" A thriving Chinese business culture represents not only a source of economic partnership but a potential fount of managerial wisdom that can help renew Western economies. Unfortunately, the cultural distance between East and West makes Chinese examples too different, and at times inappropriate, for Western firms to emulate. Out-standing entrepreneurs such as Stan Shih, who have taken the best managerial practices from the East and the West while avoiding the shortcomings, represent ideal ""intermediate"" role models. By employing such an ""ambicultural"" approach to management, Shih provides a model for both bridging cultures and instructing organizations in the East and West. In this essay, we discuss these linkages and some of the useful lessons for managers from both cultures. Indeed, ""Chinese"" as a way of thinking, with its emphasis on balance and self-other integration, offers the promise to bridge global divides and facilitate the formation of global-minded executives.",,

Moreover, executives who agree to be considered for a search tend to come from less successful firms and have shorter tenures than those who are targeted but decline to be considered for a search. The search firm studied tends to help individuals move between industries but not across job functions or to new roles. This evidence-based research guides attention to a type of labor market intermediary that plays an increasingly important role in labor markets today, but has remained underexplored by academics.",,

Thus, published research in the 1980s focused on the ""Japanese success story"" and the auto industry, while currently research on China is in vogue. This research, however, tends to overemphasize country-specific contexts as the primary source of success, paying less attention to the effects of organizational factors that vary among firms within the same country context. This approach also deemphasizes the value of examining any combination of Western and non-Western approaches, a key element in the paper on the Acer strategy by Chen and Miller in this issue.

Watching this long stagnation, management scholars appear to have lost interest in Japanese companies. It is as if the ascendency of Japanese management ended with the publication of The Knowledge-Creating Company and there remains nothing to learn from observing Japanese business. This article seeks to rectify this casual indifference toward Japanese management and point out opportunities to gain insight into organizational decay through empirical analysis of Japanese organizations.

Specifically, the Indian approach eschews the explicit pursuit of shareholder value in favor of goals associated with a social mission. These companies make extraordinary investments in their employees and empower them in decision making. These practices combine with a distinctively Indian approach to problem solving to create a competitive advantage that has led to spectacular business growth, not just within India but in international markets as well. A particularly important lesson for the United States is that the major Indian companies are not succeeding despite the fact that they are pursuing a social mission and investing in their employees. They are succeeding precisely because they do so. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

For the sake of illustrative ease and brevity I label these two opposing views as the Beijing Consensus and the Washington Consensus. The Beijing Consensus interprets China's economic growth as a function of innovations in the state sector, including close financial controls, state ownership of firms, and political controls in favor of economic growth. The Washington Consensus views China's experience much the same as growth experiences elsewhere-that is, as a result of financial liberalization, private entrepreneurship, and political opening. Contrary to the established views among China scholars, this paper argues that the Washington Consensus view fits with the Chinese growth experience better.

Profits do matter, but today we know more about how business contributes to society. Good firms bring innovation to the marketplace, which facilitates their growth. Innovative, growing firms generate economic growth and employment, which, in turn, greatly improves people's lives. In this paper I argue that the main goal of business is to develop new and innovative goods and services that generate economic growth while delivering important benefits to society. Steady economic growth generated through innovation plays a major role in producing increases in per capita income. Small changes in economic growth can yield very large differences in income over time, making firm growth particularly salient to societies. In addition to providing growth, innovative firms can supply important goods and services to consumers, particularly those at the base of the pyramid. Through innovation and growth firms can do untold good for society. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

Our findings illustrate the importance of bridging innovation using twin skills to balance research and commercial goals, and the need for codifying knowledge capacities and creating new or changing existing institutional structures to legitimize and facilitate entrepreneurial activity.

Although there is a ground-swell of interest supporting organizations that dare to care, the bounds of what it means to care, especially the organizational implications of caring, have yet to be established. In this exchange, I argue that it is certainly within the responsibility of an organization's leaders to develop socially responsible practices, but the nature of industry and the institutional environments in which organizations exist jeopardize the competitiveness of organizations that implement such practices. Further, globalization amplifies the economic risks to the organizations that dare to care. Organizational leaders thus need to proactively change the nature of their competitive environment to one more supportive of social responsibility. Organizational leaders can do so through their influence on policy makers and other organizations that shape the formal and informal norms of business practices across world regions.

It's the connections: The network perspective in interorganizational research,2010,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952039293&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2010.50304417&partnerID=40&md5=18f163ccb8839f1531d5b9461c861c18,"The application of social network analysis to interorganizational contexts has seen an explosion of interest in the past several years. We argue that not only does the network or structural perspective add explanatory power to scholarly understanding of organizations' behavior and outcomes, but that it expands the universe of observed phenomena from an autonomous to a relational view for studying and explaining organizational action and outcomes. We develop an organizing framework based on three levels of network analysis (the dyad, the ego, and the whole network) and four theoretical mechanisms (resource access, trust, power/ control, and signaling) to organize and review the key findings and debates in the interorganizational network literature. We point to avenues for future research based on the linkages across the boxes in our framework, gaps in the framework, and finally, extensions beyond the framework.",,
Is CEO pay too high and are incentives too low? A wealth-based contracting framework,2010,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952040556&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2010.50304413&partnerID=40&md5=423bb1f1019ffb408c1d8cb005e1fd0a,"In the wake of the recent financial crisis, proposals have been put forward to resolve ""problems"" with executive pay and incentives. Although these proposals discuss ways firms or regulators might get executives to hold greater incentives, they fail to identify how one should determine whether an executive has enough (or too much) incentives. We lay out an economic framework for thinking about what level of performance-based incentives an executive should have. In doing so, we emphasize how performance- based incentives are linked to executive pay levels, as well as to the level of executives wealth. We also make clear both the benefits and costs of performance-based incentives.",,
An ambidexterity perspective toward multinational enterprises from emerging economies,2009,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72649083416&doi=10.5465%2famp.23.4.49&partnerID=40&md5=b92888bd6a3cca0fcc7b9809dcda4c75,"In this article we present an ambidexterity perspective on the international expansion of emerging economy enterprises, highlighting the unique strategic behavior of emerging market multinational enterprises (EM MNEs). Specifically, we conceptualize ambidexterity as a multidimensional term comprising co-evolution, co-competence, co-opetition, and co-orientation. While all firms need and maintain some degree of ambidexterity, EM MNEs have stronger motives and abilities to build and leverage such ambidexterity to offset their late-mover disadvantages. They behave co-evolutionarily to deal with the external environment they face at home and abroad, leverage their co-competence (transactional and relational) to compete against their global rivals, develop co-opetitive (simultaneous cooperation and competition) ties with their business stakeholders, and maintain co-orientations (leveraging competitive advantages to bolster short-term survival and compensating competitive disadvantages for long-term growth). This article uses several cases from China to detail this view and provides theoretical and practical implications of ambidexterity in the context of global business. It sets a foundation for discussion and examination of the critical domain of multinational enterprises from emerging economies-one that is yet to be widely examined.",,

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the trends and drivers of this surge in M&A activity in the European Union. It reviews the role of the European Commission in fostering a level playing field for takeover activity and the key characteristics of M&A deals in Europe. Despite evidence of significant progress toward the development of a homogeneous market for M&As, important differences still hold among European countries both in the rules and in the patterns that M&A activity takes. The analysis suggests that this dissimilarity between Europe and the U.S. is not solely linked to the existence of a harmonized market but rather arises from unique institutional characteristics ingrained in the corporate structure of companies, which differ among European countries. This raises questions about the generalizability of current research on North American M&As to the European context.",,

In this paper we identify and clarify a number of common misconceptions about EBMgt. Rather than a single rigid method, EBMgt is a family of approaches that support decision making. It is something done by practitioners, not scholars, although scholars have a critical role to play in helping to provide the infrastructure required for EBMgt. Properly conducted systematic reviews that summarize in an explicit way what is known and not known about a specific practice-related question are a cornerstone of EBMgt.",,

(2) What is the quality of evidence (where it exists) regarding evidence-based management? and (3) Is there evidence that employing evidence-based management will improve organizational performance? We applied an assessment rubric based on ranking systems developed in evidence-based medicine to evaluate the strength of evidence. We found that a large number of articles are published on the topic, but most provide encouragement to adopt EBMgt based on opinion and anecdotal information. We call for increased research to generate stronger evidence related to the impact of EBMgt on organizational performance.",,

Green management matters for many reasons, but fundamentally it matters because people expect managers to use resources wisely and responsibly; protect the environment; minimize the amounts of air, water, energy, minerals, and other materials found in the final goods people consume; recycle and reuse these goods to the extent possible rather than drawing on nature to replenish them; respect nature's calm, tranquility, and beauty, and eliminate toxins that harm people in the workplace and communities.

In this paper we examine these three sources. We conclude by recognizing that our disagreements with Ordóñez are not small and list several reasons why we are not sanguine about the possibility of reconciliation.

On the one hand, firms engage in a large number of alliances to secure and extend their competitive advantage and growth; on the other hand, their alliances exhibit surprisingly low success rates. In this paper, we discuss how firms can address these failures by identifying some of the primary drivers of alliance success. First, we discuss how firms can achieve success with any individual alliance by considering critical factors at each phase of the alliance life cycle. Second, we show how firms can increase their overall alliance success by developing and institutionalizing firm-level capabilities to manage alliances. Third, we highlight emerging issues in the alliance context, including the need to recognize a new class of alliances between firms and not-for-profit organizations or individuals, the benefits of taking a ""portfolio approach"" to alliance strategy and management, and the opportunity to transfer one's alliance capabilities to the effective management of other interfirm relationships, including acquisitions.

We (a) review the roots of the institution-based view, (b) articulate its two core propositions, and (c) outline how this view contributes to the four fundamental questions in strategy. Overall, we suggest that the institution-based view represents the third leg of a strategy tripod, overcomes the long-standing criticisms of the industrybased and resource-based views' lack of attention to contexts, and contributes significant new insights as part of the broader intellectual movement centered on new institutionalism.

This has profound implications for our understanding of corporate social responsibility, what we view as the relevant issues relating to it, and how we investigate its role and impact.",,

Hundreds of studies conducted in numerous countries and contexts have consistently demonstrated that setting specific, challenging goals can powerfully drive behavior and boost performance. Advocates of goal setting have had a substantial impact on research, management education, and management practice. In this article, we argue that the beneficial effects of goal setting have been overstated and that systematic harm caused by goal setting has been largely ignored. We identify specific side effects associated with goal setting, including a narrow focus that neglects nongoal areas, distorted risk preferences, a rise in unethical behavior, inhibited learning, corrosion of organizational culture, and reduced intrinsic motivation. Rather than dispensing goal setting as a benign, over-the-counter treatment for motivation, managers and scholars need to conceptualize goal setting as a prescription-strength medication that requires careful dosing, consideration of harmful side effects, and close supervision. We offer a warning label to accompany the practice of setting goals. Copyright by the Academy of Management.",,

I focus on two dimensions of this Sino-Indian difference-having to do with the state and with civil society-that have become contextually salient as a result of the current world financial crisis but have received short shrift in the management literature. China exhibits a strong state, forcing organizations to coexist with it, blurring the lines between the public and the private. The ambient rise in crisis-induced state ownership will likely force such coexistence on organizations worldwide, so there is an opportunity to learn from the Chinese. India exhibits a raucous civil society, historically in angst against excesses of capitalism in a way that now appears relevant to the rest of the world. On both fronts, state and civil society, China and India are mirror inversions of each other. Each can be understood better when juxtaposed against the other. As management scholars, we would be well advised to learn from such economic experiments unfolding worldwide.",,

I argue that all these shifts can be seen as part of an interconnected movement toward a finance-centered economy, and that the recent economic downturn can be viewed as one outcome of this broader movement.

Second, the amount of equity used in the CEO compensation package, such as stock options, is greater in firms that use consultants. This is consistent with alignment of manager and shareholder interests. Third, there is little evidence that using consultants with potential conflicts of interest, such as supplying other business to client firms, leads to greater CEO pay or the adverse design of pay contracts.

Complementarity in monitoring and bonding: More intense monitoring leads to higher executive compensation,2009,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650482307&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2009.39985541&partnerID=40&md5=49c566f32d09acc63e03be59484b1aa2,"Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.",,

From this research, we draw implications from past research and areas for future research on successfully managing JVs, taking into account the decisions JV partners must make throughout the partnering process, from initial motivations through partner selection and negotiation of terms to implementation and ongoing management. Key implications include the necessity of honesty, trust, and commitment for the success of the JV, settling disputes by focusing on what is best for the JV rather than individual partner objectives, and division of managerial responsibilities according to the functional expertise of each partner.",,

In this article, I review the key features and limitations of the postwar U.S. economic model as well as the challenges to this model from the success of many Japanese firms doing business in the U.S. market and the rapid rise of the Asian ""tigers."" Given the current situation, it is likely that the influence of the fully fledged market fundamentalist model, imposed on many Eastern European countries in the early 1990s, will be greatly diminished, and attention focused much more on alternative forms of capitalism.

Temporary help agencies and the making of a new employment practice,2009,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65349146553&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2009.37008003&partnerID=40&md5=b7e9a2f9798c76085e756eb8370de38f,"Executive Overview: Over the past 50 years in America, we have gone from a system of work characterized by lifetime employment at a single employer to a patchwork system characterized by low security and high volatility. A major player in our new world of work is the temporary help agency, which serves as the intermediary between workers and companies. Traditionally, temporary help agencies have been regarded, at best, as a necessary evil, and, at worst, as machines that eat up and spit out workers. In fact, the reality is far more nuanced. When job seekers' options are unemployment or degraded employment, working with the staff of an agency that has an investment in promoting its profit-making commodity-good temporary workers-gives them a distinct advantage. Agency staff help applicants and valued workers improve résumés and refine their job expectations in productive ways, and often advocate for better wages, higher-level positions, and more humane, safer working conditions for their temps. Temporary employment today is thus a double-edged sword. While, on average, agency temps receive lower wages, rarely can purchase health insurance, and have virtually no employment security, they can also be buffered from the worst aspects of new employment relations by labor market intermediaries such as temporary placement agencies.

Has goal setting gone wild or have its attackers abandoned good scholarship?,2009,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65349189640&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2009.37008000&partnerID=40&md5=e05d7be394f331af3cafa361b3a54543,"Executive Overview: We believe that Ordóñez, Schweitzer, Galinsky, and Bazerman (2009), in their critique of goal setting, have breached the principles of good scholarship. Rather than conducting or integrating research, they chose to draw their central theme from anecdotal evidence. Further, they employ unrepresentative citations from the literature, the misreporting of results, and the use of emotionally laden metaphors rather than dispassionate language. Moreover, almost all the pitfalls of goal setting they cite, rather than being original, have already been published-by us. In this rejoinder, we highlight these shortcomings.

In Good to Great, author Jim Collins identified a set of 11 firms as great, then used them to derive five management principles he believed led to ""sustained great results."" We contend that due to two fatal errors, Good to Great provides no evidence that applying the five principles to other firms or time periods will lead to anything other than average results. We explain the two errors and empirically test our contention. When ranked with the 2006 Fortune 500, the 11 Good to Great firms have an average ranking of 202nd. In addition, in terms of long-term stock return performance, the Good to Great firms do not differ significantly from the average company on the S&P 500. Our evidence is consistent with the conclusion that although the Good to Great firms may be good, they aren't great. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,
FDI in China: What we know and what we need to study next,2008,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58249113812&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2008.35590352&partnerID=40&md5=36ebdcb84c992d35c70f5507608dd8bf,"China is the world's fastest growing economy and is the focus of extensive discussion by both academics and businesspeople. One of the principal drivers of China's growth is foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country. China has pursued a historically unique FDI policy that has long-term implications for both Chinese and international businesses. The largest portion of China-related research is focused on FDI in China. This paper looks at what we know from this research and where future research about China and FDI needs to move. This paper will allow academics to build that knowledge of China and FDI into teaching and into a foundation for understanding this dynamic economy. Such an understanding of FDI will also help academics whose expertise is not China to better understand what is unique about China and its economy and lay the foundation for understanding other emerging economies. Using a process framework this paper examines various issues related to FDI in China, including the nature of earlier foreign investments into China, the timing and mode of entry, partner selection decisions, joint venture strategies, interpartner issues, and people issues in FDI.

However, during the last decade, this paradigm has been challenged by a number of analysts (e.g., Porter & van der Linde, 1995), who have argued basically that improving a company's environmental performance can lead to better economic or financial performance, and not necessarily to an increase in cost. The aim of this paper is to review empirical evidence of improvement in both environmental and economic or financial performance. We systematically analyze the mechanism involved in each of the following channels of potential revenue increase or cost reduction owing to better environmental practices: (a) better access to certain markets; (b) differentiating products; (c) selling pollution-control technology; (d) risk management and relations with external stakeholders; (e) cost of material, energy, and services; (f) cost of capital; and (g) cost of labor. In each case, we try to identify the circumstances most likely to lead to a ""win-win"" situation, i.e., better environmental and financial performance. We also provide a diagnostic of the type of firms most likely to reap such benefits. Copyright by the Academy of Management; all rights reserved.",,

His simple but powerful framework for creating a strategy any organization can use to go from goodness to greatness is certainly compelling. However, was Collins truly able to identify 11 great companies? Or was the list of great companies he generated merely the result of applying an arbitrary screening filter to the list of Fortune 500 companies? To test the durability of his greatness filter, we conducted a financial analysis on each of the 11 companies over subsequent periods. We found that only one of the 11 companies continues to exhibit superior stock market performance according to Collins' measure, and that none do so when measured according to a metric based on modern portfolio theory. We conclude that Collins did not find 11 great companies as defined by the set of parameters he claimed are associated with greatness, or, at least, that greatness is not sustainable.

On the other hand, when there is a mismatch, or lack of fit, a variety of difficulties are likely to result for workers and their families as well as for employers and society. Mismatches have become more common in the United States in the past several decades, due in large part to the pressures on companies to be more competitive, increased skill requirements, and the growing diversity of the labor force. Here we look at some of the major changes in labor markets that have led to seven types of mismatches between workers and jobs in the U.S. and discuss their implications.

Hidden costs associated with stakeholders in supply management,2007,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35348901994&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2007.26421239&partnerID=40&md5=0a89bb167b3fc61aaf22f160e7668235,"Many businesses fail to recognize the strategic importance of sourcing decisions. Companies often focus on the price and quality of goods provided to them, but it is easy to overlook the social and environmental standards of suppliers. Those who do may find themselves on the receiving end of aggressive attacks from a range of stakeholders, from customers and shareholders to the news media. Indeed, the business practices of Georgia Pacific, a hardwood plywood supplier, were at the heart of actions by the Rainforest Action Network aimed at disrupting operations at Home Depot; the practices of tomato growers that supplied Taco Bell restaurants were behind boycotts of the fast food giant; and fishing practices that endangered dolphins were the source of discontent with the tuna industry. Clearly the business practices of key suppliers can readily tarnish a corporate reputation, and the strategic impact - potentially including business disruption, business interruption, and even business failure - of neglecting these perceptions needs to be recognized by present and future business leaders. In order to examine the dynamics of change brought about as a result of negative stakeholder perceptions of supply management practices, we looked at the college and university athletic apparel industry, which between 1996 and 2001 came under scrutiny for dealing with suppliers and supply chains that produced goods in foreign factories with poor working conditions. When negative reactions escalated, the universities became the focus of activities aimed at changing the practices of their suppliers. This conflict was played out in the media, providing a solid approach - through discourse analysis - to investigating the events and reactions on both sides of the conflict. Our findings show that inattention to the practices of an organization's suppliers should serve to caution business leadership. Conversely, we show that a proactive stance toward managing supplier practices can serve to provide for successful resolution of stakeholder concerns regarding an organization's outsourcing.

Under the BOP approach, poor people are identified as potential customers who can be served if companies learn to fundamentally rethink their existing strategies and business models. This involves acquiring and building new resources and capabilities and forging a multitude of local partnerships. However, current BOP literature remains relatively silent about how to actually implement such a step into the unknown. We use two BOP cases to illustrate a strategic framework that reduces managerial complexity. In our view, existing capabilities and existing local BOP models can be leveraged to build new markets that include the poor and generate sufficient financial returns for companies to justify investments.",,

Hauser) either involve quibbles and misinterpretations of research evidence or are downright erroneous. We clarify the misunderstandings by providing evidence that is well-established through decades of research in the area of industrial/organizational psychology. By doing so, we re-emphasize that (a) the utility and validity of general mental ability are among the most robust findings in psychological research, (b) such findings were realized by the development of the meta-analysis method, and most important, (c) organizations can benefit greatly by utilizing findings obtained from meta-analysis.",,

In this article, I explain why these efforts make good business sense and why organizations with diverse employees often perform best. I do this by describing a logic of diversity that relies on simple frameworks. Within these frameworks, I demonstrate how collections of individuals with diverse tools can outperform collections of high ""ability"" individuals at problem solving and predictive tasks. In problem solving, these benefits come not through portfolio effects but from superadditivity: Combinations of tools can be more powerful than the tools themselves. In predictive tasks, diversity in predictive models reduces collective error. It's a mathematical fact that diversity matters just as much as highly accurate models when making collective predictions. This logic of diversity provides a foundation on which to construct practices that leverage differences to improve performance.",,

This paper explains how understanding ""stereotype threat"" - the fear of being judged according to a negative stereotype - can help managers create positive environments for diverse employees. While stereotype threat has received a great deal of academic research attention, the issue is usually framed in the organizational literature as a problem affecting performance on tests used for admission and selection decisions. Further, articles discussing stereotype threat usually report the results of experimental studies and are targeted to an academic audience. We summarize 12 years of research findings on stereotype threat, address its commonplace occurrence in the workplace, and consider how interventions effective in laboratory settings for reducing stereotype threat might be implemented by managers in organizational contexts. We end the paper with a discussion of how attention to stereotype threat can improve the management of diversity in organizations. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
Creating competitive advantages through new value creation: A reverse logistics perspective,2007,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34547212405&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2007.25356512&partnerID=40&md5=57221ade294f5da8b781b884150728b4,"Executive Overview Conventional wisdom in value chain strategy assumes a one-directional flow of primary activities, starting from inbound logistics to operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and finally to service. Our recent study, extensive discussions with executives, and on-site visits suggest that this wisdom may not be complete for certain industries or products. Customers on average return about 6% of everything they buy. Companies need to view this as an opportunity to give this returns pile a new lease of life. Yet many companies are not used to thinking that the things they expel such as products, waste, and resources actually have value. In fact, few retailers and suppliers capture the wealth of information that is locked inside a box that has been returned to the warehouse. Elevating the returns process to a new marketing opportunity builds a loyal customer base and also attracts new ones. In this paper, we present a redefined value chain strategy that entails a closed-loop system for industries in which reverse chain activities (reuse, repair, refurbishing, recycling, remanufacturing, or redesign of returned products from the end user) may create additional competitive advantages for the firm. Firms that do not recognize the importance of an effective reverse logistics strategy as part of their value chain risk damaging customer relations and may seriously jeopardize their brand image and reputation. A good reverse logistics program can be a differentiator and provides a means of gaining market advantage. In our perspective, a redefined value chain should be a part of the overall business strategy for manufacturers or retailers who handle product returns.

Yet from an optimistic viewpoint, business exit can effectively create value for the selling company. In this paper we attempt to bring the relevance of the seller's side back into our consciousness by asking: What do we know about business exit? We start our exploration with Porter (1976), focusing on literature that investigates the antecedents of, barriers to, and outcomes of business exit. We also include studies from related fields such as finance and economics. 1 Through this research we determine three clusters of findings: factors promoting business exit, exit barriers, and exit outcomes. Overall, it is the intention of this paper to highlight the importance of business exit for research and practice. Knowing what we know about business exits and their high financial value we should bear in mind that exit need not mean failure but a new beginning for a corporation.

This commentary addresses the economic perfect storm that the United States and many other developed countries face as they attempt to become globally competitive. Its forces conflate strategic change with the erosion of employment and income security as firms shed labor and old institutional arrangements, in turn degrading quality of work and family life for workers as well as the futures of retirees. We evaluate the responses of our commentators - Louis Uchitelle, J.T. Battenberg III, and Thomas Kochan - who assess the current crisis and possible solutions to it. Their responses and the supporting evidence indicate that the current misalignment among labor, management, and government and the 20 century institutions they maintain make any effective solution nearly impossible. That is, unless there is a renewed partnership among business, labor, and government to create 21st century institutions capable of achieving both global competitiveness and high quality of life and well-being for workers.",,

We review past work, develop expectations, and provide large-scale evidence for examining the validity of such suggestions. We accessed extensive data provided by Dun & Bradstreet and procured detailed information from 765 leading public and private North American businesses. Analysis of 215 closely matched pairs showed that companies with former business school professors as executives generated significantly greater revenues per employee than counterparts with non-former professors as executives. Companies with former professors in vice-president positions had the best performance in the sample, signifying the value of correspondence between academic expertise and functional business area. Companies with executives who had exited academic careers early performed better than companies with late career exit counterparts. The performance of companies with executives who were professors at top-ranked business schools was the same as other companies with executives who were professors at non-ranked business schools. We observed controls to mitigate effects from organization size, industry sector, and geographic location and executed several auxiliary analyses to assess the validity of principal findings. Finally, we interviewed a sub-sample of executive manager participants by telephone and collected qualitative data from them via surveys to further interpret the results and diminish alternative explanations. Our findings suggest that the fashionable idea that business school professors are unable to ""walk the walk"" is a popular myth. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
Implications of methodological advances for the practice of personnel selection: How practitioners benefit from meta-analysis,2007,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35348840275&doi=10.5465%2famp.2007.26421233&partnerID=40&md5=ce4a667e5d04e743fb6059dba81f910e,"We discuss how meta-analysis, a method for synthesizing research findings, can meaningfully impact personnel selection practices. Specifically, we review important changes in professional and legal practices from the past 30 years resulting from meta-analytic findings. The implications of using meta-analysis methods for evaluating utilities of selection procedures and for assessing relative predictive capabilities of three popular selection tools (general mental ability tests, personality tests, and structured interviews) are further discussed. Based on these implications, we propose that meta-analysis can play an important role in bridging the gap between academic research and organizational practices.

In response to sexual harassment suits, many firms on Wall Street implemented strict sexual harassment policies, and even family friendly work-life balance policies. Unfortunately, the lawsuits have continued, prompting many to wonder why Wall Street continues to be so hostile to anyone other than white males. In a research study conducted in 1998 and 1999 with 76 men and women working on Wall Street, I found a number of reasons why change has been so slow in the making.

On the one hand, after a half a century of stability in the earnings of women relative to men, there has been a substantial increase in women's relative earnings since the late 1970s. One of the things that make this development especially dramatic and significant is that the recent changes contrast markedly with the relative stability of earlier years. On the other hand, there is still a gender pay gap. Women continue to earn considerably less than men on average, and the convergence that began in the late 1970s slowed noticeably in the 1990s. Is this slowdown just a blip in an overall trend, or has the pay gap converged as far as it can? We look at this issue in depth and make some predictions for the future.

An important aspect of understanding venture capital involves the different sources of risk capital for the entrepreneur, i.e., (classic) venture capitalists (VCs), business angels, and corporate venture capitalists. Furthermore, whatever source of risk capital entrepreneurs choose, they have to take into account the different phases of the investment cycle, i.e., the pre-investment, post-investment, and exit phases. We discuss some of the key issues of which entrepreneurs need to be aware when dealing with venture capitalists during each of these three investment phases. Furthermore, we provide hands-on advice to help entrepreneurs maximize the value of their relationship with VCs throughout the investment cycle, and we point to trouble spots which can endanger value creation. For instance, in the pre-investment phase, the challenges of finding an (adequate) investor, obtaining the right amount of money, and structuring a fair deal are paramount for entrepreneurs. During the post-investment phase, entrepreneurs must attend to managing the relationship with the VC via the creation of effective communication, mutual trust, and the establishment of objectivity and consideration towards the other party. For the exit phase, we discuss the importance of establishing a timely and harmonious exit for the VC. We begin with a brief comparison of venture capitalists in classic venture capital firms with business angels and corporate venture capitalists. The focus of the article, however, is on classic venture capital.",,

Increasingly, companies based in high-wage economies are hiring skilled workers in lower-wage economies to undertake service tasks that can be performed remotely, such as IT maintenance and call center operation. Today, improvements in information technology and falling telecommunication costs mean that any activity that is not tied to a particular place by the need for customer contact, or local knowledge, or complex, face-to-face interactions with colleagues can - in theory - be performed remotely. Thanks to freer trade between countries and a reduction in the perceived risks of operating overseas, companies can choose to perform such an activity in a lower-cost offshore location, if that seems advantageous, either by outsourcing to a third party vendor, or by developing its own, captive operation. Both choices comprise what we know as ""offshoring."".",,

They also put forward proposals for improving both executive pay and corporate governance. This paper provides an overview of the main elements of their critique and proposals. The authors show that, under current legal arrangements, boards cannot be expected to contract at arm's length with the executives whose pay they set. They discuss how managers' influence can explain many features of the executive compensation landscape, including ones that researchers subscribing to the arm's-length contracting view have long considered as puzzling. The authors also explain how managerial influence can lead to inefficient arrangements that generate weak or even perverse incentives, as well as to arrangements that make the amount and performance-insensitivity of pay less transparent. Finally, they outline proposals for improving the transparency of executive pay, the connection between pay and performance, and the accountability of corporate boards.",,

But consumer privacy advocates are increasingly concerned by what they see as the encroachment of ""big brother."" This concern, we believe, has the potential to slow or even derail future RFID applications. In order to avoid this outcome, we suggest that RFID technology has the dual responsibility to both effect efficiency and to protect privacy. In this paper we review the current trends in RFID technology, look at how manufacturers and governments are addressing consumer privacy concerns, and end with a recommendation that an alliance be created that includes manufacturers, retailers, government representatives (both as users and as protectors), ethicists, academicians, and industry leaders/executives to develop acceptable and implementable guidelines for the industry.",,

Yet the evidence for this, beyond anecdotes, is slim. In this article, we review evidence on whether firms that do business in foreign countries are substituting foreign for domestic labor. We review the results of previous studies and present new firm-level evidence showing that, in fact, increases in employment in low-income countries do hurt employment at home. The premise that foreign expansion of U.S. multinationals encourages employment at home is a myth, but the domestic employment costs of offshoring are probably fairly small in magnitude.",,

Based on interviews, surveys, and analysis of the appointment calendars of 79 Japanese CEOs, this research examines changes in CEO priorities since 1989 and how these changes reflect larger shifts in the way business is conducted in larger Japanese firms. The authors find that Japanese CEOs and their firms are becoming much more focused on investor relations than on bank relations, more focused on media relations and promoting their firm to the market, and less focused on government relations as Japan undergoes deregulation. The authors also find that Japanese CEOs are focusing more on external factors, with greater emphasis on shareholders and less attention to employees. Within the firm, Japanese decision-making is becoming more top-down than middle-up-down, as well as less hierarchical with fewer levels of management. In addition, Japanese CEOs and their firms are focusing more on outsourcing and hiring non-regular workers. The most surprising finding, however, is the absence of radical change in terms of personnel-related priorities and practices, in light of the length and degree of Japan's recession.",,

While part of the managerial function requires the establishment of rules and policies that promote good customer service and product consistency, managers who lead with a firm hand or place too much pressure on sales quotas, may be unknowingly contributing to their employees' deviant behaviors. Managers must learn to identify the role that they play in triggering employee deviance.

Despite persistent interest in this issue, we do not yet have good answers to the question of how long it will take until more than a token number of women hold the CEO position. This study provides numerical estimates that help to answer this question, and also provides new information regarding the job responsibilities and positions in the executive hierarchy of women and men below the rank of CEO. This article presents the results of an extensive data collection effort that has yielded a comprehensive census of top executives in U.S. Fortune 1000 firms as of the year 2000. With regard to the pipeline to the CEO position, our data suggest that we should expect to see a slow increase in the percentage of CEOs that are women in the next five to ten years. Nevertheless, the percentage of CEOs that are women is likely to remain relatively low. As a result, our estimates suggest that if current trends continue, perhaps 6 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 1000 will be women by 2016. We also document the little known fact that almost 50 percent of the firms in the Fortune 1000 had no women as top executives as recently as the year 2000. Moreover, even firms with women executives generally had only 1 or 2 per firm.",,

Conversely, jobs are destroyed by deaths and contractions of existing businesses, and outward relocations. To the extent that state and local policymakers directly address job creation and job destruction, they focus to a large extent on relocation - engaging in efforts to attract new businesses to a state or locality, and attempting to encourage existing businesses contemplating leaving to stay. However, the empirical evidence underlying this focus on relocation is virtually non-existent, as there has been no systematic evidence on the role of business relocation in job creation and destruction. This paper presents new evidence on the importance of each of these processes - births and deaths, expansions and contractions, and in- and out-migration - to employment growth (and decline). We use data from the National Establishment Time Series for California. The evidence indicates that births of new business establishments and especially new firms, and expansions of existing ones, coupled with their counterparts of deaths and contractions of existing establishments, are the prime determinants of employment growth. In contrast to the high profile accorded it by policymakers, business relocation plays a negligible role. The gross job flows (both positive and negative) from births, deaths, expansions, and contractions far outweigh those due to relocation. Moreover, in most years the net difference between expansions and contractions of existing businesses contribute by far the most to job growth.",,
"Opportunity recognition as pattern recognition: How entrepreneurs ""connect the dots"" to identify new business opportunities",2006,Academy of Management Perspectives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33748807513&doi=10.5465%2fAMP.2006.19873412&partnerID=40&md5=5f9c21c04b90872f4caa29693624eae9,"How do entrepreneurs identify opportunities for new business ventures? One possibility, suggested by research on human cognition, is that they do so by using cognitive frameworks they have acquired through experience to perceive connections between seemingly unrelated events or trends in the external world. In other words, they use cognitive frameworks they possess to ""connect the dots"" between changes in technology, demographics, markets, government policies, and other factors. The patterns they then perceive in these events or trends suggest ideas for new products or services-ideas that can potentially serve as the basis for new ventures. This pattern recognition perspective on opportunity identification is useful in several respects. First, it helps integrate into one basic framework three factors that have been found to play an important role in opportunity recognition: engaging in an active search for opportunities; alertness to them; and prior knowledge of an industry or market. In addition, it also helps explain interrelations between these factors (e.g., the fact that active search may not be required when alertness is very high). Second, a pattern recognition perspective helps explain why some persons, but not others, identify specific opportunities. Third, a pattern recognition framework suggests specific ways in which current or would-be entrepreneurs can be trained to be better at recognizing opportunities. Future directions for research on a pattern recognition perspective are described, and its practical implications for entrepreneurship education are examined.",,

The article and the important report Farrell and her colleagues at the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI 2005) completed in late 2005 provide much food for thought regarding offshoring of service jobs. The accompanying article gives only a flavor of the results, while the report contains the most detailed micro-level analysis available of the employment impacts of offshoring upon specific sectors. In contrast to the report's rather muted conclusion regarding the dimensions and implications of services offshoring, a more comprehensive reading suggests a profound transformation of the employment and wage structure for many college-educated Americans is underway.",,

While these emerging forms of employment have become harbingers of new ways of working, they remain poorly understood; efforts to explain their emergence and significance have suffered from an excess of ideology and a dearth of data. Stephen Barley and Gideon Kunda undertook an ethnography of technical contractors to produce a detailed, balanced, and accurate depiction of how contractors structure and interpret their experience. Their study documents the social dynamics of skilled ""contingent labor,"" a term economists and sociologists now use for an array of short-term work arrangements. Their goal was to understand how employment relations were changing at the dawn of the 21st century. Closely studying contractors' everyday lives provided a strategic vantage point for viewing, evaluating, and perhaps even shaping changes taking place in the U.S. and global economies. As they set out to explore the world of technical contracting, Barley and Kunda were confronted with an unexpected profile of contractors: these were itinerant experts and social pioneers who partook of a way of life and a culture of work that challenges the prevailing theories and entrenched practices of employment. After an account of the exigencies of technical contracting, Barley and Kunda discuss contingent work within the context of the American industrial landscape and in light of institutionalist and free market perspectives. They also discuss contingent labor as it relates to the way in which professions and occupations are organized. Specifically, they argue that contracting directs our attention to a resurgence of occupational organizing in the wake of bureaucracy's retreat and the free market's advance. They suggest what a renewed appreciation for occupational dynamics could mean for individuals, firms and public policy.",,

Indeed, it is often small clues that influence a customer's overall perception of an experience. Customers form perceptions based on the technical performance of the service (functional clues), the tangibles associated with the service (mechanic clues), and the behavior and appearance of service providers (humanic clues). Functional, mechanic, and humanic clues play specific roles in creating the customer's service experience, influencing both rational and emotional perceptions of service quality. Clearly and consistently designing and orchestrating clues is a critical management responsibility; businesses need to be ""clue conscious"" and add ""clue management"" to their job descriptions.",,

Always"" has made it the largest retail operation in history. However, this unrelenting mission has also created a way of doing business that draws substantial criticism regarding the company's employment practices, relationships with suppliers, and the company's impact on local economies. This paper focuses on a company that delivers low prices to consumers, but in a fundamentally different way than its competitor, Wal-Mart. That company is warehouse-retailer Costco. In the following sections we will begin by providing some background on the company, including its history, its business model, its ethical principles, core beliefs, and values. Then we will consider some typical Wall Street analysts' assessments of this approach, followed by a systematic comparison of the financial performance of Costco with that of Sam's Club, a warehouse retailer that is part of Wal-Mart.",,

While there is much writing on the topic, most seems to be either general advice (i.e., being open minded and respectful of other cultures) or very specific information about a particular country based on a limited case study (do not show the soles of your shoes when seated as a guest in an Arab country). Both kinds of information are certainly useful, but limited from both theoretical and practical viewpoints on how to lead in a foreign country. In this paper, findings from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) research program are used to provide a sound basis for conceptualizing worldwide leadership differences. We use a hypothetical case of an American executive in charge of four similar teams in Brazil, France, Egypt, and China to discuss cultural implications for the American executive. Using the hypothetical case involving five different countries allows us to provide in-depth action oriented and context specific advice, congruent with GLOBE findings, for effectively interacting with employees from different cultures. We end the paper with a discussion of the challenges facing global executives and how corporations can develop useful global leadership capabilities.",,

A megacorporation with sales that consistently rank it as the number-one or number-two publicly traded company in the United States and in the world, Wal-Mart has impacted wage rates, prices, and economies on a local, national, and global scale. It is arguably the world's most important privately controlled economic institution. It not only has no rivals, it actually influences the prices set by its suppliers and has often seemed impervious to challenge, let alone accountability. Many of the most basic and most urgent questions about Wal-Mart, those at the core of a public debate over the ""Wal-Mart Effect,"" go unanswered. Wal-Mart's own 40-year history of absolute secrecy, including forbidding its suppliers to talk about their relationship with Wal-Mart, has only deepened the mystery of its impact. Answering the questions is vital - not just to understand the impact of Wal-Mart but to understand the behavior and impact of all kinds of megacorporations emerging in the global economy.",,

Despite this observation, managers often fail to take humor seriously or realize its numerous benefits. Humor is more than just funny concepts; it represents a multifunctional management tool that can be used to achieve many objectives. This article describes how managers can use humor to reduce stress and enhance leadership, group cohesiveness, communication, creativity, and organizational culture. Specifically, we suggest humor styles that are best suited to realize these outcomes. Additionally, the effect of humor on organizational outcomes is moderated by individual differences such as ethnicity and gender. Much like selecting the proper tool from a toolkit, managers can select the appropriate humor style suitable for the desired organizational outcome, adjust for individual differences, and achieve positive organizational outcomes.",,

Most manufacturing companies have adopted some type of ""lean initiative,"" and the lean movement recently has gone beyond the shop floor to white-collar offices and is even spreading to service industries. Unfortunately, most of these efforts represent limited, piecemeal approaches-quick fixes to reduce lead time and costs and to increase quality-that almost never create a true learning culture. We outline and illustrate the management principles of TPS that can be applied beyond manufacturing to any technical or service process. It is a true systems approach that effectively integrates people, processes, and technology-one that must be adopted as a continual, comprehensive, and coordinated effort for change and learning across the organization.",,

American automobile manufacturers readily adopted the ""Toyota Way"" and many of the management practices in service industries, such as Total Quality Management (TQM) are biased on its fundamental principles. The author of this paper, Darius Mehri, is an American-born computer simulation engineer who worked in a Toyota group company for three years, observing this system firsthand and conducting his own qualitative research on what he considers the true impact of lean work: the human cost. As a participant observer who was inculcated in Japanese social and workplace culture, Mehri takes an examination of TPS well beyond what many studies American and European scholars have been able to go. His assessment is guided by a distinction which is fundamental to understanding Japanese culture and business: tatemae (what you are supposed to feel or do) and honne (what you actually feel or do). Mehri believes that international enthusiasm for the Toyota Production System results from western observers' failure to discern the honne within the tatemae. He lifts the curtain of formality and messages from management at Toyota - the tatemae - that obscures the realities the honne - of the Toyota Way: limited potential for creativity and innovation, narrow professional skills, worker isolation and harassment, dangerous conditions on the production line, accident cover-ups, excessive overtime, and poor quality of life for workers.

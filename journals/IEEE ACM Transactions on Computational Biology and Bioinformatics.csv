Deep Collaborative Filtering for Prediction of Disease Genes,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092801571&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2907536&partnerID=40&md5=0d8ac6a1cf4e2349a13deee66da51c51,"Accurate prioritization of potential disease genes is a fundamental challenge in biomedical research. Various algorithms have been developed to solve such problems. Inductive Matrix Completion (IMC) is one of the most reliable models for its well-established framework and its superior performance in predicting gene-disease associations. However, the IMC method does not hierarchically extract deep features, which might limit the quality of recovery. In this case, the architecture of deep learning, which obtains high-level representations and handles noises and outliers presented in large-scale biological datasets, is introduced into the side information of genes in our Deep Collaborative Filtering (DCF) model. Further, for lack of negative examples, we also exploit Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning formulation to low-rank matrix completion. Our approach achieves substantially improved performance over other state-of-the-art methods on diseases from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Our approach is 10 percent more efficient than standard IMC in detecting a true association, and significantly outperforms other alternatives in terms of the precision-recall metric at the top-k predictions. Moreover, we also validate the disease with no previously known gene associations and newly reported OMIM associations. The experimental results show that DCF is still satisfactory for ranking novel disease phenotypes as well as mining unexplored relationships.

Modeling Variability in Populations of Cells Using Approximated Multivariate Distributions,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092803398&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2904276&partnerID=40&md5=b12df36c35c147bf184ccd62ae4bfe96,"We are interested in studying the evolution of large homogeneous populations of cells, where each cell is assumed to be composed of a group of biological players (species) whose dynamics is governed by a complex biological pathway, identical for all cells. Modeling the inherent variability of the species concentrations in different cells is crucial to understand the dynamics of the population. In this work, we focus on handling this variability by modeling each species by a random variable that evolves over time. This appealing approach runs into the curse of dimensionality since exactly representing a joint probability distribution involving a large set of random variables quickly becomes intractable as the number of variables grows. To make this approach amenable to biopathways, we explore different techniques to (i) approximate the exact joint distribution at a given time point, and (ii) to track its evolution as time elapses. We start with the problem of approximating the probability distribution of biological species in a population of cells at some given time point. Data come from different fine-grained models of biological pathways of increasing complexities, such as (perturbed) Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Classical approximations rely on the strong and unrealistic assumption that variables/species are independent, or that they can be grouped into small independent clusters. We propose instead to use the Chow-Liu tree representation, based on overlapping clusters of two variables, which better captures correlations between variables. Our experiments show that the proposed approximation scheme is more accurate than existing ones to model probability distributions deriving from biopathways. Then we address the problem of tracking the dynamics of a population of cells, that is computing from an initial distribution the evolution of the (approximate) joint distribution of species over time, called the inference problem. We evaluate several approximate inference algorithms (e.g., [14] , [17] ) for coarse-grained abstractions [12], [16] of biological pathways. Using the Chow-Liu tree approximation, we develop a new inference algorithm which is very accurate according to the experiments we report, for a minimal computation overhead.

PASA: Identifying More Credible Structural Variants of Hedou12,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092749753&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2934463&partnerID=40&md5=9d2749bca253af465a3c573d1b483e64,"Although plenty of structural variant detecting approaches for human genomes can be looked up in the literatures, little has been acknowledged on the effectiveness of those structural variant softwares for plant genomes. Moreover, it has been demonstrated frequent occurrences for those structural variant detecting softwares to find too many false structural variants. In this paper, we devote to detect deletions, insertions, and inversions, in total of three kinds of structural variants occurring in Hedou12 genome in contrast to Williams82 genome. To find more potential structural variants, we try to develop new principles to detect discordant and split read map sets supporting structural variants. Aiming to enhance the precision of structural variant detections, we propose two new sequencing characteristic based probability models, which use the sequencing parameters of Hedou12 genome as well as the parameters for Hedou12 paired-end reads to be aligned onto Williams82, to evaluate the probability for a potential structural variant to occur in. To remove the false members from those potential structural variants, we propose a set cover problem model to describe formally on which potential structural variants it should accept to achieve as high as possible a probability summation. This will achieve a solution with more credible structural variants, which can be verified by comparing with DELLY version 0.5.8 and LUMPY version 0.2.2.3. Our algorithm has been verified to be able to find deletions, insertions, and inversions in Hedou12 in contrast to Williams82 DELLY as well as LUMPY fails to find.",,"Algorithms; Gene Deletion; Genome, Plant; Genomic Structural Variation; Genomics; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Inversion; Software; Soybeans; algorithm; chromosome inversion; DNA sequence; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; plant genome; procedures; software; soybean"
A Novel Approach to Detecting Epistasis using Random Sampling Regularisation,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092750342&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2948330&partnerID=40&md5=0471a1d3d75d98bffab6d1d3a4ad671e,"Epistasis is a progressive approach that complements the 'common disease, common variant' hypothesis that highlights the potential for connected networks of genetic variants collaborating to produce a phenotypic expression. Epistasis is commonly performed as a pairwise or limitless-arity capacity that considers variant networks as either variant vs variant or as high order interactions. This type of analysis extends the number of tests that were previously performed in a standard approach such as Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), in which False Discovery Rate (FDR) is already an issue, therefore by multiplying the number of tests up to a factorial rate also increases the issue of FDR. Further to this, epistasis introduces its own limitations of computational complexity and intensity that are generated based on the analysis performed; to consider the most intense approach, a multivariate analysis introduces a time complexity of O(n!). Proposed in this paper is a novel methodology for the detection of epistasis using interpretable methods and best practice to outline interactions through filtering processes. Using a process of Random Sampling Regularisation which randomly splits and produces sample sets to conduct a voting system to regularise the significance and reliability of biological markers, SNPs. Preliminary results are promising, outlining a concise detection of interactions.

A Novel Edge Effect Detection Method for Real-Time Cellular Analyzer Using Functional Principal Component Analysis,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092684729&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2903094&partnerID=40&md5=941146de6fea91861b7f6741d6e57b8b,"Real-time cellular analyzer (RTCA) has been generally applied to test the cytotoxicity of chemicals. However, several factors impact the experimental quality. A non-negligible factor is the abnormal time-dependent cellular response curves (TCRCs) of the wells located at the edge of the E-plate which is defined as edge effect. In this paper, a novel statistical analysis is proposed to detect the edge effect. First, TCRCs are considered as observations of a random variable in a functional space. Then, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is adopted to extract the principal component (PC) functions of the TCRCs, and the first and second PCs of these curves are selected to distinguish abnormal TCRCs. The average TCRC of the inner wells with the same culture environment is set as the standard. If the distance between the scoring point of the standard curve and one designated scoring point exceeds the defined threshold, the corresponding TCRC of the designated point should be removed automatically. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This method can be used as a standard method to resolve general time-dependent series issues.",,"Algorithms; Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; Cytological Techniques; Humans; Principal Component Analysis; Time Factors; Toxicity Tests; algorithm; biology; cytology; human; principal component analysis; procedures; time factor; toxicity testing; tumor cell line"
Predicting DNA Methylation States with Hybrid Information Based Deep-Learning Model,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092750292&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2909237&partnerID=40&md5=027d86f45b06d1b82e9583c957586343,"DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of some biological processes. Up to now, with the development of machine learning models, there are several sequence-based deep learning models designed to predict DNA methylation states, which gain better performance than traditional methods like random forest and SVM. However, convolutional network based deep learning models that use one-hot encoding DNA sequence as input may discover limited information and cause unsatisfactory prediction performance, so more data and model structures of diverse angles should be considered. In this work, we proposed a hybrid sequence-based deep learning model with both MeDIP-seq data and Histone information to predict DNA methylated CpG states (MHCpG). We combined both MeDIP-seq data and histone modification data with sequence information and implemented convolutional network to discover sequence patterns. In addition, we used statistical data gained from previous three input data and adopted a 3-layer feedforward neuron network to extract more high-level features. We compared our method with traditional predicting methods using random forest and other previous methods like CpGenie and DeepCpG, the result showed that MHCpG exceeded the other approaches and gained more satisfactory performance.",,"Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; Deep Learning; DNA; DNA Methylation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Histone Code; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; DNA; biology; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; histone code; human; procedures; tumor cell line"

The problem consists of a set of independent jobs with distinct processing times, weights, and due dates to be scheduled on a single machine. The goal of the problem is to minimize the total weighted tardiness. Several swarm intelligence (SI) motivated techniques have been proposed to solve SMTWTP. Still, the solution for large scale SMTWTP instances within a reasonable amount of time is a challenging task. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the efficient SI based techniques to solve real world optimization problems. This article presents an effective amended ABC based strategy to solve SMTWTP. A local search (LS) approach, influenced from the lunar cycle is proposed and hybridized with ABC to escalate the exploitation capacity of the algorithm. The proposed LS approach is titled as the lunar inspired LS (LLS) approach and the proposed hybridized strategy is known as lunar inspired ABC (LuABC) algorithm. The proposed LuABC algorithm has been applied on 25 large SMTWTP instances of job size 1000.

A Network-Based Comparison Between Molecular Apocrine Breast Cancer Tumor and Basal and Luminal Tumors by Joint Graphical Lasso,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092749959&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2911074&partnerID=40&md5=ed775146c55552f088191ab26f4a96c0,"Joint graphical lasso (JGL) approach is a Gaussian graphical model to estimate multiple graphical models corresponding to distinct but related groups. Molecular apocrine (MA) breast cancer tumor has similar characteristics to luminal and basal subtypes. Due to the relationship between MA tumor and two other subtypes, this paper investigates the similarities and differences between the MA genes association network and the ones corresponding to other tumors by taking advantageous of JGL properties. Two distinct JGL graphical models are applied to two sub-datasets including the gene expression information of the MA and the luminal tumors and also the MA and the basal tumors. Then, topological comparisons between the networks such as finding the shared edges are applied. In addition, several support vector machine (SVM) classification models are performed to assess the discriminating power of some critical nodes in the networks, like hub nodes, to discriminate the tumors sample. Applying the JGL approach prepares an appropriate tool to observe the networks of the MA tumor and other subtypes in one map.

To improve the prediction accuracy, we propose a new unsupervised descriptor for protein sequences, which is based on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network model combined with a sequence-compression method called byte-pair encoding (BPE). Our results demonstrate that BPE can encode a protein sequence into a sequence of shorter length, thereby enabling efficient training of the seq2seq model. Furthermore, we implement a basic predictor using the proposed descriptor, and our experimental results demonstrate that the predictor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in tests for proteins that are not included in the training data.",,"Amino Acid Sequence; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Point Mutation; Protein Stability; Proteins; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Unsupervised Machine Learning; protein; amino acid sequence; biology; chemistry; genetic database; genetics; human; point mutation; procedures; protein stability; sequence analysis; unsupervised machine learning"
The Use of Informed Priors in Biclustering of Gene Expression with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092685994&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2901676&partnerID=40&md5=6b13d88d4c6a100f330d6f1f252ca9b0,"We motivate and describe the application of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) models to the ""soft"" biclustering of gene expression data, in which we obtain modules (biclusters) where the affiliation of genes and samples with the modules are weighted, instead of being hard memberships. As a distinct contribution, we propose a method which HDP is informed with prior beliefs, significantly increasing the quality of the biclustering in terms of both the correctness of the number of modules inferred, and the precision of these modules, especially when evidence is sparse. We outline two such informed priors; one based on co-expression relationships inherent in the data, the other based on an externally provided regulatory network. We validate these results and compare the performance of our approach to Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), another model that features weighted modules. We have, to this end, performed experiments on semi-synthetic data. The results show that HDP, with the addition of a well-informed prior, is able to capture the correct number of modules with increased accuracy. Furthermore, the model becomes robust to changes in the strength of the prior.

Variable Neighborhood Search for Partitioning Sparse Biological Networks into the Maximum Edge-Weighted k-Plexes,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085999468&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2898189&partnerID=40&md5=eecaefd60bc018833aae2d0f88d06b67,"In a network, a k-plex represents a subset of n vertices where the degree of each vertex in the subnetwork induced by this subset is at least n-k. The maximum edge-weight k-plex partitioning problem is to find the k-plex partitioning in edge-weighted network, such that the sum of edge weights is maximal. The Max-EkPP has an important role in discovering new information in large biological networks. We propose a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for solving Max-EkPP. The VNS implements a local search based on the 1-swap first improvement strategy and the objective function that takes into account the degree of every vertex in each partition. The objective function favors feasible solutions and enables a gradual increase of the function's value, when moving from slightly infeasible to barely feasible solutions. Experimental computation is performed on real metabolic networks and other benchmark instances from the literature. Comparing to the previously proposed integer linear programming (ILP), VNS succeeds to find all known optimal solutions. For all other instances, the VNS either reaches previous best known solution or improves it. The proposed VNS is also tested on a large-scale dataset not considered up to now.",,"Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Factual; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Programming, Linear; algorithm; biological model; biology; factual database; metabolism; procedures; system analysis"
Causal Disturbance Analysis: A Novel Graph Centrality Based Method for Pathway Enrichment Analysis,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087590880&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2907246&partnerID=40&md5=a761e7b6a4efae9deda4ba5af90a8dce,"Pathway enrichment analysis models (PEM) are the premier methods for interpreting gene expression profiles from high-throughput experiments. PEM often use a priori background knowledge to infer the underlying biological functions and mechanisms. A shortcoming of standard PEM is their disregarding of interactions for simplicity, which potentially results in partial and inaccurate inference. In this study, we introduce a graph-based PEM, namely Causal Disturbance Analysis (CADIA), that leverages gene interactions to quantify the topological importance of genes' expression profiles in pathways organizations. In particular, CADIA uses a novel graph centrality model, namely Source/Sink, to measure the topological importance. Source/Sink Centrality quantifies a gene's importance as a receiver and a sender of biological information, which allows for prioritizing the genes that are more likely to disturb a pathways functionality. CADIA infers an enrichment score for a pathway by deriving statistical evidence from Source/Sink centrality of the differentially expressed genes and combines it with classical over-representation analysis. Through real-world experimental and synthetic data evaluations, we show that CADIA can uniquely infer critical pathway enrichments that are not observable through other PEM. Our results indicate that CADIA is sensitive towards topologically central gene-level changes that and provides an informative framework for interpreting high-throughput data.",,Algorithms; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Protein Interaction Maps; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; transcriptome; algorithm; biology; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetics; human; procedures; protein analysis; signal transduction

Such technological advances enable researchers to uncover the functionally distinct cell subtypes such as hematopoietic stem cell subpopulation identification. However, most of the related algorithms have been hindered by the high-dimensionality and sparse nature of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. To address those problems, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary clustering based on adaptive non-negative matrix factorization (MCANMF) for multiobjective single-cell RNA-seq data clustering. First, adaptive non-negative matrix factorization is proposed to decompose data for feature extraction. After that, a multiobjective clustering algorithm based on learning vector quantization is proposed to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data. To validate the effectiveness of MCANMF, we benchmark MCANMF against 15 state-of-the-art methods including seven feature extraction methods, seven clustering methods, and the kernel-based similarity learning method on six published single-cell RNA sequencing datasets comprehensively. When compared with those 15 state-of-the-art methods, MCANMF performs better than the others on those single-cell RNA sequencing datasets according to multiple evaluation metrics.

BRWMDA:Predicting Microbe-Disease Associations Based on Similarities and Bi-Random Walk on Disease and Microbe Networks,2020,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077132802&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2019.2907626&partnerID=40&md5=b1b8ae551d6883c106cad7d0061f0e51,"Many current studies have evidenced that microbes play important roles in human diseases. Therefore, discovering the associations between microbes and diseases is beneficial to systematically understanding the mechanisms of diseases, diagnosing, and treating complex diseases. It is well known that finding new potential microbe-disease associations via biological experiments is a time-consuming and expensive process. However, the computation methods can provide an opportunity to effectively predict microbe-disease associations. In recent years, efforts toward predicting microbe-disease associations are not in proportional to the importance of microbes to human diseases. In this study, we develop a method (called BRWMDA) to predict new microbe-disease associations based on similarity and improving bi-random walk on the disease and microbe networks. BRWMDA integrates microbe network, disease network, and known microbe-disease associations into a single network. After calculating the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity of microbes based on known microbe-disease associations, the microbe network is obtained by adjusting the similarity with the logistics function. In addition, the disease network is computed by the similarity network fusion (SNF) method with the symptom-based similarity and the GIP kernel similarity based on known microbe-disease associations. Then, these two networks of microbe and disease are connected by known microbe-disease associations. Based on the assumption that similar microbes are normally associated with similar diseases and vice versa, BRWMDA is employed to predict new potential microbe-disease associations via random walk with different steps on microbe and disease networks, which reasonably uses the similarity of microbe network and disease network. The 5-fold cross validation and Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) are adopted to assess the prediction performance of our BRWMDA algorithm, as well as other competing methods for comparison. 5-fold cross validation experiments show that BRWMDA obtained the maximum AUC value of 0.9087, which is again superior to other methods of 0.9025(NGRHMDA), 0.8797 (LRLSHMDA), 0.8571 (KATZHMDA), 0.7782 (HGBI), and 0.5629 (NBI). In addition, BRWMDA also outperforms other methods in terms of LOOCV, whose AUC value is 0.9397, which is superior to other methods of 0.9111(NGRHMDA), 0.8909 (LRLSHMDA), 0.8644 (KATZHMDA), 0.7866 (HGBI), and 0.5553 (NBI). Case studies also illustrate that BRWMDA is an effective method to predict microbe-disease associations.",,Algorithms; Computational Biology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Infections; Microbial Consortia; Microbiota; algorithm; biology; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; microbial consortium; microbiology; microflora; procedures

We firstly propose a series of rules for the mapping from VCF and OWL files to JSON files, and then present rule-based algorithms for transforming VCF-based genetic variants and OWL-based biological ontologies into JSON objects. On this basis, we introduce effective approaches of integrating the mapped JSON files in MongoDB. Finally, we complement this work with a set of experiments to show the performance of our proposed approaches.

Gene Regulatory Network Inference from Perturbed Time-Series Expression Data via Ordered Dynamical Expansion of Non-Steady State Actors,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060370269&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2509992&partnerID=40&md5=9f5a9a7ac758d04121eb541bc0aa5948,"The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has been the subject of intense research activity. A variety of models and methods have been developed to address different aspects of this important problem. However, these techniques are narrowly focused on particular biological and experimental platforms, and require experimental data that are typically unavailable and difficult to ascertain. The more recent availability of higher-throughput sequencing platforms, combined with more precise modes of genetic perturbation, presents an opportunity to formulate more robust and comprehensive approaches to gene network inference. Here, we propose a step-wise framework for identifying gene-gene regulatory interactions that expand from a known point of genetic or chemical perturbation using time series gene expression data. This novel approach sequentially identifies non-steady state genes post-perturbation and incorporates them into a growing series of low-complexity optimization problems. The governing ordinary differential equations of this model are rooted in the biophysics of stochastic molecular events that underlie gene regulation, delineating roles for both protein and RNA-mediated gene regulation. We show the successful application of our core algorithms for network inference using simulated and real datasets.",,"Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Systems Biology; Time Factors; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetics; procedures; sequence analysis; systems biology; time factor"
Discovering Gene Regulatory Elements Using Coverage-Based Heuristics,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060388240&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2496261&partnerID=40&md5=8eff445764983df50e7e98f67c04cfc7,"Data mining algorithms and sequencing methods (such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) are being combined to discover genomic regulatory motifs that relate to a variety of phenotypes. However, motif discovery algorithms often produce very long lists of putative transcription factor binding sites, hindering the discovery of phenotype-related regulatory elements by making it difficult to select a manageable set of candidate motifs for experimental validation. To address this issue, the authors introduce the motif selection problem and provide coverage-based search heuristics for its solution. Analysis of 203 ChIP-seq experiments from the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements project shows that our algorithms produce motifs that have high sensitivity and specificity and reveals new insights about the regulatory code of the human genome. The greedy algorithm performs the best, selecting a median of two motifs per ChIP-seq transcription factor group while achieving a median sensitivity of 77 percent.",,"Algorithms; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Computational Biology; Computer Heuristics; Disease; Humans; Nucleotide Motifs; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Sequence Analysis, DNA; algorithm; biology; chromatin immunoprecipitation; computer heuristics; diseases; DNA sequence; genetics; human; nucleotide motif; procedures; regulatory sequence"
REPA: Applying Pathway Analysis to Genome-Wide Transcription Factor Binding Data,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060389822&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2453948&partnerID=40&md5=63463a94cb0d457ada1cd88fcbdc2cee,"Pathway analysis has been extensively applied to aid in the interpretation of the results of genome-wide transcription profiling studies, and has been shown to successfully find associations between the biological phenomena under study and biological pathways. There are two widely used approaches of pathway analysis: over-representation analysis, and gene set analysis. Recently genome-wide transcription factor binding data has become widely available allowing for the application of pathway analysis to this type of data. In this work, we developed regulatory enrichment pathway analysis (REPA) to apply gene set analysis to genome-wide transcription factor binding data to infer associations between transcription factors and biological pathways. We used the transcription factor binding data generated by the ENCODE project, and gene sets from the Molecular Signatures and KEGG databases. Our results showed that 54 percent of the predictions examined have literature support and that REPA's recall is roughly 54 percent. This level of precision is promising as several of REPA's predictions are expected to be novel and can be used to guide new research avenues. In addition, the results of our case studies showed that REPA enhances the interpretation of genome-wide transcription profiling studies by suggesting putative regulators behind the observed transcriptional responses.",,Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Protein Binding; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; protein binding; transcription factor; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; human; metabolism; physiology; procedures; signal transduction
PyMut: A Web Tool for Overlapping Gene Loss-of-Function Mutation Design,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060385389&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2505290&partnerID=40&md5=193f6f6e1077dfe17a2f3c9a031e5d31,"Loss-of-function study is an effective approach to research gene functions. However, currently most of such studies have ignored an important problem (in this paper, we call it ""off-target"" problem), that is, if the target gene is an overlapping gene (A gene whose expressible nucleotides overlaps with that of another one), loss-of-function mutation by deleting the complete open reading frame (ORF) may also cause the gene it overlaps lose function, resulting a phenotype which may be rather different from that of single gene deletion. Therefore, when doing such studies, the loss-of-function mutations should be carefully designed to guarantee only the function of the target gene will be abolished. In this paper, we present PyMut, an easy-to-use web tool for biologists to design such mutations. To the best of our knowledge, PyMut is the first tool that aims to solve the ""off-target"" problem regarding the overlapping genes.

Nucleosome Positioning of Intronless Genes in the Human Genome,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032613578&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2476811&partnerID=40&md5=9033d8052ac44180b9b52415d257f1bc,"Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, are involved in transcription regulation and DNA replication. Intronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function. Our analysis reveals that nucleosome positioning shows a distinct pattern in intronless and intron-containing genes. The nucleosome occupancy upstream of transcription start sites of intronless genes is lower than that of intron-containing genes. In contrast, high occupancy and well positioned nucleosomes are observed along the gene body of intronless genes, which is perfectly consistent with the barrier nucleosome model. Intronless genes have a significantly lower expression level than intron-containing genes and most of them are not expressed in CD4+ T cell lines and GM12878 cell lines, which results from their tissue specificity. However, the highly expressed genes are at the same expression level between the two types of genes. The highly expressed intronless genes require a higher density of RNA Pol II in an elongating state to compensate for the lack of introns. Additionally, 5' and 3' nucleosome depleted regions of highly expressed intronless genes are deeper than those of highly expressed intron-containing genes.",,"CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Introns; Nucleosomes; chemistry; CpG island; DNA methylation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; genomics; human; human genome; intron; nucleosome"
Encoding Data Using Biological Principles: The Multisample Variant Format for Phylogenomics and Population Genomics,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050729829&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2509997&partnerID=40&md5=29bf74eab78dcb685566123bcb33f4dd,"Rapid progress in the fields of phylogenomics and population genomics has driven increases in both the size of multi-genomic datasets and the number and complexity of genome-wide analyses. We present the Multisample Variant Format, specifically designed to store multiple sequence alignments for phylogenomics and population genomic analysis. The signature feature of MVF is a distinctive encoding of aligned sites with specific biological information content (e.g., invariant, low-coverage). This biological pattern-based encoding of sequence data allows for rapid filtering and quality control of data and speeds up computation for many analyses. Similar to other modern formats, MVF has a simple data structure and flexible header structure to accommodate project metadata, allowing to also serve as an effective data publication and sharing format. We also propose several variants of the MVF format to accommodate protein and codon alignments, quality scores, and a mix of de novo and reference-aligned data. Using the MVFtools package, MVF files can be converted from other common sequence formats. MVFtools completes tasks ranging from simple transformation and filtering operations to complex genome-wide visualizations in only a few minutes, even on large datasets. In addition to presentation of MVF and MVFtools, we also discuss the application both in MVF and other existing data formats of the broader concept of using biological principles and patterns to inform sequence data encoding.",,"Animals; Databases, Genetic; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Plants; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; animal; DNA sequence; genetic database; genetics; metagenomics; phylogeny; plant; procedures; sequence alignment; software"
IAS: Interaction Specific GO Term Associations for Predicting Protein-Protein Interaction Networks,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032613197&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2476809&partnerID=40&md5=d3bab022638c907c1ab739d24c94a2a7,"Proteins carry out their function in a cell through interactions with other proteins. A large scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of an organism provides static yet an essential structure of interactions, which is valuable clue for understanding the functions of proteins and pathways. PPIs are determined primarily by experimental methods; however, computational PPI prediction methods can supplement or verify PPIs identified by experiment. Here, we developed a novel scoring method for predicting PPIs from Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of proteins. Unlike existing methods that consider functional similarity as an indication of interaction between proteins, the new score, named the protein-protein Interaction Association Score (IAS), was computed from GO term associations of known interacting protein pairs in 49 organisms. IAS was evaluated on PPI data of six organisms and found to outperform existing GO term-based scoring methods. Moreover, consensus scoring methods that combine different scores further improved performance of PPI prediction.",,Animals; Fungi; Gene Ontology; Humans; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Proteins; Systems Biology; protein; animal; fungus; gene ontology; genetics; human; metabolism; physiology; plant; procedures; protein analysis; systems biology
A Framework for Identifying Genotypic Information from Clinical Records: Exploiting Integrated Ontology Structures to Transfer Annotations between ICD Codes and Gene Ontologies,2018,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032613229&doi=10.1109%2fTCBB.2015.2480056&partnerID=40&md5=cb50100f2687887b2e6353984f779ddf,"Although some methods are proposed for automatic ontology generation, none of them address the issue of integrating large-scale heterogeneous biomedical ontologies. We propose a novel approach for integrating various types of ontologies efficiently and apply it to integrate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9CM), and Gene Ontologies. This approach is one of the early attempts to quantify the associations among clinical terms (e.g., ICD9 codes) based on their corresponding genomic relationships. We reconstructed a merged tree for a partial set of GO and ICD9 codes and measured the performance of this tree in terms of associations' relevance by comparing them with two well-known disease-gene datasets (i.e., MalaCards and Disease Ontology). Furthermore, we compared the genomic-based ICD9 associations to temporal relationships between them from electronic health records. Our analysis shows promising associations supported by both comparisons suggesting a high reliability. We also manually analyzed several significant associations and found promising support from literature.",,"Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Electronic Health Records; Gene Ontology; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; biology; data mining; electronic health record; gene ontology; genetic database; genotyping technique; human; International Classification of Diseases; procedures"

These spectra came from seven human and six mouse tissues, five of which are the same between the two organisms: liver, kidney, lung, heart, and brain. Overall, we detected 4 percent of all exon-skipping events found in RNA-seq data, regardless of their effect on reading frame. The fraction of alternative isoforms detected did not differ between out-of-frame and in-frame events. Moreover, the fraction of identified alternative exon-exon junctions and constitutive junctions were similar. Together, our results suggest that both in-frame and out-of-frame translation may be actively used to regulate protein activity or localization.",,Alternative Splicing; Animals; Exons; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Protein Isoforms; Proteomics; Reading Frames; isoprotein; alternative RNA splicing; animal; exon; genetics; human; mass spectrometry; mouse; procedures; proteomics; reading frame

The ability to efficiently and confidently identify mixture spectra is essential to alleviate the existent bottleneck of low mass spectra identification rate. However, most of the traditional computational methods are not suitable for interpreting mixture spectra, because they still take the assumption that the acquired spectra come from the fragmentation of a single precursor. In this manuscript, we formulate the mixture spectra de novo sequencing problem mathematically, and propose a dynamic programming algorithm for the problem. Additionally, we use both simulated and real mixture spectra data sets to verify the merits of the proposed algorithm.",,"Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Databases, Protein; Mass Spectrometry; Peptides; Proteomics; Sequence Analysis, Protein; peptide; algorithm; amino acid sequence; chemistry; mass spectrometry; procedures; protein database; proteomics; sequence analysis"

"Does culture matter? Corporate reputation and sustainable satisfaction in the Chinese and German banking sector","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175839613&doi=10.1057%2fs41270-023-00259-x&partnerID=40&md5=18e5f009af58aacc4797d501013fd1ac","Corporate reputation is important for all types of banks across the world, despite these countries differing culturally. Building on an extended corporate reputation model, we identify the key drivers of customer-based reputation and sustainable customer satisfaction in two culturally different countries, namely China and Germany. We also consider two reputation dimensions—perceived competence and likeability—and their effects on the target construct. Empirical data from 625 German and 734 Chinese commercial bank customers allow us to estimate the corporate reputation model with the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method, and by substantiating the relationships by means of a necessary condition analysis (NCA) and a predictive power analysis. By comparing the two countries’ results, we identify their cultural differences. Overall, we confirm the model’s relevance for the two cultures, finding that banks’ perceived attractiveness is the most important driver of both cultures’ customer-perceived bank reputation. By means of an importance-performance map analysis, we identify a large overlap between the two cultures’ set of important constructs, likeability’s much greater importance in Germany, and the perceived quality construct’s relevance in both countries. We contribute to research and scientific knowledge about corporate reputation models by identifying the similarities in and differences between two countries’ markets with respect to the banking sector, all of which have implications for international banks’ management. © The Author(s) 2023.","Commercial banks; Customer-perceived reputation; PLS-SEM; Sustainable satisfaction",""
"Social relationships as strategic variable in the sharing economy: an empirical analysis of accommodation-sharing market","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190804731&doi=10.1057%2fs41270-024-00299-x&partnerID=40&md5=bf85ae58709a879e05c67aaefd37dbdb","Accommodation services are perceived by consumers as possessing a greater purchase risk compared to goods, especially in first-purchase situations and during international travel. To mitigate this risk, consumer prospects look for cues that indicate the quality of service they can expect. This research investigates the role of social relationships in consumer purchase decision-making within rapidly growing accommodation sector of the sharing economy. Utilizing Airbnb’s social connection feature, consumers can see how they are socially connected with Airbnb hosts worldwide. We employ a censored proportional hazard model on a sample of 4,316 consumer prospects who have used social connection feature at least once. Additionally, we re-estimate the model using a propensity score matched sample of 8,632 consumers. The study reveals a positive association between the use of social connection feature and the hazard rate. Specifically, findings indicate that the using social connection feature for searching for accommodation reduces the time to make a first purchase. The article discusses the managerial implications of these findings. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bayesian models; Information search; Perceived risk; Sharing economy; Social relationships",""
"I will buy virtual goods if I like them: a hybrid PLS-SEM-artificial neural network (ANN) analytical approach","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170388258&doi=10.1057%2fs41270-023-00252-4&partnerID=40&md5=5ce1dc0d61ece5f69d159e15b92ecae9","Despite the popularity of Free-to-Play (F2P) games in recent years, the motivations behind players’ intention to purchase virtual goods in F2P games still require further investigations. This study aims to address this dilemma by investigating the antecedents of functional, emotional, and social values in shaping the purchase intention of virtual goods in F2P games. Using purposive sampling, data were collected through a survey from 352 F2P game participants in the United States. A hybrid PLS-SEM-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling approach was employed to examine the impact of these factors on the intention to purchase virtual goods. The results reveal that perceived value positively influences the purchase intention of virtual goods. The findings also show that functional, emotional, and social values significantly impact the perceived value and purchase intention of virtual goods. Further, perceived value mediates the relationship between quality, achievement, enjoyment, aesthetics, customization, self-presentation, and the intention to purchase virtual goods. The ANN results reveal that quality and social presence are the most critical factors since they achieve the greatest normalized importance ratio compared to the others. The model illustrated considerable explanatory evidence for purchase intention in the context of F2P games. Additionally, this research significantly strengthens the marketing literature by developing an understanding of the intention to buy virtual goods in F2P games. The proposed model can provide insights for F2P game providers to design their games and marketing strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Consumption value theory; F2P games; Perceived value; PLS-SEM; Purchase intention; Virtual goods",""

Several solutions have been tried including survey design, incentivizing respondents, esthetically enhancing surveys, infusing secondary data and shortening the scales; however, these actions create their own problems that further impact the quality of data. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of a modified version of a commonly used method in medical research, Randomized, Multicenter, Parallel-Arm Research Design. This methodology is proposed as a solution to lengthy surveys in social science research for specific types of applications. Using a typology research example, a survey with 1020+ items was divided (into three parallel arms) using this methodology, given to different respondents (randomly across multiple centers), later recombined and analyzed.

An online survey with 308 adult social media subjects was conducted. PROCESS Models (Models 0 and 1) were used to test the main and moderating effects. Further, to provide readers with more insight into the examined moderating effects, Pick-a-Point and the Johnson–Neyman techniques were used to probe the interaction terms. The study results show that customers are willing to boycott socially irresponsible companies in times of crisis, such as after a devastating earthquake. Interestingly, customers’ boycott intention against corporate social irresponsibility is accentuated by companies’ impression management tactics, customer income, and residency. Further, the results indicate that the positive impact of company social irresponsibility on customer boycott intention is significant only for customers high on altruistic values. The results allow us to suggest several theoretical and managerial implications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Company social irresponsibility; Customer altruistic values; Customer boycott intention; Organizational impression management tactics",""

Considering that companies are encouraged to have a social role through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the implementation of DC could contribute to the advancement of the European DC discourse through internal strategies that are aligned with the communicated CSR-based external image. Thus, the present study aims at understanding employees-sportspersons’ perceptions and their potential contributions to the value of the brand they work for. Starting from a knowledge base of 22 in-depth interviews administered to a sample of athletes and coaches from eight different European countries, a content analysis has been conducted using the hermeneutic approach and qualitative datamining through a CAQDAS tool (T-Lab). Results show that employee-sportspersons possess specific capabilities, such as time management and teamworking, which could significantly contribute to the brand value. However, these capabilities are not sufficiently recognized by the employer brand, showing a misalignment between the promised brand social commitments and the actual delivery of such promises, thereby undermining the authenticity of the brand’s social-driven aims and the overall authenticity of the brand’s CSR-based commitments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Authenticity; Brand alignment; CSR; Dual career; Marketing; Sport analytics",""

An online questionnaire-based survey administered to a pan-Canadian sample of 1000 respondents reveals that from an aggregate perspective, perceived situational factors positively and directly impact environmental attitudes and plastic packaging waste recycling. Because environmental attitude is also positively related to plastic recycling, environmental attitudes partially mediate the link between perceived situational factors and plastic recycling. From a piecemeal perspective, the perception of a higher degree of inexpensiveness, fastness, and effortlessness directly affects environmental attitudes and plastic packaging waste recycling. Hence, environmental attitude partially mediates the effect of consumers' perceived situational factors and explains their impact on plastic packaging waste recycling. © The Author(s) 2024.","Circular economy; Environmental attitude; Plastic packaging waste; recycling; Situational factors; Survey",""

The quantitative study uses a questionnaire survey to collect data from 279 TV streaming service subscribers, which is analysed with the PLS-SEM methodology. Results show that the hedonic dimensions of perceived customer value have a significant positive effect on brand love, while the more utilitarian dimensions lack a significant effect. Furthermore, brand love plays a significant role in building brand experience, but not for switching intention. Moreover, for millennial consumers, brand love has a significantly higher impact on switching intention than for Generation Z consumers. This study contributes by testing the dimensions of the perceived customer value model in building brand love in the streaming TV context.

This study examines how the effectiveness of different marketing actions changes in the passenger car industry by considering brand-based data during economic contraction, which most countries experience, especially during and after the COVID-19 era. Different marketing activities’ effectiveness means examining each action’s impact on performance. Performance is measured by sales volume and market share through quarterly data between 2010 and 2018, while advertising, pricing, and distribution are considered marketing actions in this study. The model is estimated using the fixed effect panel estimated generalized least square. The results support that price competitiveness and investing in advertising, including social media during recessions, are two critical factors enhancing performance through sales volume in the car segment covered in the study. In addition, distribution intensity positively influences the sales volume of each car brand and model, while this effect does not change during the recession. In the case of performance measurement through market share, the total impact of advertising expense on performance during a downturn is found to be zero in contrast to the sales volume-based analysis. The price-related result is found to be in a similar direction, while distribution hurts performance during economic contraction. Unlike most studies in the literature, the study offers the opportunity to discuss the impact of economic contradiction, both in an understudied industry and in a sub-sector/segment where competition and sales are intense. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Business performance; E70; Economic contractions; M21; M31; M37; Marketing activities; Passenger car industry; Quarterly data",""

We also specify random coefficient versions of both the non-sparse and the sparse model. The fact that the random coefficient models lead to better values of the Bayesian information criterion demonstrates the importance of latent heterogeneity. The random coefficients sparse model attains the best statistical performance if we consider model complexity and offers a better interpretability. We investigate the cross-purchase effects of household segments derived from this random coefficient model. As additional interpretation aid we cluster categories and category pairs by integer programming. We demonstrate what the best performing sparse model implies for cross-selling by product recommendations and store layout.

However in recent years, there is evidence to suggest that brand commitment in Japan is decreasing. In this study, we collected data from consumers in 2018 and again in 2023 using the same instrument to ascertain the change in brand commitment as a predecessor of consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and habit and ultimately their impacts on continuance behavior in using mobile wallet applications. We did not find the relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention to be significant in the 2023 model, unlike earlier. The results of this 5-year study comparison revealed that brand commitment was found to be a predecessor construct to both Japanese consumer satisfaction and habit across the years.

The aim is to identify factors predicting CLV and assess their associations with CLV. Given the nested structure of the data, where transactions by customers are clustered within e-shops, a multilevel model is employed as the analytical framework. While classical linear regression assumes independence of observations within a sample, our dataset operates across three hierarchical levels: transaction level (I), customer level (II), and e-shop level (III). This hierarchical structure challenges the validity of inferences drawn from linear regression models, as transactions by one customer are not independent, and customers within a single e-shop may exhibit interdependencies. Therefore, a multilevel model is utilised to appropriately address the dependence among transactions within this nested data structure. The analysis reveals that the “number of transactions” exhibits the strongest positive association with CLV, followed by “days to transaction” and “session duration”. Furthermore, we discovered that “direct access” exhibits a positive association with CLV compared to access through Google campaigns, whereas access through Facebook campaigns demonstrates a negative association with CLV when compared to Google campaigns. Additionally, using the e-shop on mobile and landing on the product details page both show negative associations with CLV compared to desktop usage and landing on the e-shop’s home page, respectively. Our research identifies several variables that are associated with CLV in e-shops. This enables e-shop managers to effectively target and engage customers through marketing activities, thereby maximising revenues, financial performance, and customer CLV. © The Author(s) 2024.","Customer lifetime value; Customer targeting; E-shop; Loyalty; Multilevel models",""

In the marketing literature, however, it is generally accepted that the perceived value of products from store brands is significantly lower than products from manufacturer brands. This study investigates whether the same difference exists among consumers on a multi-sided platform. The study finds that consumers perceive products sold by the platform as delivering significantly less value than substitutes from third-party brands, and that this difference persists independently of price. The implications of the findings for managers and marketers are that (i) first-party content strategies on MSPs are limited by consumers’ value perceptions. This implies that (ii) managers should calibrate their first-party content strategies according to target customers’ preferences and that (iii) in their analytics, marketers should distinguish between first- and third-party content. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Consumer perceptions; Entry strategies; First-party content; Multi-sided platforms; Network effects",""

The volume of data poses challenges for humans; however, using automated content analysis techniques frees the researcher to focus on the distilled data. Even though multiple forms of text analysis techniques have been discussed in prior marketing literature, few articles simplify the techniques enough to allow for easy adoption by readers. This article discusses three text analysis techniques and then applies these techniques to a dataset of 1287 newspaper articles following the major demonetization announcement in India. It provides an interesting insight into the life of the Indian citizen faced with a government-mandated drive that demonetized 86% of the currency, endangering everyday retail transactions in a cash-dominated economy. Interesting insights emerging from simple techniques such as comparative word frequencies and sentiment analysis are presented which highlight the coping techniques used by the people to continue retail transactions. The initial desperation led to attempts to use the demonetized currency notes by splurging on gold, liquor, and fuel. Once the awareness about the absence of valid currency seeped in, people focused on more thought-out attempts to sustain normal retail transactions. Further, topic modeling was applied to discover the underlying topics in the data corpus, which further revealed the repertoire of coping strategies used by the people. A topic that stood out in the analysis was related to retail-focused mobile payment services, which subsequently found large-scale acceptance in the economy.

While it makes sense for a new entrant to take into account an incumbent’s behavior to inform its entry decisions, it would be risky to base such a decision solely on that information. In particular, the potential entrant may also want to conduct its own market research. Naturally, the market research should account for incumbent behavior. Yet, little is known about how a second mover decides where it should conduct market research. Is the information gained from observing the incumbent a substitute or a complement to market research? The information a second mover gathers through observation includes the incumbent’s choice of market. Even more important is the signal generated by an incumbent’s decision to exit or stay in a market. This decision signals to a second mover whether a market is viable, at least for one firm. A second mover that considers entry between an existing market (with an operating incumbent) and a new market (that has no incumbents) chooses between different types of uncertainty. Our paper addresses how this uncertainty affects the second mover’s market research decision. Should a second mover do market research in the competitor’s backyard or should it boldly go where no firm has gone before and research a new market? How is this decision affected by factors such as expected demand conditions and competition? Intuition suggests that information about a virgin market is always more valuable because the first mover already provides information about the existing market. Our research shows that this intuition is not always correct. It is correct when market research generates perfect information. However, market research is rarely perfect. When market research provides estimates subject to an error, a second mover may gain by conducting market research in a market with an existing competitor. Here, the complementarity of the competitor’s performance coupled with market research amplifies the value of the research. © The Author(s) 2024.","Market entry; Market exit; Market research; Signaling",""

The present study addresses this topic by postulating a structural model for its evaluation. The author's structural model also examines the influence of system quality constructs (system stability, system agility, and anthropomorphism), and information quality constructs (information exhaustiveness or information up-to-datedness) as independent variables. The researcher uses a questionnaire, based on previous literature, which is administered to a sample of 651 participants. The proposed structural model is evaluated by applying PLS-SEM analysis. The results show that brand credibility influences the constructs of customer satisfaction (β = 0.289/p-value < 0.001) and continued use intention (β = 0.304/p-value < 0.001).

Data from an online survey of 371 consumers drawn from contrasting service contexts (restaurants and hospitals) were collected. In both service settings, the results reveal that value congruence is positively related to consumer–brand relationship quality and voluntary performance, and the consumer–brand relationship quality is negatively related to the propensity to leave. Furthermore, while consumer–brand relationship quality influences voluntary performance in the restaurant context, its influence does not exist in the hospital context. Contrary to expectations, the length of a relationship with a brand does not enhance the quality of the relationship; rather, value congruence takes precedence.

The substantive and modeling challenges that surface in this context relate to more nuanced customer relationships, highly heterogeneous populations, multiple product offerings, and temporal data constraints. To tackle these issues, we treat the CLV estimation as a lump sum prediction problem across multiple products and develop a hierarchical ensembled CLV model. Lump sum prediction enables the use of a wide range of supervised machine learning techniques, which provide additional flexibility, richer features and exhibit an improvement over more conventional forecasting methods. The hierarchical approach is well suited to constrained temporal data and a customer segment model ensembling strategy is introduced as a hyperparameter model-tuning step.

We estimate baseline category sales and the dependence of category demand on marketing activities (price, display and feature). We then relate the store-level demand to geodemographic characteristics of stores’ zip codes, accounting for local competitive intensity faced by stores. We find that as the percentage of college educated consumers in a store’s zip code increases, category sales increase and price sensitivity of the store decreases (regardless of store format). Median income of the store’s zip code explains most of the observed variation in estimated price sensitivities across stores. We find that a majority of stores are underpricing cereal, coffee and cola, i.e., pricing lower than what the optimal mark-ups implied by their price elasticities would suggest. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Demographics; Geodemographic effects; Marketing mix elasticities; Store-level demand",""

In this sense, this research aims to map the theory related to the value of a brand purpose from data analyzed systematically that could reveal the related phenomenon and its relations. An exploratory study of an inductive nature was carried out using Grounded Theory with specialists (practitioners) in marketing. The Atlas.

After completing the open, axial, and selective coding phases, the core phenomenon was identified and entitled brand purpose equity (BPE). Four subcategories of BPE were classified: activists, inspirational, differentiators, and identity creators, suggesting that BPE is a multidimensional construct. This is the first study that offers an exploratory conceptual framework to conceptualize and create a theoretical basis for the value of brand purpose.

However, further insight regarding the role of BDACs in the processes of SP creation can be provided by deploying complementary analytics techniques, namely importance-performance map analysis (IPMA), necessary condition analysis (NCA), and combined importance-performance map analysis (cIPMA). This paper applies these techniques to a sample of 210 Spanish companies with the potential for circularity and environmental impact. The results show that BDACs exert a positive total effect toward achieving SP. However, companies still have the potential to improve and benefit from these capabilities. In addition, BDACs are a necessary condition (must-have factor) for all dependent variables in the model, including SP. In this case, high levels of BDACs are required to achieve excellence in SP, justifying organizational initiatives that prioritize the improvement of BDACs to achieve SP goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Big data analytics capabilities; Circular economy practices; Combined importance-performance map analysis (cIPMA); Importance-performance map analysis (IPMA); IT-enabled capabilities perspective; Necessary condition analysis (NCA); Supply chain management capabilities; Sustainable performance",""

We examined two distinct video ads for a cosmetics brand, employing video sentiment analysis to gauge their emotional impact on 35 female participants. This assessment was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire and a biometric platform integrating facial detection analysis (using Affdex software by Affectiva) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Both video and text sentiment analyses were performed on two 30-s television ads—one promoting women’s empowerment and the other emphasizing anti-aging properties. While the textual analysis suggested a generally positive tone for both ads, video sentiment analysis, incorporating facial expressions via the Face API, revealed a significant contrast. The ad highlighting youthful appearance displayed higher positive emotional content, particularly “surprise,” compared to the “femvertising” ad promoting women’s empowerment. This heightened emotional response, as identified by video sentiment analysis, had a notable impact on participants’ emotional reactions to the ad, correlating with increased purchase intention and ad enjoyment. Conversely, no significant correlations were observed between emotions, purchase intent, and ad enjoyment for the femvertising ad. This outcome underscores the superiority of video sentiment analysis over traditional textual analysis, which fails to capture the emotional nuances conveyed through facial expressions. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of video sentiment analysis in predicting purchase intent and assessing advertising appeal. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.","Advertising effectiveness; Autonomic response; Emotional impact; Facial expressions analysis; Femvertising; Galvanic Skin Response; Neuromarketing; Textual sentiment analysis; Video sentiment analysis",""

However, most studies have focused on the value of co-destruction's emotional and behavioral consequences without considering its psychological impact on consumer behavior. This study bridges this research gap by examining consumer alienation as a fundamental psychological state that underpins the value co-destruction process. Its primary objective is to delve into the significance of alienation within retail banking, uncovering its underlying causes and consequences. Furthermore, the study examines how the external locus of control affects the behavior of alienated consumers. The data were collected from 211 French retail bank users. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The study showed that consumers’ discontent, perceived differential treatment, and financial distress lead to value destruction and influence consumer alienation toward retail banking service providers. A high level of alienation leads to payment delinquency, negative WOM, and switching intentions to internet-only banks. The external locus of control moderates these relationships. By identifying the antecedents and consequences of consumer alienation in retail banking, this study provides practical advice to retail banking providers on retroactively identifying alienated consumers. This study provides ideas on restoring lost value, retaining customers, and preventing them from switching to internet-only banks.

Results show that mindfulness is related to impulse buying, either affectively or cognitively. The more mindful the consumer is, the less likely he/she will make an impulse buy. Additionally, consciousness did not positively affect the need for arousal or material things. The more conscientious you are, the less the need to be aroused. This indicates that companies need to differentiate between very conscientious consumers and consumers who are not. The more a consumer looks for information, the less likely any marketing cues, such as advertisements or social media, will arouse him/her.

In this work, a kNN regression variant, easily adaptable for classification purposes, is suggested. The proposal allows dealing with all types of input variables while embedding feature selection in a simple and efficient manner, reducing the tuning phase. More precisely, making use of the weighted Gower distance, we develop a powerful tool to cope with these inconveniences. Finally, to boost the tool predictive power, a second weighting scheme is added to the neighbors.

While researchers apply multiple methods to salesforce motivation and performance, the power of machine learning has not been applied to independent representatives and their unique circumstances. This research employs supervised learning algorithms for predictive analytics to create models for recruits and existing independent representatives. It finds that the most crucial factors align with expectancy theory for both. Allocated time for direct selling, ability to find new customers, gender, and adopting direct selling as a career play key roles in predicting sales success for individuals entering direct selling. The highest-performing representatives are characterized by time invested, experience of direct selling, recruitment, tenure, and use of technology. By predicting representative success factors, organizations can tailor recruitment, training, and incentives to maximize performance. Because independent sales representatives are not employees, understanding these factors is critical to firms engaging them. Translating established theory into testing with predictive analytics to identify meaningful success factors for rarely studied independent sales representatives has the potential to change the landscape for recruitment, retention, and success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Direct selling; Expectancy theory; Independent sales representatives; Predictive analytics; Salesforce performance; Supervised learning algorithms",""
"Challenging the linearity assumption of intra-brand image confusion","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143270360&doi=10.1057%2fs41270-022-00202-6&partnerID=40&md5=354868bf7636a2107dfabd3de8b15c19","The purpose of this study is to clarify and consolidate the components and consequences of intra-brand image confusion (IBIC). In addition to validating previous research results on IBIC in a fresh context (different product category with its brands), this study challenges the linearity assumption usually underlying studies of branding impacts and IBIC. A national representative online survey was conducted in the United Kingdom investigating the smartphone market. Explorative factor analyses were conducted in order to assess the components of IBIC. Structural equation modeling reveals the extent and consequences of IBIC. Multiple regressions were conducted to further explore non-linear response at the sub-domain and higher-order construct level. The results confirm and solidify previous results on the relevance of the construct of IBIC. This study supports the relevance of intra-brand image confusion’s three components. A novel contribution arises from the fact that customers with a moderate involvement level are more confused than people with lower involvement levels. A U-shaped response indicates that lower involved prospective customers are at higher risk of a confusion by too broad assortments. Brand managers are well advised to pay strong attention to the structure of an assortment and to sub-brands to prevent the occurrence of an IBIC. © The Author(s) 2022. corrected publication 2023.","Assortment; Brand image; Brand portfolios; Intra-brand image confusion; Non-linear effect; Portfolio strategy",""

This study examines marketing prompts—text inputs created by marketers to guide LLMs in generating desired outputs. By combining insights from the marketing literature and the latest research on LLMs, the study develops a conceptual framework around three key features of marketing prompts: prompt domain (the specific marketing actions that the prompts target), prompt appeal (the intended output of the prompts being informative or emotional), and prompt format (the intended output of the prompts being generic or contextual). The study collected hundreds of marketing prompt templates shared on X (formerly Twitter) and analyzed them using a combination of natural language processing techniques and descriptive statistics. The findings indicate that the prompt templates target a wide range of marketing domains—about 16 altogether. Likewise, the findings indicate that most of the marketing prompts are designed to generate informative output (as opposed to emotionally engaging output). Further, the findings indicate that the marketing prompts are designed to generate a balanced mix of generic and contextual output. The study further finds that the use of prompt appeal and prompt format differs by prompt domain. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Business; Large language models; Prompt engineering",""

Although online surveys are broadly available, one of the major challenges is to collect high-quality data, which is fundamental for marketing. Since online surveys are mostly unsupervised, the possibility of providing false answers is high, and large numbers of participants do not finish interviews, yet our understanding of the reasons behind this pattern remains unclear. Here, we examined the possible factors influencing response rates and aimed to investigate the impact of technical and demographic information on the probability of interview completion rates of multiple surveys. We applied survival analysis and proportional hazards models to statistically evaluate the associations between the probability of survey completion and the technical and demographic information of the respondents. More complex surveys had lower completion probabilities, although survey completion was increased when respondents used desktop computers and not mobile devices, and when surveys were translated to their native language. Meanwhile, age and gender did not influence completion rates, but the pool of respondents invited to complete the survey did affect completion rates. These findings can be used to improve online surveys to achieve higher completion rates and collect more accurate data. © 2024, The Author(s).","Completion probability; Cox’s regression; Hazard ratio; Online survey; Optimisation; Response rate; Technical conditions; Time-dependent processes",""

With the spread of technologies, managers face dilemmas how to relate to existing technologies. One prominent contemporary technology is big data (BD). While research articulates its importance, it ignores its combination with existing traditional systems (i.e., small data; SD) and how firms cultivate this development. This study examines the impact of SD, BD that constitute marketing analytics, and their intersected relationship on data-driven insights en route implications on marketing innovation. Based on quantitative and qualitative studies and ambidexterity framework, the study proposes the combination of SD and BD (data ambidexterity) as key driver of marketing insights and innovation. A conceptual model was tested using regressions, path analyses, and robustness checks. Findings show that new data technologies should not overshadow older ones and suggest a hierarchy of analytic effects (SD < BD < SD × BD). While BD has a stronger effect than SD on insights, their combination is more beneficial than each in isolation. Moreover, the effect of this combination on marketing innovation is mediated through data-driven insights. The study addresses the paucity of research on SD and BD, proposes a more holistic approach, extends the potential of marketing analytics, and exhibits theoretical and practical implications of data ambidexterity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Ambidexterity; Big data; Descriptive insight; Marketing innovation; Predictive insight; Prescriptive insight; Small data",""

Against a backdrop of increasing competition and rising costs to attract new users, freemium platform providers need to know how to reduce termination rates. We analyze several influencing factors of termination rates using extensive data over a 5-year period from a freemium platform on sport and breeding horses. We find that shorter contract terms, increasing involvement, and increasing platform-specific content reduces termination rates. Furthermore, freemium providers should pay special attention to the interaction of video views and number of last logins. While both variables individually have no significant influence, the interaction effect positively affects termination rates. The higher both the number of video views and the number of last logins, the higher the termination rate. For freemium providers this finding leads to a dilemma. In short term (within a week), they do not know if a premium user has logged in for the last time and is willing to terminate. Still, this result is highly relevant for freemium providers. They should use our results to analyze last logins and video views ex post. In this way, they can learn about their customers’ behavior and find out how to reduce the termination rate in the future. © 2023, The Author(s).","Freemium; Online marketing; Online platform; Premium; Retention; Termination",""

Three studies were conducted. Study 1 (N = 228) examines the effect of a brand being associated with a conflicting political belief on attitude and buying intention. Study 2 (N = 212) tests the moderating role of PBG among these relationships. Study 3 (N = 126) tests the moderating role of PBG for a service brand and adds the mediating role of self-congruity. We followed marketing analytics best practices to examine causal effects of manipulated stimuli. We also examined the psychometric characteristics of the data-collection tool and tested direct relationships between variables. Additionally, we used percentile bootstrap confidence intervals, with PROCESS-Macro, to test mediating effects in the theoretical model. The studies include moderating analyses and analysis of variance. The results show that the association of a brand with a conflicting political belief negatively influences perceived self-congruity, which leads to an unfavourable attitude and, in turn, to a lower buying intention.

The results uncovered a residual superiority of global brands, but not deterministic of purchasing intentions. Brand competence and stereotyping demonstrated a reciprocal influence. The myth of incommensurability between global and local branding strategies was demonstrated to be off beam, and likewise, the alleged inverse proportionality of local and global stereotypes. In this context, the future of brand extensions and rebranding require a compatibility of both strategies and the hybridization of globalness and localness on one’s portfolio management exercise. Nonetheless, the extension of the general influence of the brand to gain higher control over the consumption patterns ought to abandon the seemingly unattainable logic of micro-targeting and focus on the meta-mapping of the “consumer mosaic” and the underlying contingencies of accessibility and manipulation of large amounts of data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Brand competence; Brand globalness; Brand localness; Brand stereotype; Conscious consumption; Purchase intention",""

This study addresses the gap in the research literature by categorizing the concept of ‘self-confidence’ into general and specific (GSC/SSC) and assessing their impacts on consumers’ intentions to complain about a company. A conceptual model proposed for the research that was empirically verified using a sample comprising consumers in Swansea, U.K. was employed. The results of the multilevel and polynomial regression indicated that although both GSC and SSC influence consumers’ intentions to complain, GSC cannot moderate the relationship between SSC and complaining intention. Moreover, the findings showed that the impact of SSC on the intention to complain is considerably stronger than the effect of GSC. Therefore, it could be concluded that consumers’ intentions to complain is mainly driven by their specific self-confidence. This study, in addition to laying the groundwork for future research, has important managerial implications. Most notably, the findings confirmed that companies would benefit from enhancing consumers’ SSC and encouraging them to file their complaints directly to the company. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022.","General self-confidence; Intention to complain; Kanazawa’s evolutionary theory; Latent state-trait theory; Multilevel modeling; Specific self-confidence",""

The study adopted the survey method to collect data in Canada and the United States among the marketing personnel working in firms with at least limited experience in the deployment of BD. The collected data were analyzed with ANOVA and a two-step cluster analysis procedure. The cluster variate included technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge constructs with their relevant indicator variables. The profiling of the clusters was also completed. The findings indicate the existence of two sufficiently large clusters among the marketing personnel. They had very different profiles regarding their gender, decision-making role, BD deployment level in their respective firms, and experience level. This research sheds light on the types of marketing analytics personnel required to implement BDMA successfully.

As data continue to be generated and relied upon, data literacy skills are becoming increasingly critical. Since data must be ‘prepared’ prior to its analysis, this paper highlights three core competencies—cleaning, transforming, merging (i.e., data preparation)—that are required to build a sound marketing analytics foundation. Expanding data literacy to include the ability to transform data from its raw state into a usable form will enhance students’ overall level of proficiency and marketability in marketing analytics. It is imperative to include the teaching of data preparation as part of the analytics curriculum in marketing analytics courses to ensure that students attain the greater level of data literacy.

The purpose of this study is to establish the piecewise linear approximation (PLA) as a trend analysis method that accounts for the structural breaks. PLA uses the complete data to simultaneously estimate the breakpoints and the continuously connected trends, immediately before and after the break. Thus, PLA not only ensures the ease of interpretation of the results, but also eliminates the probability of using discretion by uniquely determining the current trend, making the estimated result reliable. The case study demonstrates the proposition that, several products’ sales trends and the necessity of determining an appropriate time span for data analysis, underwent changes at least once. The method’s validity is demonstrated by showing the changes of the sales trends immediately after analyzed store’s renovation.

Among various forms of virtual currency, cryptocurrency has emerged as a prominent contender. The advent of digital currency has opened new avenues in the software industry, particularly in finance, data storage, and data collection. This evolution has given rise to exciting opportunities for businesses to explore the potential of digital currency and leverage its benefits. Cryptocurrency (crypto) is very volatile regarding the market value, which carries a host of unknowns that make it difficult to predict and analyze future prices. This paper discusses the use of six types of machine-learning models (Linear Regression, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, TARCH, and VAR) to predict the Bitcoin and DogeCoin prices; General Least-Squares Regression and Neural Networks algorithms to predict the volatility of a given cryptocurrency and its prices from 2014 to 2023 with daily cryptocurrency volatility data. The results show that high-performance computing techniques such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks (0.0468 RMSPE) regression models to predict relatively accurate crypto price volatility and past available cryptocurrency price data are proven to be used to verify the prediction results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Cryptocurrency; High performance computing; Linear regression; Machine learning; Neural Networks; Price prediction",""

Common distribution-velocity models use distribution-breadth metrics. However, distribution-breadth metrics lack the variability needed to meaningfully differentiate competing brands. This article presents a new approach for modeling distribution-velocity using weighted total distribution, which combines distribution-breadth and distribution-depth. Using retail scanner data from the U.S. market covering a total of 1682 brands in 12,049 stores across five channel types, we propose total-distribution models that are easier to specify, better reveal the differences in distribution between brands, and thus improve competitive benchmarking. This novel modeling approach based on total distribution serves as a pivotal contribution by providing an effective analytical tool for competitive benchmarking in diverse market environments. It allows brands to increase their market-share by spending on a fair share of total distribution. These findings highlight the usefulness of a total-distribution metric as a measure of competitive distribution coverage to support product-portfolio and category-management decisions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Category management; CPG; Distribution velocity; Total distribution",""

The simplicity of this index has been overwhelmingly well received by industry, and many organizations have adopted it. However, studies using NPS are less frequent and, often, they reach a negative conclusion about the effectiveness of the index. This outcome is mainly because NPS does not have a particularly good explanatory power for business performance, compared with satisfaction and other loyalty indices. Despite academic criticism, industry still relies on NPS because no other simple and robust index has been proposed. Therefore, this study proposes a new index, the next purchase intention brand (NPI), as an alternative loyalty index. Unlike existing indices, NPI identifies the one brand that the customer would most likely continue purchasing using a single answer. Only brands with high loyalty receive scores; the survey results are unaffected in markets targeting countries with intermediate response tendencies. For six consumer goods categories (beer, deodorant, green tea, instant noodles, nutrition drink, and shampoo) in Japan, the NPI index has a higher explanatory power for market share than general loyalty indices.

Administrators primarily forecast the factors based on their expertise and intuition to evaluate implications and repercussions. The variables are large, varied, and situational to each individual and complex. We used machine learning (automated processes using predictive algorithms) to predict undergraduate extensions for at least 2 years beyond a standard 4 years to complete a bachelor's degree.

The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents promising solutions to these challenges. However, understanding the intricacies of technology acceptance within the startup environment becomes paramount. Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) have long served as foundational frameworks for understanding technology adoption and integration, but their effectiveness is hindered by inherent limitations. These limitations demand further exploration, particularly when viewed through the entrepreneurial lens. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations inherent in TAM and its extensions, alongside other prominent technology acceptance models. By incorporating an entrepreneurial perspective, the analysis reveals additional challenges stemming from the dynamic nature of startup ecosystems. From a pragmatic standpoint, this paper provides actionable insights for technology-driven entrepreneurial organizations to navigate innovation and technology adoption decisions more intelligently. From a theoretical perspective, it contributes to the refinement and evolution of technology acceptance models, particularly in the context of entrepreneurial ventures. In light of these limitations, the paper offers strategic recommendations for future research endeavors. These include encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, contextualizing models to suit startup dynamics, conducting longitudinal studies to capture evolving user perceptions, accounting for individual differences in technology adoption, and validating emerging models to reflect contemporary realities. Emphasis is placed on the entrepreneurial imperative of agility and adaptability in navigating the ever-changing landscape of technology acceptance. Moreover, the paper underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and delineates practical implications for organizations and practitioners aiming to sustain technology acceptance and successful implementation within dynamic startup environments. By addressing these constraints, researchers can pave the way for the development of more robust and comprehensive models, better equipped to clarify and predict technology acceptance and usage patterns. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical need for ongoing refinement and innovation within the realm of technology acceptance, providing actionable insights to propel both scholarly discourse and entrepreneurial practice forward. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation adoption; Limitations; Startup environment; Technology acceptance model",""

We compare a traditional (naïve) multinomial logit to six machine-learning alternatives: learning multinomial logit, random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting, support vector machines and an ensemble learning algorithm. The comparison is done by applying these methods to beer category stock keeping unit (SKU) level panel data. Results show that machine-learning techniques tend to perform better, but not always. Ensemble learning performs best while maintaining an overall high-performance level across all SKU classes, independently of their sample size. This result builds on existing evidence about the benefits of combining multiple prediction techniques over relying on a single best performing model, as conventional wisdom would intuitively make us believe. In general, the better performance of machine learning techniques at predicting product choice should not come as a surprise. At their core, machine learning techniques are designed to augment dimensionality of models and/or scan through orders of magnitude greater model alternatives, relative to the narrower focus of traditional approaches. © 2023, The Author(s).","Choice prediction; Ensemble learning; Machine learning",""

We consider seven measures of social media activity within a Social Impact Theory framework and test under what context does online chatter about a brand lead to higher foot traffic to those brand stores. We use hierarchical linear regression to account for the random effects of brand and store heterogeneity, which is superior to ordinary linear regression. Despite wide variation, when brand mentions increase by one standard deviation—either in likes or disagreement—then next-day foot traffic to stores of that brand will increase by 0.04 standard deviations (3–4%). This modest but meaningful effect, however, fully dissipates within 1 week. The weak cross-brand effects show that social media has distinct and larger influence on brands individually rather than universally. Our approach is novel due to (1) the large scale of data, (2) the breadth of analysis, (3) the multi-level specification, and (4) in estimating global elasticities between changes in electronic word-of-mouth (WoM) communication about brands and changes in store visits of those brands. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Digital economics; Multilevel analysis; Retail; Social impact theory; Social media; WoM",""

Here, a data set of a Portuguese wholesaler for food and household supplies is used as an exemplary application. To increase the quality of the analysis, a two-stage approach is proposed. First, key accounts are filtered by a density-based outlier detection. Second, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is applied to cluster smaller customers. This two-stage approach is aligned with the business implications of key accounts as outstanding and very differently behaving customers as well as with the core idea of an ABC analysis. Also, the exclusion of key accounts corresponds to the definition of outliers as the results of a different underlying mechanism. Using this two-stage approach shows better clustering results compared to using a one-stage approach applying only a GMM. Therefore, it is concluded that density-based detection of key accounts followed by a clustering using a GMM is beneficial for customer segmentation within B2B applications. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anomaly detection; Clustering algorithms; Customer segmentation; Marketing management",""

This relatively new advertising strategy’s annual spending has increased dramatically in recent years. Despite its practical success, the background theory for mobile in-app advertising is still in its infancy. This type of advertising also sees the emergence of new participants, such as ad networks and app publishers, which leads to the development of new theoretical constructs and more nuanced conceptual relationships on top of popularly accepted frameworks, e.g. Mobile Advertising Effectiveness Framework. This study especially looks at app publishers’ roles, which have received the least attention in the advertising literature and are almost non-existent in the previous effectiveness frameworks. The empirical goal of this study was to assess the moderating effects of ad space characteristics on the effectiveness of mobile in-app advertising. To test the research’s conceptual model, a 24-factorial online experiment was set up. Accordingly, this study established a common goal for participants and a metric to measure that common effectiveness goal. Ultimately, the model was successfully tested by both Moderated Regression Analysis and Multigroup Moderation Analysis techniques with data from over 15,000 ad impressions and over 800 ad clicks from thousands of mobile users in over 160 countries around the world. The study theoretically found that publishers can significantly moderate the effects controlled by advertisers, and users, which can practically help increase the revenue of advertising through designing and delivering ad spaces on their applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Ad clicks; Ad space; Advertising factors; App publisher; Effectiveness framework; Integrated advertising; Mobile in-app advertising; Moderation; Programmatic advertising",""

In consideration of the interactive nature of live streaming commerce, this paper proposes an interaction–immersion model to investigate factors affecting impulse buying behaviour. The proposed research model assesses the effects of different kinds of interaction (the person–environment interaction, the para-social interaction with streamers, the para-social interaction with other participants) on interaction immersion, and the subsequent response, i.e., impulse buying behaviour of customers. The proposed model is validated using survey data from 358 users of live shopping. The results show that the three dimensions of interaction have positive and significant effects on customers’ interaction immersion, which can affect impulse buying behaviour positively and significantly. Also, streamer attractiveness can positively moderate the effect of interaction immersion on impulse buying behaviour. These findings highlight the vital role of interaction and immersion in encouraging impulse buying behaviour, which can shed light on the design of a better live shopping platform and marketing strategies of sellers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Impulse buying; Interaction immersion; Live streaming technology; Para-social interaction; Person–environment interaction; Streamer attractiveness",""

Lodging attributes are important determinants that affect consumers’ accommodation selection, perception of service quality, satisfaction, and future behavior intentions. Thus, the current study is to examine the attributes that guests consider important and to verify their similarities and differences with hotel attributes is of strategic importance to both hotels and Airbnb.

Three studies were conducted to highlight the significant negative implications of scale proliferation for theory building in the area of customer brand engagement. Each study employed multiple linear regression to investigate multiple distinct customer brand engagement scales. First, the discriminant validity of these scales was examined. Second, the studies examined the relationship between these customer brand engagement constructs and several constructs that previous studies had indicated as antecedents of customer brand engagement. Overall, the results have some worrisome theoretical implications. The measurement scales displayed adequate discriminant validity indicating that scholars have been using the same term (i.e., customer brand engagement) to label constructs that are, in fact, distinct. That is, the various customer brand engagement scales measure different concepts. Moreover, the relationships that these distinct constructs share with their proposed antecedents vary across constructs.

A study of the effects of perceived ethical behavior of brands in Colombia during the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak was conducted in May 2020 in Bogota, Colombia, to ascertain customer perception of brand ethical actions during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. A Bayesian model was developed to assess the impact of brands' ethical behavior on brand recognition benefits, brand image, and brand commitment. The selection of the initial months of the outbreak for this project was important because the COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to augment consumer perception of brands' ethical actions at a pivotal moment in consumers' lives. Our findings demonstrate that customers expressed a positive perception of brands' ethical actions during the early months of the pandemic, which resulted in high commitment intention to these brands in the model examined. The findings highlight the critical nature of the perception of ethical behavior in the eyes of customers during a major global health crisis. More than ever, organizations must commit their brands to fully live out their publicly expressed ethical principles and continuously monitor consumer perceptions of brand attributes and behaviors associated with ethical actions regardless of market conditions. Commitment to living the brand's stated ethical principles can be demonstrated via branding activities in ways that can be especially welcomed by customers during turbulent times. The insights mentioned in this article are crucial for brands already present in South America or exploring expansion into these regions. The findings provide compelling evidence of the impact of ethical actions on consumer commitment to brands, suggesting that brands must now, more than ever, stay in touch with their customers and truthfully live the ethical values they transmit to customers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bayesian methodology; Brand commitment; Brand ethicality; COVID-19; Turbulent times",""

Vector autoregressive models show that the impact of the studied variables on WOM transmission depends on brand performance stability and consumer involvement with the product category. The marketing mix has a greater impact on WOM transmission than RWOM across the countries for growing (vs. declining) brands. The impact of RWOM on the transmission of PWOM is greater for high- than low-involvement consumers. The difference in the impact of RWOM on the transmission of PWOM depends on the stability of brand performance.

Based on categorization theory, the authors hypothesize that brand name similarity and feature similarity, both independently, and in interaction, increase brand cannibalization. The empirical analysis in three consumer packaged-goods categories shows that it is more critical to minimize the feature similarity than brand name similarity to limit cannibalization and generate higher incremental sales from line extensions.

First, brands that invested in Sponsored Brands video (SBv) ads in addition to sponsored ads static ads had a 25% higher click-through rate (CTR) and 10% higher year-over-year sales growth. Second, individual consumer CTR depends on ad format (video vs. static), unmuting, and time watched. For audiences in 15 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, we find a 17.7 times higher CTR on SBv versus static images, especially for unmuted versus muted SBv. Furthermore, the muted consumer CTR increases with the viewed video length, with a substantial increase at a viewed video length longer than 5 s. Surprisingly, the unmuted CTR remains over 3 times that of muted CTR at all viewed video lengths, showing only a CTR uptick when the video was completed. Thus, if the ad is not watched with sound for its full length (the best-case scenario), advertisers should strive for video ads that (1) are unmuted, even for a short time, or (2) play at least 5 s on mute. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Advertising; Click-through rate; Digital; Outstream; Sound; Video; Viewed length",""

The study uses a cross-sectional survey that was conducted among the members of various brand communities from Canada and the United States. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to examine the strength, significance, and effect sizes of the relationships. The findings indicate that participation has a significant impact on brand community engagement and brand community relationship quality. Furthermore, responsible information behavior appears to be the most effective strategy to encourage participation and thereby increase engagement and relationship quality with the brand community. The results confirm previous researchers’ findings with regard to how to encourage participation and enhance relationship quality in the context of co-creation in brand communities. The study is unique in its ability to determine how these variables work together in order to achieve that goal, rather than studying their individual impacts on the construct. We are able to get a more augmented and strategic perspective on how to achieve the goals of engagement and enhanced relationship quality in brand communities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Brand community; Brand community engagement; Co-creation; Partial least squares (PLS) modeling; Participation; Relationship quality",""

The hypotheses are tested with a dataset of survey data from 323 Portuguese consumers using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Based on social identity theory, the findings show that storytelling improves consumers’ cognitive responses through consumer–brand identification and stimulates consumers’ emotional responses through brand affective involvement. Moreover, storytelling stimulates behavioural responses through purchase intention, via the mediating role of consumers’ cognitive and emotional responses. The results also show that storytelling generates stronger emotional than cognitive responses, but cognitive responses have stronger effects on behavioural responses. This research contributes to the literature on the strategic role of storytelling in brand management by demonstrating that storytelling is an effective way of improving the consumer–brand relationship experience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Affective involvement; Consumer relationship experience; Consumer–brand identification; Narrative structure; Purchase intention; Storytelling",""

Thus, we examine the impact of psychological customer engagement on behavioral customer engagement (i.e., customer purchases, customer referrals, customer influence, and customer knowledge). To enhance the model’s explanatory power, we also explore the moderating role of customer commitment in that relationship. An online survey (N = 207) was conducted to measure the constructs of interest. Regression analyses test research hypotheses; PROCESS Model 1 was used to test the moderating role of customer commitment. Further, the Johnson–Neyman (JN) technique (also called floodlight analysis) was employed to probe the interaction terms. The results show that when customers cognitively and affectively engage with a brand, they are more willing to behave favorably toward the brand by purchasing its products/services, promoting it, influencing others on social media platforms, and providing valuable suggestions or feedback to the brand. The results also indicate that the positive impact of psychological customer engagement on customer purchases and customer referrals is stronger for lowly committed customers than highly committed customers.

A partial least square structure equational model was conducted. The data collection framework followed a traditional SEM data collection and consequent analysis. The results revealed that consumer need for uniqueness is an antecedent of inconspicuousness luxury consumption, while cultural capital has a negative effect on conspicuous luxury consumers, mediated by susceptibility to normative influence.

Determining if these marketing efforts are effective in convincing customers to take desired actions is challenging since companies need to ensure that their marketing campaigns are feasible in order to target the right customers who are most likely to respond to the marketing treatment. Prescriptive analytics provide better means to measure the impact of a marketing campaign on customer behavior when compared to conventional predictive analytics. Uplift modeling presents an opportunity to maximize the incremental impact of marketing treatment by determining the most responsive customer segment who will take positive action only because of receiving the treatment. This paper aims to suggest an uplift modeling approach in a marketing campaign in B2B context for better evaluation of performance which has not gained enough attention as B2C in literature. By applying three uplift modeling techniques to a real-world B2B cross-sell campaign, it is demonstrated that the campaign effectiveness can be increased significantly by determining the customers who are truly responsive to the related campaign. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","B2B; Machine learning; Marketing campaign management; Supervised learning; Uplift modeling",""

Based upon the theory of psychological reactance and psychoevolutionary theory of emotion, we hypothesize how such lifestyle changes affect consumers perceiving and responding to companies' communications messages. The theories also suggest that consumers in different cultures may respond to COVID-19 differently. To test our hypotheses, we implemented a Python scraper to collect companies’ Instagram posts pre- and during the COVID-19 lockdown. A machine learning algorithm was applied on the collected post photos to automatically identify certain photo characteristics, such as indoor versus outdoor, and with a single person versus many people; a text mining and sentiment analysis was implemented on the collected post captions to identify the salient emotion each caption exhibited, such as joy and anticipation. After that, we conducted a regression discontinuity analysis of photo characteristics or caption emotion on number of likes or comments to identify consumers’ response change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimation results supported our hypotheses and suggested tactics that could improve consumer communications effectiveness in this changed time. Viewing COVID-19 as an example of a current event in the ever-changing world, this paper suggests that such events could impact consumer response and behavior, and that companies’ marketing and advertising strategies should be responsive to such events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Consumer communications; COVID-19; Cross-cultural study; Machine learning; Regression discontinuity analysis; Sentiment analysis; Social media marketing",""

First, a multi-layered conceptual model is developed using the e-service quality dimensions to understand consumers' online behavior in the context of a developing country, India. Data were collected from 588 respondents from four metropolitan cities in southern India during the ‘new normal’ post-pandemic period. After checking the psychometric properties of the survey instrument, using the LISREL package of structural equation modeling, the hypothesized relationships were tested using Hayes's PROCESS macros. The results indicate that the credibility and responsiveness of e-retailers are significant predictors of trust. The findings also support the positive association of trust with online buying behavior and customer satisfaction. Most importantly, price discounts and offers (PDO) (first moderator) and assurance (second moderator) interact with trust to positively influence online buying behavior. The study also empirically found that the personalization (first moderator) and accessibility (second moderator) of e-retailers interact with online buying behavior to enhance customer satisfaction. The three-way interaction effects offer novelty to the conceptual model, and findings significantly contribute to the literature on online buying behavior.

This paper develops a stochastic model, which is then applied to household purchase data to predict ultimate trial and first repeat purchase rates for a new brand introduced in an existing category of common frequently purchased goods. Previous research directed at the estimation of these two common indicators of new product success, as well as critical components of volume forecasting models, has focused on the elapsed calendar time to purchase or repurchase of the new brand. However, typical scanner panel data also contain information regarding consumer purchasing behavior of other brands in the category. The model developed in this paper utilizes this richer category purchase data from a household scanner data to estimate these two critical forecasting parameters: ultimate trial and first repeat rates. Results from four instances, including two cases involving new products and two cases involving existing brands, are used to demonstrate the value of the category purchase approach in comparison to the elapsed calendar time to purchase approach. Results show that the category purchase approach is more accurate in predicting the percentage of clients who would ever try a new product in the market (i.e., eventual trial) and in predicting the first repeat rate. Results also demonstrate how this projected eventual trial and first repeat rates could be used to develop a better estimate of long-term market share. We demonstrate that this approach provides an improved forecasting tool and recommend that marketers should, when possible, take advantage of this method. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Calendar time approach; Category purchase approach; Long-term forecasts; New product introduction; Scanner panel data; Stochastic model",""

A “data autocracy” regime is asserted to be distorting the information to the consumer and bias the ability to take informed free choices. Consequently, companies face nowadays a great data governance challenge, i.e. to restore the consumer’s positive sentiment while continuing to explore Big Data. Hence, we have conducted a multi-method enquiry with foci on the Danish market covering the topic of digital footprint’s awareness. This was fashioned with a descriptive-exploratory research purpose, to understand the sentiment (perception) and the behavior (action) of the data-owners and data-brokers surrounding the dataveillance over personal lives. Results confirmed a generalized inability to minimize risks of data misuse. A new insight for Marketeers is the willingness of some respondents to pay for security services and thus safeguard their privacy (disbelieved of the regulatory compliance system). A perception-behavior gap is noticed on the distress with the exposure of personal information and the paradoxical low self-defensiveness. Likewise, data-brokers admit the deliberate use (perception) of imitation strategies (e.g. hyper-targeting; algorithmic refinement; and, predictive modeling) for maintaining a competitive parity with other firms, which contrasts with the institutional isomorphism (inaction) to interrupt them. Given the relevance of this discussion (and our conclusions) for policy-making, managers (inclusively marketing professionals) and citizens, is recommended the deepening of this research line in the region, especially in Nordic countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Big data; Consumer’s sentiment; Denmark; Digital footprints; GDPR",""

Souvenir shops usually have only one opportunity to sell products to each visitor because of their nature. Thus, clarifying the contemporaneous causal relationships among the sales of products sold in souvenir shops is much more important. We propose that there are informative causal relations among the sales of tourism products. We develop a methodology to estimate these causalities given exogenous factors without specifying the causal directions. The proposed model is a structural vector auto regressive model with exogenous variables, and its estimation method is a modified vector auto regressive model to a linear non-Gaussian cyclic model. Applying the proposed methodology, we analyzed point of sale data from a souvenir shop. The results show that tourists who purchase tourism products of an ideal size for office/workplace souvenirs tend to simultaneously purchase other tourism products of the same size or products for households. The obtained result can help marketers plan sales promotions and inventory controls. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Contemporaneous effect; LiNGAM; POS data; Structural vector auto regressive model; Time series; Tourist products",""

The study draws on the long tail perspective to differentiate between niche and popular mobile apps and considers app updating frequency, revenue model, user value of mobile apps, and optimization of the mobile app content as influential elements of app store strategy. It proposes a model linking developers’ app store strategy to mobile app performance, measured through user rating data, with mobile app popularity acting as a moderator. To test its hypotheses, the study estimates a regression model with interaction effects on a dataset of mobile apps from Apple’s App Store (N = 5765). The findings reveal that, relative to popular mobile apps, niche mobile apps need to be managed more proactively through more frequent updates and efficacious optimization of the mobile app content.

Mediating variables trust and perceived value are considered in the paths from interactivity and reputation to purchase intention. An empirical study was conducted to collect 236 valid responses from respondents of various demographic backgrounds. It is found that a serial mediation model fits the data better than a parallel mediation model. Furthermore, interactivity caused an inconsistent mediation (suppressor) process with an insignificant total effect on purchase intention, and reputation caused a consistent mediation process and a significant total effect on purchase intention. For the reputation factor, indirect path through trust had the largest effect size, while indirect path through perceived value had the largest effect size for the interactivity factor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Interactivity; Live commerce; Mediation process; Purchase intention; Reputation",""

To answer these questions, this study examines three pairs of rival products: Apple’s iPhone versus Samsung Galaxy, Intel versus AMD processors, and Netflix versus Hulu. Guided by psychological and marketing theories, Vector Autoregressive models were constructed to estimate the effects of ISI for the rival products (1) on the stock returns, and (2) on each other. Results showed that (1) ISI for the products significantly impacts the stock returns, and (2) the effects of ISI for one product on the other are not only significant but also asymmetrical.

One of the few suggestions for loyalty indices is the net promoter score (NPS). Approximately two-thirds of Fortune 1000 companies currently use this index due to its overwhelming simplicity. However, scholars have criticized NPS for being inferior to other loyalty indices. Accordingly, scholars have mainly used Likert scales that cannot compare products/services using a single question and are subject to a response bias due to cultural differences. To fill this gap, we address the following four main criticisms of NPS: First, its advantages over the Likert scale of preferences and recommendation and purchase intentions are unproven; second, it cannot compare a competing product or service using a single question; third, its threshold setting is subjective; and fourth, it suffers from a cultural response bias tendency. This study asks the following research question: “Is brand selection superior to Likert scales in explaining sales performance?” To form a generalized conclusion, we examine 100 brands selected from 20 industries in the US market. The results of randomized controlled trials prove the superiority of selection over scale.

In light of this, this study aims to investigate the key factors that drive customer trust in airline brands within the Latin American context. In order to accomplish this goal, an augmented version of AIRQUAL was utilized to evaluate Colombian native customers' perceptions of the customer experience (CX) provided by Avianca, a well-known and highly regarded airline active in Latin America. AIRQUAL is a model used to evaluate the quality of airline service proposed by Nadiri et al. (2008). It consists of five dimensions: airline tangibles, terminal tangibles, personnel services, empathy, and image. These dimensions were expanded to capture additional touchpoints identified in the literature. They represent internal and external touchpoints that make up the airline customer experience, resulting in a more robust research model. The additional dimensions, namely the impact of perceptions associated with other customers and the process of the purchase experience, were incorporated to account for a more holistic assessment of the experience provided. They also help capture the three stages of the experience provided by the airline as proposed by Namukasa (2013) before, during, and after the flight. The examined drivers of brand trust in the proposed model were the dimensions of the augmented AIRQUAL model and a measure of CX. Results indicate that while most dimensions impact brand trust, CX was identified as the key driver of brand trust and acted as a mediator of the dimensions of the augmented AIRQUAL and brand trust. According to the findings of this research, all three aspects of service quality—pre-flight service quality, in-flight service quality, and post-flight service quality—are of comparable significance and have a significant bearing on how customers evaluate their experiences. © 2023, The Author(s).","Airline industry; Brand trust; Customer experience; Other customers; Service quality",""

The generalization and specification of the results about these benefits and their consequences on an international scale have become a requirement for businesses looking to retain foreign customers and conquer new markets. The current paper aims to apply Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling to better understand the relational benefit outcomes, the mediating effects of satisfaction and commitment, and the moderating effect of individualism/collectivism within the synthetic model. Accordingly, MASEM was performed using 33 valid empirical studies. It incorporated 280 effect sizes over a period of 21 years and a cumulative sample of 15,222 respondents. The synthetic outputs from domestic markets confirm that relational benefits explain satisfaction, commitment, and loyalty. Further, relational benefits have a positive effect on loyalty through the mediating effect of satisfaction and commitment. Finally, individualism/collectivism moderates the causal links between relational benefits, satisfaction, commitment, and loyalty. The summarized effects enable assessing the influence of relational benefits on satisfaction, commitment, and loyalty in several markets and across cultures to give a set of recommendations for researchers and managers looking for foreign markets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Commitment; Confidence benefits; Individualism/collectivism; Loyalty; Meta-analysis; Relational benefits; Satisfaction; Social benefits; Special treatment benefits",""

To further unpack these complex relationships, the current study investigates the role of gender as a moderating variable on the moderation effect of brand value between perceived social media interactivity and perceived social media agility. In this regard, an online survey (N = 275) was conducted to measure the constructs of interest. PROCESS Models 1, 3, and 4 were used to test the research hypotheses. The results show that individuals perceive highly interactive brands as more agile on social media, leading to high brand trust levels. The results also indicate that the positive link between perceived social media interactivity and perceived social media agility is contingent on consumers’ perceived brand value. The results further display that the conditional effect of perceived social media interactivity on perceived social media agility as a function of brand value is moderated by consumers’ gender.

Despite the usefulness of such reviews, consumers may have difficulty finding reviews suitable for their own preferences because those reviews possess significant preference heterogeneity among reviewers. Differences in the four dimensions of individual reviewers (Experience, Productivity, Details, and Criticalness) lead them to have differential impacts on various consumers. Thus, this research is aimed at understanding the profiles of multiple influential reviewer segments in the service industries under two fundamental evaluation principles (Quality and Likeness). Based on the results, we theorize that reviewer influence arises from writing either reviews of high quality (Quality) or reviews reflecting a significant segment of consumers’ common preferences (Likeness). Using two service product categories (restaurants and hotels), we empirically identify and profile four specific influential review segments: (1) top-tier quality reviewers, (2) second-tier quality reviewers, (3) likeness (common) reviewers, and (4) less critical likeness reviewers.

As sellers benefit from displaying several reviews with favorable ratings, many sellers solicit reviews from customers. When a customer places an order on an e-commerce platform, the seller gets a notification to fulfill the order, and the customer is notified of the estimated delivery date. Some customers receive their products on time, while others receive their orders either earlier or later than the notified delivery date. After customers receive their products, the sellers often solicit reviews. This research focuses on the impact of delivery performance on review ratings. Specifically, this study addresses two questions: (1) Do customers reward sellers for early delivery in the same way they penalize them for late deliveries? (2) What is the role of the temporal distance of rating in online ratings in the context of delivery performance? The study estimates ordinal logit models in the Bayesian framework. Findings of the study indicate that customers give much lower (a little higher) ratings to orders delivered late (early) than to orders delivered on time.

This study contributes to the literature in two ways: first, by the more comprehensive manner in which performing arts consumers are segmented and, second, by comparing subgroups along all elasticity regions (i.e., elastic, unitary and inelastic) of a performing arts demand curve. Structured surveys were administered to nearly 1900 subjects. This study distinctively enriches segmentation analyses by analyzing the price sensitivity between cluster segments defined by psychographic variables and their expectation of marketing mix offerings, yielding three segments of intrinsics, disinclined and impressionable performing arts consumers. We find that price appeals should be primarily directed at intrinsics, a segment of consumers least drawn to performing arts events and with the greatest price sensitivity. PAOs should seek to maintain the greater price inelasticity among intrinsics and impressionables with differential approaches. In targeting intrinsics, PAOs must meet the higher quality expectations these patrons have of the organization’s core artistic product. Price inelasticity among impressionables can be achieved through targeted programming and advertising efforts to these consumers, a group more susceptible to the influence of external factors affecting buying behavior. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Elasticity; Market segmentation; Marketing mix; Motivators; Performing arts; Pricing; Psychographic",""

However, the marketing analytics literature offers little guidance on how digital marketing analytics tools should be selected and leveraged in service to the firm’s overall strategy. Foundational marketing theory and research concerning the origin of consumer value and the primary importance of the consumer decision journey to strategy formation offer a pathway to evaluating digital marketing tools and analysis in a strategic and theoretically sound manner. This paper builds on seminal marketing thought to propose a conceptual framework that places use of digital marketing analytics tools and channels in the context of a firm’s marketing plan. The framework has diverse applications across many industries and platforms and can help markers avoid falling victim to digital marketing analytics myopia, even as evolving technologies and broader societal forces like the response to Covid-19 accelerate the digitalization of marketing. © 2021, The Author(s).","Consumer decision journey; Digital marketing analytics; Integrated marketing communications; Marketing myopia",""

Normal regression, or ordinary least squares, has been used predominantly to analyze count data in experimental studies, while the appropriate models for count data analysis such as Poisson regression have not been fully embraced in consumer behavior research. The fact that only a small fraction of published papers in consumer behavior research with count data have used Poisson regression calls for a push to rethink the common approach of using normal regression for count data analysis. To demonstrate the importance and value of using Poisson regression for count data, we first discuss the parametric forms and properties of both normal regression and Poisson regression, and then show readers through large-scale simulated experiments that Poisson regression is the appropriate model to use for count data, not only because of better model fit but also because of lower error rates in hypothesis testing in various experimental settings, which is critical for consumer behavior researchers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Consumer behavior research; Count data; False negative; False positive; Hypothesis testing; Poisson regression",""

This understanding will help brand managers to understand how individuals who are heavy users of a variety of brand communities will be different from individuals who are more focused in their individual brand community membership. The study used a cross-sectional survey that was conducted among the members of various brand communities (N = 503) from Canada and the United States. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to examine the strength, effect, and significance of the relationships. The results of the paper confirm the impact of the number of brand communities a person is a part of on brand community satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty, and behavioral loyalty—but not on social and physical promotion. Furthermore, brand community satisfaction was significantly related to the delight construct. The delight construct also had a significant relationship with attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. Finally, attitudinal, and behavioral loyalty were significantly related to social and physical promotion.

In this article, a comparative experiment between two demand forecasting models is conducted to forecast an aggregate time series in Brazilian food retail on a twelve-year horizon. Performance was analyzed by comparing the accuracy of a linear model, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and a non-linear model, and Wavelets Neural Network (WNN). Performance was validated by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and U-Theil, with a view to achieving the most accurate measurement of demand responsiveness, using the Fill Rate (FR). WNN had the best performance, with a FR of 98.43%, whereas SARIMA achieved a FR of 102.23%.

Both areas are diagnosed from perspective of managers’ and researchers’ perception based on two-community theory. As such, research expands understanding of the marketing research effectiveness in term of complex system of interrelated elements, of organizational and methodological nature. Further, by exploring research effectiveness in firms, this work provides insights about determinants of organizational learning, allowing firms to leverage research and information more effectively, by instituting structural, procedural, organizational and methodological changes, as well as by seeking appropriate personal skill sets among managers and market researchers. Research findings indicate that organizational constraints of the research effectiveness ensue not only from information-users’ personal shortcomings in decision-making processes, but the lack of basic knowledge on marketing research. Further constraints reveal a deficiency of ‘organizational code’, as part of specific culture inside business organizations. While methodological errors center on the conceptual aspects of research designs. Importantly, managers neglect the methodological sphere of effective research, while market researchers neglect the organizational sphere of managing information within this research. Practical implications of study, provide answers to questions: how to prevent methodological errors in the research processes; how to expel organizational barriers in term of managing information in business organization; and how to combine both streams to increase the overall marketing research effectiveness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Information-providers; Information-users; Marketing research effectiveness; Methodological errors; Organizational constraints",""

These are estimated by three orthogonal components—disconnection, irrationality, and deceit. We identify the best interactional patterns of borrower-lender profiles, ones that expectedly minimize the risk of default. We resort to discretized, predator–prey Lotka–Volterra equations where lenders act as predators and borrowers as prey, incorporating market trends and learning effects. To mathematically operationalize our framework, we use combinatorics with high, medium, and low levels of the three components of DFPs. We find 27 salient lender-borrower interactional scenarios and observe three different patterns: explosive, conducive, and implosive. Our theoretical findings indicate that equal (ir)rationality (in financial terms) between lenders and borrowers is a necessary but insufficient condition to maintain harmonious, long-term relationships. We use eutectic theory to map the agents’ profiles by introducing another variable: Expected return [E(Rp)] versus risk [σ], using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as a base. We find six market segments: the inactive predators and prey, the loose, the greedy, the vulnerable, and the stable. We identify the optimal combination of borrowers–lenders interaction under risk, given market trends and learning effects. We propose a path for future research that would see the application of analytical tools such as factor analysis, k-means clustering algorithm, χ 2 and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests to verify differences among the hypothesized segments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Borrowers; Combinatorics; Dark financial profile; Deceit; Disconnection; Eutectic; Irrationality; Learning; Lenders",""

This study outlines a modeling method that uses customer data (product offers made to each current or potential customer, features, discounts, and customer purchase decisions) to estimate a mixed logit choice model. The model is estimated via hierarchical Bayes and machine learning, delivering customer-level parameter estimates. Customer-level estimates are input into a nonlinear programming next-offer maximization problem to select optimal features and discount level for customer segments, where segments are based on loyalty and discount elasticity. The mixed logit model is integrated with economic theory (the random utility model), and it predicts both customer perceived value for and response to alternative future sales offers. The methodology can be implemented to support value-based pricing and selling efforts. Contributions to the literature include: (a) the use of customer-level parameter estimates from a mixed logit model, delivered via a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure, to support value-based pricing decisions; (b) validation that mixed logit customer-level modeling can deliver strong predictive accuracy, not as high as random forest but comparing favorably; and (c) a nonlinear programming problem that uses customer-level mixed logit estimates to select optimal features and discounts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","B2B; Machine learning; Mixed logit; Nonlinear programming; Sales data",""

Using a latent class model, we classify respondents according to variables that measure consumer search for new automobiles. We unveil changes in characteristics of the six latent segments of car shoppers. Our main findings show that, over the years since the advent of the Internet, the segment of car buyers who mainly search through car dealers/stores has been shrinking drastically. We also find evidence that, over time, the heavy Internet user segment has become less likely to have decided on the manufacturer/dealer prior to searching.

The various factors affecting this are studied to maintain an excellent relationship with customers. Self-service technology (SST) is widely implemented by companies in service sector. This paper proposes to apply the customer satisfaction survey to investigate factors influencing the customer satisfaction. The relationships among the factors are discovered using PC-algorithm. The critical factors are identified to be inputs in regression tree and ANN to estimate the customer satisfaction level. By means of comparison of models, importance of selected inputs is quantified and discussed. The results show that customer satisfaction has strong connectivity relationship with personal service attributes as well as affective and temporal commitment by running PC-algorithm. ANN validated by 10-fold cross validation is the best among the models. The most important factor influencing the satisfaction level to the companies is the customer's desire of continuing a relationship.

Thus, the present study aimed to explore the influence of children’s emotions induced by food product TV commercials, particularly pleasure and arousal, on their purchase loyalty. It also examined the moderating effects of socio- and concept-oriented family communication patterns on this relationship. The empirical analysis of survey data of 209 fifth- and sixth-grade Iranian students through confirmatory factor-analytic approaches and structural equations modeling indicates the need for reflecting on their emotions as they intend to make purchase decisions. Our findings reveal that children’s emotion exercises a significant impact on their purchase loyalty and the more positive they feel about a product, the more loyal they remain towards it. Regarding the moderating roles of family communication patterns, it is found that these maverick consumers make purchase decisions independently regardless of their parents’ communication styles.

The study demonstrated that normative and predictive expectations in conjunction, rather than separately, generated commensurate levels of customer satisfaction and emotions. Another finding of the current study is the moderating effect of emotional valence on the relationship between emotional arousal and satisfaction. The valence sign changes the direction of the relationship between emotional arousal and satisfaction. Positive emotional valence strengthens the relationship between them; in contrast, when emotional valence is negative, arousal negatively impacts satisfaction.

If consumers remain loyal to a brand, it is because they understand, sympathize with, and value the brand’s concept. However, few studies have focused on brand concept as a factor of loyalty. Therefore, this study verified the influence of the brand concept on repurchase intention. Through multiple regression analysis of Apple MacBook Pro, Dyson Big Ball, Nintendo Switch, Facebook, Starbucks, and Tokyo Disney Resort users in Japan, the first hypothesis—consumers who recall a brand concept are more likely to have repurchase intention than those who recall specific features when asked about brand attractiveness—was supported. Furthermore, Fisher’s exact test supported a second hypothesis—consumers with high loyalty maintain high-level construal, even if they use a brand frequently and recall the concept as the brand’s attractiveness, contrary to construal level theory. By introducing the viewpoint of brand loyalty, the conditions under which construal level theory does not conform were shown.

Rough set theory, analysis shows that the maximum one-to-one correspondence exists between the brand's reputation, the fabric quality, and the information quality for a product with each brand, irrespective of the brand type. The C4.5 decision tree analysis and multilayer perceptron theory show that the reputation and quality of the fabric are also accountable for selecting PLB over NB, besides price. The choice of colors is the conspicuous attribute of a PLB choice, followed by ease of availability in online stores. The study demonstrates that retailers should focus more on brand image and brand repositioning than keeping price gaps to satisfy young customers. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Consumer perception; National brands; Perceptual mapping; Private label brands; Private label strategy; Rough set theory",""

Younger patrons are visiting casinos less frequently than their older counterparts, thus increasing the pressure to market to guests effectively. In this study, we investigate the differences in marketing, gaming, and entertainment preferences under the lens of Generational Cohort Theory (GCT). A survey with a discrete choice design was used to measure each generation’s gaming behaviors and marketing preferences, while a hierarchical Bayes model was used to examine intergenerational differences. The results show that younger cohorts have an increased preference for social-based gambling activities and greater preference for non-gaming offers. Considerations are noted with recommendations for the industry to help cultivate customer loyalty amongst the younger generations, which may ensure firm viability for years to come. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Casinos; Conjoint analysis; Free play; Generation Z; Generational Cohort Theory; Promotional offers",""

The findings show that fit may not have a linear relationship with the choice of an extension when loyalty and brand familiarity are considered. Loyal consumers’ likelihood to choose high-fit and moderate-fit extensions is not much lower than their likelihood to choose products from familiar competitors. We also find an inverted-U-shaped relationship between choice behavior and degree of perceived fit for loyal and moderately loyal consumers. Moreover, brand concepts can make a brand more elastic and extendable, increasing loyal and moderately loyal consumers’ likelihood to choose moderate- and even low-fit extensions. However, disloyal consumers are highly unlikely to choose extensions over products from familiar competitors regardless of fit and types of similarity. Finally, the effect of similarity on consumers’ choice of extensions is fully mediated by loyalty and perceived risks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","Brand concept similarity; Brand extension; Brand familiarity; Brand loyalty; Feature similarity",""

The resulting visualizations clarify the interpretations regarding which brands are similar, with overlapping confidence regions, and which brands are distinct, given non-overlapping confidence ellipses. The modeling is first demonstrated on a small, synthetic dataset and then on real consumer data. The model extension is shown to be useful, and it is relatively straightforward in implementation.

Research suggests that, in developed countries, quick service restaurants are more common for deprived (poor) districts. As a result, in such countries, people with low income consume more fast food. In Russia, the situation is slightly different. The majority of popular quick service restaurants are located in the central districts of large cities. In some regions of Russia, there are no fast food chains at all. Taking into account the studies suggesting that living in places with a high density of quick service restaurants leads to higher consumption of fast food, we can assume that, in Russia, people with average or above average income consume more fast food. The standard HoReCa research techniques did not provide sufficient results that could fully disclose the reasons for the quick service restaurant industry development in Russia. Therefore, the author decided to apply the constrained association method. The method made it possible to comprehensively study all the issues that consciously and unconsciously could concern the respondents, detect the emerging trends of the studied market, and clarify the limits to acceptance or rejection of fast food by the respondents. This method also allows forming attributes affecting customer satisfaction, comparing competing brands by their attributes, specifying brands with large customer equity, detecting merits and flaws of various brands, the attitude of respondents to the stimulus word and explaining the reasons for negative, neutral and positive reactions, identifying feelings and emotions experienced by the respondent to the stimulus word, and explaining the causes of their occurrence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Associative method; Associative network; Customer satisfaction; Fast food industry",""

Therefore, in some cases, delivery times can be shortened by exceeding a company’s manufacturing and sales ability. However, the excess inventory accumulated due to the constant shortening of delivery times decreases the willingness to consume, and the brand value may decline due to consequent price reductions. Therefore, it is important to build an appropriate supply system by understanding the conditions under which the length of the delivery time adversely affects purchase intentions. The focus of this study is on the fact that, for the first candidate car, delivery time may not adversely affect the purchase intention. The impact on purchase intentions is examined under a randomized controlled trial within the Japanese automobile industry by extending the delivery time from 3 to 10 weeks. The results reveal that extending the delivery date of the first candidate car had no effect, but extending it for the second and subsequent candidates decreased purchase intentions. Thus, the consumer’s psychological time changes depending on purchase intentions, even if the wait time is physically the same. Therefore, for products with the highest category share, it is not worthwhile to excessively decrease delivery times. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Automotive industry; Delivery time; Excess inventory; Psychological time; Randomized controlled trial",""

Although earlier studies treat promotions as an interim activity to dissolve excess stock, starting from the 1980s, promotions had been seen as a critical element in creating a sustainable sales trend for the products. This paper focuses on the significance of the effect of promotional decisions on mean level and volatility of category sales trend. We employed time series methods, including exogenous variables. In our investigative methodology, sales trend considered in two different contexts, first the current level of sales, which corresponds to an increase in average sales trend and later variability of sales, leading to change in the level of uncertainty in category sales. To illustrate this research question, we use data belonging to one of the largest supermarket chains in Turkey.

We select the “laundry powder detergents” category sales quantity as a pilot category. The study exhibits that promotion policy variables have a significant effect on the average level of category sales. However, the uncertainty caused through promotional variables has a weakly significant effect compared to their impacts on the mean level of sales. Our study verifies previous studies claiming promotional variables significantly positively affect the mean level of sales trend. Besides, we found concrete evidence that the volatility of sales trend has a diminishing effect on the trend, while most of this adverse effect stemming from sales series own endogenous volatility process, not promotional variables. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Market Response Models; Sales Promotions; Time Series Models",""

"Consumer sentiments toward brands: the interaction effect between brand personality and sentiments on electronic word of mouth","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088831871&doi=10.1057%2fs41270-020-00085-5&partnerID=40&md5=245c11ca8ed368857007f1ae8d7afcf8","Consumers can exchange real-time brand opinions through social media, hence requiring brands’ urgent attention. Therefore, can customer sentiments expressed in social media influence electronic word of mouth (e-WOM)? This research identifies customer sentiments’ influence on e-WOM and their differences based on brand personality. Brands have significantly different personalities; thus, we argue that sentiments (e.g., anger, anticipation, disgust, fear) that increase or decrease e-WOM also differ based on brand personality (sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness). Data from the top 100 most valuable global brands and more than 50,000 brand tweets were collected. We conducted a sentiment analysis on these tweets to identify customer sentiments. Then, computed regression analyses were performed, and a random forest model was constructed. This study consistently shows that the interaction terms between brand personality and sentiments are crucial to customer sentiments that increase or decrease e-WOM based on brand personality. For example, joy increases and decreases e-WOM of brands with an exciting personality and a competent and sophisticated personality, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted a cluster analysis to identify main brand clusters based on their personality and shed light on brand structure in the marketplace. We also discussed managerial implications and avenues for future research. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Brand personality; Electronic word of mouth (e-WOM); Sentiment analysis; Social media; User-generated content",""

For this reason, we recommend extreme caution when using the existing procedures, and we argue that enumeration of all-possible variable subsets is a preferred strategy. We also address a common decision problem—the selection of the number of clusters—and develop an index which can help guide the joint selection of variables and clusters. By way of an empirical example, we illustrate the variable-selection problem and demonstrate the use of the proposed index to jointly select variables and clusters in K-means partitioning. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","K-means clustering; New product launch; Pharmaceutical industry; Segmentation; Variable selection",""

One possible solution is to link actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to the fee structure. The main objective of this paper is to model VMT dynamics and establish a methodology for designing an optimal VMT tax rate. The paper proposes a novel model for VMT dynamics and estimates the model parameters using historical data. An optimal control problem is then formulated by designing a cost function which aims to maximize the generated revenue while keeping the tax rate at a reasonable rate. Using optimal control theory, a solution is provided to this problem. Steady-state analysis of this model is provided and simulations are performed for the 50-year period showing the projected VMT, generated revenue, and the optimal tax rate.

Studying a sample of 675 customers and members of cooperative banks in Germany, we find perceived attractiveness to be the most important driver of corporate reputation. Furthermore, we confirm a positive relationship between corporate reputation and loyalty, and a mediating effect of both satisfaction and relational trust.

This study analyzes the mediating effect of consumers’ perceived ethicality in the relationship between consumer cynicism/material values and affective commitment by comparing the perception of CSR efforts as weak or strong in the context of cosmetics brands among young women. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was utilized to test the data related to 271 participants obtained by purposive, convenient, and snowball sampling methods. The results reveal that cynicism has a serious negative effect on perceived ethicality that mediates affective commitment, whereas, materialism has a relatively stronger positive impact on perceived ethicality that triggers intensive affective commitment. In addition, perceiving CSR action as weak or strong is found not to change the established affective commitment among cynics, while leading materialists to develop strong emotional bonds through brand ethicality perceived exaggeratedly. Furthermore, cynics are found predisposed to making brand-related judgments on a rational basis, while materialists mostly address such issues on an emotional basis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Affective commitment; Consumer cynicism; Consumers’ brand ethicality; Cosmetics; CSR; Material values; PLS-SEM",""

We analyzed more than 50 million advertisements viewed in eight Gameloft games, and found that more than 139 thousand of them led to an install in another Gameloft game. Propensity score matching was used to account for selection bias in the decision to install the advertised game. This method allowed us to correct observational data to mimic a randomized experiment. Results reveal an overall 20.66% decrease in expected IAP revenues in the current game after the user installs the advertised game. This variation was found to be greater in higher revenue-generating games, but it did not appear to vary depending on the amount the user spent before seeing the advertisement. In the Gameloft context, the decrease in future expected IAP revenues in the current game was lower than the gains in the newly installed game, resulting in an overall 17.69% increase in future expected revenues.

This change in behavior implies redesigning the strategic management of the brands, in terms of the relationship with the customer.

Can analytics uncover the linguistic “plot arcs” and resulting sentiment or emotion in political text? This paper examines how natural language processing (NLP) and data visualization tools and methods in analytics can play a key role in marketing political candidates. Using publicly available text messages, the authors employ NLP techniques to transform the text observations from the past campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump into a linguistic “corpus” and story arc visualizations. The methodology includes the use of Syuzhet and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. The resulting data visualizations reveal the story arcs associated with the candidate’s communications, and they provide a means to analyze the unbiased political sentiment or hidden emotion in the text. In an analysis of the results, the authors found distinctly different story arcs and vocabulary usage among the three Presidential candidates. The contribution to the literature is a methodology for extracting the story and the resulting sentiment from text messages for marketing campaigns. The authors suggest that the techniques used in this paper can assist future research on marketing other products or services that utilize computer-mediated communications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","Analytics; Natural language processing; Political marketing; Text mining; Visualization story arcs",""

Findings indicated that, while both tangible and intangible rewards have an impact on loyalty and assessment of the overall loyalty program, tangible rewards are much more impactful in generating attitudinal loyalty. Furthermore, both types of rewards had a larger impact on the online loyalty program evaluation than on the attitudinal loyalty construct. The current study provides a systematic look at the relationships between online loyalty program rewards and their impact in bringing about desirable outcomes for online loyalty program managers, utilizing a structural equation model to analyze the relevant relationships.

The drastic measures often taken in these situations, especially in cases of negative media attention or a scandal, usually involve dismissal of the related persons. Hence, predicting, monitoring, analysing and measuring SoMe firestorms related to organisations or individuals can be beneficial. This paper describes SoMe firestorms and their effect, using media analysis involving opinion mining. The analysis focuses on the human trash (ihmisroska) scandal that was caused by a local centre party politician in Finland. The politician caused a SoMe firestorm by describing homeless people and substance addicts as ‘human trash’. The analysis utilises machine learning to classify 3300 media hits in the Finnish language to analyse their sentiment during the SoMe firestorm. General conclusions are drawn about the spread and influence of the SoMe firestorm to form a basis for wider global generalisation. The study formulates a scale for quantifying and analysing the influence of SoMe firestorms. The scale includes three classes relating to the exponential rise of the effect, starting from 1, with 3 being the highest. This scale aligns with the literature, which states that these events usually follow the same pattern. The case example provides further direction for the presented 1–3 level scale. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Scandal; Social media firestorms; Standardised measurement",""

The first contributes to the development of marketing theory by proposing a measurement instrument, allowing for the testing of knowledge on the effective marketing research processes, while the second focuses on the verification of that knowledge across two groups: managers and researchers in business organizations from the perspective of a two-community theory of management. In particular, the level of compliance between information-users and information-producers on their knowledge of these processes is investigated. With these objectives in mind, theoretical assumptions of the effective marketing research processes from the methodological perspective are discussed. Next, methodological problems appearing in marketing research processes are characterized. Further discussion speaks about a need for stronger integrity of researchers and managers on the basis of methodological knowledge of effective research processes in order to enhance these processes and improve activities related to planning marketing strategies and decision-making. Finally, when comparing that knowledge on the basis of the empirical study conducted, we implemented the following analytical strategies based on Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) and Multiple Indicators-Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model in reference to a sample 391 of respondents working in multinational companies in a European country (Poland). The results confirmed the psychometric quality of the developed scale of testing knowledge on effective marketing research processes, but also revealed that managers and researchers share slightly different points of view on the effective marketing research processes. Managers exhibit an even greater level of instability than researchers when evaluating these processes, while their insufficient knowledge is due to a lack of conviction that marketing research can be effective in general. Moreover, managers assume that marketing research and research information does not always play a significant role in the activities related to planning marketing strategies and decision-making. Our findings also have practical implications for organizations that wish to improve their internal information policy and make the marketing research more effective with equal engagement of both groups. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","CFA; Effective marketing research processes; Information and knowledge; Information-users (managers); Invariance measurement; Market researchers; MGCFA and MIMIC models",""

In particular, brand-owned social media seems to be an increasingly popular way of enhancing a brand’s position, connecting with customers, and improving customer engagement with the brand. To guide strategic marketing communication decision-making on social media, the current study extends the relationship communication model and offers an analytical workflow to gain new insights from unstructured textual data available on brand-owned social media. The workflow utilizes an eclectic mix of analytical tools such as word clouds, and cluster and word association analyses, which collectively allow for identification of main topics and their temporal evolution in unstructured textual data from a brand’s social media. In doing so, the proposed workflow offers researchers and practitioners a step by step procedure to make sense of such textual data, which may prove unwieldy and overwhelming otherwise. Furthermore, to manifest the utility of the proposed workflow, it is applied to illustrative data collected from a brand’s Facebook page. Results from this example analysis point to a slight fading of the brand’s perceived core position as an event avenue, as well as an evolution of customer sentiments that may reflect different levels and types of customer engagement with the page.

A review of relevant literature on the topic, leads us toward testing the following key hypotheses: consumers are adopting mobile banking due to the perceived usefulness and benefits associated with the concept; and consumers are adopting mobile banking due to technological advances meaning increased access to the mobile phone devices. We published an online questionnaire on Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain responses from Internet users. A dominating proportion of participants highlighted how mobile banking is a concept that they adopted between three and 5 years ago, showing just how recently mobile banking took off. The results also showed a number of links between the study’s research hypotheses and the adoption of mobile banking. The overall result of the study shows online banking as a concept that is influenced by a number of both internal and external factors. No single factor plays a dominating force in pushing retail bankers to adopt mobile banking, with it instead being a culmination of numerous different factors.

This is the stickiness of a dollar, the average time a random deposited dollar remains with the bank. A practical algorithm for calculating stickiness is deduced and theoretical properties of the metric are derived. Stickiness is a metric that can be applied both at the aggregate and at the individual level. Examples are given from a bank with branches in different countries. With these examples it is shown that stickiness has some desirable properties: (1) stickiness at the individual level positively correlates with stickiness at the aggregate level; (2) stickiness increases with time, but slower than at a linear rate and (3) at the individual level stickiness in the future can be predicted by stickiness in the past. As a consequence, stickiness can be regarded as a stable customer variable. It is, therefore sensible to characterize demographic groups, e.g. stickiness increases with age, and to use it as active or descriptive variable for customer segments.

Some believe this era of data driven computational social science has the same potential as the emergence of cognitive science in the 1960s and should not be left to private companies or government agencies. Given the entrance of Big Data techniques to companies and the university setting, it is our role, as consumer researchers, to identify issues that are relevant to our field and to suggest a consumer research method adapted to Big Data. The first section of this article addresses ethical and epistemic issues to consider when conducting marketing research with Big Data. The second section suggests the use of abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers’ digital traces and make new theories emerge. Finally, we present the archetype-based analysis as an example of what researchers can do with Big Data when they adopt abductive, inductive and deductive approaches in the research process. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Abductive reasoning; Big data; Research ethics; Research methods; Segmentation",""

In a first exploratory survey, this relation appeared to be U-shaped. Brand relations are relatively strong for both consumers under 30 and those over 60. In a second survey, a theory-based explanation is sought as to why the importance of brand relation increases with age over 50. The answer lies in a decreased tolerance of ambiguity, consistent with low cognitive-affective complexity. Given hedonic innovativeness and future time perspective, the relation between age and brand relation becomes stronger. The results imply that brands should communicate to older consumers: ‘we have a long future together, our new products are attractive and we don’t take you out of your comfort zone’. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Aging; Brand relation; Cognitive-affective development; Innovation; Socioemotional selectivity theory; Tolerance of ambiguity",""

Specifically, we examined how system support, community value, freedom of expression, and rewards and recognition encourage customer engagement, as well as how customer engagement influences repurchase intention and word-of-mouth intention. We tested the research model with a sample of 276 online brand community members. Empirical data supported our hypotheses, and revealed that customer engagement mediates relationships between community characteristics and brand loyalty.

Knowledge of customer behavior can help marketing managers re-evaluate their strategies with the customers and plan to improve and expand their application of the most effective strategies. B2B or business customers are more complex, their buying process is more complicated and their sales value is greater. The business marketers usually prefer to cooperate with fewer but larger buyers than the final consumer marketer. As a business transaction requires more decision makings and more professional buying effort than the consumer market does, the efficient relationship with business customers is of paramount importance. Most customer segmentation approaches based on customer value fail to account for the factor of time and the trend of value changes in their analysis. In this article, we classify customers based on their value using the RFM model and K-means clustering method. Then, an assessment of changes over several periods of time is carried out.

However, identifying these respondents is a non-trivial task. In the context of multi-item, unidimensional scales, it has been suggested that response variance may hold information about careless responding. This notion was tested in the current research with two studies. Data collected from respondents indicates that people responding carelessly display more variance in their responses than people responding with more effort. Given this finding, a procedure which uses measures of response variance and cluster analysis to identify careless respondents was developed. The effectiveness of the procedure with different specifications was tested with simulated data and validated with data from actual respondents. On the basis of the results, we advocate using the procedure with specifications that conservatively identify careless respondents. Such an approach will identify the most extreme careless respondents, while maximizing the retention of careful, honest respondents.

The present research addresses these issues by presenting a deterministic model that allows managers to determine whether and when sacrificing margins in acquisition is justified from the perspective of CE maximization.

The conventional marketing mix model is often used to inform the tangible elements, but is lacking into two key aspects. Firstly, it ignores the role of intangibles. Secondly, the focus is solely on individual brands in isolation. This ignores the wider competitive context, where the decision to choose one brand is the simultaneous decision not to choose another. Successful brand management, however, requires a simultaneous holistic view of all players. To address both issues, this article argues for a dynamic time series version of the discrete choice attraction model. Firstly, the demand system structure treats the entire category as a single unit, capturing competitive steal, cannibalisation, halo and category expansion effects of brand-specific marketing. This provides accurate marketing return on investment and budget allocation, facilitating the manufacturer-retailer relationship.

The main effort focuses on rebalancing effectively the datasets during training so as to reverse the negative effect of imbalance and to increase the correct classifications for the under-represented class. Distance-based and cluster-based resampling techniques are applied in comparison and in combination in order to understand how customer targeting could become more effective for practitioners. Using a publicly available dataset for direct marketing of bank products, we study the influence of resampling techniques on the different algorithms and conclude that our proposed cluster-based technique is overall the most effective in relation to other well-established techniques. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.","Class imbalance; Classification algorithms; Marketing analytics; Resampling techniques",""

The results of model fitting to an online shopping time series (1998–2009) show that all three models represent the diffusion curve quite well and adequately; however, the Bass model described the online shopping diffusion curve more accurately than the other two models. Forecasting with early diffusion data (1998–2002) suggests that the Bass, Logistic and Gompertz models are unable to adequately describe the diffusion curve from limited data. Nevertheless, the Bass model with the adjusted market potential coefficient (m) produced forecast accuracy that is comparable to the Bass model fitted to the full data (1998–2009).

Positioning helps to clarify brand strengths among competitors and identify potential challenges of similar brands and possible substitutability. Assessments of positioning, from initial marketplace efforts to resources directed at modifications and re-positioning, are frequently assisted by the graphical representations of brands in multidimensional space. Such perceptual maps are constructed to reflect the closeness of brands and therefore the extent to which they are seen as interchangeable, versus distances between brands representing their relative positioning distinctiveness. To create perceptual maps, data are frequently obtained that comprise a sample of respondents rating a series of brands with respect to their perceived similarities and differences, as well as the status of each brand along multiple attributes. This research uses the variability inherent in such three-dimensional data to construct confidence regions around point estimates in perceptual maps. Current maps tend to be simply descriptive, with positions reflected by point estimates, but multivariate models including multidimensional scaling and multi-mode factor analysis can be modified to extract the subject heterogeneity and derive inferential perceptual maps. Confidence regions that overlap will indicate more clearly an inference of brand similarity, whereas non-overlapping regions imply statistically differentiated brand perceptions. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.","Confidence regions; Multidimensional scaling; Perceptual maps",""

The paper shows how the model can be extended to create a cross-classified multiscale model that makes better use of the locational information available to improve the efficiency of the neighbourhood targeting.

Then, we focus on development of models to measure options’ values for better estimation of CLV. In this research, we develop three models based on real options. Each model is useful when the following options are available: option to market penetration, option to customer development through add-on selling and option of stage investment. The applicability of the models is demonstrated by numerical illustrations.

We address this issue by developing a pricepromotion model in which time limits are conceptualized not only in terms of their effects on customer awareness but also customer urgency. Further, the proposed model incorporates recent insights from behavioral research which indicates that time limits can either enhance or diminish the effects of discount incentives. A key advantage of our approach is that it places minimal demands on managers’ resources, while also leveraging their unique knowledge of the market. In collaboration with an online retailer who frequently uses price promotions, we examine a real-world promotion and illustrate the insights facilitated by the model. In this empirical context, urgency declines with longer time limits but it does so less steeply when accompanied by larger discounts. Additionally, the managers learned that they tend to use time limits that are too long and discounts that are too small, resulting in foregone profits. We conclude by demonstrating the value of sensitivity analyses for understanding how profits can vary with changes in the environment and with differences in the accuracy of managers’ knowledge about customer responsiveness. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Deadlines; Decision calculus; Discounts; Promotions; Time limits; Urgency",""

The mixed logit (MXL) model, which incorporates random coefficients into the multinomial logit model, has been widely adopted for this purpose. The most commonly adopted method in this context is to assume that the random coefficient follows a continuous, unimodal distribution, and the parameters of the distribution as well as the other parameters for the model can be obtained using maximum simulated likelihood estimation. In this article, we refer to this method as the continuous mixed logit (CMXL) model. This method requires the a priori assumption that the distribution of the random coefficient is continuous and, usually, unimodal. One way to relax this assumption is to estimate the distribution nonparametrically, by assuming a discrete distribution with finite support. We refer to this approach as the discrete mixed logit (DMXL) model. Based on the DMXL model, we propose the mass-point MXL model as one alternative to the continuousdistribution assumption and compare its performance with the latent class logit model (LCLM), also part of the DMXL family. Either model can be used to represent unobserved heterogeneity with a discrete distribution in the parameter space. In this article, we conduct empirical analyses and compare the continuous and discrete representations of unobserved heterogeneity in logit models using simulated data with known parameters and real data with discrete choices. Analysis with simulated data provides insights on the ability to distinguish between continuous and discrete parameter distributions and a better understanding of the goodness-of-fit measures used in evaluating model performance with real data. From the simulation study, we find that when the data is generated from a normal distribution, the CMXL model with the unimodal-distribution assumption is preferred to the DMXL mode. From the real data analysis, we find that the CMXL model fails to recover heterogeneity that is identified by the DMXL model. In conclusion, we suggest that when estimating a random-coefficient MXL model, one should start with a CMXL model, but should not accept a ‘no heterogeneity’ conclusion without estimating a series of DMXL models using either the mass-point MXL model or the LCLM with different starting values. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Discrete distribution; Logit model; Maximum simulated likelihood estimation; Unobserved heterogeneity",""

A sample of 56 articles from high-quality marketing journals examines the components of the brand value proposition statement, applicable theories, and descriptive findings. There has been an increased interest in the research on brand value propositions as value creation becomes more customer-focused and value-based selling becomes more pervasive. This exploratory study suggests an ongoing need for examining the effectiveness of types of brand value propositions in terms of both the managerial process in which they are constructed as well as the precision of such brand promises on customer understanding. The paper concludes with a suggestion for more robust empirical research on the construction and deconstruction of brand value propositions, a need for more managerially focused research, and a future research that examines the under-researched area of how value propositions are effectively communicated on branded websites. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.","Brand promise; Brand value proposition; Citation analysis; Customer value; Systematic review",""

Central to business growth and survival, customer retention is an important issue that every business strives to understand and harness. While some studies have attempted to determine the factors that influence customer retention, few measure it quantitatively. However, businesses have long been eager to have quantitative information concerning their customer base: How many of their customers they can consider retained at any given time? What time lapse should trigger an alert that the customer may have defected? Based on real purchasing data from a Web retailer, and using 80 percentage of assurance as an example, this paper proposes a customer retention assessment method by calculating the aggregate 80th percentile of maximum inter-purchase times and confirms the validity of this method by showing that the assessment successfully sets apart valuable customers, in terms of number of orders, average spending per order, and total spending. This research not only enables researchers to undertake longitudinal studies of customer repatronage behavior, but also helps practitioners monitor customer retention effectively. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","B2C electronic commerce; Customer retention; Empirical study; Inter-purchase time; Repeat purchase behavior",""

The primary objective of this article is to fill the gap in the literature by examining the key determinants in physician sample-dispensing and quantity decisions at the individual-physician level while controlling for targeted marketing activities and unobserved physician heterogeneity. We conceptualize the dual roles of drug samples, experimentation and subsidy, in physicians’ prescription decision making, empirically test for the existence of these dual roles, and quantify their long-run sales impact using physician panel data from two therapeutic categories. Our analysis yields strong empirical support for the existence of the dual roles in physician sample-dispensing behavior.

Besides reduced prices and sales promotions, sellers have recognized many other factors that entice consumers to visit retail stores like, pleasant experiences, eye-catching displays and store aroma, and so on. Retailers need to understand the buying behaviour of the consumers and the variables associated with it. The purpose of the present study is to scrutinize the inter-relationship among various antecedent factors that define impulsive buying behaviour among shoppers. From past researches, this study extracted antecedent factors constituting impulsive buying. Through extensive discussions among experts from industry and academia, a qualitative assessment of the relationship between these factors was undertaken. With mathematical computations, as suggested under Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), a conceptual model is proposed to explain impulsive buying. The model reflects that all the six congregating factors do not trigger impulsive buying directly. It follows a hierarchy-of-effects model, with merchandising display initially sparking the urge for impulsive tendency. Merchandising displays increase the effectiveness of both – promotional schemes and incentives, and retailer-induced instore efforts. These two factors further enhance the effect of socialization and crowd in malls, which cumulatively contribute to arousal of hedonism that eventually leads to impulsive buying. The retail industry, especially the mall developers and supermarket/hypermarket may use the findings in strategizing to enhance their ability to engage, arouse and achieve impulivse buying among shoppers. The proposed hierarchical model with interconnection of these component factors will be of immense interest to retail/mall managers and researchers.

The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to identify latent dimensions for classifying respondents. χ2 and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests were used for verifying differences among segments. Four segments were identified. Each segment exhibited significant differences in demographic characteristics, product knowledge and attitudes toward FEVs. Dissimilar knowledge and attitudes toward FEVs among identified profiles, with heterogeneous perceived benefits, suggest the advisability of implementing differentiated communication strategies to foster a still embryonic market.

However, these studies used regression analysis and found significant effects of each of the determinants regardless of other variables. Taking a different perspective, the present study uncovers the “causal recipe” (combination of antecedent conditions) of helpfulness review by applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Congruent with elaboration likelihood model, this study finds that high argument quality and high source certainty, together in a review, do not make a review helpful, and consumers use heuristics (peripheral cues) when reading a long review. Negative as well as long reviews are found to be helpful. Real consumer reviews collected from Amazon.com are used for this study.

Second, campaigns for different customer segments need to be planned in advance to balance the costs and the success of marketing activities. For these tasks, we propose a process, starting with rule-based classification, including an evolutionary algorithm combined with a nearest-neighbor technique to obtain understandable, optimized rules. The classification results lead to product rankings for each customer. We cluster the rankings with p-means, using a modified Canberra distance, so that we obtain customer segments.

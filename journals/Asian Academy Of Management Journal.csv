"Investigating the factors of consumers’ purchase intention towards life insurance in bangladesh: An application of the theory of reasoned action","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098062630&doi=10.21315%2faamj2020.25.2.6&partnerID=40&md5=6337709ca470f47f426a003b37783193","This study aims to examine the factors that influence consumer purchase intention towards life insurance. The study included religiosity, risk aversion motives, saving motives, and financial literacy with classical Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), therefore extending the model. A convenience sampling method was employed to collect data from 315 respondents working in different public and private institutions in Bangladesh. Collected data were analysed using the structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that attitude, subjective norms, risk aversion motives, saving motives, and financial literacy have a significant positive impact on consumer purchase intention towards life insurance. Moreover, religiosity was found to have a negative impact on purchase intention. In addition, saving motives was found as a mediator in the relationship between risk aversion motives and purchase intention, as well as between financial literacy and purchase intention. Since attitude and subjective norms were found to have the most effect on purchase intention, the study implicated that marketers should emphasise company image, reputation, and the credibility of the agents, together with the significant others to whom we often turn to before making any financial decision. Finally, the study offered directions for further research after divulging several limitations. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.","Bangladesh; Financial literacy; Life insurance; Religiosity; TRA",""

This study compares this mediating effect in developed and developing countries using agency theory and signaling theory. A panel sample of 2,688 firms in developing and developed countries is analysed for the period of 2002–2017. The empirical findings demonstrate that corporate innovation fully mediates the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance in developed countries. However, innovation partially mediates the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance in developing countries. This could be because of different socioeconomic factors and capabilities of innovators involved in corporate governance structure. The study has both theoretical and policy implications and provides insights for policy makers for identifying the influence of innovation on firm value and evaluating the importance of corporate governance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.","corporate governance; developed and developing countries; firm performanceinnovation; mediating effect",""

Apart from strengthening tax revenue collection, Indonesian government must also investigate the role of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) that potentially affects domestic investment in the negative way. Hence, it is the objective of this study to examine the impact of OFDI on Indonesian domestic investment for the period between 1980 and 2018. By applying vector error correction model, we observe that OFDI has significant adverse effect on domestic investment.

Given this condition, this study intends to examine the effects of governance mechanisms and CSR practice on firm performance and the moderating effect of board independence is investigated on corporate governance-CSR (CG-CSR) and performance nexus of 588 Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia between 2006 and 2017. Both accounting-based (ROA) and market-based (Tobin’s Q) performance measures have been used for measuring performance. Dynamic model using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) has been employed on the dataset to control for potential endogeneity, reverse causality, and dynamic heterogeneity. Findings indicate that ownership concentration negatively affects ROA; chief executive officer (CEO) duality positively affects ROA and negatively affects Tobin’s Q. Moreover, investment on CSR is negatively related to both performance measures. Finally, board independence negatively moderates the CG mechanisms, CSR practice, and performance relationship. Findings of the study have implications for Bursa Malaysia and Securities Commission Malaysia to reset the limit of independent directors on board so that their unnecessary interference in operations of management may be avoided. Furthermore, companies need to reassesstheir CSR strategies whether they are spending on CSR activities or hiding their financial malfeasance in the name of investment on CSR. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.","Board independence; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Firm performance; Malaysia",""

Currently, the existing legislation has discouraged trade union activities and this has directly deprived the employees of their rights for a better working conditions at the workplace. There is also an evidence of anti-union actions taken by employer in recognition claims in order to prevent collective bargaining with trade unions. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an important tool in an organisation where the interests of the stakeholders is sustained.

However, in the face of uncertainty and competition, the decision to divest a subsidiary from a market becomes a critical decision for MNEs. This study suggests that the factors for divesting subsidiaries are related not only to the performance of the subsidiary but also to slack resources and sunk costs. It analysed 254 subsidiaries in Taiwan and found that the better the subsidiary’s performance is, the less it would decide to divest from the market. Additionally, it was found that the subsidiary with slack resources would be a moderating variable with a positive impact. In addition, the presence of sunk costs reinforces the positive effect of slack resources on the relationship between subsidiary performance and the non-divestment of the subsidiary.

However, lesser is known about the Malaysian students and employed jobseekers’ intention to apply for jobs on the corporate companies’ websites. Therefore, this study aims to assess the subjective perceptions of these two groups’ intentions to apply for jobs on the websites. This study also aims to analyse the mediating effect of organisational image on perceived person-job fit (P-J fit) and perceived website usability (PWSU) which may be moderated by these two groups of jobseekers’ intentions. The conceptual model was first analysed using two-level confirmatory factor analysis. Adopting Hayes’ Model 7 template, AMOS software was used to differentiate the two groups’ perceptions. The results indicate that the perceived P-J fit and PWSU are the main factors influencing jobseekers’ intentions to apply for jobs on corporate websites. The moderated mediation technique has identified an indirect effect between perceived P-J fit and the intention to apply for jobs indicating the importance of established organisational image that it arouses applicants’ pursuit intention. Thus, the corporate human resource managers need to ensure the sites are designed for easy navigation and job advertisements that contain updated job information and realistic job preview. Using this platform, companies can reduce costs and time for the recruitment of talents. This study provides the subjective perceptions of jobseekers’ intention study and it contributes to the first component of Planning Theory of Intention.

The current environment has transformed the internal working pattern, structure, and communication system to survive the rough business ecosphere. Consequently, SMEs encountered innumerable barriers to achieve the innovation performance and the SMEs should recognise the internal barriers so that they are able to accelerate their innovation performance. Therefore, this study aims at examining the internal barriers namely constraint in financial resources, constraint in technology, and constraint in human resources that hamper the innovation performance among the Malaysian manufacturing SMEs. This study embarked on two phases of data collection. First phase includes a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 participants from 5 SMEs via snowballing technique to gather their insights on internal barriers that impede innovation performance. For second phase, the survey method was adopted, and 217 SMEs responded to the survey. All the responses were analysed using SmartPLS technique. The interview findings demonstrate that all the internal constraints are indeed important for SMEs to grasp and serve as the obstacles for innovation performance. Nevertheless, from the quantitative analysis, only financial constraints serve as the significant barrier that impede innovation performance. To summarise, this research produces insights on decisive proof regarding internal barriers that inhibit the manufacturing SMEs to achieve innovation performance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.","financial constraints; human resources; innovatioperformance; internal barriers; SMEs; technology",""

The results show that OCR fully mediates the relationship between the instrumental climate and the escalation of corruption. Instrumental climate leads an individual to OCR, which impacts on the corruption escalation. The analysis also shows that loyalty can moderate the effect of instrumental climate on OCR. It indicates that a level of loyalty enables an individual to filter the impact of instrumental climate on OCR. Besides, the intention of corruption also contributes to the escalation and snowballing effect of corruption. Surprisingly, it is also found that individuals with their experiences tend to be more expert, skilful, and efficient in committing acts of corruption.

This paper explores the effect of ERPT on domestic inflation in Vietnam by comparing with other Asian economies. Specifically, pass-through mechanisms are examined for every single price as well as a distribution chain from import price index (IMP), producer price index (PPI) to consumer price index (CPI). The empirical results show that exchange rate shocks positively influence the price changes in Vietnam as well as in other Asian countries. According to Cholesky decomposition, the exchange rate plays a limited role in regulating CPI movements. Besides, world commodity prices are found to have a significant impact on domestic inflation across the sample-countries.

Islamic law or Shariah gives a significant prominence to environmental care. The responsibility to care for the environment is set at individual and societal levels, as outlined in the primary sources of Shariah. In line with the industrial and vast economic development, the modern jurists have extended the moral and religious obligations to firms. Environment is an important element that supports the objective of Shariah or maqasid al-Shariah, which is to safeguard the interests of all beings. However, the current devastating state of the global environment, including those of Islam-majority and Islam-dominated countries, poses major challenges to the maqasid al-Shariah. Environmental degradation is threatening the dharuriyyah level of maqasid al-Shariah, or the basic necessities of human. In view of this devastating phenomenon, this paper highlights the relevance of Islamic legal maxim of harm prevention, and how it can provide an impetus to the global environmental sustainability in modifying human attitudes and actions pertaining to the environment. We conclude that progressive interpretations of Shariah by way of incorporating vast economic development and social changes are important to address new necessities of maqasid al-Shariah. While holding on to the principles of Shariah, religious rulings pertaining to environmental matters are to be aligned to the current changing needs and problems of the society. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.","contemporary Islamic society; environmental sustainability; maqasid al-Shariah",""

Evidence from the Muslim employees working in different industrial sectors in Australia, New Zealand, United States, and Canada have been used to explore the positive outcomes of inclusive organisational climate propositioned by the growing Muslim community in the Western workplace. This exploratory qualitative study presents the findings from 30 interviews with purposively selected Muslim employees working in the Western economies. Recursive abstraction and thematic approach have been used to analyse the data. The findings supported the popular assumption that inclusive organisational environment positively influences the desired employee outcomes among the Muslim employees that may lead to the attainment of various organisational goals. The findings also revealed that Muslim workers in the Western workplace feel more comfortable and included in a work climate where co-workers from different backgrounds or orientation are interested and encouraged to discuss their faith, values, and practices openly instead of carefully avoiding such conversation in the social interaction. Inclusiveness, to the Western workers with Muslim identity, is more about the interaction and behaviour of their co-workers at a personal level and less about the organisational system level mechanisms.

This study examines the impact of workplace bullying on young employees’ outcomes in Vietnamese firms. Based on the conservation of resources theory, a sequential mediation model of five constructs (workplace bullying [WPB], work-life conflict [WLC], job satisfaction [JS], work support, and negative well-being [NWB]) was studied. Data from 238 young employees of different sectors was used to test the hypothesised model. The research data were analysed using AMOS version 22 to examine the constructed hypotheses. The results confirm that bullying is, directly and indirectly, related to employees’ outcomes in terms of job satisfaction and NWB. Furthermore, the mediating effects of WLC on the relationships of bullying, job satisfaction, and NWB are confirmed. Contrary to previous research, work support did not mediate these relationships. In order to lessen the level of perceived NWB, it is essential to reduce negative acts at work as well as enhance the understanding of this phenomenon.

Nonetheless, empirical research on this potential behaviour has received limited attention in hospitality research. Drawing from self-determination theory (SDT), this study tests a conceptual model that examines the mediating role of harmonious passion between cooperative psychological climate and IWB within the hospitality industry. This study also recognises the importance of servicing empowerment as the boundary condition between harmonious passion and IWB. We further developed a moderated mediation model to test the above said relationships. A total of 257 employees who worked in the four-and five-star hotels in Pakistan participated in the study. Partial least structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the data. Results reported significant mediating effect of harmonious passion between cooperative psychological climate and IWB. The relationship between harmonious passion and IWB was strengthened to the extent that servicing empowerment in the hotel firms was high. Furthermore, the indirect effect of cooperative psychological climate on IWB (via harmonious passion) was stronger when the servicing empowerment was high. Practitioners looking to enhance harmonious passion and IWB can do so by creating a cooperative climate in their hotel firms. This study carries value as research on harmonious passion in the organisational context is still unexplored and this study extends the scope of cooperative psychological climate research that this factor has the potential to foster employees’ harmonious passion leading them display IWB. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.","Cooperative psychological climate; Harmonious passion; Innovative work behaviour; IWB; Servicing empowerment",""
"Examining influence of religiosity on ethical attitude towards business: Evidence from india and china","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098002186&doi=10.21315%2faamj2020.25.2.3&partnerID=40&md5=f5b14bc785d114e255ac43041bf5f606","The primary purpose of the paper is to examine how religiosity influences ethical attitude towards business and to compare and contrast this relationship for two populous Asian countries: India and China. The socio-cultural setting of both the countries resonates strongly weaved religious values and traditional ideology, though with a disparate political system. Using Attitude towards Business Ethics Questionnaire (ATBEQ) and 10-item Religious Commitment Inventory (RCI-10), data from 231, i.e., n(India)=122 and n(China)=109, respondents is collected, and research variables are compared based on gender and country of origin. Men demonstrate a higher ethical attitude towards business, higher religiosity, and higher score on ethical business philosophies than their women counterparts. Additionally, Indians score significantly higher than the Chinese on the three constructs. The results of regression analysis demonstrate that religiosity influences ethical attitude towards business for men, women, and Indians only. The relationship is not supported for China. The study further deconstructs religiosity into two subscales: intra (inner interpretive understanding) and inter (outer demonstrative action) religiosity to examine their influence on ethical attitude towards business. Individuals with higher intra-religiosity have a higher ethical attitude while no such relationship is evidenced for inter-religiosity. Even further, items of ATBEQ are mapped to represent four ethical business philosophies and their differences compared on the basis of sub-constructs of religiosity. Variations in ethical business philosophies are shown by intra-religiosity only. Essentially, it is not about preaching religion, it is about practicing a religion that really matters. Freedom to practice religion, religion-based teaching, and ethical values embedded into business practices could help shape new virtue ethics as an inspiring point of reference and guidance for business leaders. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.","Business philosophy; Ethical attitude towards business; Ethical philosophies; Intra-religiosity inter religiosity; Religiosity",""

How is opportunity discovered and perceived that will eventually trigger and stimulate entrepreneurial action? An ongoing conversation in entrepreneurship concerns the clumsiness in the definition of opportunity – whether discovered or created, objective or subjective. Can opportunity exist independently, as a pre-existing object, even without being observed by any actors? Or is opportunity subjectively and socially constructed? Are they real or artificial? This paper articulates opportunity as a holographic representation that provides cues and signals to alert entrepreneurs to act. We attempt to explain how opportunity-as-hologram inspires and motivates entrepreneurial action. The proposed opportunity-as-hologram construct (or holographic opportunity) is representationally valuable as it embraces the various definitional variations and clarifies the opportunity concepts underpinning entrepreneurship. Central to this paper are the re-casted perspectives on opportunities by addressing the major conceptual issues at the core of entrepreneurship theories. The three views – discovery, creation, and actualisation of opportunities – can be valid and mutually non-exclusive in holographic terms. This paper explores implicate and explicate orders and quantum theory concepts theorised by physicist David Bohm. This conceptual construct of holographic opportunity contributes to the ongoing dialogues on the opportunity, improves the conceptual clarity of opportunity, and opens new research and practice possibilities. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.","complexity science; explicate order; holographic representations; implicate order; propensity",""

This study examines the factors that influence Malay, Muslim Malaysian men to work in two careers generally dominated by women, which are nurse and “pak andam” (Malay bridal beautician and consultant). Using a case study qualitative approach, the author investigated the factors that influence male nurses (N = 14) and “pak andam” (N = 5) to work in occupations generally considered to be the main domain of women in Malaysia’s culture. Data from semi-structured interviews revealed that the reason why men become male nurses is mainly caused by external factors, which are family obedience, financial disadvantage, and religious obligation. However, during their journey in becoming nurses, they developed their passion for nursing. In contrast, the males who become “pak andam” do so mainly because of personal factors, which is their interest in beauty and fashion.

In doing so, they remain silent and conform to all the decisions taken by the top management. Most studies have treated the causes of this silence as unobserved intervening mechanisms and named them black boxes. The current study therefore, aims to explore those unobserved psychological characteristics of employees. More specifically, it examines the employee’s psychological ideology, namely liberalism and conservatism in affecting commitment to status quo mediated by employee silence and moderated by social dominance. This study proposes that employee ideologies (liberalism and conservatism) affect their voicing behaviour and ultimately their resistance or acceptance to the status quo. Data from 219 faculty members from different universities in Karachi, Pakistan was gathered. The study hypothesised that liberals will tend to voice their opinions and resist the managements status quo while conservatives tend not to voice their opinions and endorse status quo, and they accept management’s decision and will not question their actions. The results showed that liberals have an indirect relationship with silence, namely they do not remain silent. Additionally, silence had an indirect relationship with status quo. Even though they are silent it does not mean they endorse status quo. Further, it was found that silence mediates the relationship between liberals and commitment to status quo. It was also found that conservatives also endorsed status quo but there was no relationship between conservatives and silence. Further, silence did not mediate the relationship between conservatives and status quo. Moreover, social dominance orientation strengthens or moderates the relationship between silence and status quo. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.","conservatism; employee ideology; liberalism; management; silence; status quo",""

Thus, we seek to understand when and how cognitive absorption is beneficial for individual learning. The proposed model was tested using data obtained in a field study (N = 371) and in an experiment (N = 119). For field study, data was obtained at two points in time from three data sources (co-workers, subordinates, supervisors) working at a private commercial bank operating in Pakistan. For laboratory experiment, data was collected from the business students of a private sector university in Pakistan. The obtained data for both studies were analysed for random coefficient models with Mplus. Based on the motivation-ability-opportunity theory of behaviour, we proposed a model. It was found that cognitive absorption and highest individual learning was contingent upon the individual level knowledge absorption capacity. It was further found that training programmes with high cognitive absorption are likely to produce high levels of individual learning when the participants also have both high level of knowledge absorption capacity and technological opportunity. With this research, we inform practitioners that in these learner-focused trainings, personal characteristics of the participants and technology play vital role in determining effectiveness for high level of individual learning. The research findings will help practitioners understand what they need to add in training programmes for high level individual learning experience.

Utilising random sampling of data in six ASEAN countries, collected in the years 2013 to 2015 and comparing male to female entrepreneurs, the regression results of this empirical study show that although high growth-oriented entrepreneurs in both start-ups and established enterprises account for only 2.7% of all enterprises in this study, high-growth aspirations can only partially be sustained by early-stage entrepreneurs into the next business phase since it depends on several factors: (1) receiving funding (for both genders); (2) being export oriented (for male entrepreneurs); and (3) perceptions of having new products or services to offer to the market (for women entrepreneurs). Both genders are less prone to pursue their initial early-stage growth goals as established entrepreneurs.

The findings integrate the arguments of the resource-based view and the Uppsala model applied in the transition economy that suggest internationalising listed firms acquire certain benefits from the state, and the separation of the highest two positions in such firms facilitates the exact anticipation of uncertainties and risks in making business decisions. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.","CEO duality; internationalisation; listed firms; state ownership; Vietnam",""

The enrollment ratio is also getting high, and universities are putting efforts to attract more students. Hence, it is essential to provide students with the best quality services as it spreads positive word-of-mouth. Therefore, the present article is designed to study the impact of front-desk staff service quality on word-of-mouth through the mediating effect of students’ affective commitment and students’ trust. An online questionnaire survey was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. This study used the partial least square method to run structural equation modeling analysis. The findings revealed that all paths show a positive and significant relationship except front-desk staff service quality and word-of-mouth. Moreover, students’ affective commitment and trust mediate the relationship between front-desk staff service quality and word-of-mouth. Results also illustrate that gender exerts a significant moderating role on front-desk staff service quality, students’ affective commitment, and word-of- mouth. The study provides practical implications for policymakers, private university management, and educational institutions. Firstly, it is crucial to provide effective communication training to the front-desk staff to learn the basic etiquette of greetings and humbleness. Secondly, there must be experienced personnel who can assist students promptly. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

There is no doubt that wellbeing of the employees is one of the secret recipes that generates high return value for all levels of chains; the individual and the organisational productivity and growth as well as nation’s prosperity. However, majority of leadership researchers have failed to capture the multi-dimensional concept of EW. Moreover, the studies of the impact of leadership styles on EW are limited and narrow-focused. Thus, this study aims to examine the role of authentic leadership (AL) style on EW. This study uses meso-mediational relationship through financial and non-financial rewards and meaningful work and how they affect EW. Data were collected from 343 employees in 30 manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The finding reveals that the positivity of authentic leaders indirectly influences EW through non-financial rewards and meaningful work.

A survey method was used for collecting the response of senior level managers of pharmaceutical companies located in Hyderabad, India, and the hypothetical model and structural relationships were tested via structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings of the research present that TR plays a role of mediator in the relationship of TID, TD and succession planning in organisations. This study helps pharmaceutical companies to be future ready for succession planning by using their regular talent management strategies skilfully.

Second, does the internal committee affect bank performance? Hence, this paper determines whether independent directors strengthen corporate boards and whether committees affect bank performance. The panel data ordinary least square regression analysis is used for this study. We also use logistic regression models for various committees to find their relationship with bank performance and NPAs. Tobin’s Q is used as proxy for bank performance. Independent variables are board size (BSIZE), proportion of independent directors on the board (PERIND), number of board meetings per year (BMEET), size of the audit committee (AUC), and two measures of the bank business (asset size and loan), and one control variable is time. We use financial and corporate governance data from 2005 to 2018, the study finds that independent directors play a major role on the board. It finds a positive and significant relationship between board independence and bank performance. The performance also increases with the increase in board size but after a point, the curve declines forming and an inverted U-shaped curve is formed. The mandatory internal committees have a crucial role to play, which is demonstrated by their effect on the reduction of NPAs.

This study used bibliometric indicators of publications indexed in Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection over the last two decades to provide an overview of the main characteristics of its publications. A total of 1,840 papers by 2,607 authors in 518 journals were reviewed. The publications were examined in terms of temporal trend, geographical and institutional distribution, references, authors, and citations. The results indicate that the importance of venture capital research is increasing. In terms of impact, a small group of productive countries (e.g., USA and UK) and authors (e.g., Cumming and Wright) contributed to a significant share of these publications. Whereas China is expected to attract more attention to this topic in the future. Harvard University is the most productive institution and the Journal of Business Venturing is the most active journal. By topic, publications that address the contribution of venture capital to entrepreneurship are the most cited. New areas of research have focused especially on the implication of signal theory in venture capital networks, support for decision-makers and crowdfunding as a new investment strategy. Today, the micro-level is the dominant level (compared to the macro-level) in venture capital research.

Despite a plethora of branding and knowledge management literature, a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of brand orientation and knowledge creation process together on organisational performance. The studied tourism entrepreneurs exhibit low involvement in branding activities and knowledge creation according to government of Malaysia sources. The significance of brand orientation and knowledge creation process for improving the organisational performance of tourist resorts remains inconclusive. For this study, empirical data was drawn from 322 tourist resorts in Malaysia. The hypothesised relationships are analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that brand orientation and knowledge creation process have a positive and significant effect on organisational performance whereas knowledge creation process partially mediates brand orientation and organisational performance. We propose higher involvement of tourism entrepreneurs in knowledge sharing sessions to develop distinctive brands to attract customers, which will in turn improve organisational performance.

Furthermore, prior studies have extensively focused on earnings management around initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), while less attention has been given to the listing event. Another motivation comes from the context of the undeveloped market. While earnings management has been widely discussed in developed countries, it is still limited in emerging countries in general and in Vietnam in particular, due to the lack of research on this phenomenon and the unique institutional feature and pre-listing profit requirement in Vietnam’s stock market. This research is conducted to investigate the earnings management behaviour around listing event in Vietnam. The sample of this study consists of financial data from 189 newly listed companies on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HOSE) for the period of 2009–2017. Four cross-sectional models were used to estimate earnings management, including two total accruals-based models and two current accruals-based models. This research makes important contributions to the body of literature on Vietnam’s stock market. First, this study provides empirical evidence suggesting a greater positive earnings management practice of newly listed firms in current accrual models than those in total accrual models. Second, the results from both parametric and non-parametric test statistics show that HOSE-listed firms present higher levels of earnings management in the year prior to the listing than those in post-listing year and two subsequent years after listing. Finally, new listing requirements in 2012 require the company’s return on equity (ROE) in the most recent year to be at least 5%. However, the paper finds no evidence to suggest that relative to all newly listed firms after the new profit requirement exhibit greater positive earnings management than that of firms listed before the change in pre-listing year. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Accounting accruals; Earnings management; Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange; Listing requirements; New listings",""

Data from 242 respondents were collected using a stratified random sampling technique, and the partial least square (PLS) program was used to analyse the correlation between variables. The results showed that managers who tend toward strategic flexibility can be identified by their personality traits, such as their approach to gathering information, decision-making, and relate with the external world. However, sources of energy do not significantly influence strategic flexibility. On the other hand, strategic consistency can be identified by personality traits such as a source of energy and decision-making. However, the way of gathering information and relate with the external world did not show a significant influence on strategic consistency. Therefore, if top management requires more strategic flexibility, managers with an intuitive, judging, and thinking-oriented personality will be more aligned with this strategy.

This study involves a qualitative approach using NVivo text analysis tool to analyse texts and word frequency from 44 references, including 35 journal articles, six policy papers, two books or book chapters and one conference proceedings. The results show that Public Sector ICT Management Review was the top journal with the highest coverage of the study’s main themes, followed by the Journal of Education for Teaching, the Human Resource Management Review, and the Advances in Health Science Education indicating the importance of the value-based workforce in these four areas of employment (i.e., public sector, education, human resource, and health). The word frequency analysis also shows the five most-used words were “values,” “work,” “based,” “selection,” and “recruitment.” These findings show that the references used in this study are valid and reliable relevant to the study’s main themes. Value-based workforce relates to value-based recruitment – building a value-based workforce begins with a good recruitment strategy. In the Islamic context, Islamic work values are highly influential and Islamic work-related values have been used as recruitment conditions for hiring employees during the Prophet Muhammad’s (pbuh) time and the rightly guided caliphs. If incorporated into the value-based model of recruitment, Islamic-related work values could potentially build a value-based workforce. This study has a significant implication to managers especially in finding good employees for the success of the organisation. Recruiting employees through value-based recruitment and selection is believed could reduce many work-related issues and improve organisational effectiveness.

The Wavelet-Granger causality provides us further insights into the lead-lag relationships between oil prices and China’s economic activity from an economic perspective. The dynamic time-frequency association findings suggest crucial implications that might assist policymakers and other market participants in mitigating risk. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.","causality; economic activity; oil prices; VAR-GARCH-BEKK; wavelet analysis",""

To analyse the data, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to check the influence of both service quality and application quality on passenger loyalty and their indirect influence through passenger perceived value and passenger satisfaction. The result shows that the passenger perception of mobile app quality is an important driver of passenger loyalty towards AMT services. Further, this study suggests that the effect of both service quality and mobile app quality on passenger loyalty is via strengthening passenger perceived value and satisfaction. Finally, this study’s findings reveal the important role of mobile app quality as the determinant of AMT service quality.

The banks are somewhat converged with their conventional peers. Consumers believed that the banks imitate their peers pertinent to the pricing calculations and product lines. Without effective measure, consumers may discern Islamic banks undermine their maqasid objective and continued critics of mimicking their peers are prolonged. Against this backdrop, this study examines consumer preference using a proposed index known as the Maqasid Consumer Preference Index (MCPi). Drawing upon the MCPi, the present study examines consumer preference for six Islamic banks operated in Malaysia to which Islamic home financing products are presently made available. Our data were drawn from valid 450 usable questionnaires. The results obtained report that six Islamic banks relatively have a moderate index. Of these, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB) is ranked first, followed by Maybank Islamic, CIMB Islamic whilst Kuwait Finance House is ranked last. This work examines a new approach to measure consumer preference using the MCPi. Our contributions are confined to these particular factors - educating customer, establishing justice, and promoting welfare in the context of Islamic home financing in Malaysia. Future works may provide a different perspective on these interrogations by considering new dimensions to extend the findings. Despite this concern, the results obtained offer improved insights for bank managers to manage Islamic home financing products effectively. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

The obtained data were then analysed for random coefficient models with Mplus. It was found that having only quality LMX will not guarantee the validation of co-workers’ ideas. The focal employee needs to signal to others that they also care about their co-workers and have quality LMX. Subordinates who maintain quality relationships with their supervisors also need to consider what they signal to their co-workers by their behaviours and actions at work. Co-workers are more likely to provide support for creativity to those who are more supportive at work.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,339 participants above 20 years of age of which 351 had contracted illness in the past and 988 had not. Data was collected using questionnaire from four highly populated districts in India. The questionnaire was developed based on the constructs of health belief model. The data was statistically analysed. Kendall’s Tau-b correlation technique was used to explore the relationship between perceived vulnerability and product aversion. Logistic regression was used to find out the odds at which each independent variable, categorised based on the health belief model, contributes to willingness to buy. The model was able to predict 15% of the variance for willingness-to-buy among the illness and 27% among the non-illness groups. Findings suggest that the perceived vulnerability reduced product aversion among the illness group. Mere presence of primary and super-specialty hospitals was not sufficient for the illness group to subscribe for health insurance. Income perceptions emerged as a significant predictor among the illness group. Presence of well-established hospital, income perceptions, and subjective norms were significant predictors among the non-illness group. The growth of the health insurance industry largely depends upon the presence of well-established hospitals.

Given the focus on intention to create an international business venture and the working segment, we expand the entrepreneurial event theory by supplementing perceived competence and job satisfaction as determinants of entrepreneurial intention while testing the mediation of perceived feasibility and perceived desirability in such relationships correspondingly. Three focus groups on 27 Vietnamese employees were conducted to explore the specific relevant competences and develop the conceptual model. Afterwards, data from an empirical survey on 567 Vietnamese employees was analysed using a partial least squares structural equation model to test the hypothesised relationships. The empirical results indicate that perceived competences, viz. administrative competence, communication skills, network building competence, and international business expertise have a positive impact on entrepreneurial intention. The relationships between either administrative competence, network building capacity or international business expertise, and entrepreneurial intention are totally mediated by perceived feasibility. The study also reveals a noteworthy finding about the negative direct effect of overall job satisfaction on entrepreneurial intention and the partial mediating role of perceived desirability in this relationship. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.","Competences; Corporate venturing; Employee motivation; International entrepreneurship; Job satisfaction; Perceived competence",""

Achieving strong growth in today’s primary eyecare market presents a challenge for many independents as they face new uncertainties from competition and regulatory reforms. Compounded by their inability to offer lower prices as well as lacking individual negotiating power with manufacturers, many small independent opticals have turned to buying groups to help reduce product acquisition costs as well as to stay competitive as independent entities. A mail survey of 200 independent opticals was conducted, and the data was analysed using structural equation modelling. The two dependent variables of interest are repurchase intentions and relational tolerance. The effect of affective commitment is positive and significant for both repurchase intentions and relational tolerance while calculative commitment only had a positive impact on relational tolerance. Findings further suggest that both transactionaland relational-specific investments help govern the relationship between buying groups and independents in an uncertain environment. Transaction specific investment increase independents’ calculative commitment as it creates value in the form of cost saving and profit enhancement. At the same time, this study corroborates arguments from social exchange theory regarding the role of relational mechanisms in reducing opportunism by enhancing independents’ affective commitment. However, while the bright side of social capital has often been the focus on buyer-seller relationships, the positive relationship between relational embeddedness and calculative commitment supports the emergent notion of the dark side of social capital. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.","Environmental uncertainty; Relational embeddedness; Relational tolerance; Repurchase intentions; Transactional embeddedness",""

To this end, the goal of the currently presented work is to determine and empirically validate the said EC factors in relation to the entrepreneurial environments of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)-5, namely Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, both at the regional and national levels. For this purpose, the presented research adapted the entrepreneurial perceived capabilities framework to first investigate the key determinants of EC that affect key entrepreneurial processes, such as the seeking of new opportunities and the decision to venture into new commercial opportunities, within the context of ASEAN-5 economies. Next, the identified variables were empirically tested via an examination of their coefficients in relation to their impact on entrepreneurial perceived capabilities. Succinctly, the current work applied recent consistent estimation of panel bootstrap random-effects model to determine time variant changes with respect to the studied variables in the panel sample. The data used in the current work was obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and World Competitiveness Yearbook (WCY) databases for the years 2010–2016. The results of the current work suggest that factors such as beliefs regarding entrepreneurship as a good career choice (EnGC) and perceived opportunities (PO) yield significant positive impact on the efficiency of EC in ASEAN-5, and can be nurtured to further improve EC environments both at the regional and national levels. Conversely, the fear of failure (FefRa) variable was shown to exert considerable negative impact on the efficiency of ASEAN-5 EC environments. Variables such as intellectual property rights (IPR), university education (UE), and knowledge transfer rate (KT) were also shown to have a positive impact on both national and regional ASEAN-5 EC environments. The current work thus makes a valuable contribution to the associated literature by presenting a robust empirical analysis of EC factors of ASEAN-5 economies, the results of which can be used to inform policies aimed at strengthening the EC settings of ASEAN-5 with respect to their pursuit of an innovation-driven region. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.","ASEAN-5; Entrepreneurial capability; Entrepreneurial environment; Panel Bootstrap (PB) analysis; Random effect model",""

Theoretical arguments for business environment and performance go in both directions. That is, on the one hand business environment enhances SME’s performance; on the other hand it also impedes its operation. Using these arguments, we hypothesise that both favor treatment of local government for state-owned companies and bribery (or ""speed money"") are negatively related to SME’s performance. Promotion policies of local government for private firm and local labour force have positive effects on SME’s performance. We test these hypotheses in a survey data from 63 manufacturing and service SMEs locating in three provinces of the Mekong Delta within the period of 2011 and 2012. Using fixed effect and random effect models, the empirical results release that local government’s favour policies for private firms and labour force have positive effects on SMEs’ performance. The results revealed that although bribery has positively related to SME’s performance, this relation becomes negatively when the level of bribe is high. A major implication is that the study provides better understanding for SMEs in addressing the local environment factors, which significantly affect SMEs’ performance. The results of this study can also be used as reference for anyone who is interested in start their own business providing insights into decision-making in starting a business and also for any SMEs which are interested in continuing to sustain and grow. In addition, bribery enables SMEs to use government resources, avoid red tape, and thus foster revenues. High levels of ""speed money"" increasingly absorbs the returns on SME activities, and distort entrepreneurial spirit and behaviour because favourable relationships with public officials provide entrepreneurs legitimacy and thus decrease the risk for closure. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.","Bribery; Labour force; Local business environment; SMEs; “Speed costs”",""

Historically, the country's Constitutional ""heads of power"" were intended to prohibit the federal government from regulating individual aspects of the employment relationship. Over time, such interpretations of the constitutional powers were challenged by governing parties, resulting in the modern-day, ""national"" unfair dismissal protections afforded to the majority of workers. The journey Australians traversed during the architecture of their current unfair dismissal legislation provides a lesson on a government's ability to conjure significant influence on individual arrangements between management and workers. Despite Australia's participation in the worldwide, neoliberal push to deregulate labour markets, the protection of workers from unfair dismissal is an explicit matter in the employment relationship attracting increased regulation through industrial legislation.

The study found that an audit firm size has a significant impact on the likelihood that an auditor agrees with offering audit exemption. The larger the size of the firm, the greater is the likelihood of agreeing with allowing audit exemption. Therefore, it is suggested that small audit firms (with 5 or fewer employees) merge and focus on activities that contribute more added value such as consultancy. In so doing, auditors from these firms would be required to improve their knowledge and capacity by offering these services and not merely focusing on traditional audit work for SMEs. This is because SMEs are known to have limited resources and capacity and thus would be expected to have poor internal control. The requirement of a mandatory audit for such firms might lead auditors to compromise their independence.

The empirical results indicated that only entrepreneurial competency and technology usage are related to successes of small businesses. However, this study found insufficient empirical evidence to support the relationship between marketing capability, financial resources, knowledge sharing, and business success. As this study was confined to the small businesses under the FELDA scheme, this provides valuable findings by uncovering the differences among the critical success factors due to the different reasons for formation of the small businesses.

As a mirror to an Islamic type of insurance, Takaful agents play significant role not only to sell the Takaful products, but also to behave according to the Islamic norms in front of their customers. Thus, this research is conducted to introduce new concept of Islamic relationship marketing (IRM) and investigates its significance towards customer gratitude, trust, and commitment in the industry. A total of 741 of Family Takaful customers in Klang Valley area have participated in the survey conducted in this study. Few statistical analyses were performed to confirm the proposed measures of IRM including descriptive, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), measurement model, and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Through EFA and measurement model, four variables were confirmed to measure the IRM which are Islamic ethical behaviour, social, structural, and financial bonds. Furthermore, these measures of IRM have significantly affected customer gratitude, trust, and commitment via SEM analysis.

One glaringly prominent aspect is the absence of a spiritual/religious interventionist approach in exploring the lack of consumer awareness that led to the present situation. Instead of attempting to solve the problem through brute economic policies, a wasatiyyah-oriented approach is warranted for informing consumers of their religious obligation to avoid profligate spending and adopt moderation in financial matters. Hence, the objective of this study is to examine the practice of moderation (the concept of wasatiyyah) among Muslims consumers in their financial decision-making.

This study offers a contextualised insight on the link between entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation and cultural differences (operationalised using cultural distance, or CD). In particular, through highlighting the moderating role of CD, this study has developed a matrix of entrepreneurial opportunities based on cultural differences for EMEs, which can be useful for both EMEs and the host country’s administrative agencies. By accounting for culture in articulating the findings, this research contributes to theory by bridging the institutional-individual divide in entrepreneurship discussion through an institutional lens.

The extant literature on this has majorly focused on the antecedents of impulsive shopping, prominent among these include traits (like sensation-seeking and impulse buying tendency or IBT), motives (utilitarian, hedonic), shoppers’ resources (time and money), and marketing stimuli. Although personality is a key determinant of consumer decision-making, the role of personality traits, specially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, in impulse buying is not conclusive. Also, there exists a need for analysing impulse buying behaviour with respect to product-specific situations rather than general IBT. The present study fills this gap by analysing the role of three personality traits on impulse buying. A scenariobased online experiment was conducted, and the sample respondents were randomly categorised into two groups. The former group had respondents with an instrument to measure their IBT in general, while the later had respondents for whom the instrument was shared with a scenario built around the product category of apparel. With the data set of 386 respondents, the study reveals that the relationships between the two personality traits—extraversion and neuroticism, and IBT—are independent of the product category.

Because the Malaysian society is considered to have a higher level of trust than other Asian countries, we used a snowball sampling method and recruited 377 employees from 44 private organisations (62% response rate) in Malaysia as participants in the current study. Multilevel analyses revealed that management trust climate led to higher levels of personal development and job performance; however, it showed no relation to sleeping problems.

Existing studies suggest that foreign ownership may either increase or decrease the quality of financial reporting, suggesting that foreign ownership is explained using two conflicting hypotheses: The active-monitoring hypothesis and the transient hypothesis. In emerging markets, where family ownership is predominant, conservatism is an important measure of financial reporting quality because conservatism decreases opportunistic management behaviours and mitigates information asymmetries. This paper tests conservatism as a proxy for financial reporting quality using three piecewise accrual models, proposed by Ball and Shivakumar (Journal of Accounting Research, 44, 207-256 (2006)); the cash flow model, the Dechow and Dichev model, and the Jones model. This research finds that foreign ownership is positively associated with conservatism in all three models.

Malaysia’s employee engagement score values were recorded at 61% and 59% for years 2015 and 2017, respectively. Low quality condition of new vehicles produced by Malaysia’s national automotive manufacturing companies is potentially caused by non-engaged employees.

Because the role of a CEO is the core factor determining performance in business management, the behavioural characteristics of CEOs can determine the outcomes in a company. This study was conducted from the viewpoint that personality factors contribute to behavioural characteristics. The causal relationships were analysed among the six HEXACO personality factors (honesty-humility, extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotionality), the learning and growth of organisations, and performance in business management. For this purpose, a survey was conducted of the current CEOs of SMEs over a period of approximately 10 months, extending from 21 May 2015 to 22 February 2016. A total of 172 valid data were collected and used for the analysis of this study, and the results were as follows.

Such efficient risk management measures are paramount in building robust and sound financial systems. This study provides a new approach for measuring risk management efficiency levels in banks by offering a more detailed insight into the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach based on the usage of a financial risk instrument. Comparatively, the results of this study confirm the findings by Hahn (2008) indicating that Japanese banks are superior in terms of managerial efficiency when compared to European and US banks.

Even though the overall result found the sheepskin effects serve as a higher signal of productivity compared to years of schooling in enabling individuals to seek higher returns in the labour market, the sheepskin effects from both diploma and university degrees are different between two phases: 2002–2007 and 2007–2012. The over-education and under-skilled situation respectively occur among degree and diploma holders in the Malaysian business services sector might be evidence that the sheepskin effects for both credentials are limited to provide higher signal to employers compared to university dropout between 2002 and 2007.

The sample used in the study is composed of crude palm oil futures (FCPO) and crude palm oil (CPO) prices for the January 2007 until December 2011 period. The period is divided into two sub-periods: Period I (January 2007-July 2009) before Shari'ah-compliance and Period II (August 2009-December 2011) after Shari'ah-compliance. The results of the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Philips Perrons (PP) unit root tests suggest that the CPO and FCPO series are integrated at first difference. Johansen's co-integration test indicates that FCPO and its underlying spot market (crude palm oil) for both periods are co-integrated, implying that there is a causal relation between the two markets. In period I, the estimated results of Vector Error Correction model (VECM) indicate a one-way causality direction from the CPO market to the FCPO market in the long run. This can be interpreted as a price discovery process that occurs from its underlying spot market to the FCPO market.

Therefore, it is highly imperative for mall managers to ascertain features that would differentiate them from their competitors. The objective of this study is to segment and profile shoppers based on their orientation towards different factors associated with an organised retail using hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering techniques. Two segments were identified through the analysis. Each segment was profiled in terms of mall attractiveness characteristics, demographics and behavioural factors. Results of both hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis suggests two prominent groups among shoppers, namely relatively higher aged service class people and young students. Constituents of these segments also reveal distinct patterns. The younger segment pays more importance to variables like mall events and promotional schemes being organised by malls and/or retailers.

The present study adds to the literature investigating the effects of FDI as a spillover channel through which foreign trade enhances the relative demand for skilled labour in 50 Malaysian manufacturing industries during the 2000-2008 period. Our empirical results based on the generalised method-of-moments system estimator reveal that the spillover effects of FDI are significant for skill upgrading and, in turn, lead to increased demand for skilled labour. Although the coefficient for FDI indicates a negative relationship between FDI and skilled labour demand, the effect of FDI is positive and statistically significant. This result gives an indication that the spillover effects of FDI appear to be quickly assimilated by workers in the Malaysian manufacturing industries through the ""learning effect"" and that the fast pace is biased towards skilled workers. Nevertheless, this study finds no evidence of spillover effects from trade on the demand for skilled labour. The findings from this study potentially contribute to long-run FDI policy, especially to encourage FDI inflows into low receiving industries. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.","FDI; Skilled labour demand; Spillover effects; Trade",""

The results of this paper show that SPMS significantly and positively influences organisational learning and IS strategic alignment. The strategic communications and dialogues between the employees of an organisation, which are the mechanisms provided by SPMS, enhance the degrees of the IS strategic alignment. According to the results, it was observed that organisational learning and the IS strategic alignment have significant and positive effects on the construction of IT infrastructure for KM. Thus, the clear directions of IT development, which are formed with the integration between IS strategy and business strategy, seem to shape the goal orientations of the members in a firm and to enhance their collaborations in the construction of the IT infrastructure. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia 2016.","Competitive applications of knowledge resources; Information systems (IS) strategic alignment; Information technology (IT) infrastructure for knowledge management (KM); Organisational learning; Strategic performance measurement systems (SPMS)",""

In a sample of 390 Malaysian public sector subordinates, the relationships between conflict management styles (bargaining and problem solving) and psychological strain (somatic strain and depressive symptoms) was explored. Based on social exchange theory, it was further expected interactional justice to work as a moderator in this relationship, buffering the negative consequences of bargaining styles for subordinates with supervisors whom are having high rather than low interactional justice. Results indicate that bargaining was positively associated with somatic strain, while problem-solving was negatively associated with both somatic strain and depressive symptoms. As hypothesised, the PLS-SEM product moderator indicator approach analysis revealed that perceived interactional justice buffered the negative consequences of bargaining styles on somatic strain and depressive symptoms. This study’s primary novelty is to highlight interactional justice as a “helping hand” protecting against the negative consequences of bargaining styles among subordinates. Consequently, it has a main practical implication for organisational management aimed at sustaining the well-being for their manpower. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.","Conflict management styles; Depression; Justice; Strain; Well-being",""

Accordingly, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used in examining the effects of FD and gross fixed capital formation on MPE. Using a yearly time series data spanning from 1991 to 2016, the results revealed that there is a cointegration between FD and gross fixed capital formation on MPE.

Women entrepreneurs are known to be persistent and resilient in running their business. However, it may be interesting to focus on factors or components that contribute towards their resiliency. Hence, this study explores the critical components of entrepreneurial resiliency which play a significant role in the business survival of women entrepreneurs during and after undergoing economic crises. The term resilience comprises three components, namely hardiness, resourcefulness, and optimism. Hardiness refers to adaptive capacity, and not easily discouraged by failures. Resourcefulness, on the other hand, relates to cash flow, investment, relational networks, material assets, and the ability to adapt to changes, while optimism means the preparedness to make decisions, take action, and the ability to see the humorous side of things. The sample of the study consisted of 100 women entrepreneurs, mainly food operators in Klang Valley who were selected randomly. Most of the women entrepreneurs were aged above 30 years, and more than half have more than 10 years’ experience in running their business. A set of questionnaire with items on entrepreneurial resilience and its components-hardiness, resourcefulness, and optimism-was used to gain information among women entrepreneurs. The findings show that the most critical components for resilience during crises was resourcefulness, while optimism emerged as the most important component after undergoing crises. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.","Hardiness; Optimism; Resilience; Resourcefulness; Women entrepreneurs",""

The Malaysian government is confident of achieving the target provided that the human capital is leveraged in ensuring innovation at the highest level particularly among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, only few studies have considered human capital as a factor that mediates the effects of other variables on innovation. Therefore, this paper aims at investigating on how human capital dimensions namely uniqueness, value and pro-activeness will be leveraged by pro-innovativeness organisational architecture dimensions that is allocation for free time, work discretion, rewards, and tolerance for risk taking in order to achieve innovative performance. A structured study instrument was used for data collection purpose. A total of 1000 active SMEs were selected via simple random sampling from Malaysia Small and Medium Enterprises Directory 2011/12. A total of 263 SMEs responded to the questionnaire. However, a total of 262 usable questionnaires were thus secured for analysis. The analysis was then conducted via Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed several interesting findings: (a) rewards has an influence on the uniqueness, value and pro-activeness of human capital; (b) tolerance towards risk taking has an influence on human capital (uniqueness, value and pro-activeness; (c) uniqueness of human capital has an influence on innovative performance and (d) uniqueness of human capital mediated the relationship between tolerance for risk taking and innovative performance.

Data were drawn from self-administered surveys completed by 55 2GOs and 3GOs. Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses were conducted to interpret our findings. The findings show that management styles, relationships between family members, values and beliefs and successor training significantly influence family business performance levels. The relationship between antecedents and business performance is found to be partly mediated by succession issues and fully mediated by sucession experience. Both theoretical and practical implications and avenues for future research are discussed © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.","Business performance; Family-owned firms; Succession",""

In particular, internal and external factors found in previous studies were applied to the analysis in order to investigate whether or not those factors had a significant effect on the business stability of Korean credit card firms. The major research findings are as follows. First, the determinant factors for profitability were found to be the degree of enlargement, foreign credibility, and the level of risk management. Second, the determinant factors for capital adequacy were found to be the degree of enlargement, diversification, foreign credibility, the level of management, and the interest rate. Third, the determinant factors for loan soundness were found to be the degree of enlargement and foreign credibility. Lastly, the determinant factors for liquidity were found to be the degree of diversification, foreign credibility, the level of risk management, the degree of competition, economic conditions, and the interest rate.

However, in tandem with a changing socio-cultural environment and an increase in educational opportunities, women have started recognising their inherent talents and business skills. With the help of various governmental and non-governmental agencies, growing numbers of women are joining the ranks of entrepreneurs. However, in the existing familial and societal setup, entrepreneurial women are overburdened and find it increasingly difficult to balance their work and life roles. Therefore, the major objective of the present study was to develop and validate an appropriate tool to illustrate the work-life balance (WLB) issues faced by women entrepreneurs of South India. We also sought to understand the important factors influencing the WLB of these women entrepreneurs. To achieve this end, data were collected by area sampling (cluster-random) paired with semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire.

Thus, ERP eventually leads to an efficient and competitive business. Despite the prominence of ERP systems, approximately three-quarters of ERP projects are deemed as failures. Most failures are attributed to the misfit between pre-loaded business models in the ERP system and business requirements in the real world. This paper introduces a framework to classify ERP misfits into logical categories that provide insights for solution derivation. Subsequently, the classification methods are applied to a case study.

We suggest that firms based in countries with a higher level of rule of law will invest more FDI per capita in host countries with comparable or higher levels of legal protections. Further, companies based in countries with a lower rule of law are accustomed to lower degrees of institutional safeguards. For these latter countries, the comparable levels of rule of law between home and host country will not as strongly impact FDI per capita. We test our logic through an examination of FDI from two home countries with different levels of rule of law: Japan (high) and South Korea (medium). Using FDI data from Japanese firms in 114 countries and South Korean firms in 118 countries, we find that while rule of law is a predictor of FDI per capita, the relative nature of the rule of law between home and host countries in higher rule of law home countries is also important. In addition, we discover that companies from Japan, a high rule of law country do seek out similar or higher rule of law environments for higher levels of FDI per capita investments while companies from a medium level rule of law country, South Korea, are less beholden to institutional standards. Our study contributes to the literature looking at the impact of country-level factors on foreign investment decisions, suggesting that it is the comparative rather than absolute values that are important to understand as well as the institutional environment in the home country.  © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.

However, this is not necessarily true when it comes to the field of strategy. Although it is widely accepted that firm performance is an essential variable in the strategy literature and that diversification is the most commonly studied variable of strategy (Dess, Gupta, Hennart, & Hill, 1995) the issue of proper operationalisation is conspicuously absent. It is readily observable that there is a plethora of measures being employed to measure both diversification and firm performance. However, the measures of performance and diversification that have been employed have not been unanimously agreed upon. In addition to this general state of confusion, the issue of international variations across measures has not been evaluated.

Trusting relationships are even more important to small businesses with limited operational resources, which makes partnerships with foreign importers an important strategic consideration. When exporters pursue these endeavours, they are able to leverage partner company competencies. Organisations gain market knowledge and, thereafter, a greater export competitive advantage. This study examines the antecedents of relationships between small and medium export and import enterprises. This study also investigates the effects of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) relationships on exporters' competitive advantage. Based on a sample of 228 SMEs, trust positively and significantly affects competitive advantage.

This work was done to expand our understanding of performance appraisal and to highlight its uses in connection with other human resource management and development functions. The study finds that previous researchers devoted the most attention to PA conducted for administrative purposes, followed by PA for developmental purposes; the strategic category of PA was studied somewhat, whereas PA for purposes of role definition was almost ignored.

As interdependent team based work has become an inherent characteristic of the workplace, role ambiguity while working is quite inherent in such organisations. By gaining better clarity regarding individual roles, employees can impact their role performance significantly. Data were collected from 176 employees of a large information technology organisation using survey technique by physically administering the questionnaire with the help of the Human Resource department in two phases; first from the employees and co-workers and finally from the supervisors. Subsequent data analysis was performed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results showed that feedback seeking both from a supervisor and co-workers ameliorated the effects of role ambiguity on role performance. Specifically, compared to feedback seeking from co-workers, feedback seeking from a supervisor was found to be more useful in reducing the effects of role ambiguity on role performance.

The intriguing results of this transformation include the development of various sustainability programs and initiatives that has increased for three decades. The myriad of research in this area focuses on creating opportunities that would minimise, if not eliminate, the impact of manufacturing activities on the natural environment and society. However, previous approaches seemingly detach their association to the competitive function of manufacturing. Maintaining competitiveness while pursuing sustainability has drawn interest from practitioners, but this area is inadequately explored in the current literature. Current research directions on sustainability in the manufacturing industry lack foundations on exploring mechanisms that maintain or improve the competitive function of manufacturing. The integration of sustainability issues into manufacturing strategy (MS) implies complex decision-making in manufacturing. Thus, this paper proposes a framework in formulating MS that addresses sustainability issues while taking into account the competitive function of manufacturing. The framework integrates classical theories of MS and sustainability issues derived from previous works. The proposed framework provides guidance for the decision-making of practitioners and researchers in developing a sustainable manufacturing strategy (SMS). This contributes to manufacturing planning at the firm level. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.","Framework; Manufacturing strategy; Sustainable manufacturing",""

With the advent of RFID, organisations have the opportunity to rethink how their organisation will operate and integrate in the supply chain. Especially for Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), that they have limited resources adopting such an innovative technology (i.e. RFID) the adoption decision can be daunting. Literature indicates that SMEs that decide to go on with implementation have so far only a few guidelines from either private companies or public authorities regarding awareness on specific opportunities and risks. This research is therefore trying to explore in detail the factors that affect SMEs' RFID adoption in the Taiwan Information Technology (IT) manufacturing industry. We are employing Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) techniques and utilising a questionnaire survey in order to collect and analyse our data. After classifying the responding SMEs into three different adopters categories named ready adopter, initiator adopter and unprepared adopter using EFA technique our results show that each category has some specific adoption factors related to their unique situation. These are for ready adopters: cost and management, for initiator adopters: competitiveness and process efficiency and unprepared adopters: IT management difficulties, IT implementation difficulties and cost of implementation. A SMEs RFID adoption model is then proposed. It is anticipated that the findings of this research will not only enhance the research in RFID adoption in SMEs, but can also act as a reference for practitioners in the industry and researchers in the academic field. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.","Adoption; Exploratory factor analysis (EFA); Information technology (IT); Radio frequency identification (RFID); Small and medium enterprises (SMES)",""

The survey covered a random sample of 120 private manufacturing firms in industrial zones in the Yangon area. Two broad categories of learning are determined: Internal and external. Internal learning is captured by two domains of learning, individual and organisational, whereas external learning involves customers, competitors and suppliers. Firm performance is evaluated using two broad groups of aspects: Non-financial and financial. The ordinary least square (OLS) results show that first, different domains of learning affect firms' performance differently. Individual, organisational and competitor learning impact firms' non-financial performance, whereas other forms of learning do not. Second, the effect of different domains of learning on performance differs in accordance with the different aspects of performance measurement. Individual learning can explain firms' financial performance both directly and indirectly. However, organisational and competitor learning explain firm financial performance indirectly.

With slow economic growth in its primary trading partners, there is a pressing need for Malaysia to change its current export structure, which relies heavily on western industrialised countries as export destinations. By doing so, Malaysia can diversify its economy through agreements with new export destinations with which it currently has low bilateral trade. This paper aims to examine the trends of Malaysia's exports to Middle Eastern Asian Countries (MEACs) that are similar to Malaysia in that MEACs are also Islamic countries. Proposing MEACs as Malaysia's new main export destinations, this study will examine the probable impact of various trade agreements signed between MEACs and other countries on Malaysian exports to MEACs. Applying panel data analysis, this study observes that trade agreements between MEACs and other countries do not exert negative effects on Malaysian exports to MEACs. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.","Exports; Gravity model; Malaysia; Middle eastern asian countries",""
"Classifying consumers based upon their pro-environmental behaviour: An empirical investigation","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899450890&partnerID=40&md5=31e9c34303c76cb004b491563f4ee5b3","Despite a wide applicability of demographic and psychographic variables for segmentation criteria, past research indicates that these variables are not as effective as behavioural variables. The present empirical study's focus is determining different typologies of Indian consumers, which exist in terms of Pro-Environmental Behaviour (PEB), and investigating whether PEB varies across these typologies. For this study, a total of 152 Indian consumers were contacted through convenience sampling. Using factor and cluster analysis, the typologies were classified as ""active green activists"" or ""passive green activists"". Using discriminant analysis, formed groups were validated and profiled by chi-square. Using environmental variables as the basis of segmentation, this study offers practical guidelines to green marketers who are targeting the Indian markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.","Cluster analysis; Discriminant analysis; Factor analysis; Green marketing; Pro-environmental behaviour; Segmentation",""

The purpose of this study is to explore the influences of different values and concerns affecting search and purchase intentions of consumers and to build an integrated model, which could explain the purchase intentions of consumers in Turkey, where the majority of the population is under the age of 30. An integrated model of motivation and concern factors on the online shopping is developed to test the causal effect variables. Current study points out that hedonic value is a determinant of the consumer intention to search and purchase. Search intention has a direct impact on purchase intention. Utilitarian value does not have a significant impact on the search intention but it does have an important impact on the purchase intention. From the concern factors perspective, security has a significant impact on both search and purchase intentions, whereas there is no impact for privacy. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.","Hedonic value; Privacy; Purchase intention; Search intention; Security; Utilitarian value",""
"A resource-based view of small export firms' social capital in a southeast asian country","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858384004&partnerID=40&md5=ccb99fe136fac9fdc7e9460ce32e0694","This study empirically examines the social capital that facilitates the flow of export knowledge, thereby supporting the entrepreneurial stance of small export firms. By applying the VRIO (value, rarity, inimitability and organisation of firm resources) framework to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study suggests that superior performance is a function of resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable and sufficiently organised to develop and sustain the firm's competitive advantage. This study argues that small, resource-constrained export firms in a developing economy are able to adopt entrepreneurial tactics and reap positive rates of return by exploiting their relational capital to acquire export knowledge. A survey of 175 small export firms in the Philippines was conducted, and the data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results suggest positive relationships between the firm's social capital and export knowledge. Export knowledge is associated with entrepreneurial orientation, which then correlates with export performance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Competitive advantage; Entrepreneurial orientation; Export performance; Resource-based view; Small firms; Social capital",""

The development of industrial estates has experienced phenomenal growth due to the globalisation policy of the government of India. Seven constructs, which include manpower, technology, social, hedonistic, industrial site, economic governmental factors, and as well as their underlying items, play vital roles in location selection decisions. A pilot study was conducted to understand the market and frame an effective questionnaire. The survey used a structured questionnaire for personnel from information technology organisations, government, and support service organisations. The data collected from the respondents was analysed to reduce it to meaningful factors. The factorised data and the constructs were further analysed with the help of a structural equation model.

One major factor that has been increasingly discussed is loyalty. In this study we examine the influence of cardholders' satisfaction on loyalty (program loyalty and store loyalty) in a retail context, namely, in department stores and superstores. Data were collected from 400 cardholders of a retail loyalty program in Klang Valley, Malaysia via the drop-off-and-collect technique. Structural modelling techniques were applied to analyze the data. The results indicated that program satisfaction is not related to store loyalty (share-of-wallet, share-of-visit and store preference). However, loyalty to the program (program loyalty) plays a crucial intervening role in the relationship between program satisfaction and store loyalty. The study underscores the principal importance of program loyalty in the retail loyalty program. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Loyalty card; Loyalty program; Program loyalty; Retail; Satisfaction; Store loyalty",""

The adjusted Sharpe index, adjusted Jensen Alpha index, and Treynor index are adopted to compare the performance of the Islamic unit trusts against the market benchmark and risk-free return. In measuring risk and diversification, the study relies on the standard deviation and R2 coefficient of determination, respectively. The findings reveal that during the non-crisis period, the performance of the Islamic unit trusts is comparable to that of the market benchmark, while during the crisis period, the Islamic unit trusts perform better compared to the non-crisis period. These findings suggests that the Islamic unit trust funds can be an ideal hedging instrument during a down market and provide potential portfolio diversification benefits for the investors. Based on these findings, the investors could strategize and diversify their portfolio accordingly during different market conditions. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.","Financial crisis; Islamic finance; Malaysia; Unit trust",""

Data were collected from 250 university students from five universities through self-reported questionnaires that were e-mailed to them. The results indicate that factors such as user friendliness, information provision, and website usability are significantly related to the perceptions of university students towards Internet recruitment. Amongst the three factors, information provision appears to be the strongest predictor. It can be concluded that Internet recruitment will continue to gain prominence, and employers must pay considerable attention to their online recruitment information, appearance, features, and functions if they wish to attract the right job candidates. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.","Information provision; Internet recruitment; Perception; University students; User friendliness; Website usability",""

It provides illustrative examples of how knowledge-based management, pursuing a vision that fosters creativity and innovation by employees, could ultimately fulfil the profitability objective of the business and at the same time add value to the community's quality of life. Using the SECI model as the parameter for analysis, we found that knowledge creation processes were affected by a combination of leadership, teamwork and Ba, corporate culture, and human resource management. Our conclusion emphasises the need for future research to further examine the practice of knowledge-based management in cross-industry segments in Vietnam and in other countries with similar conditions. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.","Green entrepreneurship; Knowledge creation; Knowledge-based management; Knowledge-creating companies; Vietnam",""

The objective of this study is to determine if firm performance, board attributes, ownership structure and incumbent power influence the decision of whether to elect an internal or external candidate. Results from logistic regression analysis on 145 succession events over a four-year period (2002 to 2005) indicate that firms which are controlled by blockholders tend to select an outsider as the successor. Further, firms that are controlled by family members and position their former CEOs within the firms are more likely to select insiders as successors. However, firm performance, board composition, CEO duality and turnover type do not affect the selection choice. This study implies that poor firm performance does not necessarily lead to outside CEO selection choice. Further, boards of Malaysian PLCs are not effective in choosing outsiders as successors as both board composition and CEO duality do not necessarily select outsiders to become new CEOs. Another implication of this study is that former CEOs who continue their directorship in the same companies do have some power in naming new CEOs as the former tend to select insiders as successors. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.","CEO succession; Corporate governance; Corporate performance",""

The empirical results obtained using dynamic panel and time series techniques for monthly data from January 1995 to December 2009 eventually show that the panel data estimates are more powerful than those obtained by applying individual time series estimations and the significant contribution of the exchange rate prediction horizons in determining the status of UIP. This finding reveals that at the longer time horizon, the model has better econometric specification and thus more predictive power for exchange rate movements compared to the shorter time period. The findings can also be a signalling of well-integrated currency markets and a reliable guide to international investors as well as for the orderly conduct of monetary authorities. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Emerging markets; Panel co-integration; Time series; Uncovered interest parity",""

It also aims to reveal the differences between entrepreneurs in a relatively mature free market economy (Taiwan) and a newly emerging free market economy (Mongolia). The analysis shows that socio-economic conditions affect the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. There are different approaches to building social capital in a relatively mature market and its newly emerging counterpart.

A local perspective to expatriate success,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14644387530&partnerID=40&md5=c2e452d3489dca5543ba88ab0566fa49,"Many expatriate human resource (HR) policies, particularly in the area of compensation, remain rooted in the past because they continue to favor the expatriate over local staff and do not take into account the increasing qualifications and aspirations of these local employees. Inequitable treatment leads to low commitment and poor work performance among local staff. More importantly, inequitable treatment creates tension between local and expatriate employees and causes the local staff to be less willing to be cooperative or supportive of the expatriates with whom they have to work. Without local support, expatriates may experience greater difficulty adjusting to their new jobs and the new environment, which is a contributing factor in the failure of expatriates. To minimize these problems, HR practices of expatriating organizations should focus on providing more equitable compensation for local and expatriate employees, selecting expatriates who are truly worthy of the higher pay, and increasing the transparency of pay practices so that local employees can see the linkage between work inputs and compensation more clearly. Managers at the local organization should emphasize favorable referents for local staff, breed organizational identification among the employees, prepare the local staff for incoming expatriates, and encourage them to assist and mentor incoming expatriates. It is critical that multinational companies (MNCs) are aware that some existing HR practices have potentially unintended negative consequences and that neglecting the impact of these practices on local employees hurts the effectiveness of the organization as well as the ability of expatriates to succeed in their assignment.",,
On the dark side of strategic sourcing: Experiences from the aerospace industry,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14644390919&partnerID=40&md5=17ea493933a6c1efc5138f7990edfe6e,"American manufacturing has undergone dramatic changes during the last two decades. Manufacturing firms were re-engineered, downsized, and restructured. Employees were dismissed, divisions were scrapped, and subsidiaries were spun off. As a consequence, outsourcing to external suppliers increased significantly, which in turn resulted in the increased saliency of strategic sourcing and its economic implications. Strategic sourcing integrates the buying firm's strategic decisions with those of its key suppliers, thus promoting trust and decreasing transaction costs. However, a dark side of strategic sourcing has emerged. Some firms established long-term contracts with their suppliers, set up mutually dependent relationships, and then began to strangle suppliers with relentlessly short-term, cost-driven decisions. As a result, the buying firms and their suppliers have now become competitors in the same market. Simply put, there is serious long-term risk associated with firms becoming strategically integrated with suppliers and then mistreating them for short-term gains. This paper demonstrates that misapplying the tenets of strategic sourcing can result in the disintegration of the existing supply chain and weaken the buying firm's long-term competitiveness.",,
Leadership group coaching in action: The Zen of creating high performance teams,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14644404309&partnerID=40&md5=6c62c91473f1886c52e7a7682ac0fdbe,"Although one-on-one coaching can be very effective, this article advocates the benefits of leadership coaching in a group setting, because durable changes in leadership behavior are more likely to occur. Discussion is offered to show that leadership group coaching establishes a foundation of trust, makes for constructive conflict resolution, leads to greater commitment, and contributes to accountability, all factors that translate into better results for the organization. The article suggests that a change methodology centered on leadership group coaching creates high-performance teams, is an antidote to organizational silo formation, helps put into place boundaryless organizations, and makes for true knowledge management. A strong plea is made for aspiring leadership coaches to undergo clinical training to prepare them for the kind of deep-seated psychological problems that can derail the leadership coaching process. Commentary about the clinical approach to organizational intervention is included. The article also explores the similarities between leadership coaching and psychotherapy. Finally, the article includes a discussion of a number of general concerns about leadership coaching.",,
Achieving and maintaining strategic competitiveness in the 21st century: The role of trategic leadership,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32044465945&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.19417908&partnerID=40&md5=a36accb65f837b9e2bc987b2f7107111,"Competition in the 21st century's global economy will be complex, challenging, and filled with competitive opportunities and threats. Effective strategic leadership practices can help firms enhance performance while competing in turbulent and unpredictable environments. The purpose of this paper is to describe six components of effective strategic leadership. When the activities called for by these components are completed successfully, the firm's strategic leadership practices can become a source of competitive advantage. In turn, use of this advantage can contribute significantly to achieving strategic competitiveness and earning above-average returns in the next century. © Academy of Management Executive.",,
Strategies for responsible restructuring,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32044445265&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.19417906&partnerID=40&md5=44f2bf5715985b2d1cd5ef745048f3de,"As organizations struggle to enhance their competitive positions, employment downsizing continues as a preferred part of a restructuring strategy. Its objective is to reduce operating costs as a way of increasing earnings and stock prices. A study of S&P 500 firms from 1982-2000, however, casts serious doubt on the long-term payoff of this approach. The purpose of this article is to suggest several alternative approaches to restructuring. In contrast to employment downsizing, a strategy that regards people as costs to be cut, a responsible restructuring strategy focuses on people as assets to be developed. This focus recognizes that people are the source of innovation and renewal, especially in knowledge-based organizations, and that the development of new markets, customers, and revenue streams depends on the wise use of a firm's human assets. The article presents company examples and research-based findings that illustrate mistakes to avoid and affirmative steps to take when restructuring responsibly. © Academy of Management Executive.",,

Aligning organizational processes with mission: The case of service excellence,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29144442287&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.18733215&partnerID=40&md5=a3d0561f915871d445ee7f01f86fcc23,"It has become increasingly clear in the research literature that successful organizations have found ways to ensure that their organizational missions are aligned both in terms of fit with the external environment and with all factors internal to the organization. The challenge is that accomplishing this fit is easier said than done. Too often there is a gap between what the organization says it seeks to do and what its employees actually do. The purpose of this paper is to offer managers a method by which they can create and conduct an audit of the gaps in the alignment of their organizational practices, policies, and procedures with their mission. The value of conducting such an audit is to create a diagnostic device to identify and close the gaps in an effort to secure better alignment with the mission. The authors use the mission of service excellence to illustrate the logic and process of developing such an audit, as this is one of the more challenging aspects of any organization and especially a service organization's mission. If what gets measured gets managed, then conducting such an audit can serve as an important tool for ensuring that the internal actions of the organization are being effectively managed to achieve the mission. © Academy of Management Executive.",,
Business as usual: The acceptance and perpetuation of corruption in organizations,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32044467555&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.19417904&partnerID=40&md5=5787ea2d0dd267c673361d9e8f34bf58,"Many of the recent corruption scandals at formerly venerated organizations such as Enron, WorldCom, and Parmalat have some noteworthy features in common. In most instances, the fraudulent acts involved knowing cooperation among numerous employees who were upstanding community members, givers to charity, and caring parents - far removed from the prototypical image of a criminal. The involvement of such individuals in corrupt acts, and the persistence of the acts over time, is both disturbing and puzzling. We argue that the above phenomenon can be explained in part by the rationalization tactics used by individuals committing unethical or fraudulent acts. Rationalizations are mental strategies that allow employees (and others around them) to view their corrupt acts as justified. Employees may collectively use rationalizations to neutralize any regrets or negative feelings that emanate from their participation in unethical acts. Further, rationalizations are often accompanied by socialization tactics through which newcomers entering corrupt units are induced to accept and practice the ongoing unethical acts and their associated rationalizations. We describe the different forms of rationalization and socialization tactics and the ways in which firms can prevent or reverse their occurrence among employees. The onset of these two tactics can establish enduring corruption in organizations and become institutionalized in seemingly innocuous processes. © Academy of Management Executive.",,
Leveraging intellect,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32044455509&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.19417909&partnerID=40&md5=053c6cd306f158d7860a1f8010417534,"With rare exceptions, the productivity of a modern corporation or nation lies more in its intellectual and systems capabilities than in its hard assets - raw materials, land, plant, and equipment. Intellectual and information processes create most of the value-added for firms in the large service industries - like software, medical care, communications, and education - which provide 79 percent of all jobs and 76 percent of all U.S. GNP.1 In manufacturing as well, intellectual activities - like R&D, process design, product design, logistics, marketing, marketing research, systems management, or technological innovation-generate the preponderance of value-added. McKinsey & Co. estimates that by the year 2000, 85 percent of all jobs in America and 80 percent of those in Europe will be knowledge-based. Yet few managements have systematically attacked the issues of developing, leveraging, and measuring the intellectual capabilities of their organizations. What are the keys to these processes?

A team production model of corporate governance,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29244474920&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.18733212&partnerID=40&md5=6c84ea8701b38991d407171f04495fc5,"A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this ""production"" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. © Academy of Management Executive.",,

Are you sure you have a strategy?,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32044433030&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.19417907&partnerID=40&md5=b72bbf1ffc545d07cb1d0f9aa950e582,"After more than 30 years of hard thinking about strategy, consultants and scholars have provided an abundance of frameworks for analyzing strategic situations. Missing, however, has been any guidance as to what the product of these tools should be - or what actually constitutes a strategy. Strategy has become a catchall term used to mean whatever one wants it to mean. Executives now talk about their ""service strategy,"" their ""branding strategy,"" their ""acquisition strategy,"" or whatever kind of strategy that is on their mind at a particular moment. But strategists-whether they are CEOs of established firms, division presidents, or entrepreneurs - must have a strategy, an integrated, overarching concept of how the business will achieve its objectives. If a business must have a single, unified strategy, then it must necessarily have parts. What are those parts? We present a framework for strategy design, arguing that a strategy has five elements, providing answers to five questions - arenas: where will we be active? vehicles: how will we get there? differentiators: how will we win in the marketplace? staging: what will be our speed and sequence of moves? economic logic: how will we obtain our returns? Our article develops and illustrates these domains of choice, particularly emphasizing how essential it is that they form a unified whole. © Academy of Management Executive.",,
Corporations as stepfamilies: A new metaphor for explaining the fate of merged and acquired companies,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29144475330&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.18733213&partnerID=40&md5=13205ec04e33f659b613e870c479fea8,"Economic explanations of mergers and acquisitions tend to focus on issues of efficiency and strategic fit. When acquisitions fail, economic arguments tend to dominate the reasoning and explanations. While cohesive theory exists, empirical studies of acquisitions and divestitures of failed acquisitions based upon economic models are inconsistent and have poor explanatory power to identify clear success or failure factors. Non-economic explanations, on the other hand, generally lack an integration that goes much beyond suggesting that non-economic differences create integration problems and cannot explain why the economic synergies that organizations hope for often fail to materialize. In an attempt to address these challenges, we draw upon the stepfamily literature to propose several new concepts that provide insights into the factors that influence the success of acquisition execution and implementation. Since diversified corporations bear a striking resemblance to human stepfamilies, stepfamily theory can provide new managerial insights and prescriptions. Three main perspectives frame our view of merger and acquisition success: Biological Discrimination, Incomplete Institutionalization, and Deficit-Comparison. From these perspectives, we propose important factors and characteristics that can influence the ultimate success or failure of a merger or acquisition. From this metaphor, we provide managerial prescriptions for firms engaged in merger and acquisition activities to improve the probability for ultimate success. © Academy of Management Executive,.",,

Practicing managers, so it is claimed, search for knowledge that will help them improve organizational performance but rarely consult the work of university-based researchers - work that they often find incomprehensible and irrelevant to their day-to-day challenges. Researchers assert that rather than being interested in systematic and long-term solutions, managers are generally infatuated with the latest fads and fashions in their search for quick fixes. We contend that management research can matter to managers, but for this to occur requires mutually beneficial partnerships involving managers and researchers, as well as the support of their organizations. To support our contention, we illustrate the importance of practice-relevant management research by drawing on four important contributions to management understanding that were prompted by the organizational experiences of a group of inquiring managers and curious researchers. Together these illustrations not only demonstrate how partnerships between practicing managers and management researchers can yield practice-relevant knowledge, but also provide insights into enhancing the likelihood that productive encounters will occur. © Academy of Management Executive.",,
Closing the performance feedback gap with expert systems,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29144525410&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.18733214&partnerID=40&md5=d9f568c32a74ac32e3ee631632c89b7b,"The dictums of ""don't be judgmental"" and ""don't say anything at all if you can't say something nice"" seem to be sufficiently ingrained to make many managers reluctant to provide performance feedback. The barriers to providing feedback, especially negative feedback, range from managers' fears of hurting employee feelings to potential workplace violence. They inhibit managers from providing performance feedback that can help employees grow and develop or enable the organization to eliminate poor performers. While a number of writers have offered strategies such as social learning, education, and training to overcome these barriers, the problem still exists. This paper suggests that Expert Systems (ESs), a relatively new type of tool, can improve the performance feedback skills of both experienced and inexperienced managers. ESs offer managers a means both to increase their knowledge of what makes for an effective appraisal feedback session and to improve their skills in performing this important task in a manner that best fits each employee in each unique situation. By providing managers this just-in-time knowledge, ESs can help managers become more consistent and more effective than ever before in providing performance feedback. © Academy of Management Executive.",,

It means achieving success by working with people, not by replacing them or limiting the scope of their activities. It entails seeing the workforce as a source of strategic advantage, not just as a cost to be minimized or avoided.

However, people vary in their individual propensity to lie in identical situations. Whereas nearly all people lie in bargaining situations, only some people lie when faced with mildly conflicting expectations. People need to rationalize their lies, and organizational cultures emphasizing honesty don't seem to reduce lying so much as they drive lying underground. Suggestions are proffered for managerial action aimed at positively influencing honesty. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,
Transfer of managerial practices by French food retailers to operations in Poland,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20444432788&doi=10.5465%2fame.2005.16962721&partnerID=40&md5=de7d5e0c74e61f595d0197c3fb879a2d,"We studied French food retailing chains operations in Poland over a period of ten years to assess their ability to transfer their managerial practices and work routines to Polish store management and floor personnel. We discovered that the retailers experienced great difficulty in reproducing their model in Poland because knowledge transfer was impeded by the differences between the management model of the French retailers and the behavior model of their Polish recruits. Both models were embedded in quite dissimilar home country administrative heritages. The resulting blockage threatened the growth potential of French hypermarkets, which relied on the rapid training of large numbers of store management and staff. We show that the French retail managers went through three phases in attempting to transfer their practices. In the first phase, they endeavored to impose the home office practices without adapting to the different attitudes of the first Polish employees. In the second phase, they overcame the period of confrontation of the two models by adapting their practices and creating a shared common space for learning with their employees. By diverging from the home office methods, they succeeded in training their Polish employees to run the first hypermarkets. In the third phase, currently under way, the retailing home offices are re-imposing standardization of methods, to ensure globalization of their business model. We conclude that, despite the temporary divergence led by local managers in adapting to local conditions, multinationals will eventually re-centralize and impose home-office approved practices because the knowledge encompassed is considered fundamental to the firm's business model. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005.",,

While it is tempting to explain this state of affairs in terms of managers' reluctance to share power, this article considers the possibility that democracy's limited success is due to its own limitations as a system of organizational governance. The article questions two common assumptions: (a) that political democracy provides a useful model for organizational democracy, and (b) that democratic process is applicable in all organizations. Close analysis suggests that political democracy provides little guidance for organizational democracy because its essential characteristics- accountability to the governed, right of participation, free exchange of information, and right of representation-are rarely, if ever, supported in organizations. Furthermore, the basic function of political democracy- legitimization of authority-has no counterpart in organizations. As for applicability, the article argues that democratic process can only be successfully implemented where it contributes significantly to competitive advantage and organizational performance. This depends on several contingency variables, including the nature of the organization's products and services, the characteristics of its workforce, and the degree of hierarchical resistance to redistribution of power and control.",,

Our study indicates that Accenture's global KM strategy, based on its ""one global firm"" vision, did not make sufficient considerations for local or regional challenges. Accenture was unsuccessful in motivating its East Asian consultants to contribute to KM by failing to show appreciation for their knowledge. Furthermore, Accenture appeared not to have provided adequate support for addressing cross-cultural challenges.

Linkage analysis helps managers map, evaluate, and overcome barriers that underlie the organizational improvement paradox. In this paradox, organizational changes are expected to lead to performance benefits for a unit as well as for the firm as a whole, but benefits occur only for the unit. The organizational improvement paradox frustrates change efforts and is the norm in organizational change where the firm has multiple units and levels. Linkage analysis permits managers and change agents to visualize the complex process of change. It details critical change pathways that otherwise go unrecognized and unmanaged. Through two cases, the reader can practice using linkage tools. Linkage analysis primes managers to take critical and widely overlooked steps to produce visible firm-level results.",,

Before the 1990s Safeco was very successful. However, during the late 1990s, Safeco chalked up five straight years of declining return on equity. In 2001, it lost nearly $1 billion and wrote off $1.2 billion in goodwill related to the acquisition of American States Financial Corporation in 1997. Mike McGavick, at the age of 44, joined SAFECO in January 2001 and led the company through an organization-wide restructuring, which resulted in a 10 per cent layoff of workforce, canceling 10 per cent of the company's agency force, and selling several lines of business. This was all done in his first 11 months. The result of these major efforts by the end of 2002 was a profit of $300 million and stock performance that led the insurance industry. Prior to joining Safeco, McGavick held a number of executive positions at Chicago-based CNA Financial Corporation starting in 1995. These included serving as president and chief operating officer of the company's largest operating unit, responsible for the majority of CNA's commercial insurance business. In addition, he engineered CNA's e-commerce strategy. McGavick began his insurance career in 1992, spending three years as director of the Superfund Improvement Project for the American Insurance Association. He served as a lead negotiator for the insurance industry with Congress, federal agencies, and groups concerned about reform of the nation's Superfund laws. Prior to that, McGavick held a series of public affairs positions, including chief of staff for U.S. Senator Slade Gorton from 1989 to 1991 and campaign manager for Gorton's successful comeback campaign in 1988. A native of Seattle, McGavick attended the University of Washington, graduating in 1983 with a degree in political science.

Planned, temporary spaces where democratic organizing can occur may benefit and enhance the change capacity of command and control cultures without replacing or discounting basic organizing structures. We describe democratic organizing in the context of the Appreciative Inquiry Summit, a large-system change initiative that uses dialogic democratic processes to inspire positive change. A case study of ongoing AI Summits within the United States Navy offers an example democratic organizing in a command and control environment. We suggest that within a temporarily organized space like the AI Summit, normative consciousness, holistic collegiality, and communal conviction are key principles of democratic organizing. These design principles not only foster organizational democracy, but they also promote effective and collaborative relationships across organizational levels and functional boundaries well after the intervention has ended.",,

This question has become particularly pressing for an increasing number of established companies that have recently come under attack from ""strategic innovators"" - companies that attack the established players by using radically different business models. The success of these attackers in gaining market share has created a big dilemma for established companies. On the one hand, by embracing the new business models that the innovators have introduced in their markets, established companies can potentially take advantage of a great growth opportunity. On the other hand, because the new business models often conflict with the established ones, companies that try to compete by adopting both of them risk mismanaging both and destroying value. How, then, can established companies embrace the new business models without diluting and destroying their existing models? Our research explores this question and offers a contingency solution to this problem. We show that the challenge for companies is to balance the benefits of keeping the two business models separate while at the same time integrating them enough so as to allow them to exploit synergies with one another. We describe four possible strategies that companies can use to achieve such a balance and identify what separates success from failure for each strategy.",,

The need for quick decisions, the need to cope with demands created by complex market forces, and the assumed benefits of applying deeply held knowledge combine to create strong perceived value for the intuitive approach. Intuition, however, has not been subjected to sufficient review, particularly in a forum for executives and other managers. This article responds to the need for critical evaluation. Utilizing holistic hunch and automated expertise as two fundamental definitions, our review evaluates intuition's costs and benefits in light of an organization's goals. Drawing evidence from the fields of behavioral decision making, strategic decision making, and mental modeling, our conclusions suggest intuition is a troublesome decision tool. To contribute to effective managerial practice, we offer tactics that decision makers can use to make intuitive judgments and choices less troublesome.",,

Although uncivil behaviors occur commonly, many organizations fail to recognize them, few understand their harmful effects, and most managers and executives are ill-equipped to deal with them. Over the past eight years, as we have learned about this phenomenon through interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, experiments, and executive forums with more than 2,400 people across the U.S. and Canada, we have found that incivility causes its targets, witnesses, and additional stakeholders to act in ways that erode organizational values and deplete organizational resources. Because of their experiences of workplace incivility, employees decrease work effort, time on the job, productivity, and performance. Where incivility is not curtailed, job satisfaction and organizational loyalty diminish as well. Some employees leave their jobs solely because of the impact of this subtle form of deviance. Most of these consequences occur without organizational awareness. In addition to detailing the nature of incivility and its consequences, we provide keys to recognizing and dealing with habitual instigators, and remedies that are being used effectively by organizations to curtail and correct employee-to-employee incivility.",,

Japan's distribution system permanently baffles; negotiation is as if with alien beings; its long-term approach to business disconcerts; choosing market intermediaries is an art in itself, while securing a business foothold and market presence entails massive costs. Prescriptions for how to do business with Japan are largely the same that dominated Western thinking in the 1980s, as if Japan has not moved on. If our company had applied the conventional thinking, our strategy for entering the Japanese market would have floundered. But we refused to follow the standard wisdom. We proceeded on the assumption that our best chance lay in a novel approach: we would co-create the market with our Japanese business partners through a synergistic process of knowledge sharing. In its planning and implementation our strategy turned on its head much accepted marketing wisdom. Perhaps most strikingly we learned that it is possible to transfer knowledge even if headquarters representatives are not locally present on a permanent basis. As we will describe, key cross-cultural interaction took place at corporate headquarters, where Japanese expatriate employees performed the crucial knowledge transfer activities. This approach enhanced the value of the knowledge among our business partners in Japan and their willingness to absorb it into their everyday business operations. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,

We describe how cognitive and emotional dynamics - how we think and feel while giving and receiving feedback - can complicate this process, making it more painful and less useful than it should be. These dynamics often interfere with the ability of recipients to process and respond constructively to feedback. They also interfere with the ability of feedback givers to formulate and deliver feedback that is high quality and does not produce defensiveness. Further complicating matters, both feedback givers and receivers have a difficult time recognizing how their own cognitive and emotional dynamics are hindering their effectiveness in the feedback process. We illustrate how these dynamics hamper the feedback giving and receiving process and how understanding them can help managers produce more actionable feedback on performance (feedback that leads to learning and appropriate results). © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,

In an in-depth analysis of the 100 largest organizational crises of the last five years, a mutual logic behind these crises has been identified. In general the problems lay in the four areas of growth, change, leadership and organizational culture. In most cases the companies grew and changed too quickly, had too powerful managers and nurtured an excessive success culture. Conversely, if these factors were insufficiently developed, companies aged prematurely, which likewise led to failure. In order to sustain success, companies need to keep a balance between these extremes. In this article we present company examples and research-based findings that illustrate behaviors to avoid and practices for managers to follow within their own organizations.",,

This article critically reviews explanations for this phenomenon, and posits an alternate explanation of the kaleidoscope career model that fits workers' concerns for authenticity, balance, and challenge, vis-à-vis the demands of their careers in this new millennium. In particular, the kaleidoscope model fits women's careers well as a means of understanding how women operate relationally to others in both work and non-work realms. Like a kaleidoscope that produces changing patterns when the tube is rotated and its glass chips fall into new arrangements, women shift the pattern of their careers by rotating different aspects in their lives to arrange their roles and relationships in new ways. The article concludes with guidelines on how women executives can increase their career success and how organizations can create an improved workplace that will attract and retain talented women given the anticipated labor shortages beginning in 2012.",,

Yet we do not know much about what makes some champions effective while others fail to deliver the goods. What I discovered by studying 72 innovations in 38 companies is that effective champions differ from ineffective ones in their personal characteristics and behaviors, how they identify the innovations to back, and how they promote them to gain the support they need to bring ideas to realization as new products or services. Effective champions are distinguished by three behaviors: conveying confidence and enthusiasm about the innovation; enlisting the support and involvement of key stakeholders; and persisting in the face of adversity. Relying on their personal networks inside and outside of the organization, they scout widely for new ideas and opportunities to pursue. Effective champions build support for the innovation by astutely analyzing key stakeholders' interests and tailoring their selling strategies to be maximally persuasive, and by tying the innovation to positive organization outcomes such as profitability, enhanced reputation, or strategic advantage. I conclude with seven action steps that enterprise leaders can take to breed, rather than block, potential champions in their organizations. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,

While everybody else may see a co-worker's incompetence, the employee is clueless about his or her serious development need. It may not be enough to provide feedback to this type of employee and hope that performance will improve. However, ignoring feedback has serious consequences for both the individual and the organization. Based on Hanna's individual change model from the therapeutic literature, we argue that individual and organizational factors, or precursors, enhance the speed of individual change in response to feedback. The individual precursors increase the likelihood that an employee will change in response to performance feedback, while the organizational precursors reflect how an organization's environment supports and rewards individual change. Individual change will occur more quickly and effectively to the extent that these precursors are present. This paper describes the precursors, provides a tool that managers can use to assess the precursors, and presents a case example to illustrate these points. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,

Ideally such companies would implement the same practice throughout their facilities worldwide. Too often they run into difficulties and sometimes even outright failures. Some problems in implementing such practices cross-nationally can be linked to differences in institutional environments. Hence, executives need to be keenly aware of how distinct institutions in various national settings potentially impact the viability of a particular strategy. This article examines the effect of such institutions on best practices through a case study of a German multinational that implemented the same lean production program at one facility in Germany and one in the United States. It finds that the heavily regulated environment in Germany proved conducive to the success of this program there, while the liberal environment in the United States contributed to its failure at their U.S. facility.

The initial starting point was a ""best practice"" developed by a U.S. consultancy based on the benchmarking of large global firms. Norwegian Multi chose to remove from this best practice the elements that were seen as most provocative to dominant cultural values. Over time more and more subsidiaries reintroduced elements of the original practice. The management practice we examine - performance management (PM) - can be regarded as an extension of the traditional performance appraisal, linking individual performance to corporate strategy.1 Researchers separate calculative PM (focus on individual contributions and rewards) and collaborative PM (focus on creating a partnership culture between employer and employee, for example through competency development).2 In the United States, PM practices contain both calculative and collaborative elements, whereas in Scandinavia the calculative element is downplayed.3 Norwegian firms have had a long tradition of holding annual ""planning and development talks."" This is, however, a single, once a year event intended to promote good working relations more than a managerial system for evaluating, developing and compensating employees. 4 We suggest that when introducing a ""foreign best practice"" into this setting, national values present initial barriers, whereas organizational capabilities and systems are crucial for the final shape of the practice. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005,.",,
Transferring management knowledge to Russia: A culturally based approach,2005,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20644472632&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2005.16962597&partnerID=40&md5=06bcfbf5aef57986774cf48cc14957ab,"Russian managers entered the decade of the 1990s ill-prepared to manage their companies in the country's chaotic transition to a market economy. This article draws lessons for transferring Western management knowledge to Russian managers from programs conducted over a ten-year period by the Rayter Group, a cross-cultural training organization. The group's experience underscores the transitional nature of business values among Russian managers, including the need to recognize the barriers and potential opportunities that traditional culture and values can create, as well as the potential for newly developing ones to support the transfer of Western knowledge. These two sets of values must be understood and appreciated by those transferring knowledge through the design and execution of management education programs, as well as in other situations like joint ventures and parent-subsidiary operations. The lessons presented in this article are grounded in the context of a culturally based approach to transferring knowledge that includes the culture, values, attitudes, and behaviors of Russian managers. These factors affect the capabilities of both transferors and receivers of knowledge to engage in effective knowledge transfer. The article concludes with recommendations for knowledge transfer in Russia that may also be useful in other transitional economies. © Academy of Management Executive, 2005.",,

However, democratic processes can also absorb significant time and other organizational resources and bog down decisions, which may lead to reduced efficiency. This article summarizes the pros and cons of organizational democracy. It also introduces and integrates ideas from the three other articles in this special forum. In the end, we conclude that although the economic arguments for organizational democracy may be mixed, increased stakeholder participation in value creation and organizational governance can benefit both society and corporations. In fact, the corporation itself may be envisioned as a system of self-governance and the voluntary cooperation of stakeholders.",,

A worthwhile question is how alternative blueprints of corporate democracy might better satisfy the requirements of modern knowledge economies. In this article, we introduce a model of corporate democracy developed and implemented by the medium-sized Dutch engineering firm Breman Group in the early 1970s. The model has been in place ever since. We argue that Breman's democratic structures and procedures help to develop and sustain organizational adaptation and learning capabilities and competencies which are critical to a knowledge- and service-based economy. We provide lessons that can be learned from the Breman example and illustrate how the Breman model of democracy has been and can be implemented in other existing and newer organizations.",,
Managing the life cycle of virtual teams,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3242707444&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.13837468&partnerID=40&md5=79153ba09f93f027069aaf2e20fb088d,"In the fast-paced, technology-driven 21st century, virtual project teams represent a growing response to the need for high-quality, low-cost, rapid solutions to complex organizational problems. Virtual project teams enable organizations to pool the talents and expertise of employees (and non-employees) by eliminating time and space barriers. Yet, there is growing evidence that virtual teams fail more often than they succeed. To understand the factors that contribute to virtual team effectiveness, we tracked six virtual project teams from a large food distribution company from inception to project delivery. We identified factors at each stage of the virtual-team life cycle that affected team performance. These results provide specific examples of what managers can do, at various points in time, to increase a virtual team's chances to fully develop and contribute to firm performance.",,
The future shape of strategy: Lemmings or chimeras?,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142778440&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.13837454&partnerID=40&md5=962ed97b786e0e06d7c07c9a5186376a,"Despite revolutionary claims about the changing shape of organizations and strategy, the predispositions of executives are often framed and limited by the structures assumed by strategy's foundational works of the 1960s. These works emphasize top- down planning, generic linear processes, simple either/or choices, and singular outcomes. We argue that there is a need to evolve these mental frames to better enable executives to appreciate how today's firms can compete more effectively through individualized approaches that seek both economies of scale and unique identities in the marketplace. This evolution necessitates a new framework that can handle complex, multi-dimensional processes. Such a generic framework would conceptualize the need to simultaneously customize products and services for individual consumers while trying to reduce costs through efficient production and service provision. In working with executives in Europe and Australasia, we have drawn upon the chimera, a creature with a single body and different formidable heads operating on many fronts, as an analogy for the firm confronting numerous, quite different, and often paradoxical challenges. The chimera has inspired us to create a new framework: the Value Chimera - a multi-faceted, multi-dimensional means of assessing how firms can manage their value-adding processes to target multiple customer groups in complex business environments.",,

Strategic leadership of ethical behavior in business,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3242709240&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.13837425&partnerID=40&md5=18a927a882d125e6511086cd0ca66720,"The strategic leadership of ethical behavior in business can no longer be ignored. Executives must accept the fact that the moral impact of their leadership presence and behaviors will rarely, if ever, be neutral. In the leadership capacity, executives have great power to shift the ethics mindfulness of organizational members in positive as well as negative directions. Rather than being left to chance, this power to serve as ethics leaders must be used to establish a social context within which positive self-regulation of ethical behavior becomes a clear and compelling organizational norm and in which people act ethically as a matter of routine. This article frames the responsibility for strategic leadership of ethical behavior on three premises: (1) It must be done - a stakeholder analysis of the total costs of ethical failures confirms the urgency for ethics change; (2) It can be done - exemplars show that a compelling majority of an organization's membership can be influenced to make ethical choices; (3) It is sustainable-integrity programs help build and confirm corporate cultures in which principled actions and ethics norms predominate.",,
A survey of the executive's advisory panel: Why managers bend company rules,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142715179&doi=10.5465%2fame.2004.13837387&partnerID=40&md5=985dcdfd943570e961434decb32d1d76,"Most managers live by a personal code of conducf that includes certain principles about integrity, regard for others, and keeping commitments. They refrain from engaging in actions that might compromise their reputations, careers, or organizations; they comply with regulations and are law-abiding. Most also believe they are ethical, and that is precisely why, when confronted with situations that they believe compel them to bend company rules, they are decidedly torn. While playing by the rules is the principled thing to do, and many would say the safest too, many managers also feel a responsibility to challenge the rules, because the rules are not always infallible, and fairness to other parties may demand nothing less. To better understand the nature of these competing demands, we asked over 100 executives from The Executive's Advisory Panel to share their views with us about why managers bend the rules and what they risk in doing so. The stories they tell offer unique insights into these ethically precarious balancing acts. In presenting these observations we add two cautions. First, it may seem that we are saying that it's okay to bend rules. We are not, nor are the Advisory Panel members. Decisions to bend rules should never be taken lightly, and ethically responsible executives know that. Second, out of sensitivity to the issues involved, the executives who responded were specifically asked to share their general observations about the nature of rule bending in today's workplace. Hence, although these are their general observations, they in no way should be considered reflective of any Panel member's practices.",,
The future of leadership: Combining vertical and shared leadership to transform knowledge work,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842473099&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.12690298&partnerID=40&md5=bcd727fafb72909272c65374e698978e,"Knowledge work is becoming increasingly team-based. The reason is clear. It is becoming ever more difficult for any one person to be an expert on all aspects of the work that needs to be done, and this is true in a wide variety of contexts ranging from the R&D lab to the executive suite. With the shift to team-based knowledge work comes the need to question more traditional models of leadership. Traditionally, leadership has been conceived around the idea that one person is firmly ""in charge"" while the rest are simply followers - what is termed vertical leadership. However, recent research indicates that leadership can be shared by team leaders and team members - rotating to the person with the key knowledge, skills, and abilities for the particular issues facing the team at any given moment. In fact, research indicates that poor-performing teams tend to be dominated by the team leader, while high-performing teams display more dispersed leadership patterns, i.e., shared leadership.1 This is not to suggest that leadership from above is unnecessary. On the contrary, the role of the vertical leader is critical to the ongoing success of the shared-leadership approach to knowledge work. Thus, this article addresses the following questions: (1) when is leadership most appropriately shared? (2) how is shared leadership best developed? and (3) how does one effectively utilize both vertical and shared leadership to leverage the capabilities of knowledge workers?",,

In most instances, the fraudulent acts involved knowing cooperation among numerous employees who were upstanding community members, givers to charity, and caring parents - far removed from the prototypical image of a criminal. The involvement of such individuals in corrupt acts, and the persistence of the acts over time, is both disturbing and puzzling. We argue that the above phenomenon can be explained in part by the rationalization tactics used by individuals committing unethical or fraudulent acts. Rationalizations are mental strategies that allow employees (and others around them) to view their corrupt acts as justified. Employees may collectively use rationalizations to neutralize any regrets or negative feelings that emanate from their participation in unethical acts. Further, rationalizations are often accompanied by socialization tactics through which newcomers entering corrupt units are induced to accept and practice the ongoing unethical acts and their associated rationalizations. We describe the different forms of rationalization and socialization tactics and the ways in which firms can prevent or reverse their occurrence among employees. The onset of these two tactics can establish enduring corruption in organizations and become institutionalized in seemingly innocuous processes.",,

Moreover, the knowledge needed to generate competitive imagination and to manage disruptive change increasingly lies outside the organization, at the periphery of firms' established stakeholder networks. Unfortunately, most companies still tend to focus management attention only on known, salient, or powerful actors to protect their advantages in existing businesses. In recognition of these challenges, we develop the concept of Radical Transactiveness (RT). RT is a dynamic capability which seeks to systematically identify, explore, and integrate the views of stakeholders on the ""fringe""the poor, weak, isolated, non-legitimate, and even non-human - for the express purpose of managing disruptive change and building imagination about future competitive business models. RT consists of two complementary skills. First, by reversing the logic of traditional approaches focused on managing powerful stakeholders, firms fan out to identify voices at the fringe of their networks to both preempt their concerns and generate imaginative new business ideas. Second, by creating mechanisms for complex interaction and empathy with those on the fringe, firms fan in to integrate and reconcile this knowledge with existing know-how to design and execute disruptive new business strategies.",,

Based on a comprehensive set of interviews with project managers and clients in three different information-technology service organizations, we examined two key questions: How can project managers operate more successfully as client-relationship managers and, in many cases, as client account executives? What strategies can the project manager use to build a trusting, long-term relationship with a client organization? We identify the multiple roles of the project manager including coach, entrepreneur, politician, friend, and marketer, and how they facilitate the attainment of the primary project-manager role: project implementer. In addition, we provide new strategies used by project managers doubling as client account executives. Important lessons for service organizations and project managers wanting to enhance client engagements are offered.",,

Sang-Chul Lee, Minister of Korea'S Ministry of information and Communication, believes enjoying one'S work is more important than the person'S skills. In a press conference after his inauguration as minister, he stated that Korea is now no longer just an advanced IT country but a global IT leader. He believes that strengthening the international competitiveness of the Korean IT industry is the foremost task of his ministry. From 2000 to 2001, Sang-Chul Lee was the chief executive officer of KT (Korea Telecom) and previously served as the first CEO of Korea Telecom Freetel, known as KTF, a mobile communication firm. As CEO of KT, he transformed KT from a ""dinosaur"" public utility firm into a private enterprise by selling off the government share of KT stock in spring 2002. Mr. Lee is an expert in the information/telecommunication area who graduated with a B.S. from Seoul National University, an M.S. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and a Ph.D. from Duke University, all in electrical engineering. He worked as a senior researcher at both Western Union Spacecom and Computer Science Corp. As CEO of KT and KTF, he demonstrated his exceptional managerial skills and global mindset. Now, at this critical juncture as Korea attempts to become a global IT powerhouse, Mr. Lee is the architect for the future direction of the Korean IT industry. Minister Lee oversees establishing basic government policies on: • Overall management and coordination of national informatization strategy • Development of high-speed information and communication infrastructure • Implementation of major national strategies related to information and communication • Strengthening international cooperation concerning IT and informatization issues • Development of strategies for broadcasting, satellite business, and media content • Management of Korean mail and postal finance operations. [Mr. Lee stepped down as Minister when a new administration took office on February 28, 2003. The Korean government'S policies regarding information and communication technology are not expected to change under the new administration].",,

Superstition and decision-making: Contradiction or complement?,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-11044230920&doi=10.5465%2fame.2004.15268696&partnerID=40&md5=5634ccda7b8746d183176e1a1d4edfcf,"This article discusses the relationship between superstition and business decision-making in Chinese business communities. Although superstition constitutes a crucial part of business life in Chinese societies, the management literature has been virtually silent with respect to the phenomenon of superstitious business decision-making. Through discussing the pros and cons of integrating superstition into a decision-making process, this article helps managers, whether superstitious or not, understand the phenomenon. There are two key linkages between superstition and decision-making. On the one hand, the irrationality normally associated with superstition and the supposed rationality of decision-making suggest an apparent contradiction between the two. On the other hand, superstition and decision-making may be complementary in the sense that the former can be used as a means to cope with the uncertainty associated with the latter. The complementary aspect suggests that superstition fulfills two main functions: providing an additional source of information and reducing uncertainty-induced anxiety. These functions come with certain costs. Since superstition is, by definition, not supported by scientific evidence, a superstitious practice may be completely nonsensical. The risk of basing a decision on such a practice is obvious. Even if a superstitious practice is valid metaphysically, gaining access to this stock of knowledge is problematic. No matter whether the information provided by superstitious sources is valid or not, the information may distract managers from their normal decision-making processes. Finally, the apparent contradiction between superstition and decision-making may give rise to cognitive dissonance among managers who believe in rational business decision-making. Superstitious beliefs and behaviors are widespread in virtually all human societies. With the trend toward globalization, it pays for companies to be superstition-conscious and to develop an understanding of the superstitious practices in countries where they operate.",,

Most companies approach the design and management of their business partnerships by focusing on optimizing each individual alliance. This approach gives priority to meeting alliance-specific objectives and allocating resources based on the strategic importance of each partner. Typically, however, a company will be involved with several alliance partners, and sharing of information and knowledge across these alliances is rare. In addition, a company's alliances will often compete with one another, and with the internal organization, for limited resources. An emerging perspective is to manage alliances as a portfolio, and to understand how individual alliances impact each other and the internal organization. We offer a portfolio approach to alliance design and management that builds upon existing alliance research and practice, and offers a fresh perspective reflective of what is happening in today's business environment-networks of companies, both allies and rivals at the same time, collaborating in a dynamic and uncertain world. By understanding partners' alliance networks, thinking about potential future projects with each partner, and developing processes to share information and knowledge across alliances, this approach seeks to minimize areas of friction in the portfolio and leverage areas of synergy.",,

Can real-options analysis improve decision-making? Promises and pitfalls,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-11044226918&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.15268687&partnerID=40&md5=ae735fb91f909c9bfc22da03a4c38c5c,"Managers are faced with uncertainty in nearly every aspect of their decisions. Reducing uncertainty, then, often leads to better decisions and greater potential firm success. The real-options literature provides one tool to reduce uncertainty. A real option is commonly defined as any decision that creates the right, but not the obligation, to pursue a subsequent decision. Used effectively, these options can minimize Josses while preserving potential gains. Real options are used both formally, as a modeling tool for specific decisions, and informally, as a perspective for framing decisions in a different light. We separate real options into four distinct types-immediate entry, immediate exit, delayed entry, and delayed exit. We then provide additional understanding into how they differ and how each can reduce uncertainty. We also suggest that firms should use all four types of real options to search for additional benefits beyond uncertainty reduction. We identify several pitfalls to avoid, as well as processes to help avoid such pitfalls as escalation of commitment. In addition, we show that real options are as vulnerable to the frailties of managers as are other types of decision tools, frailties which may affect both the appropriate writing and exercising of a real option. A real-options perspective encourages both low-cost trials, where failure is not catastrophic, as well as a conscious search for benefits that may emerge from the learning embedded inside the option.",,

Two forms of interpersonal trust - trust in a person's competence and in a person's benevolence - enable effective knowledge creation and sharing in these networks. Yet, though conceptually appealing, trust is an elusive concept that is often difficult for managers to influence. We conducted interviews in 20 organizations to identify ways in which interpersonal trust in a knowledge-sharing context develops. Based on this work, we summarize behaviors (e.g., discretion, consistency, collaboration) and practices (e.g., building shared vision, ensuring transparency in decision-making, holding people accountable for trust) for managers interested in promoting trust (and thereby knowledge creation and sharing) within their own organizations.",,

Strategic flexibility is the organization's capability to identify major changes in the external environment, quiekly commit resources to new courses of action in response to those changes, and recognize and act promptly when it is time to halt or reverse existing resource commitments. This strategic flexibility requires managers to find the right balance between committing the resources necessary to carry out a decision and avoiding investment of good money in bad projects. This article seeks to help managers understand the importance of and difficulties in developing strategic flexibility. The challenge in doing this results from the substantial uncertainties inherent in making these strategic decisions as well as from psychological and organizational biases that affect the attention, assessments, and actions of decision-makers in ways that prevent them from recognizing problems and acting in a timely fashion. Being careful and rational is important but not sufficient if managers are to recognize when resource commitments should be halted or reversed and act quickly. We show that managers may become unconsciously trapped in a vicious cycle of insensitivity, self-serving interpretation, and inaction. We recommend six practical steps for avoiding such problems. We stress that managers and organizations should be prepared and proactive to overcome the biases, to avoid becoming trapped in the vicious cycle of rigidity, and to cope effectively with the uncertainties of a dynamic environment.",,

Further, not much work has been done to describe the dimensions of internetworking, or how to benchmark firm-level internetworking capabilities. We call enterprises that negotiate the transition to Internet-based infrastructures Internet-Generation Companies (IGCs). This article describes how firms operationally and strategically benefit from internetworking; however, after categorizing the Internet-enabled business operations of 493 established firms into eight dimensions, we find that despite the potential for such gains, progress is unimpressive. Reasons for this lack of progress are considered, and some variables and contingencies that influence internetworking levels are presented. Suggestions to speed up the transition conclude the article. Executives can benchmark their firms' progress toward IGC status through the ideas, measures, and frameworks presented in the article.",,

The intuitive executive: Understanding and applying 'gut feel' in decision-making,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-11044239138&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2004.15268692&partnerID=40&md5=8ccf463f409e862173da2538a581a135,"Even though the conditions under which executives operate may sometimes limit or even preclude the use of rational analysis, it is nevertheless the norm in many organizational decision processes. Intuition, on the other hand, is often considered to be the antithesis of this approach and is usually overlooked or disregarded in decision-making. However, in recent years there has been resurgence of interest in intuition, perhaps because of some dissatisfaction with rationality and its limits and also because some psychologists are now arguing that much of cognition occurs automatically outside of consciousness and in the realm of intuition. Knowledge of intuition has made significant advances in recent years, and it can now be understood as a composite phenomenon involving interplay between knowing (intuition-as-expertise) and sensing (intuition-as-feeling). Furthermore, rather than being set in opposition to each other, intuition and rational analysis are better conceived of as two parallel systems of knowing. Against this backdrop we consider the significance of the two facets of intuition for executive decision-making processes. From this integrated perspective we offer some guidelines whereby executives can make more effective and intelligent use of intuition in ways that acknowledge its limitations while maximizing its potential in enhancing firm success in complex and fast-moving business environments.",,

How do their proponents both legitimize and gain action on these initiatives - activities that involve tapping into existing organizational beliefs, or cultural frames - when an organization has historically considered such issues to be outside its realm of concern? We identify eight possible cultural frames that may be used to motivate corporate action on social initiatives, and we illustrate the use of one frame through a case study of a high-technology manufacturer addressing a particular environmental problem. We use the case to identify framing tactics which proponents of social initiatives can use to best advance such issues in their organizations. These include using the metrics and language of relevant functional groups to assign responsibility for the problems, engaging the standard routines or approaches used in such groups, and using the culturally appropriate public and/or private channels to communicate the issue, eventually gaining allies in these groups. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of cultural framing for organizational change and for the broader debate on the connection between financial and social performance.",,

However, attention to what we call the ""usual suspects"" - the number of outsiders on boards, director shareholdings, board size, and whether the CEO also holds the Chair position (CEO duality) - does not yield either strong research results or more robust corporate governance in practice. In this article we argue that the ""usual suspects,"" as measured by the classic indicators, do not ensure a truly independent board and that the key to making boards work better rests in an area largely ignored by researchers: board process. Based on structured interviews with members of corporate boards, we open a window to what is really going on inside boardrooms. Our analysis suggests five critical goals for which all boards should strive and presents a detailed checklist of recommendations for directors on how best to realize these goals.",,

Managers are more likely to make effective decisions if they fully understand the firm's competitive environment. We examine four key questions that managers regularly confront: How should a firm decide (1) Whether to enter a new market? (2) How to respond to a competitive attack? (3) If and how to pursue growth in existing markets? and (4) Whether to compete or cooperate? We suggest that firm success is enhanced when managers base the amount of participation and comprehensiveness in the decision process on the competitive dynamics surrounding these questions.",,

Improvement calls for insight into what brings about failure and ways to avoid it. The article shows that failed decisions stem from decision-maker actions in which blunders create traps and traps bring about failure. Blunders arise when decision-makers rush to judgment, use failure-prone practices, and allocate time and money unwisely. Here we consider how these blunders set a trap that limits the search for remedies. Three approaches are offered for expanding the search for alternatives and avoiding the limited-search trap. First, decision-makers should expand the arena of action by identifying key stakeholders, their concerns and claims. The second approach is to increase the clarity of objectives and select one that defines an arena of action with the broadest possible scope. The third is to use multiple perspectives to uncover options that would otherwise be undiscovered. Successful decision-makers add innovative options to the mix of remedies to be considered. Shell's attempts to dispose of an obsolete oilrig. Quaker's purchase of Snapple, and Columbus, Ohio's seeking of tax support for a sports arena illustrate how the three blunders can limit the alternatives search and discourage innovation. The article recommends search tactics that can help decision-makers be sure that they are exploring a full range of decision options.",,

These network effects enable the creation of a technological standard, which can lead to a strong competitive position for the core-product manufacturer. There is no guarantee, however, that this position can be sustained over time. Managers must therefore focus on further developments of the core product. We argue here that the best way to stimulate further developments is to reposition the core product in order to strengthen network effects. A three-phase framework can determine how to make an investment in the future generation of a product for which complements are crucial. First, we provide a matrix to evaluate whether the existing technology presents some untapped potential in terms of network effects; second, we analyze how to reposition the core product; third, we suggest some accompanying measures to manage this repositioning efficiently.",,
Former Enron vice president Sherron Watkins on the Enron collapse,2003,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4043136050&doi=10.5465%2fame.2003.11851888&partnerID=40&md5=ccdfaca376c11e67da01b2d5ea991a08,"It is my pleasure to introduce Sherron Watkins, the Academy of Management's 2003 Distinguished Executive Speaker. By now, her story as the former vice president of Enron Corporation who tried to bring what she called ""an elaborate accounting hoax"" to the attention of Enron's chief executive officer is well known. In August 2001, responding to his invitation to employees to put any concerns in a comment box, she did so. When he did not address her explosive charges at a subsequent company-wide meeting, she sought a face-to-face meeting with him. A month later the CEO announced to employees that ""our financial liquidity has never been stronger,"" while exercising his own $1.5 billion in stock options, just ahead of the company's announcement of a $618 million quarterly loss. When United States Congressional investigators uncovered her letter buried in boxes of documents, they brought Ms. Watkins before the United States Senate in February 2002 to testify about her warnings. Her articulate, detailed accounts rocked the foundations of the corporate world and the accounting profession worldwide, with consequences still playing themselves out. Ms. Watkins joined Enron in late 1993, initially managing Enron's $1 billion-plus portfolio of energy-related investments held in Enron's now-infamous investment vehicles. Later at Enron she moved to the international group focusing on mergers and acquisitions around the world, then to its broadband unit, and finally returned to investment-vehicles portfolio management in June 2001 where she worked until leaving Enron in November 2002. Before Enron she was a portfolio manager with MG Trade Finance Corporation and an auditor with Arthur Anderson. Sherron has just completed a co-authored book, Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron (New York: Doubleday, 2003). Ms. Watkins is a particularly appropriate executive for the Academy to honor now. First, her courage and integrity are extraordinary. As the Financial Times wrote on February 27, 2003, ""To her champions, the letter was a principled act, one particularly risky for a female middle manager in a male-dominated office. What she did took courage, says Philip Hilder, her lawyer, and she did it because it was the right thing to do."" I am pleased that the Academy of Management can join the many others in lauding this courage. We join, among others. Time Magazine, who named Ms. Watkins, along with Coleen Rowley of the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation and Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom, as their 2002 Persons of the Year for being ""people who did right just by doing their jobs rightly."" Just the names of a few of the awards she has received will give you a flavor of the wide admiration she has engendered: the Scales of Justice Award, Everyday Hero's Award, Women Mean Business Award, and she has been named Woman of the Year by many, many groups. She is an extraordinary model of courage and integrity in management. Finally, there is another reason why I am pleased that the Academy of Management could honor her this year. She is a middle manager, when our awards usually have gone to chief executives. This is important. She serves as a reminder to all of us that organizations are not run solely by their chief executives, but also by the thousands of managers and professionals who mate the millions of daily decisions it takes to make an organization. For too long, we have neglected middle managers. These are the people who know what is really going on and who often persevere to keep organizations operating in the adverse environments brought on by chief executives' mergers, buy-outs, spin-offs and re-organizations. Too often we have just reflected our society's ""cult of the CEO."" This bias leads too many to dismiss and devalue the critical managerial work done by those not at the apex of the hierarchy, those doing that critical work which the vast majority of our students will be doing. Ms. Watkins' principled actions serve to remind us that these managers and professionals can make history and are ignored at everyone's peril.",,

Little is currently known about the country besides its extremist and confrontational policies both inside and outside the country. In this article, we report on a study of 300 Iranian middle managers from the banking, telecommunications, and food-processing industries as part of the GLOBE Project. Our findings show that despite much visible economic and societal change, the country's deeper cultural traits seem rather intact. The first important finding is that Iran, while a Middle Eastern country, is not part of the Arab culture. Instead, it is part of the South Asian cultural cluster consisting of such countries as India, Thailand, and Malaysia. The country's culture is distinguished by its seemingly paradoxical mix of strong family ties and connections and a high degree of individualism. Societal or institutional collectivism is not a strong suit of Iranians. The country's culture also bestows excessive privilege and status on those in positions of power and authority and does not tolerate much debate or disagreement. Perhaps as a result, rules and regulations are not taken very seriously and do not enjoy much popular support. At the same time, the culture has strong orientations toward achievement and performance, although mostly at the individual level. The article provides detailed ideas on the managerial implications of our findings for Western executives and corporations.",,

Past research supports such anecdotal evidence, reporting that traditional one-on-one mentoring has been an integral component of protégé advancement, compensation, and satisfaction within traditional organizations. However, because organizational structures have changed and careers have become boundaryless, the aspiring manager today must make use of an intelligent network of multiple mentors in order to flourish in a changing workplace. This is especially true in turbulent business environments where layoffs, career plateaus, and limited promotion opportunities can derail the careers of even the most promising managers. Using support from interviews with executives, we detail the advantages of a diverse mentor network and the significant roles which multiple mentors can play in the enrichment of a protégé's professional life. We demonstrate how multiple mentors have the potential to help protégés continuously acquire knowledge (e.g., knowing why, how, and whom competencies) which they can leverage for career and personal success within and across organizational boundaries. Finally, we offer five specific strategies for creating effective developmental relationships and building intelligent career networks.",,

Because of these and other developments, managers face an increasingly diverse cultural landscape. Differences in GVT members' perceptions of time, or time visions, subtly influence the team's dynamics and performance. Time visions must be managed in order for the full potential of the GVT to be realized. This article explores the different dimensions that are typically employed when defining time. These dimensions are then combined to form four examples of cultural time visions. Three major problems associated with differing time visions in GVTs are identified, and approaches for dealing with these problems in multicultural GVTs are suggested.",,

Are your employees avoiding you? Managerial strategies for closing the feedback gap,2004,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842420620&doi=10.5465%2fame.2004.12691168&partnerID=40&md5=082f08a2b75f189860d90bdc47b129c0,"When employees perform poorly, they should seek feedback from managers. In return, managers should give constructive feedback to employees, so that they can improve their performance. However, this kind of meaningful exchange about employee performance is often precluded by managers themselves. Some managers have an overly supportive style and feel uncomfortable giving negative feedback. Other managers are intolerant of failure and react harshly to feedback-seeking from poor performers. This causes employees to stop asking for feedback or even to avoid discussing performance with their managers entirely. Some employees, such as those who generally fear negative feedback, will be more likely than others to avoid feedback from their managers, even though it might be helpful. Others will be reluctant to seek feedback because of the potential cost of being perceived as incompetent. These actions of employees and managers can mutually instigate and reinforce one another, creating a vacuum of meaningful exchanges about poor performance. We refer to this phenomenon as the feedback gap. We propose a get-well plan that offers concrete guidelines so that managers can narrow the feedback gap. Our prescription stimulates managers to view feedback about poor performance as a learning opportunity, rather than as a chance to blame others.",,

Not quite strong enough to control its own destiny, while occupying a strategic location among ambitious and powerful neighbors, Korea has gone through numerous crises in its recent history. Japanese colonization, the devastating Korean War, poverty, and a backward social infrastructure left the country ill prepared to face the modern world. However, these multiple shocks to the nation awakened the Korean people. In less than fifty years since the end of the Korean War, South Korea has transformed itself from a poverty-stricken country into a leading information and communication technology (ICT) country, especially in the most critical areas which support the new e-global age: the high-speed Internet and mobile communication. South Korea'S vitality as an ICT hotbed has resulted from a number of factors such as the changing global economic environment, government policies, and Korean cultural characteristics supporting ICT diffusion. The Korean government has made bold investment in technological and human infrastructures. These factors have enabled Korea to establish new competitive strategies for high-tech areas, especially ICT. Korean cultural characteristics that have contributed to a favorable environment for ICT development and diffusion include, among others, valuing efficiency and speed, self-efficacy, a subjective norm of belongingness, and the Korean language. The Korean experience, especially its economic transformation and ICT diffusion process, should be of interest to the governments of developing and developed countries as well as to scholars and executives involved in international business.",,

Indeed, these challenges have implications for virtually every aspect of a firm's strategy and business model. Yet, most managers frame sustainable development not as a multidimensional opportunity, but rather as a one-dimensional nuisance, involving regulations, added cost, and liability. This approach leaves firms ill-equipped to deal with the issue in a strategic manner. Accordingly, we develop a sustainable-value framework that links the challenges of global sustainability to the creation of shareholder value by the firm. Specifically, we show how the global challenges associated with sustainable development, viewed through the appropriate set of business lenses, can help to identify strategies and practices that contribute to a more sustainable world while simultaneously driving shareholder value; this we define as the creation of sustainable value by the firm.",,

Recently, however, the corporate world has been described as suffering from an ""overdose"" of stock option compensation. We argue that more attention should be paid to the design of stock options to enhance their effectiveness. In support of this argument, we first review the upsides and downsides of stock options from recipient, company, and shareholder perspectives. Next, we identify conditions in which stock options can help a company implement a strategy and motivate key talent. We then provide guidelines for designing stock options, suggesting that managers must ask the following questions: Who should receive stock options? How many? What terms should be used? How often? At what price? What ownership? Careful consideration of these questions will lead to employee stock option compensation that promotes strategic goals; enables companies to recruit, motivate, and retain employee talent; and satisfies organizational stakeholders. Finally, we highlight some emerging trends that managers must take into account in future stock option designs.",,

Through a survey of nearly a hundred outsourcing efforts in Europe and the United States, I found that one or more of seven ""deadly sins"" underlie most failed outsourcing efforts: (1) outsourcing activities that should not be outsourced; (2) selecting the wrong vendor; (3) writing a pool contract; (4) overlooking personnel issues; (5) losing control over the outsourced activity; (6) overlooking the hidden costs of outsourcing; and (7) failing to plan an exit strategy (i.e., vendor switch or reintegration of an outsourced activity,). Outsourcing failures are rarely reported because firms are reluctant to publicize them. However, contrasting them with more successful outsourcing efforts can yield useful ""best practices."".",,

Unlike the marketplace, however, politics is not a familiar game for most managers. Many managers continue to struggle with how to better understand and constructively influence their public policy environments. In this article, I describe how and why constituency building is an especially effective foundation for formulating and implementing a comprehensive corporate political strategy. Constituency building efforts that are grounded in ongoing and systemic stakeholder management can generate political influence beyond any other means. Perhaps just as important, effective constituency building offers unique opportunities for leveraging beneficial linkages between political strategies and market-based strategies that can help enhance the competitive advantages of both. Research at the intersection of management and political science provides key insights into the importance and dynamics of constituency building. Using these research findings and a series of specific case examples, I explore overarching strategic issues for planning effective constituency building efforts and provide some practical, tactical specifics of implementation. As the emerging global economy becomes ever more complex, involving larger numbers and more diverse varieties of public stakeholders, constituency building will only increase in its importance and efficacy. Constituency building is a durable strategy that can reduce corporate and business risks as well as positively enhance overall firm performance.",,

The founder, Ingvar Kamprad, only a 17-year-old boy at the time, initially arranged for the local county milk van to transport the goods to the nearby train station. Today the IKEA Group has 70,000 co-workers and a turnover of over 11 billion euros (close to $11 billion). The IKEA concept started in the 1950s with catalogue marketing combined with a showroom where customers could see and touch IKEA products. The company's three distinct features were function, quality, and low price. Problems with suppliers led the company to start purchasing from foreign producers in Eastern Europe. During the 1960s the concept was taken even further by introducing the warehouse principle. A huge store in Stockholm was opened where customers picked the products from the shelves themselves. IKEA turned a capacity problem into a new way of delivering products to customers, which is now a cornerstone in the IKEA way of doing business. The first attempt to go abroad was made in 1963 in nearby Norway, outside Oslo. IKEA took the lead in using nontraditional materials for furniture, like plastics, that made IKEA design well-known worldwide. The company also targeted younger families. It moved to the U.S. in the mid-1980s and has been targeting Eastern and Central Europe since the 1990s. Today IKEA has over 150 stores in more than 20 countries. CEO Anders Dahlvig started his career at IKEA in 1984, after an undergraduate degree in business administration at Lund University in Sweden and a master's degree in economics from the University of California. He has held various positions in Sweden and abroad including Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and the UK.

Practicing managers, so it is claimed, search for knowledge that will help them improve organizational performance but rarely consult the work of university-based researchers - work that they often find incomprehensible and irrelevant to their day-to-day challenges. Researchers assert that rather than being interested in systematic and long-term solutions, managers are generally infatuated with the latest fads and fashions in their search for quick fixes. We contend that management research can matter to managers, but for this to occur requires mutually beneficial partnerships involving managers and researchers, as well as the support of their organizations. To support our contention, we illustrate the importance of practice-relevant management research by drawing on four important contributions to management understanding that were prompted by the organizational experiences of a group of inquiring managers and curious researchers. Together these illustrations not only demonstrate how partnerships between practicing managers and management researchers can yield practice-relevant knowledge, but also provide insights into enhancing the likelihood that productive encounters will occur.",,

Given the complementary resources of these two types of organizations, forming cross-sector collaborations that more effectively use the knowledge and capabilities of both can create new opportunities to achieve both greater corporate profitability and stronger environmental protection. A growing interest by some corporations and NPOs in reconsidering traditional adversarial relationships is yielding new forms of cooperation. Executives interested in participating in more intensive cross-sector collaborations on environmental issues need to know about the types of interactions in which corporations and NPOs are now engaging and how cross-sector alliances are similar to or differ from conventional corporate strategic alliances.

Mr. Pagrotsky's views on government's role in encouraging economic, social, and cultural development are not uncontroversial. He suggests that the perception of a 'Welfare state as rigid and complacent' does not fit the Swedish model. He argues that respectable levels of social security are a source of vitality in Sweden. The effects of achieving it ripple though all parts of Swedish economic, political, and cultural life - from technology, to science, to business, to music, to cuisine - making Sweden, and its only 9 million residents, a unique competitive and productive force in the global arena. He points to Sweden's remarkable record of low inflation, high employment, high productivity growth, impressive innovation rates, vibrant entrepreneurship, and history of producing competitive world-class companies as evidence of the fruits of achieving a form of social security that encourages risk-taking, flexibility, and assertive cooperation, not rigidity and complacency.

During the last decade, strategic alliances have become an increasingly popular third alternative to either internal or acquired growth. Alliances can be cheaper, more flexible, and faster than internal or M&A growth. However, they suffer from a major drawback that makes many practitioners wary, namely the difficult issue of sharing control. One of the comparative strengths of Swedish corporate culture is the ability to cooperate laterally through sharing control. Several Swedish multinational corporations such as IKEA and H&M have turned this national trait info a successful strategic growth virtue. In this article, we discuss how some important Swedish organizational, leadership, brand, and career characteristics have been combined into a powerful international growth recipe. The Swedish ""growth cocktail"" of combining brand-driven, forward, internal growth with resource-saving supplier alliances with minimal loss of control can be deployed by other companies of different nationalities. These complementary forward and backward expansion forms can be enhanced through matching the external brand image and internal brand identity. Pluralistic career management is also essential to sustaining such international growth combinations.",,

Will Irish business be able to maintain this outstanding performance in the face of a world economic slowdown, and problems brought on by success itself? These questions of sustainability are examined, alongside the implications for management of public policy and of foreign-owned and indigenous Irish enterprises. The model of the 'Flexible developmental state' (FDS) is applied to Ireland.1 New forms of industrial organization-like transnational networks with their fluid global movements of money, information, and resources-are especially appropriate in the FDS. The FDS government plays a key role in integrating local and global business in three ways. One is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and then build local networks of production and innovation around the subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies (MNCs). FDL in the context of a global economy, was the catalyst that animated the developmental process in 1990s Ireland. The second FDS thrust is to cultivate indigenous networks of innovation and encourage them to internationalize. The third element of the FDS is the creation of a stable macroeconomic and financial environment that fostered Irish adaptation to, and participation in, the global economy.2 The 'Flexible' component of the FDS is that the Irish government, working through state agencies, shaped the organizational cultures and capabilities of both indigenous firms and MNC subsidiaries, but without directly dictating their activities.",,

Although comparatively unknown outside Malaysia, the company is a local success story whose sustained growth and profitability reflect the skills and values of three generations of the Yeoh family. Yeoh Cheng Liam founded a timber business in the 1920s, and his son, Yeoh Tiong Lay (whose initials form the company name) expanded into construction of army housing, schools, and commercial buildings as Malaysia modernized during the 1960s. By the 1980s, the company was designing, raising capital for, and building hospitals, universities, residential properties, high-rise office buildings, industrial facilities, and other infrastructure projects. In 1993 it became the first independent power producer (IPP) in Malaysia. Tiong Lay's eldest son, Francis Yeoh, completed a civil engineering Honours degree in England. On his return to Malaysia in 1978, he was given responsibility for day-to-day management of the firm-at the young age of 24. He has overseen the growth of YTL into a major conglomerate with significant business in six core areas: construction contracting, power generation, cement manufacturing, property development, hotel development and management, and IT and e-commerce. Three subsidiaries, in addition to the parent corporation, are now listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and have a combined market capitalization of almost $5 billion. YTL Corporation has also had a secondary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since 1996. A technology subsidiary, YTL e-Solutions Berhad, was listed on the Malaysian MESDAQ market in July 2002. YTL has gained a reputation for the quality and innovativeness of its financial management (a characteristic that enabled the firm to remain profitable during the 1997 Asian economic crisis) as much as for its ability to deliver successful projects in record time. Jeffrey C. Kennedy compiled the material for this ""interview"" from Francis Yeoh's speeches and reports, made available by YTL Corporation, in particular a speech by Yeoh to the Siemens Global Power Generation Symposium, 2002.",,
Practical retention policy for the practical manager,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036579438&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.7173588&partnerID=40&md5=f48460a083e9a67459a6c1365359f66d,"Labor markets have been tightening over the past decade, and replacement costs associated with filling vacancies have been spiraling upward for years. Development of fully integrated retention policy may be one of the most effective responses that workforce managers can make to these kinds of problems. Integrated retention policy uses problem-relevant information to shape focused retention initiatives. Retention research can help in the policy-development process. Retention research can shed light on the value of standard practices (e.g., exit interviews), offer telling insights into patterns and trends in employee behavior (e.g., the relative tendencies of high and low performers), and provide information relating to the efficacy of popular retention strategies (e.g., Expectation Lowering Training). In this article we show how the findings of retention research may be used to inform and enlighten a policy-formulation process.",,

Globalization and the environment: Strategies for international voluntary environmental initiatives,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036704443&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.8540373&partnerID=40&md5=aadd507ec76ed2a5471f65df0682591f,"Executive overview: Multinational firms and their global supply chains are facing increasing pressures for environmental responsibility from non-governmental actors. Reasons for these increasing pressures include concerns about the ability of national governments to regulate firms' environmental conduct in the global economy and the increasing influence of non-governmental organizations theft are extending their reach into supply chains. International voluntary environmental initiatives (VEIs) are emerging as an important tool for corporate environmental self-regulation in the global economy. In the past decade, the number of national and international VEIs has grown from a handful to hundreds. Although these initiatives are not mandated by government regulations, firms can decide to adopt them and adhere to their requirements. This article analyzes reasons for the emergence of international VEIs, explains the importance of this trend for business, and develops a strategic framework to help firms manage their involvement in VEIs. A firm's capabilities to address each particular environmental issue and the strategic importance of each issue are key factors to consider in selecting a strategy. We develop a roadmap for business decision-makers and conclude with a discussion of the impact of international VEIs on the role of government regulations in the global economy.",,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on a decade of social and economic change in Brazil,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036579391&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.7173472&partnerID=40&md5=6301a6f6099fba008b852a4d235e53d6,"Fernando Henrique Cardoso has been the president of the Federative Republic of Brazil since January 1, 1995. He was reelected in 1998 in the first elections round, with 53% of the vote. Prior to becoming a public figure, sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso had a successful career in academia. He was associate director of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and visiting professor at the Collège de France and the University of Paris-Nanterre. He also taught at Cambridge, Stanford, and Berkeley. He was chairman of the International Sociology Association (ISA), 1982-1986. He is currently professor emeritus at the São Paulo University. He has published many articles, both in Brazil and abroad, chief among which are ""Mudanças sociais na América latina"" (""Social Changes in Latin America""), ""Dependency and Development in Latin America"" (with Enzo Faletto), ""Política e Desenvolvimento em Sociedades Dependentes"" (""Politics and Development in Dependent Societies""), and ""A Construção da Democracia"" (""The Building of Democracy""). Fernando Henrique Cardoso's political career began with his election as senator. A co-founder of Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira (PSDB, The Party of Brazilian Social-Democracy) in 1988, he led the party's senatorial front until 1992. He was appointed minister of foreign relations and of finance before his election to the presidency. As finance minister, Cardoso was the architect of the so-called ""Real Plan,"" a recovery strategy to bail out the country's ailing economy. Enormously successful, the plan controlled Brazil's runaway inflation. As president, he promoted numerous reforms, including measures in pursuit of monetary stability, the privatization of state monopolies, and the reduction of trade restrictions. His permanent focus, as the interview below will reveal, has been reducing social inequities in Brazil.",,
Organizational designs for R & D,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14244271958&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.8540314&partnerID=40&md5=ce2e07c2e913bce945cb3f3c01c41d85,"Research and development is becoming increasingly business-oriented, and corporate reliance on new technology and innovation is greater than ever. How can R&D activities be organized to yield the greatest value for the enterprise? A study of 14 leading technology-intensive companies in six industries illustrates how three organizational designs are being used to manage distributed, flexible R&D organizations: (1) decentralized, (2) networked, and (3) integrated, Decentralized designs limit the role of a central R&D group; they direct R&D resources more toward products and markets rather than basic scientific activities. Networked designs push the boundaries of R&D outside the confines of a central R&D group and the firm as a whole. Integrated models use sophisticated communication linkages to tie centralized, science-based activities with the business needs of the corporation. Within the three design approaches, there are design variants, each with its positive and negative tradeoffs. We show how some designs for R&D are more effective than others and provide suggestions for how companies in search of an ideal organization design for R&D can select among possible configurations to promote adaptive, value-oriented R&D organizations.",,

Joint venture dissolution as corporate divorce,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036579413&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.7173550&partnerID=40&md5=db4c4ce2b458883d4bf7b6bc87bc103a,"Although ""corporate divorces"" among joint venture (JV) partners are frequent, JV managers are often caught off guard by the prospect of termination and are ill prepared to cope with the tensions and uncertainties associated with the breakdown of the relationship. We argue that, economic and strategic rationales aside, the dissolution process itself is an important determinant of the outcome when a JV relationship is terminated. Drawing on the human divorce literature, we use divorce as a metaphorical image through which a four-phase dissolution process is developed. Managers are advised to watch for warning signals revealing a fraying relationship. They need to pay particular attention to the asymmetry between the divorce initiator and partner, the repercussions of going public, and the impact of the aftermath on future strategic relationships.",,
Pursuing competitive advantage through integrated global sourcing,2002,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036579493&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2002.7173538&partnerID=40&md5=3336f0dc8b85c899c74537d4679aab7b,"As organizations search for new ways to gain competitive advantage, the development of progressive global strategies and approaches becomes an increasingly attractive option. Perhaps more than any other area in business today, integrated global sourcing strategies offer the potential for major performance gains. Since most organizations do not have well-developed global sourcing processes or strategies in place, improvement opportunities are indeed attractive and largely unrealized. This article enhances our understanding of global sourcing by identifying the differences between international purchasing and global sourcing within a five-level framework that highlights the progression from domestic purchasing only to the coordination and integration of global requirements. The primary focus of this article is a presentation of the factors that differentiate successful from less successful global sourcing efforts. The article concludes with a brief discussion of lessons learned and future global sourcing enhancements and improvements.",,

The seven questions that exhibited the greatest disagreement between current research findings and respondents' beliefs are explored, along with their management implications and suggestions for implementing the findings.",,

From the voices of participants in new-product development processes in high-technology organizations, we report what we have learned about the distinctive features of highly innovation-supportive cultures in product-innovation settings and propose how organizations might develop such cultures.",,

In 1996 Lockheed Martin completed its strategic combination with the defense electronics and systems integration businesses of Loral. Lockheed Martin currently employs about 125,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, and integration of advanced technology systems, products, and services. Its operating units are organized into broad business areas, including aeronautics (e.g., tactical aircraft, airlift, and aeronautical research and development), space systems (e.g., space launch, commercial satellites, government satellites, and strategic missiles), systems integration (e.g., missiles and fire control naval systems, platform integration, and C4I), and technology services (e.g., federal services, energy programs, commercial IT, and aeronautical services). In 2001 Lockheed Martin reported total sales of $24 billion in addition to a record sales backlog of more than $71 billion. Dr. Vance D. Coffman, Lockheed Martin Corporation's chief executive officer and chairman of its board of directors, was elected to his current position in 1997 after serving as the corporation's president and chief operating officer and, earlier, as executive vice president and chief operating officer. Previously, he served as president and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin's Space and Strategic Missiles Sector. Prior to the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta in 1995, he served as executive vice president of Lockheed Corporation. Before that, he was president of the Space Systems Division of Lockheed Missiles & Space Company and a vice president of the corporation. Born in Kinross, Iowa, Dr. Coffman holds a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University and master's and doctoral degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University. Coffman joined Lockheed's Space Systems Division in 1967 as a guidance and control systems analyst. After leading the development of several major space programs and large ground data processing systems, he was appointed a vice president in 1985, division vice president and assistant general manager in 1987, and president of the Space Systems Division in 1988. While in that position, he was responsible for the Hubble Space Telescope, the MILSTAR satellite communications program, and the Follow-on Early Warning System (now called the Space Based Infrared System). As CEO and chairman of the board, Coffman presided over Lockheed Martin's financial turnaround during a period of worldwide defense and aerospace industry consolidation (as two dozen companies shrunk to four or five) as well as the successful Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) bid that holds the potential for $300 billion in future sales. Dr. Coffman currently serves on the board of directors at Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and 3M. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), the American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics (in which he became a Fellow in 1996), the American Astronautical Society (in which he became a Fellow in 1991), the American Defense Preparedness Association/National Security Industrial Association, and the Security Affairs Support Association.",,

Its objective is to reduce operating costs as a way of increasing earnings and stock prices. A study of S&P 500 firms from 1982-2000, however, casts serious doubt on the long-term payoff of this approach. The purpose of this article is to suggest several alternative approaches to restructuring. In contrast to employment downsizing, a strategy that regards people as costs to be cut, a responsible restructuring strategy focuses on people as assets to be developed. This focus recognizes that people are the source of innovation and renewal, especially in knowledge-based organizations, and that the development of new markets, customers, and revenue streams depends on the wise use of a firm's human assets. The article presents company examples and research-based findings that illustrate mistakes to avoid and affirmative steps to take when restructuring responsibly.",,

Based on a comprehensive set of interviews with a subset of team members, team leaders, general managers, and executives on 65 virtual teams at Sabre, Inc.-an innovative organization in the travel industry-we identify five challenges that organizations can expect to encounter in establishing, maintaining, and supporting virtual teams, e.g., building trust, cohesion, and team identity, and overcoming isolation among virtual team members. Both leaders and members of virtual teams face particular difficulties in selecting team members who have the balance of technical and interpersonal skills and abilities required to work virtually and in evaluating the performance of individuals and teams working in virtual space. Examination of Sabre's strategies for coping with each challenge should be instructive to other organizations using or considering virtual teams.",,

This reticence is illustrated through an analysis of the adoption of ISO 14001, an international environmental-management system intended to advance the sustainable-development agenda in organizations. Interviewed managers said they resisted the standard because the benefits of ISO 14001 did not outweigh the costs and because in-house environmental systems served the same purpose. While part of this reticence can be attributed to the standard itself, it is also partly due to the nature of the issue of sustainable development. It is a societal issue to which most firms do not know how to respond. To bridge this divide, sustainable development must become more institutionalized in the regulations, norms, and mindsets of Americans. By translating the general principles of sustainable development into business practices, by developing better measures of sustainable development, and by empowering and engaging employees, firms are more likely to embrace sustainable development so that it permeates all organizational activities.",,
McKinsey's Managing Director Rajat Gupta on leading a knowledge-based global consulting organization,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-15544388577&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2001.4614868&partnerID=40&md5=5462df99c512a6c45c046c82e8a9d4ba,"Since its founding 75 years ago, McKinsey & Company's primary mission has been to help clients achieve substantial, lasting improvements in their strategies, organizations, and operations. The consulting firm's more than one thousand clients include 100 of the 150 largest global companies, as well as governments, institutions, and nonprofit organizations. With 84 offices worldwide, McKinsey operates as a global network guided by its ""One Firm"" concept of a common service standard for all clients. Projects have included designing the original organization of NASA, developing the Universal Product Code, and providing advice on the German, Russian, and South Korean economies. In July 2000, Rajat Gupta began his third three-year term as managing director of McKinsey & Company. In an age of revolving-door senior executives, his career stands as a testimonial to institutional loyalty and the virtues of professional renewal. Born in New Delhi in 1948, he joined McKinsey in New York in 1973 with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and an MBA from Harvard. He likes to say that, since he never really practiced as an engineer, McKinsey is the only place he has ever worked, even as a summer job. After heading McKinsey offices in Scandinavia and Chicago, Mr. Gupta was elected in 1994 as the firm's first non-American-born managing director. In that post, he steers a decentralized private partnership of 7,000 consultants worldwide, including some 900 partners who are leaders in their own right. Among his more notable early accomplishments was putting in place the building blocks for McKinsey's global expansion-resulting in the opening of nearly 50 of the firm's 84 offices worldwide since 1994. More recently he has also rebalanced the firm's client portfolios to bring together its traditional client base of large incumbent corporations and the leading companies of the new Internet economy. Outside of McKinsey, he played 'an instrumental role in establishing the Indian School of Business, scheduled to open its doors in July 2001. Throughout this period of rapid growth and expanded presence for McKinsey, Mr. Gupta has stressed a steady commitment to preserving and enhancing the firm's enduring mission: delivering objective, independent client service, and building a firm that is one of the world's primary destinations for talented individuals to work. Today he sees himself and McKinsey standing at an interesting juncture, as a global network of high-quality resources, with deep industry knowledge and a strong system of values, facing a single big question: what does the new economy mean?",,

Although this recognition has permeated many established companies, there is uncertainty about how to accomplish such innovation. This article is based on a six-year longitudinal study of 12 radical-innovation projects in 10 large, mature companies. The life cycle of radical-innovation projects is unlike those of incremental projects, because of an abundance of uncertainties and discontinuities. These characteristics require that radical-innovation projects be managed quite differently from incremental ones. Seven key strategic imperatives are offered for successfully implementing radical innovation.",,

GIobal presence makes available to the firm's managers five value-creation opportunities: to adapt to local market differences, to exploit economies of global scale, to exploit economies of global scope, to tap optimal locations for activities and resources, and to maximize knowledge transfer across locations. However, each of these opportunities is associated with significant obstacles and challenges that often prevent firms from exploiting them optimally. To overcome these challenges, managers need to adopt a two-step approach for analysis and action. They should first evaluate the optimality of the firm's global network for each value-chain activity along the dimensions of activity architecture, competencies at the locations, and coordination across locations. Based on this evaluation, they should then design and execute actions to mitigate or eliminate the suboptimalities.",,

Medical technology was targeted by Israeli firms because it was perceived to be attractive and global. Nevertheless, to acquire access to complementary technologies, to amass sufficient capital and marketing resources, and to compensate for market-knowledge shortcomings, many of the firms adopted cooperative strategies. Our findings show that, overall firms that have undertaken alliances marginally underperformed those that have not, suggesting that the benefits of alliances are counterweighed by their drawbacks. R&D alliances with a foreign firm outperformed alliances with a local partner; in contrast, production alliances involving another Israeli firm outperformed alliances with a foreign firm, except for cost. Foreign-partner alliances in marketing were superior to local alliances, but did not enhance survivability. Implications for strategic-alliance formation are discussed.",,

It identifies seven lessons on how to motivate the members of a team and how to structure a team and its work.

Nevertheless, managers need to note some caveats regarding this theory. Contrary to the guidance provided by the resource-based view, the values of certain resources and capabilities may actually be enhanced by seeking more rather than less competition, limiting rather than supporting functional successes, and destroying rather than protecting their exclusivity. We examine five situations in which certain processes may cause seemingly valuable resources and capabilities to lead instead to competitive disadvantages for firms as diverse as Hewlett-Packard, Food Lion, and AT & T. These trade-offs suggest that managers following the resource-based view as a guide may focus too narrowly on individual resources and capabilities, without adequately appreciating the interactions among multiple resources and capabilities and their interactions with the environment.",,

Pressures for expanding the emphasis on profits to managing responsibly derive from three general sources: primary stakeholders such as owners, employees, customers, and suppliers; secondary stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), activists, communities, and governments; and general societal trends and institutional forces. The latter include a proliferation of ""best of"" rankings, the steady emergence and development of global principles and standards that are raising public expectations about corporate responsibility, and new reporting initiatives emphasizing the socalled triple bottom lines of economic, social and environmental performance. To respond to these pressures, many multinational corporations (MNCs) in particular are developing what we have called total responsibility management (TRM) systems approaches for managing their responsibilities to stakeholders and the natural environment. In this article we outline the dominant pressures pushing the evolution of total responsibility management and present a managerial framework that highlights the three main components of TRM approaches - inspiration (vision), integration, and improvement/innovation - with the indicators inherent to a responsibility measurement approach.",,

In particular, we explore what is unique about the entertainment industry and how 15 high-profile women TV executives have succeeded in managing these challenges. For managing their careers, we found that there were several unique aspects with implications for other executives, such as the importance of being perceived as having the creative ""Midas touch"" and the necessity of developing a 360-degree approach towards networking. We learned that while managing in Hollywood presents a few unique challenges, it does not necessarily present specialized solutions. Finally, for managing work-personal life balance, we found that some major differences emerged with respect to values and philosophy towards managing work and personal life, at both the organizational and personal levels, that seemed to be unique. The women in this study defied the traditional concept of ""having it all"" and offered expanded definitions of family. In sum, this study increases our knowledge of the entertainment industry overall the unique ways in which women executives in the entertainment business respond to specific challenges, and provides lessons pertinent to executives in other industries.",,

Marriott International started in 1927 when J. Willard Marriott took his new bride Alice Sheets from Salt Lake City, Utah to Washington, D.C. and opened a nine-stool A & W root beer stand, which they later called ""The Hot Shoppe."" Hot Shoppes expanded throughout the east coast, and in 1937 Marriott added an airline catering business at Hoover Field (currently the site of the Pentagon). The division was named In-Flite Catering and served Capital, Eastern, and American Airlines. Growing up as J. Willard Marriott's son, J. W. Marriott, Jr., served in a number of capacities in the Hot Shoppes during his high school and college years, ultimately joining the company full time in 1956. Just eight months later, Mr. Marriott took over management of the company's first venture into the lodging industry-the 365-room Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, VA. In January 1964, J.W. Marriott, Jr., was elected executive vice president of Marriott Corporation and a member of the board of directors. He became president of the company in November 1964 and succeeded his father as chief executive officer in 1972. Just one year after he took the helm as CEO, the company obtained its first hotel management contract and two years later opened its first European hotel in Amsterdam, Holland. In 1977 Marriott International celebrated its 50th anniversary with sales topping $1 billion. Over the next 25 years as the CEO and as chairman of the board since 1985, J. W. Marriott, Jr., has built on the legacy and company culture established by his father and grown the company more than twenty times with sales of over $20 billion per year today.",,

However, doing business within emerging countries can be frustrating. As a case in point, in the largest South American economy there is a saying that goes: ""Brazil is not for beginners."" For casual foreign observers, the country may appear to have the same institutions and traits as developed Western nations. But acting on that assumption may well lead to unsuccessful frustrating experiences. Behind the Brazilian façade lie institutions still under construction and a complex, hybrid, and everchanging business culture. In this article, we seek to contribute to the understanding of the Brazilian business environment. We deal specifically with the importation and adoption of managerial expertise. We propose a framework to explain the reasons for adoption of this expertise and the reaction of Brazilian companies to it. Based on field surveys, we have identified the three most typical approaches to the adoption of imported managerial expertise: unreasoned adoption, ceremonial behavior, and managerial anthropophagy (cannibalism). We propose that the latter may be at once a perspective for analysis and an appropriate strategy to carry out successful enterprises in Brazil. We also present suggestions to increase the possibility of success for business ventures in Brazil.",,

Are older employees being left behind when it comes to continuous learning? The increasing importance of continuous learning and development for employees, combined with a graying of the workforce, makes these questions serious ones for administrators striving both to maintain competitive human resources and stay out of court. Comparing behavioral and legal perspectives, this article explores the possibility that age may explain differences in treatment of workers, and whether this could affect terms, conditions, or privileges of employment in a significant way. From a behavioral perspective, differences in treatment in this area could be a detriment to older workers. From a legal perspective, differences in treatment by age could be used as evidence of discrimination; however, older employees asserting legal claims based solely on inadequate learning opportunities may face an uphill battle. Could age-related effects on training and development opportunities become increasingly actionable from a legal perspective? Current trends suggest that they could. Four categories of recommendations are made that may help avert age discrimination in training and development.",,

On its maiden voyage in August of 1628, after going less than one mile, the vessel keeled over and sank I10 feet to the bottom of the Stockholm harbor. Fifty crewmembers went down with the ship. It was truly a disaster-and an excellent example of a failure in the new-product development process. In this article, we show how insights gleaned from the Vasa incident are relevant to contemporary organizations. Seven potential problems in new-product development are examined. Together, these problems comprise the Vasa syndrome-a complex set of challenges that can ultimately overwhelm an organization's capabilities. Each problem provides an opportunity to develop managerial competencies in understanding these problem areas, linking these problems to failures described in the Vasa case and contemporary organizations, and determining how to avoid or minimize these problems in the new-product development process. The Vasa case and examples from contemporary organizations demonstrate how history continues to repeat itself in the process of new-product development, and we provide guidelines on how to avoid falling prey to the Vasa syndrome.",,

Journal and newspaper articles abound,2 and professional books have been written on the subject.3 Unlike many literature-based, academic concepts, these fads and fashions are well known by practicing managers. This article focuses on five management fads of the late 20th century, each one representative of a management trend of a specific decade: MBO (1950s), sensitivity training (1960s), quality circles (1970s), total quality management (1980s), and self-managed or self-directed teams (1990s). In each case, this article explores the origin of the fad through its evolution into mainstream management practice. Further, each fad is examined to determine relevance to current management practice. The article offers practical guidelines for managers regarding which fads to embrace and when.",,

The conventional wisdom that has emerged is useful but insufficient to improve success rates. The leading innovators achieve success by moving beyond conventional wisdom to follow three emerging rules. In the past, managers obsessed about the product, obscuring the fact that what customers really want is a total solution to a problem. Similarly, managers too often emphasized the introduction of the new product at the expense of ensuring the delivery of the customer solution. Lastly, managers become internally absorbed, causing them to make decisions based on what is easiest for them and their company. The most successful marketers are, in a sense, schizophrenic. By simultaneously being able to become the customer, the competition, and their channel partner, they combine the right skills, capabilities, and resources to deliver superior customer solutions. Just as important as having a superior product or service, a firm must build a better business model and a stronger network of value-delivery partners to get a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. Competition is shifting from company versus company to network versus network. At a time when fickle marketplaces demand ever more innovation, progress in this area has never been more important.",,

In spite of this, many local private Chinese enterprises are succeeding, although they face an institutional environment that can be quite hostile. One of the principal reasons many local private firms have been able to succeed in a challenging environment where many multinationals have struggled is that they pursue strategic actions that establish their legitimacy in the society. The result is that the negative impact of meddlesome officials and the lack of well-codified and enforceable laws is reduced. This article identifies nine legitimacy-building strategies that local private firms have employed in China's transition economy.

These writings depict homo sapiens as an individualistic, utility-maximizing, transaction-oriented species. In contrast, recent scholarship has revealed the gender and racio-ethnic biases of these theories, and shown them to be invalid models of human nature. Humans are social and communal beings. Along with rationality, we are guided by emotions such as anxiety, hope, disappointment, fear, anger, excitement, pity, and remorse. By acknowledging the importance of emotions, world management discourse can evolve more holistic, inclusive, and emancipatory theories. South Africa offers a unique opportunity for understanding the African concept of ubuntu or humaneness. Ubuntu is rich with consideration for compassion and communality.

The framework draws upon the entrepreneur,hip and strategy literatures, and is illustrated primarily by the experiences of five entrepreneurial ventures we studied throughout the decade of the 1990s. Actions, based on the framework, are suggested for Russian entrepreneurs as well as Western executives who might do business with them, as ways of strengthening Russian entrepreneurship.",,

Other things being equal, industry leadership, because of scale and scope effects and customer-switching costs, is often associated with greater profitability. Industry leaders also enjoy other reputation and brand-identification benefits. This article examines how challengers can successfully overtake industry leaders. The focus is on the specific competitive behaviors or new competitive actions that challengers take to dethrone the leader. The study also examines the competitive actions leaders take to guard against aggressive challengers. Employing Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction, the article describes the dynamic competitive actions and reactions of challengers and industry leaders in what the authors refer to as the battle for king of the hill. Drawing from a sample of nearly five thousand competitive actions in 41 industries over a seven-year period, we found that successful challengers were more aggressive in taking action, carried out a more complex repertoire of actions, were unpredictable in the timing and location of attack, and were able to delay the reaction of industry leaders. The reasons that industry leaders fall victim to the actions of challengers are discussed, and strategies are offered for industry leaders to more effectively defend their position as king of the hill.",,

Executives now talk about their ""service strategy,"" their ""branding strategy,"" their ""acquisition strategy,"" or whatever kind of strategy that is on their mind at a particular moment. But strategists-whether they are CEOs of established firms, division presidents, or entrepreneurs-must have a strategy, an integrated, overarching concept of how the business will achieve its objectives. If a business must have a single, unified strategy, then it must necessarily have parts. What are those parts? We present a framework for strategy design, arguing that a strategy has five elements, providing answers to five questions-arenas: where will we be active? vehicles: how will we get there? differentiators: how will we win in the marketplace? staging: what will be our speed and sequence of moves? economic logic: how will we obtain our returns?

This article draws from the authors"" experience in over 70 mergers and acquisitions to understand the managerial actions that distinguish successful from disappointing combinations. It focuses on early efforts in the precombination phase that steer a combination toward the successful path. Precombination preparation covers strategic and psychological matters. The strategic challenges concern key analyses that clarify and bring into focus the sources of synergy in a combination.

Managing organizational competencies for competitive advantage: The middle-management edge,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0009389121&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2001.4614966&partnerID=40&md5=e4d39d2784b6b8775b24107240ce90de,"Although most managers recognize that a firm's competencies are an important source of competitive advantage, many firms encounter difficulties when they attempt to identify and assess those competencies. Specific competencies are often ambiguous to managers, and individual perceptions of a firm's competencies may vary significantly. This lack of specificity may mask significant misunderstanding and confusion about competencies. When this misunderstanding or confusion occurs among middle managers who are responsible for the day-to-day management of these competencies, the implications for an organization can be serious. We identify and examine key characteristics of competencies and the relationship between middle managers"" perceptions of competencies and firm performance. We report a study of middle managers at 17 organizations in two industries: textile manufacturing and hospitals. Results demonstrate the linkages between competency characteristics and firm success In addition, we describe a method that any firm can use to assess its competencies, and we show how management can use the assessment to enhance the firm's competitive advantage.",,
The power of emotional appeals in promoting organizational change programs,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0003154091&doi=10.5465%2fame.2001.5897664&partnerID=40&md5=958c9673fb2133f53a7bbbe94ed4c962,"In attempting to persuade employees to support an organizational change strategy, managers usually place their prime emphasis on the cognitive elements of persuasion, using mainly rational arguments. The central message of this article is that, in any change implementation program, the emotional elements of persuasion must be taken into consideration. The importance of emotions in organizations is discussed, and practical methods on how to use emotions in the change process are offered. These methods are organized around five domains: the core messages, how the messages are packaged, the characteristics of the change leaders, the interaction of change leaders with their audience, and the setting in which interactions with employees take place.",,
Firm rebirth: Buyouts as facilitators of strategic growth and entrepreneurship,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000810538&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2001.4251486&partnerID=40&md5=19f443fd2f64da44daab9986930c2a00,"Buyouts, especially leveraged buyouts, have been perceived historically as an organizational efficiency tool to streamline organizational processes, reduce workforces, and decrease unit costs. This efficiency approach has been especially useful with mature firms, where the structure of debt and limits to managerial spending decrease the downside risk and possible failure of the firm. This article illustrates how buyouts can also create entrepreneurial opportunities and allow upside growth. In particular, it focuses on understanding the aspects and circumstances of the entrepreneurial mindsets of managers who seek upside growth through buyouts. These entrepreneurial mindsets provide a wider view of buyouts as a vehicle for renewal that frequently leads to revitalization and strategic innovation. The article provides insights for entrepreneurs, managers, and financiers by articulating four categories of buyout opportunity-efficiency, revitalization, entrepreneurial, and failure buyouts. We specify the conditions under which each may be appropriate, including the governance and financial incentives, and give company examples for each category.",,
Napoleon's tragic march home from Moscow: Lessons in hubris,2000,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242679176&doi=10.5465%2fame.2000.2909844&partnerID=40&md5=5d546b0c9d2ef05034f89c5d236ec91d,"Throughout history, hubris has been cited as a common reason for leadership failure.One of the more famous examples of hubris at work was Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812, in which he lost his army and empire. The authors examine the consequences of both Napoleon's hubris and the hubris of contemporary business executives. Among the anagerial behaviors that may reflect hubris are making unsound and over-priced corporate acquisitions, pursuing growth for its own sake, and knowingly violating the standards of acceptable conduct. Using historical material on Napoleon as well as contemporary business examples, we examine the causes of hubris and specific leader behaviors that are likely to result. Guidelines for reducing the incidence of hubris are suggested.",,

This article examines a number of these undertakings to illustrate how they function as role-expansion mechanisms, and how they implicitly define five role characteristics generally reflective of a proactive employee. While job and task competence, interpersonal effectiveness, and organizational orientation have always been associated with the employee role, the other two role characteristics - enterprising qualities and personal integrity - represent relatively new expectations. These new demands raise some important issues for firms and managers, centered on differences associated with the firm's, the manager's, and the employee's expectations regarding the use of judgment and initiative. The article examines some implications of these differences, discusses person-environment fit considerations, and proposes recommendations for handling the problem. It concludes with a discussion of how the continuing evolution of the employee role blurs the traditional line between manager and employee, and how this affects the traditional managerial role.",,
Medtronic's Chairman William George on how mission-driven companies create long-term shareholder value,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0009917383&doi=10.5465%2fame.2001.5897653&partnerID=40&md5=a00ee4f1c2d86fe4bd682e94800ba0a6,"William W. George, chairman and CEO of Medtronic, Inc., delivered the keynote address and received the Distinguished Executive of the Year Award at the Academy of Management's annual conference in Washington, D.C., in August. His leadership exemplifies the highest ideals and values of the Academy's Distinguished Executive Award. His address focused on ways of building an innovative learning culture and an empowered organization. Medtronic, Inc., is the world's leading medical technology company, and is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A Fortune Magazine cover story named Medtronic the ""Microsoft of the medical device industry,"" and featured the company's innovative learning culture. Founded in 1949 as a producer of pacemakers for heart patients, Medtronic has expanded internally and through acquisitions into producing devices that do everything from controlling pain to reducing the tremors of Parkinson's disease. When Bill George joined Medtronic in 1989, it was a $I billion company, with most of its sales coming from pacemakers. Today it is worth $63 billion, and its $5 billion in sales worldwide come from a variety of cardiovascular devices, neurological stimulators, drug-delivery systems, and spinal implants. Bill George has instilled an innovative learning culture in Medtronic that has produced amazing achievements. For example, lead times for developing medical devices were reduced from four years to 18 months. Mr. George was deeply involved in changing the government FDA review and approval procedures of medical devices. He established a policy that 70 percent of revenues should come from products launched in the previous two years. The Economist describes Medtronic as ""the most innovative and market-savvy firm in the $160 billion a year medical-device industry, and Mr. George as one of the best strategists in health care.'"" Fortune lists Medtronic in its 100 best companies to work for, ranks it 381 in the Fortune 500, and states that it is poised to vault to the top 150 in five years. Bill George received his industrial engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1964, and his MBA from Harvard University in 1966. From 1966 to 1969, he worked in the U.S. Department of Defense as special assistant to the secretary of the Navy and assistant to the comptroller. He held executive positions with Honeywell, Inc., and Litton Industries, including serving as president of Litton Microwave Cooking Products. He joined Medtronic in 1989 as chief operating officer, and became CEO in 1991 and chairman in 1996. In June 2001, he resigned as CEO and continues as chair.",,
Board composition and high-flying founders: Hints of trouble to come?,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000944376&doi=10.5465%2fame.2001.4251562&partnerID=40&md5=e160888a74d56fd37b7f0d77cf50dfc2,"High-flying founders are the rock stars of the new economy and the dot-corn world. Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Stephen Case at America Online, Bill Gates at Microsoft are strong leaders of great companies. Previous generations produced great businesses and legendary leaders too, and many of them made mistakes of grand proportions. Henry Ford failed to see the value of diversification until nearly too late. Kenneth O/sen, cofounder of Digital Equipment Corp., suffered a form of myopia in the computer industry. Clearly, confidence born of great achievements can lead to overly conservative responses to business threats. We believe that business success creates personal and organizational forces that lead to a form of cautious conservatism, and perhaps arrogant disdain, in the face of competitive pressures for high-flying firms. One protection against this inertia-inducing conservatism is a strong board. Successful founding CEOs, however, show a tendency towards adopting weak boards. Farsighted CEOs, and their board-level advisors, can pay attention to the design and behavior of boards in high-flying firms. These founders can avoid the traps of success, and maintain the entrepreneurial zest that builds their companies and their reputations.",,
After the bubble burst: How small high-tech firms can keep in front of the wave,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010703497&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2001.5229655&partnerID=40&md5=d3db2448b78298742a81b57ea1d40464,"Organizations in today's New Time environment simply have no choice but to learn how to compete and not be swept away by the changing tides of the uncertain economy. This is especially true of small high-tech firms. This article focuses on the strategy, culture, and time orientation that influence the speed, pace, and timing needed by these firms to be successful. We interviewed the top management and surveyed the employees of Global Software Solutions, Inc. (GSSI), a representative of today's small high-tech companies that went through the unprecedented boom and bust of recent times. GSSI not only survived the roller coaster ride, but seem positioned well for the future. We also conducted a survey of employees at a similar firm we call WESO, which was struggling to survive. The leaders of GSSI provided valuable insights about their firm's flexible, adaptable culture and future time orientation. GSSI employees verified this culture and time horizon and responded significantly higher on the various dimensions than did their counterparts at the unsuccessful firm. This comparative case analysis suggests that an adaptable organizational culture and future time orientation are very important to the technology-dominated small firms in the New Time environment to get and stay in front of the wave of dramatic change.",,
Strategic performance appraisal in team-based organizations: One size does not fit all,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011697375&doi=10.5465%2fame.2001.4614990&partnerID=40&md5=9ab0b7b8780b80c811ef9e9272c05f1b,"The pervasive use of teams in today's organizations makes employee performance appraisal more challenging than in the past. Unfortunately, prescriptions offered in the business press often fail to consider the diversity of team forms used in team-based organizations. Teams differ in their membership configuration, the complexity of their tasks, and level of interdependence from other organizational units. In this article, we identify three team types and examine the fit between performance-appraisal characteristics and team types. Performance-appraisal characteristics include target (individual or team), type (outcome, behavioral or competency-based), and data source (manager or multirater). Our analysis underscores the critical need for effective leadership in designing and implementing performance appraisal systems in team-based organizations.",,
Linking outsourcing to business strategy,2000,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141537525&doi=10.5465%2fame.2000.3979816&partnerID=40&md5=35aa0ac67aa5cb0b2b7b6726a6780c43,"In today's business environment, companies are driven to conduct a few functions in-house and to obtain the rest from other sources through aggressive outsourcing. While outsourcing may seem attractive at the strategic management level serious pitfalls are often encountered as the strategy is pushed downward into operations. At the operational level, the strategic intent tends to be lost in a hectic day-to-day, problem-to-problem business environment. Outsourcing decisions made at the operational level can easily lead to dependencies that create unforeseen strategic vulnerabilities. These pitfalls are addressed by a systematic methodology that can guide the operational level to achieve strategically appropriate actions.",,

Those who must weigh the pressures for short-term efficiency against the demands for long-term effectiveness in confronting strategic resource-allocation and design decisions should consider the value of slack. Slack is important for organizational adaptation and innovation-two often-cited requirements for organizations of the future. Increasingly complex systems and technologies require more, not less, time for monitoring and processing information. Future demands for strategic flexibility and for integrating learning and knowledge throughout organizations highlight the need to reexamine the importance of time in organizational work-and to recognize that all organizational resources cannot be committed to immediate output efforts if we are to have time to pay attention, think, and benefit from the knowledge gained.",,

Using insights from the strategic-alliance literature and anecdotes from the healthcare industry, we refocus attention away from the traditional, solitary model of leadership to a shared model of leadership among the top executives of the partner organizations. In so doing, we advance three lessons for leaders to predict and explain strategic alliance success in the healthcare industry. Specifically, these lessons direct attention to top executives"" joint abilities to collaborate from a distance, to focus on creating customer value above all else, and to experiment and implement innovative ways to compete in the industry with a partner.",,

But what if you do not yet have a legacy of resource strengths? Entrepreneurs in emerging organizations must first assemble resources, then combine them to build a resource platform that will yield distinctive capabilities. The case studies included in this article illustrate the challenges entrepreneurs confront in identifying, attracting, combining, and transforming personal resources into organizational resources. We offer two analytical tools for assessing initial resource needs and developing a resource strategy that can enhance possibilities for wealth creation. Our pathway approach provides guidance for entrepreneurs constructing a resource base.",,
India's emerging competitive advantage in services,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011250823&doi=10.5465%2fame.2001.4614831&partnerID=40&md5=7fe09096136ce920e9f251c7f5fcd580,"We examine the business opportunities created by the economic and political changes underway in India. Despite short-term political volatility, we believe India's deep-rooted democratic institutions give it systemic resilience and stable economic growth, at rates that will reach 8 to 10 percent within a decade. The early evidence following economic liberalization suggests that India's emerging international competitive advantage-and the corresponding opportunities for multinational corporations-lies not in natural resource industries or low-skilL labor-intensive manufacturing (as in much of Asia), but in skill-intensive tradable services, as exemplified by software. We analyze India's virtual diamond in software and argue that this success will generalize to other knowledge-based services. As a result, India is likely to emerge in the short to medium term as the back office of global corporations and in the medium to long term as a leading provider of knowledge-based tradable services. We also explore the contribution of overseas Indians to India's skill-intensive service exports, contrasting it with the contributions of overseas Chinese to China's manufactured goods exports. We recommend that foreign firms enter India sooner rather than later to seize the emerging opportunities, and that in doing so they pay attention to the considerable differences in business environments among Indian states, rather than focus simply on the policies of the central government.",,

Entrepreneurs in these countries are characterized by their sheer energy, relentless strategies, and sometimes controversial practices. How can entrepreneurs rise to create wealth in environments traditionally hostile to entrepreneurial activities? What can be learned from such an experience? Focusing on these two key questions, this article draws on research from a broad range of transition economies to identify three major entrepreneurial strategies of prospecting, networking, and boundary blurring. It also delineates important lessons for entrepreneurs active in transition economies and foreign entrants interested in these emerging markets.",,

We have designed Crosstalk to span the two journals, and the content of each journal complements, rather than duplicates, that of the other. We plan to feature Crosstalk periodically. In this inaugural Crosstalk, Edgar Schein from the U.S. and Man/red Kets de Vries from France discuss their contributions to the field as well as their current thinking on important new concepts. An interview with Edgar Schein appears in The Executive, followed by a commentary by Dr. Kets de Vries and a reply by Dr. Schein. The February 2000 issue of European Management Journal uses the same format and includes an interview with Dr. Kets de Vries, a commentary by Schein, and Kets de Vries's reply. Abstracts of the interviews and biographical sketches are published in each journal. To gain a full perspective of the in-depth interviews, thoughtful dialogue, and lively exchange of ideas, readers are encouraged to read the Crosstalk in both journals. Edgar Schein has made many outstanding intellectual contributions over his long and distinguished career to our contemporary understanding of human behavior in groups and organizations. He was born in Switzerland of Czech and German parents and arrived in the United States at the age of 10. He considers himself thoroughly Americanized, his identity is clearly American, and at the same time he is able to draw on and empathize with European experiences. He is Sloan Fellows Professor of Management Emeritus and senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, where he has taught since 1956.1 He has written a seminal text in organizational psychology, a specialty that he helped to frame with Bernard Bass and Harold Leavitt. He was also a founder of the field of career dynamics, developed the concept and practice of process consultation, conducted and published work on clinical research, and has more recently concentrated primarily on organizational culture and leadership.2 Dr. Schein's latest activities include extending and deepening his focus on the dynamics of organizational subculture, developing a survival guide for organizational members, as well as,revisiting his early research on brainwashing and coercive persuasion in the context of organizational learning.~ The following interview integrates Dr. Schein's ideas about culture, communication, dialogue, and interpersonal relationships, with the central focus being on pathology and health in organizational settings.

Frequently, they do not know what to do next. Retiring executives can be more innovative if they consider their retirement as entering the flexibility phase of their lives, a time of continued contribution and potential gratification. The flexibility phase is the retirement stage in which managers experience more freedoms of time, location, activities, and opportunities. For a successful transition into retirement, managers need to examine and talk over their feelings and options. Their successors need to understand both the predecessors"" conflicts and their own.

Congressional action underway as this article went to press to further revise the quota to 195,000 may give more firms the opportunity to realize what their quick-moving competitors have already seen-that U.S. immigration policy provides several options for hiring knowledge workers and other professionals for short-term or permanent positions. This article casts the hiring of foreign knowledge workers as one of several staffing options available to organizations and presents information on advantages and limitations of various immigration programs. Hiring foreign professionals is not a costless panacea, though, and can raise important strategic issues that cascade through levels of management. This article examines these issues to help managers at all levels determine if hiring immigrant workers is a viable option for their professional workforce staffing.",,

This article explores the context of executive women's health in terms of their progress in organizations and the obstacles they face in rising to top leadership positions. We present the stressors women executives face, the ways they cope, and the related health problems associated with work that they experience. We provide specific guidelines for executive women and for organizations that will help manage women's risks and enhance their health.

For general managers and entrepreneurs, a keen interest is to learn how to apply entrepreneurial and strategic tools, techniques, and concepts in ways that help the firm create increasing amounts of wealth. Many of the activities that organizations engage in to create wealth take place within six domains: innovation, networks, internationalization, organizational learning, top management teams and governance, and growth. Importantly, the entrepreneurship and strategic management literatures have insights for entrepreneurs and general managers about the value to be gained by paying attention to these six domains. We describe how these insights can be classified as entrepreneurial and strategic actions, and discuss how greater wealth can be created when firms integrate these actions when seeking to create wealth.",,

The competition paradigm of simultaneous competition and cooperation is illustrated by two case studies of government intervention in the Australian wool and financial services sectors, in which government periodically uses independent task forces to review and propose future directions for industry policy. The task forces are independent of both business and government, attempting to find policy solutions that will be acceptable to the range of players in the game, including government. In recent cases, government has attempted to achieve step changes by using independent task forces that examined technological progress and the needs of the businesses in each industry to evolve and become more competitive. The challenge for government is to develop a set of rules and regulations that provide a stable basis for businesses to set strategy and operate in, yet at the same time keep policy up to date as forces such as technological change and globalization affect economies. For business executives, their opportunities are to lobby government and influence the frequency and nature of task-force processes in the pursuit of step changes.",,

Lessons from high-reliability organizations,2001,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0002926044&doi=10.5465%2fAME.2001.5229613&partnerID=40&md5=672a51133d479cf363212d1c5bdbc49f,"In the more than 15 years since the initial publication of Charles Perrow's Normal Accidents, practitioners and academics have contemplated how plane crashes, earthen-dam collapses, ship collisions, nuclear disasters, and chemical-plant explosions can be prevented, mitigated, or avoided. While no one has yet learned how to make the inevitable avoidable, a literature on high-reliability organizations (HROs) has developed that gives some hope that disasters can be minimized in frequency and severity. The : value of this research to practicing executives is to take the lessons learned through the research on NROs and apply them to their own organizations. This article is about how to beat the odds of having an incident or accident that one is unprepared for, regardless of the organization's purpose. Neither the sausage maker nor the chemical-plant manager is immune from errors that can have far-reaching consequences. The three major recommendations we offer are that managers should aggressively seek to know what they don't know, design reward and incentive systems to recognize the cost of failure and the benefits of reliability, and communicate the big picture to everyone.",,

Acquiring SOEs and forging strategic alliances-ranging in intensity from nonequity contractual relationships to joint ownership-give multinationals potential market advantages in regions like Central and Eastern Europe that are undergoing economic transformation. In many Central and Eastern European countries, however, M/VC partnerships or acquisitions can be seen as threats by state enterprises, privatized companies, government agencies, or political interest groups that oppose foreign domination of domestic industries. In order to succeed, M/VCs must develop alliances or acquisitions as win-win arrangements that benefit not only their own shareholders, but also their host-country counterparts and governments. M/VCs can carefully plan win-win arrangements through a process that clearly defines and prioritizes business objectives, identifies the most effective entry channels and options, assesses the potential impacts on major host-country stakeholders, determines local partner fit, and creates mutually beneficial results. Alliances and acquisitions are more likely to succeed when all stakeholders see M/VCs as partners in privatization and economic transformation.",,

Unfortunately, mental illness generally, and depression specifically, are not as well understood as physical disabilities. The general public continues to hold prejudices and misconceptions regarding the cause and treatment of depression. In this article we summarize relevant literature addressing these prejudices and misconceptions and analyze the major issues managers should consider when dealing with depressed employees. We offer four prescriptions for balancing the conflicting demands imposed by the law with concern for the employee, the safety of others, and shareholder value.",,

But the phenomenon has not caught on as fast as researchers projected, in part because of the inherent paradoxes associated with telecommuting. We explore three seemingly evident paradoxes of alternative work arrangements, particularly telecommuting: an increase in both structure and flexibility, a focus on both individuals and teamwork, and an increase and decrease in control. We view these paradoxes from a manager's perspective, and identify strategies for managing the paradoxes: accepting the paradox, clarifying the point of view, accounting for time, and using new perspectives. We apply these strategies to the three telecommuting paradoxes and illustrate them with examples of companies that use alternative work arrangements extensively. The article concludes with lessons for managing telecommuting arrangements.",,

Strategic leadership enhances the wealth-creation process in entrepreneurial and established organizations, and leads to above-average returns. On the other hand, managerial leadership will likely lead to average returns at best, but is most likely to achieve below-average returns and destroy wealth. Organizations led by visionaries who are not properly supported by strong managerial leadership may destroy wealth even more quickly than organizations led by managerial leaders. This article defines strategic leadership, differentiates among the concepts of strategic, visionary, and managerial leadership, and examines the differential links between the three types of leadership and wealth creation. When organizations restore strategic control and allow the development of a critical mass of strategic leaders, these leaders will be a source of above-average returns. The result will be wealth creation for the employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders of entrepreneurial and established organizations.",,

Their energy for work and efforts toward it are low, they do not have a positive attitude about work, and their aspirations lie elsewhere. This article presents a TEA2 diagnosis tool for determining the existence of the career blues. The framework consists of six attributes: time, talent, energy, effort, attitude, and aspiration. The concept of resonance is discussed at length as a novel approach to preempting the career blues, and to elevating one's work experience. Identifying resonance in one's life and recreating it at work is a powerful means for enjoying work more and being better at it. As a manager, conversations with employees about the blues and about resonance can be very beneficial in creating engaged employees where good enough is not enough.",,

MPI was established by a government resolution on October 21, 1995. This resulted in the merger of the old State Planning Committee, which handled national economic planning, domestic investment, and foreign donor financial assistance, and the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment, which handled foreign investment. MPI is responsible for setting strategy, plans, and decisions to develop the economy; for establishing draft economic laws and policies; for helping the government manage and administer the economy in order to preserve stability and macrolevel balances. MPI also manages official development assistance, foreign direct investment, and domestic investment for the state. Tran Xuan Gia became Vietnam's minister of planning and investment in November 1996. Prior to that, he served as vice-minister for one year.

A 360-degree feedback program enables organizational members to receive feedback on their performance, usually anonymously, from all the major constituencies they serve. Unlike the traditional approach to performance counseling, the 360-degree feedback concept does not rely solely on the supervisor as the source of information. Instead, it enlists superiors, peers, subordinates, suppliers, and customers in providing individuals with feedback on different aspects of their performance. Feedback recipients can also rate their own performance and compare it with feedback provided by others. Although the 360-degree method is widely used, its application is filled with paradoxes. While it delivers valuable feedback, the 360-degree concept has serious problems relating to privacy, validity, and effectiveness. This article identifies five paradoxes of 360-degree feedback programs and offers suggestions for managing them.",,
A framework for accommodating religion and spirituality in the workplace,2000,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010625298&doi=10.5465%2fame.2000.4468072&partnerID=40&md5=0c7227aed3d0abf27edd34ed5e5f2781,"After more than 35 years of exposure to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws, employers in the United States are struggling to understand and effectively deal with the challenges of employee rights and needs in the workplace. The workplace of the early 21st century is a much more diverse and dynamic environment than that visualized by legislative crafters of EEO laws. Though religion was addressed in the original laws, the primary focus was accommodation for religious observances outside the workplace. However, technology, global competition, downsizing, and reengineering have created a workforce of employees seeking value, support, and meaning in their lives that finds expression not only at home but also on the job. This search for religious and spiritual meaning in the workplace is a departure from the more traditional business mentality of ""power, profit, and takeovers, where religion was something saved for the Sabbath day."" Greater spiritual and religious accommodation has become a source for achieving that meaning and support. Legal interpretations have historically required that employees requesting religious accommodation meet certain tests relative to the sincerity and meaningfulness of their belief. The practice of spirituality through meditation, visioning, or spiritual contemplation has become increasingly prevalent in the United States work environment and has remained less controversial and less subject to regulation as an employee rights issue than formal religion. Those practicing formal religion want the same opportunities and rights provided to employees who practice spirituality. This article investigates the current state of religious and spiritual practice in business organizations and discusses the impact of employment law on such activity. We offer a broad and inclusive interpretation of religious and spiritual belief relevant to the workplace and provide a framework of analysis in addressing accommodation concerns.",,

Consequently, either explicitly or implicitly, they make communicative choices, which, in turn, become the organization's communication strategy. These choices are all the more important in times of great organizational uncertainty wrought by increased global competition, quicker cycle times, and the ever-changing marketplace. What are the communication strategies available to executives? How should they be made? Which ones increase organizational effectiveness? These are the core questions discussed in this article. We conclude with a case study demonstrating the benefits of systematically developing a communication strategy to address organizational uncertainty.",,

This article presents some reasons why: precipitous empowerment mandates, overreliance on a narrow psychological concept of empowerment, one-size-fits-all empowerment, neglecting the needs of power sharers, a piece-meal approach, and distortions of accountability. This article offers some ways to implement empowerment programs more effectively: enlarge power, be sure of what you want to do, differentiate among employees, support power sharers, build fitting systems, and focus on results.

The various stages involved in a successful adjustment are discussed. The executive's ability to identify with the host and the parent culture plays a critical role in every stage of the adjustment process. Failure to accept that the two cultural identities are not mutually exclusive is a source of internal conflict among expatriates. Cross-cultural competence training and a sensible repatriation plan help buffer the stressors encountered abroad. However, the willingness and courage to undergo the profound personal transformation associated with an international assignment are essential for a healthy expatriate adjustment, even after the expatriate's return Learning to live with the paradox of dual identification is an essential coping mechanism for expatriate executives.",,

There are sound business reasons for establishing virtual workplaces, but their advantages may be offset by such factors as setup and maintenance costs, loss of cost efficiencies, cultural clashes, isolation, and lack of trust. Virtual teams and telework are examples of such arrangements, but they are not appropriate for all jobs, all employees, or all managers. To be most effective in these environments, managers need to do two things well: Shift from a focus on time to a focus on results; and recognize that virtual workplaces, instead of needing fewer managers, require better supervisory skills among existing managers. Taking these steps can lead to stunning improvements in productivity, profits, and customer service.",,

Why are some so adept at coping with the complex and dynamic ambiguity, accountabilities, politics, and interpersonal dimensions of executives' jobs? Executives face numerous work stressors and job demands that can lead to stress. We suggest that succeeding in and managing stressful organizational environments is at least partially due to the exceptionally good political skills possessed by many executives. Political skill is an interpersonal style that manifests itself in social astuteness and the ability to engage in behaviors that give impetus to feelings of confidence, trust, and sincerity. Executives high in political skill are better able to cope with the chronic workplace stressors they encounter. Specifically, political skill represents a type of interpersonal control that allows people to differentially interpret workplace stressors in less aversive ways, and thus cope more effectively, which reduces strain. We believe political skill can be shaped, and thus represents a productive new area for management development programs.",,

Although the focus of the press reports was on worker exploitation and unsanitary practices in food preparation, Food Lion's core problems go much deeper. This company provides a springboard example to illustrate the dysfunctional outcomes of a myopic vision of strategy. Food Lion's fundamental strategic error was not uncommon: It based its strategy on an organizational strength that did not create a sustainable competitive advantage. We address the benefits gained from expanding the boundaries of a firm's value chain to incorporate both suppliers and customers, adding value in multiple activities and in multiple ways, and achieving close integration of value-creating activities.",,

Based on extensive interviews with Russians and Westerners in five companies, it identifies four major obstacles arising in that process: the variety of roles in the change process, the need for developing common understandings, the manner in which vision is communicated in the organization, and the importance of symbols and signals in the process of planning and carrying out organizational changes. The article addresses these themes from both Russian and Western perspectives.

Executive travel and the stress it may create is also a process that can cause emotional upset, physical illness, decreased performance, and problems in achieving company objectives. While travelers-be they businesspeople, politicians, or diplomats-can testify to the problems that being on the road may bring, a systematic discussion of this issue is necessary. None of the current models of occupational stress address this concern, and organizations have generally not effectively prepared their employees to withstand this stress.

While this sophisticated stereotyping is helpful to a certain degree, it does not convey the complexity found within cultures. People working across cultures are frequently surprised by cultural paradoxes that do not seem to fit the descriptions they have learned. The authors identify the sources of cultural paradoxes and introduce the idea of value trumping: In a specific context, certain cultural values take precedence over others. Thus, culture is embedded in the context and cannot be understood fully without taking context into consideration. To decipher cultural paradoxes, the authors propose a model of cultural sense making, linking schemas to contexts. They spell out the implications of this model for those who teach culture, for people working across cultures, and for multinational corporations.",,
Diagnosing cultural barriers to knowledge management,2000,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001009629&doi=10.5465%2fame.2000.3979820&partnerID=40&md5=7c23ab9ffceecc150919c6896d2972f9,"Organizational culture is increasingly recognized as a major barrier to leveraging intellectual assets. This article identifies four ways in which culture influences the behaviors central to knowledge creation, sharing, and use. First, culture-and particularly subcultures-shape assumptions about what knowledge is and which knowledge is worth managing. Second, culture defines the relationships between l individual and organizational knowledge, determining who is expected to control specific knowledge, as well as who must share it and who can hoard it. Third, culture creates the context for social interaction that determines how knowledge will be used in particular situations. Fourth, culture shapes the processes by which new knowledge-with its accompanying uncertaintieswis created, legitimated, and distributed in organizations These four perspectives suggest specific actions managers can take to assess the different aspects of culture most likely to influence knowledge-related behaviors. This diagnosis is the critical first step in developing a strategy and specific interventions to align the firm's culture in support of more effective knowledge use.",,

Its 14 production plants throughout Mexico and South ,America manufacture white goods such as refrigerators, ovens, and laundry appliances. The Berrondo family founded the company in Mexico City in 1947. By 1960, Mabe had grown to become the leading exporter of appliances in Mexico, and has continued to grow at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent. Nearly one-third of Mabe products, more than one million units annually, are exported to the United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America under a variety of brand names. In 1987, Mabe entered into a joint venture with GE, and has become GE's number one joint venture in Latin America. More than one-third of all gas ranges and mini-refrigerators sold in the U.S. are manufactured at Mabe plants in northern Mexico. The company's state-of-the-art research and development facility in Mexico is a leading source of new product development for GE gas stoves and other Mabe products. Mr. Berrondo is dedicated to the development of world-class manufacturing capabilities and products. He has been infusing his philosophy of excellence and innovative management practices into Mabe for many years, and has seen continual progress in his company's results and capabilities. A strong promoter of Mexico and Mexican workers, Mr. Berrondo has been quoted as saying, ""Mexican workers with a good design, the right manufacturing facility, and adequate training can produce exceptional products. We are now changing the face of Mexican management and giving workers those better designs, processes, and training. Mexican workers now have the ability to produce world-class quality appliances."" In this interview Mr. Berrondo discusses the challenges of maintaining his company's competitiveness, and the important role that training and development play in managing Mabe's 15,000 employees.",,

Global companies must succeed in the business they are in and at the same time show competence in managing multiple stakeholders at home and abroad. While it is of key importance to have the right products and services at the right price and time, global companies might not be able to deal successfully with obstacles outside their direct sphere of control. Recent examples are the destruction of production equipment-such as the sabotage of Shell Oil's pipelines in Eastern Nigeria by dispossessed and oppressed minority tribes, or the persistence of nentariff trade barriers in Japan's telecom industry-such as Cable and Wireless's difficulties in acquiring International Digital Communications against strong opposition by Japan's NTT Company. Facing such challenges, global companies require business competencies in which most managers have no background or training. The competencies needed to deal with foreign country interests, muItiple domestic and foreign pressure groups, or international conflict demand that global companies acquire organizational competency in business diplomacy management. This competency would build bridges between core businesses and the complex political environments within which global firms conduct business. In fact, many of the attributes of a business diplomacy manager are comparable to those of a political diplomat.",,

A good word to describe the job of executives today is intense. Many demands confront them-including physical ones. The international economic thrust of many businesses today has increased the amount of travel required by CEOs to develop and maintain a global presence for their companies. Another major physical demand is created by the stress related to being responsible for many people, their welfare, and the success of the company. Endless meetings, and extremely long working hours are par for the course for executives. We provide evidence that those executives who enjoy optimal fitness can handle these demands more effectively and thus perform better in their daily tasks. While many executives do take fitness seriously, what exactly constitutes optimal fitness behaviors is confusing. Given the numerous diet and exercise books on the bestseller lists today, it is easy to understand why such a quandary exists. We will attempt to provide clarity as we discuss prescriptions related to two primary components that are key to an executive's optimal fitness level-exercise and diet.",,

Previous efforts to answer this question have generally focused either on the personality traits or susceptibility to various cognitive errors of individual entrepreneurs, or on such external factors as the number of competing businesses. We suggest that entrepreneurs"" social skills-specific competencies that help them interact effectively with others-may also play a role in their success. A high level of social capital, built on a favorable reputation, relevant previous experience, and direct persona/contacts, often assists entrepreneurs in gaining access to venture capitalists, potential customers, and others. Once such access is gained, the nature of the entrepreneurs"" face-to-face interactions can strongly influence their success. Specific social skills, such as the ability to read others accurately, make favorable first impressions, adapt to a wide range of social situations, and be persuasive, can influence the quality of these interactions. Moreover, by helping entrepreneurs expand their personal networks, social skills may also contribute to their social capital. Because social skills can readily be enhanced through appropriate training, entrepreneurs who take advantage of such opportunities may reap important benefits.",,

Managers typically assume that providing employees with feedback about their performance makes it more likely that performance on the job will be improved. Despite the prevalence of feedback mechanisms in management interventions, however, feedback is not always as effective as is typically assumed. In this article, we present specific conditions under which feedback might be less effective, or even harmful. We then discuss the implications of our results and model for designing of interventions aimed at improving performance, and focus more narrowly on 360-degree appraisal systems. After arguing that these systems typically have design characteristics that reduce effectiveness, we conclude with recommendations for improving their effectiveness. We also emphasize the need for systematic evaluations of feedback interventions.",,

Research, experience, and common sense all increasingly point to a direct relationship between a company's financial success and its commitment to management practices that treat people as assets. Yet trends in management practice are actually moving away from these very principles. Why is common sense so remarkably uncommon when it comes to managing people? Why do organizations habitually overlook readily available opportunities to boost their financial performance? Drawing on extensive empirical research, an irrefutable business case can be made that the culture and capabilities of an organization-derived from the way it manages its people-are the real and enduring sources of competitive advantage Managers today must begin to take seriously the often heard, yet frequently ignored, adage that ""People are our most important asset.",,

We propose new management research in the field of product development as a foundation for studying services. The central themes of our research are frameworks guiding the efficient development of new products based on robust product and process platforms targeting an array of related markets. Enabling these product and process platforms is the development or licensing of technical, production, marketing, and organizational competencies. We adapt these concepts to services businesses, and apply them to a worker's compensation insurer, based on several years of collaborative research with management of that firm. We find the integration of target markets, services platforms, and competencies a powerful approach for characterizing the development and success of the business. Breaking the business down into major elements or subsystems of core services has allowed management to design specific service strategies and deliverables in a manner that is both highly systematic and measurable.",,

Our recent study of high technology-based industrial organizations shows that collaborative behaviors are difficult to learn, and seldom result from mere membership on teams. Some teams consisting of representatives from R&D, production, marketing, and other functional groups transform and adopt collaborative behaviors and accelerate new product development processes.

A major factor in the country's economic development has been the large number of international joint ventures established within China in recent years. Although China is now the world's most active joint venture market, satisfaction with the performance of many international joint ventures in China is declining. This can be traced in part to the inability of many firms to properly assess their knowledge acquisition goals within the joint venture. Western partners new information needs differ substantially from those of their Chinese counterparts. As a result, the joint venture partners may judge the success of their venture from vastly different points of reference. These differing goals do not automatically lead to joint venture dissatisfaction, nor do the differences necessarily need to be eliminated. Rather, the characteristics and needs of both the joint venture itself and of each partner should be studied in tandem to determine when a joint venture should devote consequential resources to meeting these knowledge acquisition goals, and when such allocation is likely to be unproductive. The application of such a contingency model to knowledge acquisition ultimately will help increase the satisfaction among international joint venture participants in China.",,

Yet many researchers and practitioners doubt the true effectiveness of this approach. To help solve this controversy, we suggest drawing from reinforcement theory and behavioral management. This approach can be used to explain the simple statements: You get what you reinforce, but you do not necessarily get what you pay for. We first critically review the traditional pay for performance practices and address the question of whether rewards, not reinforcers, do more harm than good. Next, we discuss the theoretical foundation that you get what you reinforce. Finally, we outline the behavioral management steps of organizational behavior modification (O.B. Mod.). When O.B. Mod. has been systematically applied over the years using both monetary and nonmonetary reinforcers, our recent meta-analysis found that performance on average increased 17 percent. The contingencies and practical implications of this behavioral management approach that advocates reinforce for performance instead of pay or even reward for performance are discussed.",,

Newcomers to the international arena may encounter difficulties different from those of established multinational corporations (MNCs). This article examines the internationalization process of fledgling MNCs from an organizational learning perspective. The discussion is supported by an empirical study of 19 Singapore companies and their operations in China, including joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. Internationalization is the transfer of a firm's physical and organizational technologies from one country to another. Companies that learn efficiently from their experience are able to expand overseas faster and with fewer mistakes. Managers who are directly involved in establishing and managing foreign operations are agents of learning on behalf of their companies. In order to fully make use of the experiences gained by their managers, the experiences have to be shared and institutionalized. The empirical study found that the Singapore companies generally learned in an unintentional manner and, as a result, their learning was inefficient. Suggestions for improving the learning process are proposed.",,

Corporate leadership in a globalizing equity market,1998,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042553854&doi=10.5465%2fame.1998.1333926&partnerID=40&md5=971cec5c529310f8333757b4fbca7107,"Long constrained by their national boundaries, institutional investors are discovering an outside world of higher returns and lower risks. Company executives are also learning that foreign investors are able to provide more capital at lower cost. The globalization of equity markets is a product of the 1990s. Governments are opening their markets to foreign investors; investors are diversifying their portfolios; and companies are scouting for new holders. In response, firms are restructuring their operations to enhance shareholder return, redefining management relations with foreign shareholders, and revising management compensation to align with global investor interests. Company executives are mastering new leadership skills for operating in an environment increasingly defined by a relatively small number of large international stockholders. This entails above all delivering a compelling strategy story for sharevalue growth to stock analysts and money managers worldwide. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,
"""Global strategy"" and its impact on local operations: Lessons from Gillette Singapore",1998,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4243754879&doi=10.5465%2fame.1998.1333948&partnerID=40&md5=09cfe70bc04f04f0c36af0f83bb8df16,"Among the myths about global strategy is the assumption that it means integration across international operations that causes a loss of country identify and dissociation of product lines from their local context, as they report to global product managers. This article advances a different view, in which global strategy is synonymous with holistic approaches - not necessarily international ones - that can tighten local integration in the interest of global goals. The experience of Gillette after the acquisition of Parker Pen shows that mergers and acquisitions by global companies can involve local integration across divisions in order to create within-country synergies. It also shows that tapping the power of global brands often requires acknowledging country differences and respecting local norms - thus strengthening, rather than weakening, the local country unit and enhancing relationships across functions and divisions within it. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,
Can guanxi be a source of sustained competitive advantage for doing business in China?,1998,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20444397456&doi=10.5465%2fame.1998.650517&partnerID=40&md5=48b09671a80288388c06b95bc7929bfb,"Guanxi means good connections. Although guanxi is often said to be the source of sustained competitive advantage for foreign companies doing business in China, there is little theoretical basis for this view. What is known is that guanxi has to be valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable before it can lead to a sustained advantage. Even if a certain advantage is gained, it can be difficult to sustain, because guanxi can be disrupted by something as simple as staff mobility. By suggesting ways for companies to protect their guanxi, it is hoped that this important aspect of Chinese management may be made more understandable to westerners and its use by western managers enhanced and encouraged. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

A case example is used to illustrate how the approach can be applied by strategic decision makers as a tool for exploring the potential of their companies for sustained competitive advantage. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

It appears that many organizations are slow to respond to internal complaints of sexual harassment, forcing victims to go outside the organization to seek redress through the court system. These failures to respond to complaints - what we have come to identify as the ""deaf ear"" syndrome - is surprising in light of the well-publicized costs to human resources, organizational reputation, and the bottom line. This paper investigates some of the factors and dynamics that contribute to organizational inaction. Based on interviews with EEOC attorneys who specialize in sexual harassment litigation, a review of relevant literature, and recent media examples, we identify three themes that are associated with deaf ear syndrome: (1) inadequate organizational policies and procedures, (2) managerial rationalizations, and (3) inertial tendencies. Fortunately, a few responsive organizations provide examples of best practices. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

This process of privatization was the most successful large-scale one in Argentina during the period, and it serves as a useful benchmark for other privatizations in other countries and contexts. The most important internal strategic factors that contributed to the success of this privatization were: (1) the redefinition of core businesses and elimination of non-core activities; (2) the restructuring of the organization and personnel to fit the core business; and (3) the positioning of the firm for sale to private-sector investors. The most important external factors that contributed to the success of this privatization were: (1) the government's firm and clear position on the issue, and the creation of a legal framework to permit privatization of YPF and deregulation of the industry; and (2) the identification of key pressure groups and defusing of their efforts to oppose the privatization. © Academy of Managemenf Executive, 1998.",,

New knowledge provides the foundation for new skills, which in turn can lead to competitive success. However, few firms systematically manage the process of knowledge acquisition. This paper explores international strategic alliances and their potential for learning and knowledge acquisition. In bringing together firms with different skills, knowledge bases, and organizational cultures, alliances create unique learning opportunities for the partner firms. Based on the assumption that organizational learning is both a function of access to new knowledge and the capabilities for using and building on such knowledge, the paper focuses on alliance knowledge accessibility and firm learning effectiveness. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

Dismantling the glass ceiling requires an accurate understanding of the overt and subtle barriers to advancement faced by women, and the strategies used to overcome these barriers. A large-scale, national survey of Fortune 1000 CEOs and the highest-ranking, most successful women in their companies identified key career strategies used by the women in their rise to the top, and the barriers to advancement they faced in their firms. A startling finding of the study was the disparity in the perceptions of chief executive officers and the high-ranking women in their firms. The Fortune 1000 CEOs had vastly different perceptions of the organizational and environmental barriers faced by their female employees, and in their companies' progress towards equality in the workplace. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

For instance, many executives have learned that increased capital investment does not necessarily build a better company, and international development institutions like the World Bank have learned painfully that investment in physical capital is also not the key to economic development. Knowledge embodied in human capital is now seen as key in economic development, and in knowledge-based companies or organizations. Executives developing learning organizations will share many problems with development institutions trying to foster knowledge-based economic development in the Third World. As knowledge-based transformation is learning writ large in both companies and countries, this article applies an activist philosophy of education, organizational psychology, and pedagogical theory to the international problems of economic development. The topics treated include: (I) methodologies of active learning in contrast to passive absorption of knowledge, (2) intrinsic motivation for changes in contrast to changes induced by monetary incentives, (3) local reinvention of best practices in contrast to implementation of universal recipes, and (4) horizontal learning of tacit knowledge in contrast to vertical or top-down transfers of codified knowledge. The various themes are brought together in the contrast between an open learning model of a knowledge institution and a church model of an organization promulgating branded knowledge.",,

Now we find that while claims and costs may be down in some states, stress itself may be on the rise. Some of the sources of stress - such as downsizing, violence, technology, and diversity - are a part of the current business environment. Major changes have taken place recently in a number of states regarding the applicability of Workers' Compensation coverage, especially for stress-related injuries and illnesses. The multiple sources and effects of workplace stress, coupled with an elusive liability environment, require management to carefully consider their responses to this problem area. The potential negative ramifications of stress for companies and their employees are so substantial that it is crucial that managers act to aid their employees in the development of their coping skills and to reduce excessive stress in the workplace itself. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

One of the most exciting of these new forms, the virtual team, will enable organizations to become more flexible by providing the impressive productivity of team-based designs in environments where teamwork would have once been impossible. Virtual teams, which are linked primarily through advanced computer and telecommunications technologies, provide a potent response to the challenges associated with today's downsized and lean organizations, and to the resulting geographical dispersion of essential employees. Virtual teams also address new workforce demographics, where the best employees may be located anywhere the world, and where workers demand increasing technological sophistication and personal flexibility. With virtual teams, organizations can build teams with optimum membership while retaining the advantages of flat organizational structure.

The trend toward proactive environmental management is being accelerated by public pressures on governments almost everywhere to assure a cleaner environment. Government regulations have become more stringent, legal liabilities for environmental damage have become more burdensome, and customers have become more demanding. But more importantly, there is growing evidence that firms that adopt proactive environmental management strategies become more efficient and competitive.

Although many organizations have attempted to respond to the needs of working women, the most common programs likely are inadequate for these midlife women. These women bring to organizations personal maturity, significant professional experience, and a desire for new challenges. They have significantly different needs from their younger female counterparts and their male midlife contemporaries. They have coped with the challenges of midlife in ways that have changed their perspective, altered their role definition and performance, and modified their job or work environment.

Even highly developed countries like Sweden and Japan, which have traditionally pursued policies of near full employment, have seen unemployment figures increase in the 1990s as a result of restructuring and employment reductions in industry. Nevertheless, there does not appear to be a set of international best practices related to effective downsizing.

Early hierarchical, vertically integrated organizations have largely given way to network organizations that link the assets and know-how of numerous upstream and downstream industry partners. A number of leading companies today are experimenting with a new way of organizing - the cellular form. Cellular organizations are built on the principles of entrepreneurship, self-organization, and member ownership. In the future, cellular organizations will be used in situations requiring continuous learning and innovation. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,
CEO and board chair roles held jointly or separately: Much ado about nothing?,1997,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042142366&doi=10.5465%2fame.1997.9709231660&partnerID=40&md5=9d6de3c5acf85fe6104b315ba880feef,"CEOs who jointly serve as board chairs have been the focus of considerable controversy of late. Powerful organizational constituents including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York City Pension Fund have targeted firms that rely on the joint structure. These shareholder groups prefer a non-executive director serving as board chair. Governance activists have made similar recommendations, most notably in the Cadbury Report, a governance reform document written in the United Kingdom. The central concern of reform activists is that joint service as CEO and board chair erodes the corporate system of checks and balances and compromises independence between directors and firm officers. Not surprisingly, CEOs rarely share this concern. More than 80 percent of large firm CEOs also serve as board chair. They believe the joint leadership structure provides a unified focus and communicates strong leadership to the external community. Accordingly, we pose the question: Does board leadership structure matter? Specifically, we focus on the extent to which chairs who jointly serve as CEO are more, or less, independent than their separate counterparts. Our analysis leads us to conclude while there may, at times, be compelling reasons for formally separating the CEO and board chair positions (e.g., financial distress; weak board of directors), to do so as a matter of policy for the purpose of institutionalizing independence between the board of directors and firm management is likely to be a misdirected effort. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,
Going Global: Using information technology to advance the competitiveness of the virtual transnational organization,1998,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001477312&doi=10.5465%2fame.1998.1334008&partnerID=40&md5=ad23398663d7c8f1c84306d9b5bac1c1,"It has become almost axiomatic that business success depends on expanding the global reach of an organization. Moreover, the adoption of the transnational organizational model for a multinational enterprise is widely acknowledged as the preferred means of going global. Designing effective transnational organizations depends on the effective deployment of advanced information technologies. Because globalization requires employees and business partners to be geographically and temporally distant from one another, deploying information technologies within a virtual organization is an obvious choice for overcoming spatial and temporal boundaries. © Academy of Management Executive, 1993.",,

Witness, for example, the successes of Microsoft and Intel, whose technologies define standards in today's personal computer industry. The strategic options that a firm might adopt in order fo establish us technology as a standard include licensing, entering into strategic alliances, adopting an appropriate positioning strategy, and diversifying into the production of complementary products. There are benefits, costs, and risks associated with each of these options. The key factors that have an impact on the scale of these outcomes include the height of barriers to imitation, the capabilities of the firm's competitors, the firm's own resources and skills, and the availability of complementary products. These factors influence the particular competitive strategy that a firm adopts. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

Some pundits predict that this will be the end of the Japanese corporate juggernaut. Indeed, our interest in Japan and Japanese competition has waned concomitantly in recent years. So has our learning from the Japanese. This is dangerously short-sighted. The pendulum of international trade has shifted from cross-Atlantic to cross-Pacific in recent years, as U.S. and Japanese multinational companies engaged in global sourcing strategy across the Pacific. Indeed, while struggling in the post-bubble economy, many Japanese companies have accelerated their move toward their Pacific Rim global sourcing paradigm. Based on Japan's regional ties with the rest of Asia, Australia, and increasingly other parts of the Pacific Rim, this paradigm builds on Japan's famed target costing, target exchange rate, new product development style, and keiretsu (interfirm alliances). While Japanese companies have slowed the pace of their onslaught on the U.S. market, they have begun their geographical diversification into the emerging parts of the world market. As a result, American companies are bound to face increasingly formidable Japanese competition around the world. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

In response, they have trimmed their work forces and expanded operations overseas. Those companies that rank as human resource leaders have combined downsizing with restructuring, reengineering, employee involvement programs, and team-based work redesigns. They have retrained and redeployed twice as many workers as the human resource laggards, are more apt to sponsor private-public partnerships with schools, offer employees flexible work arrangements, and conduct diversity training and mentoring programs. Neither leaders nor laggards, HR followers are hampered by short-term pressures, indifferent middle management, and other barriers to change; such companies wait for innovations to take hold in their industries.

The emphasis on new products has spurred researchers from strategic management, engineering, marketing, and other disciplines to study the new product development process. Most conclude that in order to be successful at new product development, a firm must simultaneously meet two critical objectives: maximizing the fit with customer needs, and minimizing time to market. While these objectives often pose conflicting demands on the firm, there is a growing body of evidence that the firm may employ strategies to successfully meet these objectives. Successful firms are those that articulate their strategic intent and map their R&D portfolio to find a fit between their new product development goals and their current resources and competencies. Their success also rests on how well the technology areas they enter contribute to the long term direction of the firm by helping them build new core capabilities critical to the firm's long term goals. Strategic alliances to obtain enabling technologies may shorten the development process, but partners must be chosen and monitored carefully. When firms are choosing technologies to acquire externally, they must assess the importance of the learning that would be accrued through internal development of the project, and its impact on the firm's future success. Other imperatives include using a parallel (rather than sequential) development process to both reduce cycle time and to better incorporate customer and supplier requirements in the product and process design, and using executive champions to ensure that projects gain the resources and organizational commitment necessary to their completion. Development teams should include people from a diverse range of functions and should include suppliers and customers to improve the project's chances of maximizing the fit with customer requirements while reducing cycle time and potentially reducing costs. Tools such as Stage-Gate processes. Quality Function Deployment, Design for Manufacturing, and Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing may be useful on different projects. © Academy of Management Executive, 1998.",,

Ideally, temporary engagements offer the employing organization lower costs and increased flexibility. In turn, temporary assignments offer an individual variety and growth. The organization's benefits can prove elusive, though, if temporary employees are less skilled or less committed to their work. And the employee's benefits come at great cost if temporary workers become a wandering underclass in the labor pool. Our work on both sides of the employment contract demonstrates that temporary employment works well only when managed well - by both the employer and employee. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

Many Russian firms entered an irreversible spiral of decline. A few champions have emerged. Some Russian firms have adjusted to the economic transition and have begun to prosper. This paper demonstrates how the actions of one of Russia's leading high technology firms have turned the firm's performance around. These actions are similar to, and different from, actions in high technology firms in the United States. The similarities and differences are important not only for Russian firms but for firms from other nations that hope to develop strategic relationships with Russian firms. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

This reliance is frequently fostered through the use of work teams, which are being deployed in organizations throughout the United States and in other countries in the hope of attaining enhanced levels of productivity and performance.1 Organizational restructuring has also produced ill-defined and unpredictable career paths requiring employees to assume almost solitary responsibility for their own careers. Employees in the 21st century will periodically backtrack in their careers, moving from expert back to novice as they are required to have new competencies that may very well be in areas unconnected to their personal preferences. Adaptation to these career shifts and movements into unfamiliar roles and responsibilities may take place more smoothly within a supportive team environment. While much consideration has been given to human resource issues such as selection, performance evaluation, and rewards regarding teams, attention to career development issues has not emerged as a concern in team-based organizations.2 Future work places may require people to rely on team members for rewards, recognition, and training traditionally provided by the company.

Albania and the Bora Company: Lessons learned before the recent chaos,1997,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001732711&doi=10.5465%2fame.1997.9709231664&partnerID=40&md5=516353c11b9db241f1a42d0fe0373347,"Several years have passed since the demise of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. Considerable attention has been given in the popular press to the struggles these countries are facing in the transition to a market economy. The continuing problems of Russia and the success of the Czech Republic are old news. Most recently, the tragic chaos in Albania is in the headlines. Until the spring of 1997, this poor little Balkan country and a few of its privatized enterprises, such as Bora, were successfully making the economic transition. Although the recent events in Albania point out the complex, harsh realities that countries face in making social, political, and economic transformations simultaneously, there are some important lessons that can be learned from the economic progress that was being made. By providing a brief overview of Albania and a case analysis of the Bora Company, we are able to show the importance of starting over and new thinking at both the country and enterprise levels of the transformation to a market economy. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,
Navigating the garbage can: How agendas help managers cope with job realities,1997,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011613069&doi=10.5465%2fame.1997.9707132145&partnerID=40&md5=bbf2049617a8b2f6199216ca50619d4f,"Looking for ways to get results. Leveraging time, energy, and influence. Keeping a boss, colleague or subordinate happy. Hoping for personal satisfaction. These activities and concerns give shape to managers' working days, and are reflected in the work agendas that they create to guide their activities. Work agendas come in many forms: subconscious mental notes, scribbled scraps of paper, and elaborate lists and charts. Effective agenda-setting strategies vary in part with the characteristics and conditions of a manager's job. Finely articulated and prioritized agendas are useful for some kinds of jobs and conditions, while flexible agendas that are prioritized by theme are more appropriate for others. Managers' work agendas represent an important bridge between broad organizational goals and plans and their implementation under what sometimes are chaotic conditions in organizations. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

These descriptions portray learning organizations as capable of adapting to changes in the external business environment by practicing continuous renewal of their structures and practices. Many accounts of learning organizations suggest that the path to becoming a learning organization is often wildly experimental, intensely focused around team processes, structured into nonhierarchical clusters, and operating in virtual time/space through electronic networks. For many managers, such a radical image might discourage attempts to enhance performance by becoming a learning organization. Ongoing experimentation, innovative human resource programs, radical revisions in structure, and generous doses of information technology may simply be too risky, especially where payoffs are uncertain. By offering a less radical portrait of one learning organization, Knight-Ridder, Inc., we will demonstrate that learning can be attained by using more conventional means. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,
Top managers and TQM success: One more look after all these years,1997,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0002619406&doi=10.5465%2fame.1997.9707100658&partnerID=40&md5=d08cfe3649270ec6562b26e93a4aee7d,"Few authors who attempt to explain the recent problems of total quality management (TQM) pay much attention to the ways in which the attitudes of top managers affect the quality of such programs, even though the most respected authorities on TQM have long argued that top management's leadership is key to TQM's success or failure. Our research indicates that top managers' underlying, often unspoken, orientations toward time, market, and customers affect the nature of their firms' TQM programs. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

Recognition of the importance of learning in today's business reality is reflected in a recent explosion of interest in learning organizations and the emergence of corporate learning centers and universities. Although reports of new corporate initiatives appear daily, and rhetoric abounds, there has been little synthesis of the underlying logic of recent learning initiatives. Using the example of Motorola University, we present a model depicting three phases of evolution of learning strategies in large industrial organizations. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,
Why Trafalgar was won before it was fought: Lessons from resource-based theory,1997,Academy of Management Executive,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0008536665&doi=10.5465%2fame.1997.9712024840&partnerID=40&md5=d02c7d2b07948623ba64cca68548cd50,"Resource-Based theory enhances our understanding of how some organizations achieve a sustained competitive advantage in their industries. These principles are used to analyze the British Royal Navy's historic triumph at the Battle of Trafalgar, a battle that the British had won even before the first shot was fired because they possessed certain key resources that gave them a sustained competitive advantage over the enemy fleet. Lessons for today's business managers are derived from the analysis of this battle. © Academy of Management Executive, 1997.",,

The business environment is highly turbulent and complex, resulting in terribly ambiguous and contradictory career signals. Individuals, perhaps in self-defense, are becoming correspondingly ambivalent about their desires and plans for career development. The traditional psychological contract in which an employee entered a firm, worked hard, performed well, was loyal and committed, and thus received ever-greater rewards and job security, has been replaced by a new contract based on continuous learning and identity change, guided by the search for what Herb Shepard called ""the path with a heart."" In short, the organizational career is dead, while the protean career is alive and flourishing. In this special issue of The Executive we will examine the ways the career environment and the executive of the 21st century will shape the direction of careers in the years to come. In this opening paper, we will provide a brief overview of the emerging career landscape, for both organizations and individuals. Then we will turn to an overview of the papers in this Special Issue and then to the papers themselves. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

As fewer people attach their long-term fortunes to the fates of a single organization, more and more people follow a free agent route. The free agent scrambles, bee-like, from opportunity to opportunity without regard to boundaries. While this career scramble is new to most industries, it has been common to the American film industry for a quarter century. In this article, we look back at successful careers in the film industry to gain insight into the challenges facing free agents in the 21st century. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

As more of them mature, the issue of exit, the end-game scenario, will escalate in importance. As a general theme, we have observed that partners in international alliances do not often prepare for the eventual termination of their alliances, and some are caught off guard when their other partners are better prepared to deal with issues related to termination of the alliance. In this article we will explore three issues: why alliances end, how they end, and key issues to consider. Then, using the lessons that we learned from studying more than two dozen divorces in international alliances, we provide a list of dos and don'ts for prospective suitors. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

Whether or not this old saw is accurate is not the point. Managers today are more than a little cynical when it comes to their participation in decision-making teams. While many feel compelled to sit through endless meetings, they frequently surrender - at least privately - by withholding any real effort. And, by their own account, they ""raise a white flag"" in over half the teams in which they participate. In this article, we will explore why this happens, and offer ways to manage teams that will minimize the withholding of effort. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

To make good downsizing decisions, executives need to appreciate more than just the immediate impact on human resources. And their information should be based on the collective experience of many firms. In this article, we raise five important strategic questions about downsizing and provide answers based on analyses of 100 downsizing firms. We show that downsizing has the potential to be beneficial to healthy and declining firms in a variety of industries. Those firms that are the most successful downsizers tend to use the process strategically to refocus on related business activities. Done strategically, even modest cuts have positive impact. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

Intellectual and information processes create most of the value-added for firms in the large service industries-like software, medical care, communications, and education - which provide 79 percent of all jobs and 76 percent of all U.S. GNP.1 In manufacturing as well, intellectual activities - like R&D, process design, product design, logistics, marketing, marketing research, systems management, or technological innovation - generate the preponderance of value-added. McKinsey & Co. estimates that by the year 2000, 85 percent of all jobs in America and 80 percent of those in Europe will be knowledge-based. Yet few managements have systematically attacked the issues of developing, leveraging, and measuring the intellectual capabilities of their organizations. What are the keys to these processes?

Increasingly, organizations are moving beyong traditional stakeholder management techniques to partnering tactics that lead to the achievement of common goals. In spite of these trends, there has been very little effort in the management literature to tie stakeholder management and partnering tactics. This article demonstrates how successful partnerships with stakeholders create such valued benefits as increased product success rates, increased manufacturing efficiency, the development of distinctive competencies arising from partnerships with local communities or government agencies, reduced unfavorable litigation, reduced levels of negative publicity, and favorable regulatory policies. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

As whole industries undergo restructuring, psychological contracts - those unwritten commitments made between workers and their employers - need to change in order to be kept. Service, quality, and innovation require higher contributions from people and, therefore, a new psychological contract involving commitment and trust. In high contribution work settings, that means changing the deal while keeping the people. Changes which violate a contract or fail to substitute another effective one in its place won't do. And, even though the psychological contract is not legally binding, today's executive must know how successful firms transform it. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

These leading companies have gained a sustained competitive advantage by developing and leveraging unique resources and capabilities. Ii would be difficult today to conceive of a planning effort that did not consider an organization's core competencies and capabilities. But despite the compelling logic to base future decisions regarding products and markets on these attributes, few guidelines exist to help managers define their competencies and capabilities. This paper describes the experiences of three management teams, each seeking a shared understanding of the core capabilities at their disposal. The outcomes of their deliberations, the strategic issues informed by such an understanding, and the pitfalls experienced provide guidelines for other teams as they approach similar planning tasks. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

Many people are experiencing major difficulties in their attempts to adapt to the uncertainties of career life. Observing these difficulties, writers on careers have begun to advise individuals to take personal control over their careers by becoming more versatile in their skills, accepting of change, and active in shaping their life at work. Increasingly, organizations are seen as freed from the responsibility of managing careers in their efforts to remain flexible and ready to shift with environmental changes. However, both individuals and organizations have needs for stability and for change. Organizations are better advised to adopt a pluralistic approach to career management that embraces different definitions of career success. In so doing, they will be better able to support the diverse needs of their employees and, simultaneously, enable the organization to reward and maintain diverse competencies in their workforces. © Academy of Management Executive, 1996.",,

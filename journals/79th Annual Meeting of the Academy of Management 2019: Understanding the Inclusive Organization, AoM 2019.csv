How does job autonomy influence job performance?

Results from a summary of 319 studies and 151,134 participants indicate that, overall, job autonomy led to better job performance, mainly by enhancing work motivation but also by reducing mental strain. We differentiated three dimensions of job autonomy (decision-making, method, and scheduling autonomy) and showed that theoretical mechanisms vary depending on the type of autonomy. Work motivation was most strongly enhanced by decision-making autonomy, but it was diminished by scheduling autonomy. The strain-reducing effects were stronger for decision-making autonomy and method autonomy than for scheduling autonomy. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that core self-evaluations mediated the effects of job autonomy dimensions on work motivation and mental strain. Together, our findings suggest the need to (a) consider multiple theoretical mechanisms and (b) differentiate among all three forms of job autonomy in order to better understand how job autonomy affects job performance. We offer practical implications for managers who seek to provide more job autonomy to their employees. © 2019 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2019.

We have taken a social actor conceptualization of organizations (Bromley & Powell, 2015; King et al., 2010) and integrated it with values literature (Bourne & Jenkins, 2013). We have set out to theorize on how the coherence between the values reflected in organizational talk, operational and social structures, and action may be frustrated. This work addresses a significant gap in organization studies research by spotlighting the potential negative outcomes of theoretical models and thus exploring the dark side of organizations (MacLean & Behnam, 2010). © 2019 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization, AoM 2019.

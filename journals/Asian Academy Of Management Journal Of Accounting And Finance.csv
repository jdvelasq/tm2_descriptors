"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, EMPLOYEE SALARIES, SALARY GAPS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE",2024,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196615204&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2024.20.1.4&partnerID=40&md5=9e3505c7227fe72f1db7b5f81ce854ff,"Given the scarcity of literature exploring the nexus between corporate governance and employee salaries, this study investigates the impact of corporate governance on employee compensation and its subsequent effects on financial performance. We identify a positive correlation between robust corporate governance and higher employee salaries, which in turn enhances firm profitability and value. Our findings also suggest that employee salaries act as a partially mediate in the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, indicating a nuanced mechanism through which governance quality influences organisational outcomes. Notably, we observe that enhanced corporate governance is associated with a wider salary gap between management and non-management employees, a factor that might adversely affect financial performance. These results underscore the complex dynamics between corporate governance and employee compensation strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of their interplay. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Corporate governance; Employee salary; Financial performance; Firm values; Salary gap,
CEO POWER AND TAX AVOIDANCE IN MALAYSIA: THE MODERATING EFFECT OF BOARD GENDER DIVERSITY,2024,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196628887&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2024.20.1.3&partnerID=40&md5=6cde323aeaf1281e20a8197af7e6de3b,"This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) power and tax avoidance and the moderating effects of board gender diversity on this relationship. Based on companies listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia from 2009 to 2019, it is found that CEO power is positively associated with tax avoidance. This suggests that CEOs with more dimensions of power are more competent in reducing the firm’s tax burden. Further tests show that this positive relationship is strengthened by board gender diversity. This implies that CEO competence in tax avoidance increases as the proportion of female directors on the board increases. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Board gender diversity; CEO power; Effective tax rate; Emerging market; Female director; Tax avoidance,
INTERNATIONALISATION STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: A NETWORK APPROACH,2024,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196659713&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2024.20.1.5&partnerID=40&md5=d2dbb481ffc14d7e2b840a38e1b9505f,"Internationalisation has become crucial to economic development, especially for companies that are more technological and scientific. These companies arouse curiosity, as they quickly begin their internationalisation process (IP), adopting the Born Global model shortly after its creation. It has also been noted that, when they seek to benefit from mutual flexibility, the opportunity to use technical and economic knowledge, and even the collective assumption of costs and risks, it is common for them to resort to the internationalisation model based on Network Theory. Considering that internationalisation is part of the company’s growth strategy, and that this may require an adjustment of the information structure, namely the Management Accounting and Control System (MACS), it becomes relevant to understand how IP affects MACS. In this way, our study aims to respond to how MACS adjusts to Born Global internationalisation model (BGIM) and Network Model of Internationalisation (NMI) for a successful internationalisation strategy? In this study, we evaluate how MACS is adjusted in order to become a tool capable of collecting and processing the set of useful information necessary for the implementation of the internationalisation strategy. We conducted a single case study in a Portuguese health-sector company. Our results show that MACS needs to be adjusted to facilitate the implementation of IP. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Born Global; Internationalisation; Management Accounting and Control System; Network; Strategy,
CRUDE PALM OIL PRICE PREDICTION USING SIMULATED ANNEALING-BASED SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION (SA-SVR),2024,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196671446&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2024.20.1.10&partnerID=40&md5=c4facb0d1c9b5a2d0520a74c140a0686,"Palm oil is one of the major export products of Malaysia. Predicting the price of crude palm oil futures (FCPO) traded on BURSA Malaysia Derivative is essential as agricultural markets have an inherent tendency towards instability, and thus are more vulnerable to price shocks than other industrial sectors. Hence, if the price of the futures contract on crude palm oil can be forecasted accurately, many parties such as farmers, refiners and distributors can manage the risk of price fluctuations through FCPO. This study proposes the metaheuristic and machine learning hybridised model of simulated annealing-based support vector regression (SA-SVR). The SVR in this model produces close price predictions of the FCPO with minimum deviation from the actual value with the help of SA, which first determines the best hyperparameter set to be utilised in the SVR. Although the proposed Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernelised SA-SVR model inputs only 10% of training data due to memory overload issues, it has produced a satisfying prediction result with an average execution time of 2 minutes and 34 seconds. The model performance was analysed further by using different ratios in data splitting, varying temperature combinations for the SA algorithm and initiating the parameter search based on the previous best hyperparameter set. Results show that keeping the test size constant and extracting more historical data on FCPO price for model training is better than varying train-test split ratios. The temperature schedule strategy showed that different initial and minimum SA temperature combinations affects the overall optimisation results. The best combination was the initial temperature of 100 and minimum of 40. In addition, the number of temperature reductions and average execution time to reach the best state decreases when the starting point of the parameter search space is close to the best values. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Crude palm oil price prediction; Hyperparameter tuning; Simulated annealing; Support vector regression,
"DOES THE SHARIA-COMPLIANT STATUS REMOVAL ANNOUNCEMENT MATTER?

Using 107 affected firms, we examine the removal announcement effect on the stocks’ liquidity and trading activities. Our analysis focuses only on the removal announcement due to the screening policy changes. We use 181 days event window for the short-term effect and multivariate panel estimation models for the long-term effect. The event study observes a decreasing trend for the liquidity measures, indicating a higher liquidity post-Sharia removal announcement among the affected stocks. Conversely, trading activities decrease substantially within the first few days post-event date before picking up gradually. The regression analysis confirms the results, but we do not find consistent results supporting the relationship between institutional investors and liquidity and trading activities. The study is among the pioneers to unfold the effect of Sharia-compliant status removal announcement due to the policy changes on the stock liquidity and trading activities within short and long-term perspectives. We also provide post-effect evidence on the change of the institutional investors due to the removal announcement on the liquidity and trading aspect. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Sharia screening policy; Sharia status removal; Sharia-compliant firms; Stock liquidity; Trading activities,

A purposive sampling technique was employed to select a total of 113 firms representing 14 sectors listed in the Australian Securities Exchange during the period from 2008 to 2021. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between the size of the board, gender diversity among board members, board member affiliation, and board compensation with the financial decisions of the corporations. Additionally, the study identified that the presence of experienced and non-executive board members had a negative and significant impact on internally generated funding. Furthermore, it was observed that board gender diversity, board size, board member affiliation, and board compensation displayed a positive and significant association with debt financing, internally generated financing, and equity financing. Most organisations displayed a preference for internal and debt financing over equity funding. Aligning governance with financial decisions enhances firms’ cost of capital. Governance quality affects capital market access, debt, and equity costs. Effective governance leads to favorable financing terms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Agency problem; Australian Securities Exchange; Financial decision; Resource dependency theory; Shareholders,
THE MULTIFACETED IMPACT OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS (D&O) INSURANCE ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PERFORMANCE,2024,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196669153&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2024.20.1.1&partnerID=40&md5=a285f58bb0fe79209a719683dd75ea6b,"In the ever-evolving capital market, safeguarding shareholder rights and interests is paramount for Chinese listed companies facing escalating risks. This article explores the dynamic discourse surrounding Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance, focusing on its implications in emerging markets with lower institutional support and disclosure quality. Spanning 2000 to 2020, this study rigorously examines the impact of D&O insurance in China, investigating its associations with capital markets, regulatory frameworks, managerial practices and financial reporting. My analysis reveals that D&O insurance correlates negatively with CEO turnover and litigation risk. However, its influence on investment efficiency, earnings management, financial reporting and corporate governance is comparatively modest. I also uncover nuanced disparities between stateowned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). In SOEs, where CEOs are appointed by the government and litigation risk is lower, D&O insurance’s impact is less pronounced. Conversely, non-SOEs, facing higher litigation risk, find greater significance in D&O insurance as protection against legal action. In summary, this article highlights D&O insurance’s role as a protective shield for CEOs and underscores its evolving dynamics in Chinese listed companies’ corporate governance and risk management. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",agency problem; CEO turnover; D&O insurance; financial reporting; litigation risk,

This study constructs a sentiment index for Malaysia using Principal Component Analysis. A nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is applied to capture and distinguish the optimistic and pessimistic sentiments to justify sectoral stock price movements. Our threefold findings reveal the significant explanatory power of sentiment on sectoral stock prices for both market phases, validated by bound test statistics and error correction terms. Furthermore, the study uncovers long-run asymmetric effects in most sectors (excluding technology) and emphasises their insignificance in the short run, attributable to limited and regulated short selling. Dynamic multiplier graphs underscore the temporal nature of sentiment effects, peaking in the 3rd to 7th months for most stocks, with technology stocks exhibiting an overreaction to negative sentiments. Notably, most stocks respond to positive adjustments, indicating that investors are not driven by loss aversion stemming from diverse market news. These insights are vital for individual traders, fund managers, and regulatory bodies involved in risk assessment and hedging strategy formulation. The study contributes to non-conventional equity analyses, offering valuable perspectives for navigating the complexities of small open markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Asymmetric effect; Investor sentiment; Malaysian sectoral stocks; Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) modelling; Principal component analysis,

This study aims to investigate potential shock transmission and volatility spillover effects among Islamic stock indices from selected Middle East and Northern Africa countries as well as crude oil prices and natural gas, over the period from August 2007 to September 2020. Applying VAR-BEKK-GARCH representation, the results reveal the evidence of bidirectional cross-market shock and volatility spillover effects between Kuwait and Qatar Islamic stock indexes, crude oil prices, and natural gas. Moreover, the results indicate the existence of bidirectional/unidirectional shock and volatility spillovers between Islamic indexes and all other variables, meaning there are information flows between these variables in all four countries except Turkey. Regarding the results of volatility spillovers, there is no spillover effect between Turkey’s MSCI Islamic index and Brent crude oil. These findings bear significant implications for portfolio management, offering valuable insights to financial market participants for making improved portfolio allocation decisions. Also, comprehending the volatility transmission mechanism across these markets is vital to provide policymakers and regulatory authorities with insight into the impact of energy prices on Islamic stock markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.",Commodity markets; Energy; Islamic equity markets; Volatility Spillover Effects,

Further research finds that the reducing effect of consistency on audit fees is significantly more apparent in companies with higher financial leverage. Overall, this article expands the research on the influencing factors of audit fees from the consistency perspective.

EFFECTS OF BAD NEWS ON STOCK RETURNS AND ANALYSTS’ RECOMMENDATIONS: THE INFLUENCE OF EXECUTIVE GENDER,2023,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180836203&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2023.19.2.1&partnerID=40&md5=5a8fe220a5b4217bd465b45db032dacf,"Although women are more conservative and more ethical than men, the proportion of female executives is still lower than that of men. Both Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) have strong influences in making corporate financial decisions. However, most of the literature focuses only on CEOs and ignores CFOs. Therefore, when bad news happens, it is possible that a female CEO/CFO can better alleviate the negative impact. We thus employ 4,405 firm-year observations over the period of 1996–2018, of which 680 are unique companies listed on the S&P1500 index, to examine how CEO and CFO gender influences stock returns and analyst recommendations. Our ordinary least squares and logistic regression results show that investors are pessimistic about companies led by female CEOs/CFOs, especially female CEOs. That is, when something bad happens, stock returns and analyst recommendations are worse for firms with female CEOs. Overall, this study is first to use stock returns to observe market reactions to firms with female CEOs/CFOs. In other words, the corporate remains unfriendly toward women, even those who are qualified as CEOs/CFOs. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Analyst recommendations; CEO; CFO; Gender; Stock Returns,

Cross-market liquidity co-movement between the fund’s portfolio and the market portfolio, which typically measures systematic liquidity risk and market integration, is the liquidity commonality for mutual funds. This research builds on Wang Jianxin’s study in 2013 by including market liquidity, return and volatility as common factors of liquidity, and the partial R2 of the common factors reveals each factor’s contribution. We find that emerging Asian countries share 24.14% of the intra-market liquidity commonality between funds and equity markets, and market liquidity is tied to such relationship. Emerging Asian region share 2.76% of inter-market liquidity commonality and regional market return and volatility majorly contribute to this liquidity commonality. The significance of domestic financial markets is evidenced by the wide disparity in liquidity commonality between domestic and regional markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Common factors; Commonality in liquidity; Emerging Asia; Liquidity; Mutual funds,

However, the ratio has rarely been used in solving corporate problems, such as fundamental analysis and capital structure decisions. To bridge the gap in the literature, in this paper, we examine the role of the golden ratio in deciding the capital structure and its effect on the firm’s financial performance and market acceptance for the manufacturing and services sector listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period from 2010 to 2019. In our analysis, we find a significant association between the deviation from the capital structure and the variation of the firm’s financial performance and market acceptance by using the golden ratio. The empirical findings of this study suggest that the golden ratio is an efficient tool for measuring capital structure and is useful for firms to boost financial performance and market acceptance. In general, the findings in our paper suggest financial managers of both the manufacturing and services sectors use a 38.2% ratio of equity and 61.8% of debt at the capital structure level. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies in the literature have examined the role of the golden ratio in deciding an optimal level of capital structure in Pakistan. Therefore, our paper has a significant contribution to the existing literature, and the empirical findings of the study are found strong and more evident for manufacturing than the services sector. Moreover, the findings in our paper also suggest managers in Pakistan apply the aforementioned percentage of debt and equity in capital structure level subject to performance measurement. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Capital structure; Firm performance; Golden ratio; Market acceptance; Pakistan Stock Exchange,

We find that early movers have advantages with higher post-merger performance in a merger wave, while the effect of late mover advantage is not significant. Moreover, early mover advantage can only be implemented in competitive industries. Our analysis further provides the entry-timing strategies for large firms and small/mid enterprises, respectively. Our results indicate that late mover advantage can only be adopted in large companies, while small/mid firms should be followers, not early or late movers, in high concentration industries.

To examine the three driving factors affecting China A-share excess returns, namely systematic risk, idiosyncratic risk and market sentiment, this study divided A-shares into non-dividend and dividend-paying groups based on the Dividend Paid for Common Shares in the notes of the financial report. In addition, this study used the Capital Asset Pricing model, Single-Index model, Arbitrage Pricing theory and Fama–French three-and five-factor model to analyse the three main driving factors. The Gibbons-Ross-Shanken test was used to test the model validity, and the optimal model for each group was extracted. Our findings show that after analysing the optimal models within each group, it becomes evident that systematic risk indeed exerts an influence on both dividend-paying and non-dividend companies. Nevertheless, when considering four specific systematic risks (inflation, exchange rates, crude oil and interest rates), this study’s findings establish that these risks do not significantly impact the stock returns of any company group across all time periods. As for idiosyncratic risks, firm size and book-to-market factors emerge as substantial influencers across all firms. Additionally, market sentiment significantly affects the stock performance of small-sized dividend-paying companies. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Asset pricing; China A-shares; Dividend; Market sentiment; Systematic risk,

The results show that during the pandemic, the financial statements of companies with a financial year end of 31 March 2020 have different qualities than those in the pre-pandemic period. Lower earnings conservatism is demonstrated in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period, supporting the argument that business tends to slow the recognition of bad news as the pandemic starts. The value relevance of accounting information declined in the pandemic period, primarily affected by the reduced value relevance of the book value of equity.

Overall, the results suggest that the total regulatory capital ratio helps reduce the margins of conventional banks but does not influence the margins of Islamic banks. As for the Tier-1 capital ratio, the variable increases the Islamic bank margins but does not significantly affect conventional bank margins. Based on the analysis results, regulators of conventional banks need to impose capital requirements as suggested by Basel III to reduce bank margins. Meanwhile, as for Islamic banks, the bank margins can be reduced if regulators can introduce a separate set of requirements tailored explicitly for Islamic banks. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",ASEAN countries; Bank margins; Capital regulations; Conventional and Islamic banks,
MARKET REACTION TO MODIFIED AUDIT OPINIONS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,2023,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163604261&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2023.19.1.10&partnerID=40&md5=f92310a8fa5a3bd7f91d4dbdc8a12de2,"The purpose of this paper is to review the empirical literature on value relevance of audit reports by providing current evidence on the market reaction to modified audit opinions (MAOs). This study is motivated by the argument that recent research has resolved the research designs problems raised by the pre-2010 studies that resulted in unmitigated and contradictory results. We adopt a systematic literature review based on the guidelines presented by Kitchenham et al. in 2009 to review papers published between 2010 and 2020. The main findings of our review show sufficient evidence that MAOs are indeed useful to investors in making decisions in developed countries, which is evidenced by the fact that the MAOs have a negative effect on the share prices of companies. In contrast, evidence from studies conducted in developing countries shows null market reaction to MAOs, with the exception of the Chinese market, which shows a significant reaction. The methodological limitations and alternative causes behind the null market reaction to MAOs of studies conducted in developing countries are discussed in this paper. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Event study; Modified audit opinions; Stock market reaction; Systematic literature review; Value relevance of audit reports,

The results demonstrate that a superior degree of industry-adjusted profitability reduces the need for debt financing. Within the industry, franchise and harvest firms with sufficient earnings have a lower debt overhang than under-performing firms. Furthermore, the S-curve targeted industries, which typically use debt to finance their expensive investments, appear to use fewer loans when they feel pressured by the investment support policy to intensify research and development (R&D) activities. Overall, in the emerging market geared toward a new economic roadmap, firms’ capital structures are shaped by competitive performance as well as industry and policy forces. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Capital structure; Competitive position; Industry-adjusted profitability; Innovation-driven economy; Targeted industryS-curve,

We apply various technical analyses for panel models of 4,253 yearly observations. Our results indicate that the Singaporean-listed firms’ cash holdings ratio (CHR) decreases when Singapore’s EPU increases in the period 2009–2018. Further, either global EPU or U.S. EPU indicators are correlated negatively with Singaporean-listed firms’ cash reserves. The corporate managers’ precautionary motive was not urged by the rise of EPU in the Singapore market. On the other hand, our empirical evidence suggests that Singapore’s corporate managers have an explicit speculative incentive in the context of the increased EPU in the post-financial crisis period. This research provides evidence that is at odds with the corporate managers’ classical view on precautionary cash savings in the context of the increased uncertainty of economic policy. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.

The subsequent tests suggest that big four auditors have a constraining effect on the revenue misclassification practices of firms. The findings alert auditors about the suspected firms (high-CSR firms) that are more likely to manage earnings through revenue misclassification and suggest authorities make more mandatory disclosure requirements for recording revenue items to curb the corporate misfeasance of revenue misclassification. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",Corporate social responsibility; Earnings management; Expensmisclassification; India; Revenue misclassification,

The inclusion of Bitcoin as a hedge is relatively new in literature and the effect of hedging has been exacerbated post global financial crisis (GFC), when the prices of precious metals have increased continuously. To serve that objective, the student-t EGARCH (1,1) model is first used to study the relationship between average asset return and inflation and next a quantile regression model is applied to explore the relationship between different quantiles of asset return and inflation. This ensures the hedging potential of each asset to be equally strong in bearish and bullish conditions. The tests show that the results from student-t EGARCH (1,1) model and quantile regression model are different while the results pre and post GFC are similar in most of the cases. The quantile regression model, which accounts for different quantiles for asset returns, indicates that gold, silver, and Bitcoin appear to be a hedge and safe haven in ASEAN countries. However, from the student-t EGARCH (1,1) model, which accounts for average asset returns, Bitcoin is a hedge asset but none of the three assets serves as a safe haven in ASEAN countries. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2023.",ASEAN; Assets; Financial crisis; Hedging; Inflation,

This study employs two-stage least square (2SLS) methods on the annual data of 217 Islamic banks from 35 countries ranging from 2010 to 2019. We find that the relationship between risk-based capital and risk-taking behaviour is negative, and the results are heterogeneous across different regions concerning both signs and significance. Consistent with the theory of moral hazard, we find the negative relationship between risk-based capital and Islamic banks’ risk-taking behaviour, implying that managers in Islamic banks could increase their investment in risky assets and keep only smaller amounts of capital. The concept of profit and loss sharing motivates them to take a higher risk and aim to get a higher yield. This relationship is also in line with the agency theory, inferring that bank managers could take excessive risk to get higher compensation to align with higher profitability. The results also reveal a positive relationship between risk-taking and profitability, which is in line with the portfolio theory in finance. The findings in our paper would be useful for decision-makers and bank managers in understanding the interrelationship between risk, capital, and profitability and no factor alone could be good enough to ensure bank soundness. Furthermore, our findings imply that regulators and bank managers should not only focus on bank capital for increasing banks’ stability. They should also look into both profitability and capital ratios in addition to bank capital because all three factors could increase banks’ stability simultaneously. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.",Islamic banks; profitability; risk-based capital; risk-taking,

This study is primarily motivated by the limited and inconclusive research on the monitoring costs resulting from FVD. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method using a sample of 222 Jordanian firms during 2005–18 is applied. The analysis finds that a greater level of FVD is the major cause of high audit fees. Results are more pronounced for firms with larger proportions of subjective FVDs (Level 3 assets). A significant negative (positive) impact of the pre-crisis (post-crisis) period on the association between the proportion of fair-valued assets and audit fees is confirmed. The regression results confirm the negative effect of pre-crisis period on moderating the association between the all-fair value input levels (Levels 1, 2 & 3 assets) and audit fees. The post-crisis period has a significant positive effect only in relation to Level 1 assets. Findings of this study provide policymakers and standards setters with updated evidence originating from a non-Western setting about the post-implementation costs of FVD. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

To this end, we use six systemic risk measures, the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR), the Marginal Conditional Value at Risk (ΔCoVaR), the Comovement and Interconnectedness of the South African insurance sector (Eigen), the Dynamic Mixture Copula Marginal Expected Shortfall (DMC-MES), the Average Conditional Volatility (Ave-vol), and the South African Volatility Index (SAVI). We first evaluate the significance of each measure by assessing its ability to forecast future economic downturns in South Africa. We find that only two systemic risk measures possess the ability to predict future economic downturns in South Africa. We then use principal component quantile regression analysis to aggregate these measures into a composite stress index of systemic risk for the South African insurance sector and assess the ability of the proposed index to predict future economic downturns in South Africa. Our results reveal that the proposed index is a good predictor of future economic downturns in South Africa. Thus, our results suggest that regulators and risk managers must develop an analysis of systemic risk in the insurance sector with particular attention to its effects on real economic activity. In addition, our index can potentially be used as an instrument to monitor and mitigate systemic risk in the insurance sector in order to ensure the stability of the financial system and the economy in South Africa. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

In addition to the nature of name change, we also examine the effect of market sentiment on the name change of technology companies' values. Our findings reveal that firms with concept-related name changes and strategic name changes generate significantly positive cumulative abnormal returns on the announcement date.

Univariate analysis and quantile regression (QR) are performed on 556 completed M&As transactions undertaken by Malaysian public firms from 2001 to 2019. In line with the upper echelons theory, which states that organizational outcomes can be predicted by looking at the characteristics of top-level executives, the findings from QR show that CEO characteristics significantly affect acquisition duration. This effect is conditional on the duration quantiles for CEO tenure and CEO duality but non-conditional for foreign CEO. Specifically, the findings reveal that the degree of influence by CEO characteristics gets stronger when the transactions are longer and complicated. CEO tenure can decrease M&A duration when a transaction falls in longer duration quantile. M&A transactions tend to take a longer duration when there is CEO duality. Foreign CEOs show more ability to execute transactions in a short duration compared to local CEOs. Deal characteristics such as deal size, merger transaction, hiring a financial advisor and conducting multiple acquisitions are main factors that prolong duration. The findings of this study may benefit policymakers, managers, and investors who involve directly and indirectly in an M&A process. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.",CEO characteristics; deal characteristics; M&As duration; Malaysia; quantile regression,

This study measures the actual investment return of individual investors who participated in initial price offering (IPO) stock investment in the Korean market from the short-term and long-term perspective and investigates the relationship with IPO characteristics that affect the investment sentiment of individual investors. Even though the underpricing of IPO stocks on the first day of listing on average reached 31% over the past 13 years, individual investors in the Korean stock market earned very little actual return on IPO stock investment. The market-adjusted return on IPO stock investment on the first day was about −0.5%, and even if they held IPO stocks for one year after listing, it was only 3.4%. The so-called winner’s curse, in which individual investors are allocated relatively many overvalued stocks appears to be present in the Korean IPO market. The allocation of IPO stocks by individual investors depends on several factors that reflect individual investors’ sentiment, such as past performance of previous IPOs, past industrial returns, institutional investors’ investment intent, offering size, an upward revision of the offer price, and issuing firm’s financial soundness. It was found that the higher the individual allocation rate, the lower the short-term investment return on the first trading day, confirming the winner’s curse risk of individual investors. However, in the long run, a reversal of returns was observed, in which the long-term returns of IPO stocks with high individual allocation rates rose. In order to mitigate the winner’s curse risk, it is desirable to reform IPO pricing mechanisms and allocation rules in a way that reduces the asymmetry of information between institutional and individual investors and reflects the subscription demand of individual investors. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.",individual investor; initial public offering; return reversal; sentiment; winner’s curse,

Analysis involving 22,897 firm-year observations from 37 countries shows that companies with higher product competition have lower ESG and those with higher corporate governance have higher ESG. The results also indicate the moderating effect of corporate governance, as the negative relationship between product market competition and ESG diminishes for companies with higher corporate governance. The results remain robust in additional analysis using alternative measures for product market competition and corporate governance. The findings support the joint effect of product market competition and corporate governance in determining corporate performance in ESG. The findings reflect the various pressures influencing ESG practices, and on how the strength of corporate governance plays a vital role in ensuring strategic ESG being employed for the sustainable performance of companies.

This study tests the role of CG through four indicators while controlling for other firm-specific variables. Results of the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments on a balance panel data shows that the effect of CG indicators on financing decision depends on the financing terms. In general, the influence of CG indicators is significant on the two debt financing measurements, except for managerial ownership when investments in assets are involved. This influence appears eminent in predicting the debt ratio, although the effect is not necessarily consistent with the hypotheses. The latest revision on CG codes of best practices has also improved firms’ access to debt financing, except for raising long-term debt to acquire assets. Results imply that the Sri Lankan firms adopting the CG best practices would need to rely on other factors to access long-term debt financing or on other external financing sources. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Colombo Stock Exchange; Corporate finance; Corporate governance; Financing decision; Sri Lanka capital market; System GMM,

We measure the investors’ sentiment index using Google search volume approach. We estimated a recursive equation system to investigate the effect of the investors’ sentiment on the trade-off decision between accrual earnings management and real earnings management. First, in line with the catering theory we found that optimistic period is an opportune occasion that encourages Tunisian managers to upward their earnings whether by accrual earnings management or by real earnings management. Indeed, Tunisian managers are likely to rely on abnormal cash-flows. Second, we found that the Tunisian managers, use both techniques as complementary rather than substitutes. However, during high sentiment period, this complementary relation decreases which may be explained by total cost of earnings management tools. Our results give the investors and the financial analysts, within emerging markets, important insights and requires them to adopt necessary adjustments to their expectations when evaluated from an optimistic market’ perspective.

This study estimates the NSFR and analyses the impact of this liquidity ratio on banks according to a risk-return trade-off in Vietnam prior to the Basel III implementation. Using yearly data for commercial banks from 2007 to 2018, I find that banks with higher NSFR gain more potential benefits than banks with lower NSFR. Concretely, a rise in NSFR increases bank profitability and decreases bank funding costs, credit risks and liquidity creation, as evidenced by a comprehensive set of alternative measures. The findings of this study offer insightful implications on the bank policy framework advocating the Basel III liquidity regulation in Vietnam as well as other emerging markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Basel III; Liquidity creation; Liquidity regulation; Net Stable Funding Ratio; Vietnam,

The findings suggest that contractionary monetary policy cuts down overall corporate debt. The study further asserts that corporate debt in Indian firms demonstrates target behaviour and the speed at which firms adjust their actual debt ratios towards target debt ratios is a function of not only firm-specific characteristics but also macroeconomic conditions prevailing in the country, proxied by monetary policy indicators in our study.

Liquidity risk and regulation in the organization of the islamic cooperation (Oic) banking industry,2021,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120955685&doi=10.21315%2faamajaf2021.17.2.2&partnerID=40&md5=c47320052a893336333ba76fcbeaf557,"The recurring crises have evidenced poor liquidity risk management and ineffective regulation in banking. Consequently, banking regulations have undergone continuous reforms to bolster stability in the banking system. Nonetheless, theoretical and empirical evidence provide conflicting results that warrant comprehensive research, particularly for emerging Islamic banking. This study examines the role of banking regulation on the liquidity risk of 245 conventional banks and 68 Islamic banks from selected 14 Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) from 2000 to 2017 utilising the dynamic panel GMM (generalised method of moments) technique. We measure liquidity risk using the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and the total financing-to-total deposits and short-term funding (LDEP). Meanwhile, the regulatory measures are asset restriction (AR), private monitoring (PM), supervisory power (SP) and capital requirements (CR). The findings suggest that regulation has a limited impact on bank liquidity risk. The CR supports the value creation of regulation through the reduction in banks’ liquidity risks, while PM and SP are agency costs of regulation that lead to higher liquidity risks. The impact of CR is lower on liquidity risk in Islamic banking than conventional ones, probably due to limited Islamic liquidity risk management facilities. Thus, regulators should strengthen Islamic liquidity risk instruments and markets to facilitate Islamic banking growth. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Bank regulation; GMM; Islamic banks; Liquidity risk; Supervision standards,
The effects of efficiency on banks’ market risk: Empirical evidence from China,2021,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120966365&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2021.17.2.4&partnerID=40&md5=1e043d10911dedd69ecc514c001b53ca,"This article investigates the effect of efficiencies on market risk using a sample of Chinese commercial banks from 2000 to 2015 using different measures of market risk; the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). The cost and profit efficiencies are estimated by the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) on the 12 biggest banks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In testing the effect between efficiency and market risk, this study applied four different models to uncover the relationship between VaR and ES as measures of market risk on cost and profit efficiencies. Utilising a panel data analysis, the results show that different banks efficiencies affect market risk measures differently. While bank cost efficiency reduces market risk, increase in profit efficiency increase market risk. The analysis in this study helps explain the unconvincing evidence of an inefficiencies-risk connection in the bank sector. Bank regulators and managers may need to focus on the cost and profit efficiencies-related initiatives to better manage the market risk. These findings provide bank managers with more understanding of bank risk and serve as an underpinning for bank supervision efforts aimed at strengthening the joint risk management of efficiency-market risks. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Expected Shortfall; Market risk; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Value at Risk,

Among the criteria, environmental, social and governance (ESG) score leads the group as an important indicator of non-financial quality of a firm, which may reflect value to investors either through higher expected profit or lower risk. In this paper, we focus on the latter by exploring whether ESG score has linkage to the credit rating of firms due to the risk mitigation effect. Ordered logistic regressions are applied on a panel dataset of listed companies in Shanghai Stock Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange from 2009 to 2018. The results suggest that only in Japan, having ESG coverage is greatly associated with being awarded higher credit rating. However, only the environmental and governance pillars positively link to the Japanese firms’ credit ratings, while the social pillar shows negative correlation. The finding of heterogeneous effects translates to an important implication that investment in ESG should be taken with care as the impact of ESG may depend on different nature or culture of markets. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",China; ESG; Issuer credit rating; Japan; Ordered logit,

Do state ownership and business environment explain corporate cash holdings?

Both linear and non-linear models are employed for listed enterprises’ financial data during the period from 2011 to 2019 in Vietnam. The empirical results show that state ownership reduces the corporate cash holdings in the linear model, and there is a U-shaped relation between corporate cash holdings and state ownership in a non-linear manner. By using the extended models, this study obtains consistent evidence to show that corporates reduce their cash holdings when the business environment becomes better and vice versa. Specifically, we find that the speed of cash adjustment in Vietnam is smaller than that in the developed countries, implying that corporates can shelter their liquid assets in order to avoid the negative effects stemming from agency problems between managers and state-shareholders. However, they are willing to hold more cash because of the mitigated agency problems in the case of the dominant state ownership. Ultimately, the business environment’s quality will have more power in determining the behaviour of corporates’ cash holding to meet market risks than state ownership. This study contributes to financial literature by determining the business environment’s critical role in the relationship between state ownership and corporate cash holdings. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Business environment; Cash holdings; Corporate; Panel models; State ownership; Vietnam,

These residual values are used as a proxy of ME. After employing various definitions of leverage and fixed effect regression technique, the study observes that ME has a positive and significant relationship with leverage. It indicates that efficient managers are more inclined towards debt financing. It also implies that restraining managerial discretion through debt financing may also make them efficient. Therefore, finding partially approves the agency perspective in the case of Pakistan. Overall, this study offers theoretical contributions to better understand the role of ME and leverage, and the use of DEA approach. Further, this study is fundamental to observe the ME and leverage concerning agency theory in general, and specifically in the context of Pakistan. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.",Agency theory; Leverage; Managerial discretion; Managerial efficiency,

Both event study and regressions analysis have been used to examine the impact of acquirer bidding experience on acquirer returns. The findings show that “single acquirers” achieve higher returns, with a cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) of 3.354%, but this number tends to decrease with increasing numbers of previous bids. In addition, the results of the bivariate analysis demonstrate that a single acquisition alone generates greater abnormal returns than those which are part of a series of acquisitions, with very robust results even after accounting for additional heterogeneity in payment method, target status and country/industry diversification. The findings of the multivariate analysis also confirm that serial acquirers are associated with significantly lower abnormal returns. This evidence conflicts with the notion that more experience with mergers and acquisitions (M&As) will correspond to improve target valuation and thus lead to more profitable agreements. In contrast, my findings imply that shareholder wealth is destroyed by serial acquirers, which suggests that the goal of maximising firm value is not always the sole motivation for engaging in M&A activities. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.",Acquirer bidding experience; Event study; Hubris theory; Learning-by-doing theory; Mergers and acquisitions,

The sample includes ongoing Pakistani firms that were healthy in the previous year and documenting positive gross profit. Results showed that firms bear opportunity loss primarily due to leverage rather than multistage financial distress. However, a non-linear relationship is found between leverage and indirect cost. Results further explored the impact of multistage financial distress on internal operations, i.e., working capital policies. It is found that firms manage receivable and inventory simultaneously during the multistage financial distress. Results revealed that increasing receivables and decreasing inventory is suitable during the transition of healthy firms to initial stage of financial distress, i.e., profit reduction.

The capital structure of islamic-compliant firms: Is there a financing hierarchy?,2020,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098956944&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2020.16.2.6&partnerID=40&md5=a783c2566a9a3c82314ae97356459de5,"This article examines whether the basic premises according to the pecking order theory (POT) provide an explanation for the capital structure choice of firms operating under Islamic principles. Random effect regressions were performed to test the POT applying data from a sample of 93 Islamic-compliant firms listed on Saudi stock market over the period of 2006 to 2016. The results show that sale-based instruments (Murabahah, Ijara) track the financial deficit quite closely followed by equity financing and as a last alternative to finance deficit, Islamic-compliant firms’ issue Sukuk. In the crisis period, these firms seem more reliant on equity, then on sale-based instrument and on Sukuk as last option. The study findings also indicate that the cumulative financing deficit does not wipe out the effects of conventional variables, although it is empirically significant. This provides no support for the POT attempts by Saudi Islamic-compliant firms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.",Capital structure; Ijara; Islamic-compliant firms; Murabahah; Pecking order theory; Sukuk,

We offer three results. First, we find that firm performance (measured by operating profitability and market-to-book equity) is negatively associated with busy boards. Second, we find that firms with busy boards have higher operating risk (measured by volatility of return on assets, volatility of stock returns and volatility of operating cash flow). Third, we find that the association between firm performance and busy boards is conditional on the firm’s life cycle stage. For firms in the growth stage, busy boards are beneficial to firm performance suggesting that the experience knowledge and reputation accumulated with multiple directorships help busy directors to more effectively advise these firms. In contrast, for firms in the maturity stage of their life cycle, busy boards are detrimental to firm performance suggesting the monitoring role of board is weakened by multiple directorships. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2020.",Board business; Firm performance; Firm’s life cycle; Operating risk; Reputation hypothesis,
Does foreign ownership restrict earnings management?

Given that foreign shareholders are expected to increase the transparency of the firm’s management, this study anticipates that foreign ownership would restrict earnings management of both the accrual-based earnings management (AEM), and real activity-based earnings management (REM). Using the panel dataset of the B-share and H-share firms from 2003 to 2015, this study finds that the H-share firms which cross-listed on both the mainland China and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges are more likely to manage earnings through the discretionary accruals as well as the changes in the firms’ operations. In contrast the B-share firms are less likely to manage earnings by using the discretionary accruals. This study also finds that state control and large shareholdings of foreigners can restrict the B-share firms’ earnings management through the discretionary accruals. The findings noted in this study imply that foreign investors who want to invest in Chinese firms must be more cautious about market inefficiency and the information asymmetry problem in the Chinese stock markets. © 2020, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

Moreover, over a 24 years period (1984 through 2008) big banks have managed to turn their 76% dominance to a prodigious 86% footprint, while the medium and small banks lost ground in the wake. So, looking for ways to create liquidity has become an existential crisis for non-large banks also an avenue for larger banks to maintain their leads. In an effort to find an innovative way to create liquidity, banks have turned to tools that lend themselves to be manipulated at discretion without material consequence to the rest of the business. Discretionary loan loss provision (DLLP) has become such a tool. Using a large sample of the U.S. bank holding companies from the first quarter of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we explore the relationship between discretionary loan loss provision and liquidity creation and find that, perhaps much to the dismay of some banks, earning manipulation through a tool like DLLP has a negative impact on liquidity creation. Moreover, this impact is indiscriminate regardless of whether the banks are facing an economy that is marred by financial crisis or otherwise. Our findings stand the test of various sensitivity tests to demonstrate their robustness and consistent with prior findings in the literature. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.",Bank holding company; Bank liquidity; Discretionary loan loss provision; Liquidity creation; Opacity,

Baker and J. Wurgler in 2004 for 781 sample firms listed on National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India during 1994–1995 to 2014–2015. The dividend premium, a proxy to measure the time-varying investors’ desire for dividends, is captured in each year during the study period. The dividend premium is negative for most of the years of the study period which is consistent with the previous research studies in the U.S. The results for the relationship between the dividend payment variables and the investors’ demand for dividend indicate that when the dividend premium is high the non-dividend paying firms initiate dividend payment in the following year whereas, when the dividend appear at the stock market dividend discount the dividend-paying firms omit (not continue) paying dividend in the subsequent year. The empirical results suggest that the decision to initiate and continue dividend payment have strong predictive power for the future excess share returns of dividend-paying firms over non-dividend paying firms. Thus, our results support the notion that the managers of Indian firms cater rationally to investors demand for dividends by paying dividends when investors place a premium on dividend-paying firms and vice versa. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.",Catering theory of dividend; Dividend policy; Dividend premium; Dividends; Investor sentiment,

On average, SMEs in our sample incurred a shortage in spontaneous (supplier) financing of 24.9% of total assets. This shortage is financed by bank debt of 21.1% which consists of trade-line facilities (9.6%) and term loans (11.6%). SMEs also finance this shortage in spontaneous financing with non-bank financing sources such as leasing (3.3%) and related party loans (2.9%). Regression results show that SMEs that are efficient in working capital management (shorter cash conversion cycle) tend to perform better. This value creation in efficient working capital management mainly arises from longer payable period enjoyed from the suppliers. SMEs that obtained more loans from related parties tend to exhibit higher performance. Conversely, SMEs that extend more loans to their related parties are associated with lower performance. In terms of growth, SMEs with access to banking facilities tend to enjoy higher growth rate. However, excessive debt in balance sheet is detrimental to SMEs’ growth prospect. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.",Capital structure; Malaysia; Related party loans; SMEs; Working capital management,

The linear model shows that foreign exchange reserves increase monetary independence. Nonetheless, the threshold estimation indicates that foreign exchange reserves can maintain monetary independence when the degree of financial integration of a country is above a certain threshold value. Such a finding suggests that the relationship between monetary independence and foreign exchange reserves is subject to the degree of financial integration.

However, empirical invalidity of linearity of returns has given birth to other CAPM models. Therefore, this study aims to examine the implication of preference by a risk-averse investor for higher moments and downside risk as investors are assumed to be prudent, temperate and cautious and prefer firms with negative coskewness, positive co-kurtosis, and downside risk as they yield higher risk premium. To empirically test these theoretical assumptions data of all 901 firms (listed and delisted) in Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) from 2000 to 2016 have been used. Decile portfolios are constructed for cross-sectional and time series analysis. Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Wald Test are applied to check the robustness of results. The results indicate that co-skewness, co-kurtosis and downside beta are important risk factors but only downside beta is genuinely priced over and above what co-variance risk can explain and CAPM does not significantly capture market risk premium indicating the existence of other risk measures in PSX.

Hence, the present study investigates the dominant signals in explaining the initial return in the Malaysian IPO market. The study investigates the following signalling variables: Lock-up period, shareholder retention ratio, underwriter reputation, auditor reputation and board reputation. Moreover, the current study also uses the stepwise regression analysis to know the order of contribution of the signalling variables to the overall model. The results of the regression analysis show that three signals out of five have a significant relationship with the initial return. Furthermore, the stepwise regression shows their order of contribution, where shareholder retention ratio is ranked first, followed by auditor reputation and board reputation. The outcomes of the present study offer new evidence regarding the kind of information that investors should be concerned with when evaluating IPOs and making decisions concerning investment in the Malaysian IPO market. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Initial return; Lock-up period; Malaysian IPO market; Prestige signals; Shareholder retention ratio,

Consequently, China has become one of the major trading partners to many countries in the world including Malaysia. To what extent China has affected Malaysian economy has been a hot issue facing the economists and practitioners. This paper examines the influence of China on Malaysian economic performances. Using structural vector autoregression (SVAR) methodology that takes into account the effect of other major trading partner countries such as the U.S., Japan and Singapore, the results indicate that different utilisation of foreign country variables to represent external sector in the model brings about different impact on domestic variables. It is shown that the U.S. is particularly important to affect domestic output while China is more important in influencing domestic inflation and the exchange rate, especially with regards to their respective income shocks. In addition, Singapore plays more dominant role in affecting domestic sector when foreign monetary policy shocks are considered. Japan is however more influential in affecting the exchange rate in some other shocks. While China is showing their dominance in the world economy, the study implies that knowing which country exactly affects which domestic variables is very crucial in mitigating the adverse impact of foreign policy change or shocks in the process of transforming Malaysia’s economy toward high income nation in the near future. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",China; Foreign shocks; Monetary policy; Sign restrictions; SVAR,

Based on the argument that domestic and foreign markets could affect foreign exchange exposure, the study examined 993 public listed firms that involved in domestic business, foreign sales, and assets, respectively. The sample period of 2014 to 2016 illustrates different time-varying conditions when the depreciation of Ringgit Malaysia and crude oil price were the most severe for the last decades. The findings show that firms with foreign sales face the most significant negative exposure of foreign exchange, followed by domestic firms and firms with foreign assets. The study shows that many Malaysia export firms are not effective in hedging, hence, they did not benefit from the depreciation of Ringgit Malaysia and crude oil price. The study concludes that there is an influence of domestic and foreign market effects on foreign currency exposure in the economy. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Emerging market; Foreign exchange exposure; Oil price; Ringgit Malaysia; USD,
Do insiders trading before open market share repurchase announcement give an additional signaling?

It also examines the relationship between insider trading and the actual share repurchase by the firm. A sample of 78 companies spanning from 2008-09 to 2014-15 is analysed in this study because of the unavailability of insider data in the Indian context. The paper finds that insider trading of sample firms are more than matching firms before buyback announcement. Insider buying before share repurchase announcement positively influences share repurchase decisions. We observed that insider buying has a positive and significant relationship, whereas insider selling has a negative and significant relationship with announcement return. We also found that insider buying has a positive and significant relationship with actual share repurchase and program completion. The study is constrained by the small sample size, so the results must be viewed by keeping this limitation in mind.

The monetary policy is captured by a set of different variables including money supply, refinancing interest rate and treasury bill interest rate. Using the GMM methodology, the study finds that the monetary policy of Vietnam has a significant impact on bank risk-taking level, as measured by Z-score index. The empirical findings also indicate that bank risk-taking increases in the context of a loose monetary policy. In addition, the competitiveness of banks, presented by the Lerner index, is found as a determinant of bank risk-taking levels. By using interacting variables, the findings indicate that the impact of the competitiveness of banks outweighs that of monetary policy on bank risk-taking behaviour. It implies that the banks with high market power demonstrate less risk-taking behaviour even in a loose monetary policy environment. Besides that, liquidity, credit level and cost inefficiency could increase risktaking behaviour of banks while bank size poses restrictions on bank risk-taking. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Bank; Competitiveness; GMM; Monetary policy; Risk-taking; Vietnam,

The 5 countries included in this study are Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Philippines. In the model, financial development, consumer price index (CPI) and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are the independent variables. The stationarity of the variables is examined through both first-and second-generation unit root tests with the cross-sectional dependence among countries. The Pedroni and Westerlund cointegration tests results show the existence of long run relationship among the variables. Long term coefficients are estimated using Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) model and it reveals that financial development has a nonlinear relation with FDI. When financial development passes the threshold point at above 70 point, it will benefit the FDI. Furthermore, the Panel Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is applied to examine the causality relationship among the associated variables.

Corporate Governance (CG) data were collected from the annual report of sample companies using corporate governance index based on Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG). The results of study show that corporate governance is positively associated with environmental performance and its disclosure. The results also show that environmental performance partially mediates the relationship between corporate governance and environmental disclosure quality.

This study expands on previous work done on the effects of providing non-audit services upon auditors’ independence and audit quality in Bahrain, which considered as an important subject for both auditing firms and auditing profession. This paper provides insights on the factors which explain the impact of the provision of non-audit services upon auditor independence and audit quality in Bahrain. To achieve the objectives of the research, a questionnaire was prepared and disseminated to a sample of 250 respondents. The results indicate that respondents are supporting the idea that “independence of auditor is impaired with providing non-audit service”. Kruskal-Wallis Test revealed that only respondents’ occupation is associated with their perceptions. Providing empirical evidence on this issue within the Bahraini environment, as a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, may add a new dimension to the accounting and auditing literature.

The findings indicate that the determinants differ across Islamic and conventional banks during crisis and post-crisis periods. We uncovered evidence suggesting that size, regulatory quality, inflation and overhead costs are important determinants of margins of Islamic banks. The results suggest the significant effects of market concentration, credit risk and overhead costs on conventional banks’ margins. Interestingly, the results reveal different impacts of the crisis on both types of banking system. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Conventional banks; Crisis; Generalized method of moments (GMM); Islamic banks; Margins,

Using institutional logics perspective as our theoretical lens, we conducted a case study in a Malaysian developmental financial institution (DFI) responsible for providing microfinancing. The results suggest that it is difficult to achieve a balance between economic and social considerations when the banking belief system is strongly rooted in the overall banking practices. This paper highlights the dominance of the banking logic over the social logic as reflected in the DFI’s management control system. Specifically, it demonstrates how its belief system underpins its microfinance activities due to a focus on risk-return considerations, which aim to minimise non-performing loans and maximise commercial profits. This consequently affects clients who have obtained microfinance products and services. This paper also demonstrates how the hiring carriers of social logic do not appear to infuse the organisation with social logic, due to the vague and compartmentalised structure of the microfinance segment and a lack of long-term social goals in both external and internal monitoring systems. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Belief system; Informal control; Management control; Microfinancedevelopmental financial institution,

Board gender diversity receives considerable attention within the issues of corporate governance. This is because female directors are found to be more active in monitoring activities, cautious in decision making, less aggressive and risk averse as compared to male directors. We support this argument with evidence from a sample of listed firms in Malaysia. In line with the literature, we show that female directors play a significant monitoring role in reducing corporate risk taking behaviour. Our results are robust to endogeneity concern. Since board gender diversity plays a significant risk monitoring role, we recommend that there should be a continuous call to appoint female directors to the boardrooms among Malaysian listed firms to diversify the ‘old boys club’ corporate boardrooms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Board gender diversity; Corporate governance; Corporate risk taking; Female directors; Risk monitoring,

However, if the firms are operating in a highly dynamic environment they tend to take on less debt as to avoid bankruptcy risk. Known to be in a highly concentrated ownership structure, firms in Indonesia opt to debt financing perhaps to act as a controlling mechanism to mitigate agency conflicts that may exist between the large controlling shareholders and the minority. Aged and highly profitable firms with high tangible and intangible assets and liquidity level operating in a high munificence environment follow the pecking order theory. The insights on the impact of industry characteristics are novel especially on emerging market thus fill the gap in the literature. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.",Capital structure; Emerging market; Indonesia; Ownership concentration,

The major objective of this study was to examine the extent to which regulatory and opportunistic information in book-tax differences influence accounting conservatism. We also aim to examine if book-tax differences are a signal of “bad news” for investors. Using publicly available financial statements from 2005 to 2012 for 28 Tunisian listed firms on the Tunis Stock Exchange and operating in the industrial and commercial sectors, we use a current measure for accounting conservatism and documents that observation with large book-tax differences are associated with low levels of accounting conservatism. Also, we find that firms with abnormal book-tax differences and normal book-tax differences exhibit less accounting conservatism. Overall, the results suggest that the total and differing components of book-tax differences have differential implications on accounting conservatism. Our research is valuable for researchers, shareholders as well as regulators. For researchers, it appears to an innovative area for future research. For shareholders, it shows the role of the information transmitted by book-tax differences into the analysis of earnings quality published by firms.

The sample consists of Australian companies that participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2009 survey. We find that how climate change impacts are framed (as threat or opportunity) influences the use of planning and target setting, performance measurement and incentivisation in managing emissions. However, in general, use of accounting practices in managing carbon emissions is limited. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Carbon emissions; Climate change; Management accounting; Prospect theory,
Mandatory audit firm rotation and Big4 effect on audit quality: Evidence from South Korea,2017,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029293033&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2017.13.1.1&partnerID=40&md5=52e29a1996772893d0c1df363ec36c8d,"In South Korea, due to concurrent financial scandals, Korean legislators implemented two major audit policies in the 2000s; the mandatory audit “partner” rotation policy in 2000 and the mandatory audit “firm” rotation policy in 2006. The mandatory audit “firm” rotation policy was introduced as a mean to improve audit quality based on the auditor entrenchment hypothesis. In this paper, we compare the audit quality of firms subjected to mandatory audit “firm” rotation with two benchmark groups, a sample that adopted the policy voluntarily; the second group consists of the mandatory “firm” rotation sample in years prior, a period firms were subject to mandatory audit “partner” rotation. Using accrual-based measures as proxies for audit quality, we find evidence that audit quality of the mandatory rotation firm sample is lower compared to firms that voluntarily adopted the policy. Furthermore, we find evidence that audit quality of the mandatory rotation firm sample is lower compared to the mandatory audit partner firm sample. Additionally, we also find evidence that the mandatory audit firms rotation sample whose auditors were rotated from Non-Big4 to Big4 are generally associated with lower levels of abnormal accruals consistent with the argument that the audit quality of Big4 accounting firms is superior to Non-Big4 firms. Finally, longer audit tenure and switches to Big4 audit firms generally have a positive effect upon audit quality. These findings suggest that extended audit tenure improves audit quality due to accounting firm’s accumulated client specific knowledge. Thus, our evidence suggests that the mandatory audit firm rotation policy did not have the desired effect in a Korean context. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Abnormal accruals; Audit quality; Mandatory audit firm rotation; Mandatory audit partner rotation,
Dividend capture on the ex-dividend day: Evidence from Vietnamese stock market,2017,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044309710&doi=10.21315%2faamjaf2017.13.2.4&partnerID=40&md5=1a59c22ed70d3db917f344272a697caa,"Vietnamese stock market is a promising laboratory to investigate the ex-day behaviour of stock price due to its special features: Firstly, the market uses periodic call auction mechanism for determining both opening and closing prices and there is no market maker. Secondly, tick size is much smaller than dividend amount. These imply that market microstructure theories are not applicable explanations. Thirdly, unlike many markets’ taxation of capital gains and dividends, there is no considerably preferential treatment of capital gains to dividends. Finally, short-selling is prohibited. Comparing the observed values of price drop to dividend ratio and their expected values under the impact of tax policy, we find that tax treatment fails to explain the anomaly in the research framework. The research findings show that abnormal returns are significantly positive and negative in the pre- and the post ex-dividend day periods, respectively. Moreover, regression results and relevant analysis show supporting evidence for dividend capture theory. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Dividend capture; Event study; Ex-dividend; Stock price; Vietnam,

Using two-market model to estimate the risk of the commercial banks in Malaysia, the results suggest that higher ownership concentration and larger board size resulted in higher bank risk-taking of the listed commercial banks in Malaysia. Given that the board structure is an important element of bank risk-taking, regulators should continue to enhance the monitoring of banks (where board size is large and ownership concentration is high) to control the banks’ potential for excessive risk taking. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Bank-risk taking; Board structure; Commercial banks; Corporate governance; Ownership concentration,

This paper examines whether company corporate governance practices and institutional characteristics are associated with company network size and pattern. SNA performed using UCINET and NetDraw software shows that the directors and company in the networking are moderately connected. This suggests that there is a small group of directors or companies that are well-connected and well-positioned to exercise power, control, and influence over the network. This study also reveals the interconnectedness of board members and companies. The regression results also identify a group of the most well-connected and well-positioned directors and companies in Malaysia’s corporate governance environment. The results suggest that board size, board meeting, and duality are the corporate governance practices, which most influence company network size and pattern. The presence of a Bumiputera or politically-connected director is an institutional characteristic, which especially determines the network of a company. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Board of directors; Corporate governance; Director network; Institutional characteristics; Social network analysis,

Foreign capital may also bring in management skills, latest technology and so on, which later has the potential to be transferred to local firms in host countries. It is expected that foreign capital will elevate host country's affordability. Nonetheless, this argument is very much one-way. Foreign capital is also expected to be able to exert negative consequences such as fuelling up domestic price (either stock market price, and/or real estate price) and failure to effectively transferring knowledge, skills and technologies, leading to unchanged or lower country's affordability level. Hence, this study aims at investigating the effect of foreign investment in real estate (FIRE) on host country's affordability. Using 30 emerging markets as a case for the period of 2000–2011, estimated by using fixed-effect model and complemented by 2-stage least square (2SLS) method, this study found that FIRE has a tendency to generate positive effect on countries' affordability. On the policy implication side, government can continue attracting foreign investment in real estate but it should be done cautiously as the effect is not elastic. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Affordability; Emerging markets; Foreign investment; Real estate,

For this purpose data of 867 A-listed Chinese firms over a 14 years period (2001–2014) is analysed. The study applies Arellano and Bond (GMM2) and Blundell and Bond (GMM1) dynamic panel data model to investigate asymmetric speed of adjustment. We report considerable evidence about asymmetric adjustment of corporate cash holdings, i.e., downward adjustment rate is significantly higher than upward adjustment rate. This higher downward adjustment rate holds even after controlling for financial constraints. Moreover financial constraints also play an important role in dynamic cash adjustment. Financially unconstrained firms are found to adjust faster to their target cash holdings as compared to financially constrained firms. The high speed of adjustment for above target cash level firms holds even after controlling for financial constraints. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Adjustment rate; Cash holdings; Chinese firms; Downward adjustment; Financial constraints; Upward adjustment,

In this study, the purpose of SME loans is divided into four types: total SME loans, long-term loans for investment in equipment, long-term loans for R&D investment, and short-term loans for working capital. The aim of the study is to determine whether pro-cyclicality exists in the four types of loans. In particular, it is expected that because of the high-risk weight considered in estimating credit risk, the number of long-term loans may have decreased in the economic distress experienced since 2006, when the Basel II accord came into effect. At that time, most banks adopted the advanced internal rating approach to calculate borrowers' credit risks. This study is based on the assumption that the risk weight of long-term loans is different from that of short-term loans. The GMM model is adopted to test the pro-cyclicality of long-term and short-term loans. The test results showed significant pro-cyclicality in long-term loans for investment in equipment and R&D. Second, there was no pro-cyclicality in short-term loans for purchasing raw materials. Third, the financial characteristics affecting the lending behaviour of banks were indicators of profitability and financial soundness of credit. Based on the results, effective policies are recommended, such as credit enhancement through credit guarantees, in order to alleviate the effects of pro-cyclicality on long-term loans. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Advanced internal rating approach; Lending behaviour; Pro-cyclicality; The purpose of SME loans,

Earnings conservatism has been used extensively in common-law countries such as the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK), which are known to have good financial reporting quality. In contrast balance sheet conservatism is more evident in code-law countries such as Japan and France, where accounting practice is highly influenced by the institutional culture similar to Malaysia such as political connection and family-firms. Since Malaysia uses international accounting standards adopted from common-law countries, we hypothesise that earnings conservatism will increase whereas balance sheet conservatism will decrease after the incorporation of IFRS in the financial reporting environment. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that earnings conservatism and balance sheet conservatism increase and decrease respectively after Malaysia's convergence to IFRS. The results indicate that Malaysia has successfully adopted IFRS from common-law countries as earning conservatism increase after IFRS convergence. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Balance sheet conservatism; Earnings conservatism; IFRS; Malaysia,

This study adds useful insights on adjustment behaviour and speed of Chinese firms with regards to firm-specific and country level determinants of leverage policy. To find out the adjustment speed, the study uses multiple generalised method of moments (GMM) for the purpose of robustness. Both of the GMMs report positive and their adjustment coefficients are statistically significant which implies that Chinese firms follow a target level of leverage by adjusting their current leverage policy. Chinese firms take almost 3.5 years for adjustment. The analysis is extrapolated to state owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state owned enterprises (NSOEs) and it is found that SOEs take longer time to adjust to their leverage policy as compared to NSOEs.

The results suggest that the return-leverage relationship could be indirect in terms of maturity. The panel regressions also show that sector-specific analysis is more meaningful and practical due to the mixed relationship identified. The empirical conclusions are further supported by using two indicators of financial leverage, i.e. book leverage and market leverage.

This paper is an humble attempt to add value to the existing literature by empirically testing the ‘time-varying’ and ‘scale dependent’ volatilities of and correlations of the sample commodities. Particularly, by incorporating scale dependence, it is able to identify unique portfolio diversification opportunities for different set of investors bearing different investment horizons or holding periods. In order to address the research objectives, we have applied the vector error-correction test and several recently introduced econometric techniques such as the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Multivariate GARCH-Dynamic Conditional Correlation. The data used in this paper is the daily data of seven commodities (crude oil, gas, gold, silver, copper, soybean and corn) prices from 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2013. Our findings tend to suggest that there is a theoretical relationship between the sample commodities (as evidenced in the cointegration tests) and that the crude oil, gas, gold and copper variables are leading the other commodities (as evidenced in the Vector Error-Correction models). Consistent with these results, our analysis based on the application of the recent wavelet technique MODWT tends to indicate that the gold price return is leading the other commodities. From the point of view of portfolio diversification benefits based on the extent of dynamic correlations between variables, our results tend to suggest that an investor should be aware that the gas price return is less correlated with the crude oil in the short run (as evidenced in the continuous wavelet transform analysis), but due to its high volatility, it offsets its benefit of diversification in the long run and that an investor holding the crude oil can gain by including corn in his/her portfolio (as evidenced in the Dynamic conditional correlations analysis). Our analysis based on the recent applications of the wavelet decompositions and the dynamic conditional correlations helps us unveil the portfolio diversification opportunities for the investors with heterogeneous investment horizons or holding stocks over different periods. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Causality; Commodity; Continuous wavelet transform (CWT); Diversification; Maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT); MGARCH-DCC,

This paper intends to fill up this gap. The period covered is 2001 to 2013. Findings of this paper would be of keen interest to the policy planners, investors and researchers alike. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Commercial banks; Performance measurement; Risk management,

Using a finer measure of foreign ownership, we explore the association between liberalisation and cost of equity for public listed firms on Bursa Malaysia over the sample period of 2002-2009. We find strong support for our hypothesis that total foreign ownership is negatively and significantly associated with cost of equity. Further disaggregate analysis suggests foreign institutions that trade through direct accounts are driving the lower cost of equity. When the model is extended to include interaction term, we find that an effective board of directors further strengthens the negative relationship between foreign institutions and cost of equity. Our empirical results consistently support the corporate governance channel in which foreign institutions play an active monitoring role. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Corporate governance; Cost of equity; Foreign ownership; Investor heterogeneity; Malaysia,
Effect of managerial overconfidence and compensation on share repurchase: Empirical evidence from Taiwanese firms,2016,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992512846&partnerID=40&md5=eca481254c35bfa59ba72bf38bf7b600,"This study analyses the effect of managerial overconfidence and compensation on the behaviour of Taiwanese CEOs who execute share repurchase. A panel data of 715 companies listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation and over-the-counter from 2008 to 2012 are used for the analysis. Results show that the managers who receive short-term performance bonuses and equity incentives tend to repurchase shares, and these bonuses and incentives are increased when the managers overly estimate the prospects of the company. Overconfident managers are also inclined to use additional capital in buying back shares, especially when they are under a profit-sharing scheme and have additional stock option incentives. The research findings are robust and provide strong policy implications, which advise the board of directors to improve their checks and balances, minimise costly managerial decisions, determine the motives of CEOs in implementing share buybacks, and lessen the information asymmetry inside and outside their business organisations. This study also suggests that future research should look into the tendency of Taiwanese managers to select types of financing (i.e., debt, equity, or a mix) or establish business empires through mergers and acquisitions. Other than the private sector, the case of government-owned and-controlled corporations should also be investigated. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Compensation incentive; Managerial overconfidence; Publicly-listed and OTC companies; Share repurchase; Taiwanese firms,

Results show that firms with low Tobin’s Q ratio, a proxy for corporate value, maintain lower level of long-term debt to mitigate agency costs of debt caused by underinvestment problem, whereas firms with high Tobin’s Q ratio are indifferent with the debt maturity decision. This study extends the literature on the determinants of debt maturity structure by highlighting the importance of recognising the firms by the corporate values in relation to the underinvestment problem.

In the theoretical part, two alternative theoretical perspectives in understanding sentiment are introduced, namely, the cognitive-affective theory of mind from neuroscience and the ABC model of the cognitive psychology. In modelling, we identify a combination of survey-based and market-based investor sentiment proxies, namely, the consumer sentiment index, the business condition index, and the stock futures index. The validity of the theory and model is then falsified with empirical analysis by examining the long- and short-run as well as stability relationships of the sentiment proxies on the aggregate stock market index returns using suitable econometric methods. The findings revealed that the proposed sentiment proxies are statistically significant in relations to the stock market returns in the long- and short-run with varying degree of persistency. However, the relations are not homogeneous across different size, industry groups, and market states which are in line with the existing behavioural finance views. In summary, this paper provides a new theoretical insights and empirical evidence on the roles of sentiment in Malaysian stock market that offers valuable academic, practical and policy implications. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2016.",Affective bias; Behavioural finance; Behavioural risks; Sentiment risk; Stock market,

We re-examine the exchange rate behaviour of the US economy, applying a more appropriate econometric model using 55 years of quarterly data. The model explains 96% of variation in exchange rates, which testifies to the model’s appropriateness. The error correction estimate indicates a time-to-equilibrium of 0.139 per quarter; that is, full adjustment takes seven quarters. Tests indicate evidence of a long-run relationship among the exchange rate, prices, and interest rates.

Motivated by this paradox, it is necessary to examine the dynamic relationship between FDI, pollution control and corruption to suggest a mechanism that may be effective in combating the pollution haven effect. Using dynamic panel Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation for 110 countries from 2005 to 2012, the findings suggest that the stringency in environmental control alone has had a negative effect on FDI, and at the same time, high levels of corruption have attracted FDI inflows. Interestingly, in contrast to previous findings, our results show that high stringency in environmental control coupled with low levels of corruption has attracted significantly more FDI inflows. In other words, ethical institutions could nullify the negative effect of stringency in pollution control to FDIs. This finding, besides its robustness to various environmental stringency measures, is a potential answer to the pollution haven effect for developing countries. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.",Corruption; Economic growth; Environmental stringency; FDI; Pollution haven,

The results indicate that the main reason for Malaysian companies to engage in share repurchases is to protect their share prices from market undervaluation. This reason supports the signalling hypothesis, which is found in most of the empirical studies on market reaction to share repurchase announcements. Other repurchase motives, such as to increase EPS, to adjust capital structure, and to use as a substitute for cash dividend received less support from our respondents.

In this paper, we examine the profitability of univariate and multivariate sorted momentum strategies based on prior returns, earnings surprises and revenue surprises using the data for 493 companies that form part of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 500 index in India from January 2002 to June 2010. Momentum profits are found to be persistent in the intermediate horizon (up to six months). Price momentum winners provide higher returns vis-à-vis earnings and revenue momentum winners. On long-short basis, earnings momentum strategy is most profitable. Earnings momentum is able to subsume price and revenue momentum. Further, the informational content of revenue surprises is incrementally very small. Triple sorted momentum portfolio using all the three criteria provides the highest return of 2.28% per month. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French model fail to explain these returns. The post-holding analysis reveals strong overreaction patterns for both winners as well as losers, thus, supporting the behavioural explanation.

Our findings indicate that firms adjust their dividend policies in a manner consistent with the need to preserve financial flexibility and mitigate goingconcern risks during the crisis period. Specifically, highly leveraged firms and firms with low cash flows are more likely to omit dividend payments during the crisis. Moreover, the negative effects of foreign ownership on dividend payments during the pre-crisis are muted during the crisis. This suggests that the tax-induced clientele effect became irrelevant as cash dividends became the first order of business for foreign investors during the crisis. In the same vein, prevailing investor demand for cash dividends exerts a positive influence on firms' probability to increase dividends during the crisis, implying that markets attach a high valuation to firms that are able to pay during the crisis period. We also find support for past dividends as a reference point for current dividend decisions in both the crisis and non-crisis periods, although the relation is weakened during the crisis. This implies that some managers strive to maintain stable dividends during the crisis period. Nevertheless, their ability to do so weakens during this period. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.",Dividend payout; Financial crisis; Financial flexibility; Foreign ownership; Signalling,

Role of lockup provision and institutional investors in restricting ipo flipping activity: Is there a moderating effect of investor demand?,2015,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945938206&partnerID=40&md5=8e1724c6b211542194718cbe782c562c,"This paper examines the moderating effect of pre-listing investor demand on the direct influence of lockup provision and institutional investors' participation on flipping activity. By definition, flipping activity is a liquidation of IPOs by new shareholders during the first few trading days. If flipping activity is done substantially, it has potential to erode wealth of the issuing companies and shareholders. To reduce such adverse effects, issuers and underwriters could restrict availability of tradable shares in the immediate aftermarket by relying on the direct restrictive role of lockup provision and institutional investors' participation. However, the role of restricting supply of IPOs in the immediate aftermarket could be hindered if the IPOs are highly demanded. The shift of the demand curve to the right when supply of the IPOs is restricted should induce a new equilibrium at a higher price level. The resulting price appreciation will motivate investors to flip to optimize their returns, pushing flipping activity to a higher level. Using data of 370 Malaysian IPOs covering the period from January 2000 to December 2012, this study finds that pre-listing investor demand does moderate the role of lockup provision (period) and institutional investors' participation in restricting flipping activity but in the opposite manner. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2015.",Flipping activity; Institutional investors' participation; Lockup provision; Malaysian IPO market; Prelisting investor demand,

Second, profitability shows a positive correlation with propensity to pay dividends. Third, firms that paid out more dividends in the past continue to pay relatively more dividends.

Using Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) models that overcome the shortcomings of linear investment models, we show that the PSTR models have greater explanatory power than linear models. The empirical results show that for firms with growth opportunities, (1) investment is sensitive to the availability of internal finance and (2) debt overhang reduces investment by firms with higher leverage through a ‘liquidity’ effect. Our findings imply that the managers of financially constrained firms in developed countries in the Asian region respond differently to productivity shocks and growth opportunities than financially constrained firms in emerging markets and developing countries. In addition, in emerging Asian economies, higher equity valuations increased firm-level investment after the stock markets opened to foreign investors. Accordingly, policy makers should review their liberalisation measures and seek to understand the mechanisms at work in order to bolster international investors’ confidence and stimulate foreign investment. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.",Asia; Debt overhang; Growth opportunities; Investment; Smooth transition model,
Analysis of corporate control: Can the voting power index outshine shareholding size?,2014,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84912012097&partnerID=40&md5=1a4e6ac28353df362dcfdcbf3caf90f5,"Shareholding size is a poor proxy for corporate control. At best it reflects an investor’s wealth relative to other shareholders and, most importantly, the distribution of rights to a company’s worth and the related exposure to risk. Shareholding size does not actually show an investor’s strength in corporate control. As an alternative, this paper espouses the merits of the voting power concept and promotes two indices associated with it: the Penrose-Banzhaf index and the Shapley-Shubik index.

Consistent with previous studies, the results reveal significantly strong information conveyed through inflation in helping investors earn profits in excess of a buy-and-hold strategy. The nature of the information and the subsequent importance of the corresponding market-timing activity change over time, providing new evidence of time-varying investment opportunities in the Chinese stock market. The results of this study imply that the Chinese stock market has predictable components that can be exploited using information on inflation.

How does group affiliation affect the diversification performance of family-controlled firms in Malaysia? - A governance perspective,2014,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921753696&partnerID=40&md5=9e90edef4c50850d7fc7bcf32360585e,"This paper examines the roles of business group affiliations and whether the size and ownership structure of business groups influence the performance outcomes of diversification among family-controlled firms in Malaysia. It presents evidence that agency-driven and thus performance-diminishing firm diversification is more likely to take place in firms affiliated with a family-controlled business group than in independent firms. The findings support the hypothesis that if the benefits of diversification can be captured through group-level diversification, then diversification at the firm level is more of an act of expropriation. In Malaysia, the undue political interference in business that to a certain extent has contributed to a weak enforcement of rules causes the enhanced control of family ownership through the formation of large and structurally complicated business groups to go unchecked. This grants the controlling families opportunities to pursue sub-optimal firm diversification policies that bring them more self-interested benefits at the expense of firm performance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.",Agency problems; Family-controlled business groups; Firm diversification; Firm performance; Group size; Group structure,

Its voluntary take-up by companies has been poor following a promotion that emphasised its technological benefits. This study seeks to identify a set of perceived environmental factors and examine how these factors influence managerial intention to adopt SBR. A survey instrument is developed to measure the extent of the competitive pressure, government pressure and external communication perceived by the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of listed companies as influences on their firms’ intention to adopt SBR. Based on 54 usable responses by CFOs of relatively large listed companies, the survey results reveal that, contrary to the expectation, no significant association exists between perceived competitiveness in the industry and the intention to adopt SBR. However, CFOs regard becoming a leader or an early follower as a significant consideration influencing their firms’ intentions to adopt SBR. As the paper reports, CFOs believe that they do not have adequate information about SBR from external sources. Communication about SBR is found to be significantly related to the intention to adopt SBR. Interestingly, government pressure is not found to relate to the intention to adopt SBR.

The results show that stock prices increase significantly in response to each of the three repurchase announcements, but there is no significant difference in the market reaction to firms that eventually make a repurchase versus firms that do not. We conclude that our results are consistent with the underpricing signalling hypothesis. Our results also show that small firms earn greater abnormal returns than large firms during each of the announcements, lending support to the information asymmetry hypothesis. Our multivariate regressions indicate that firm characteristics such as firm size, return on assets and the market-to-book ratio are found to be significantly related to the announcement-related abnormal returns. Finally, logit and probit results indicate that firms’ repurchase decision depends on firm size, profitability and price changes during announcements. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.",Announcement return; Information asymmetry hypothesis; Malaysian stock market; Share repurchase; Signalling hypothesis,

This study employs the monetary-portfolio balance exchange rate model and its unrestricted version in the analysis of Malaysian Ringgit during the post-Bretton Wood era (1991M1-2012M12), before and after the subprime crisis. We compare two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimation procedures (MLFN and GRNN) with the random walks (RW) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methods. The out-of-sample forecasting assessment reveals the following. First, the unrestricted model has superior forecasting performance compared to the original model during the 24-month forecasting horizon. Second, the ANNs have outperformed both the RW and VAR forecasts in all cases. Third, the MLFNs consistently outperform the GRNNs in both exchange rate models in all evaluation criteria. Fourth, forecasting performance is weakened when the post-subprime crisis period was included. In brief, economic fundamentals are still vital in forecasting the Malaysian Ringgit, but the monetary mechanism may not sufficiently work through foreign exchange adjustments in the short run due to global uncertainties.

Furthermore, this study posits that at a low level of family ownership, the positive effects of familial value are likely to outweigh the negative effects of related-party transactions. However, in the presence of a high level of family ownership, the negative effects of related-party transactions are likely to be more substantial and reduce the benefits of familial value. Using hand-collected data from 2004 on related-party transactions and family ownership from a sample of 236 publically listed Malaysian firms, the results show that there is a non-linear relationship between family ownership and earnings quality after accounting for related-party transactions. This finding suggests that certain firms are likely to report high earnings quality if they have small levels of family ownership despite low levels of investor protection in Malaysia. However, when a family has a significant ownership stake in a firm, expropriation activities appear to negatively affect the earnings quality of the firm.

The empirical evidence reveals that market risk is the major component of the sensitivity of bank stock returns, with large banks being more sensitive to changes in market conditions than medium and small banks. There is also evidence to support the influence of the interest rate on bank stock returns, indicating a decline in longer-term interest rate sensitivity. The results also reveal important information regarding the Thai banking industry: banks with high market power can take advantage of interest rate changes, leading to higher profitability, indicating a positive interest rate sensitivity, while banks with low market power and less efficient banks may not efficiently manage their risk exposures, resulting in negative effects of the interest rate risk from the maturity mismatching of their assets and liabilities. The exchange rate risk is relevant for small banks, whereas large and medium banks may have adequately hedged their foreign exchange rate exposure throughout the sample period. The time-varying estimation confirms that the bank stock-return-generating process follows the GARCH model and that volatility is time variant with a relatively high value of persistence measures. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.",Banks; Foreign exchange rate risk; GARCH; Interest rate risk; Market risk,

The study is enhanced by a comparison between the results found using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) method to test the soundness of these approaches to efficiency measurement. The empirical findings suggest that the impact of IT investments on Tunisian banks' performance is positive. The analysis of the internal determinants of banks' efficiency levels shows that size and managerial capacity positively and significantly affect the Tunisian banks' cost efficiency, while the share of non-performing loans represents a source of inefficiency. Measuring the impact of various categories of IT investments (hardware, software and IT services) on banks' cost efficiencies suggests that ""the Productivity Paradox"" does not affect all IT investments. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.",Data envelopment analysis; Information technology; Internal determinants; Stochastic frontier approach; Translog form; X-efficiency,
The effect of underinvestment on the relationship between earnings management and information asymmetry,2013,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897800998&partnerID=40&md5=129af9e64daf8fec5ab215d79250d2ba,"Earnings management is often investigated from the opportunistic perspective and rarely from the informational perspective. This study investigates earnings management from the informational perspective by incorporating underinvestment as a moderating variable in the relationship between earnings management and information asymmetry. A panel data regression analysis on firms listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia reveals that earnings management reduces information asymmetry. We also provide evidence that underinvestment moderates the relationship between earnings management and information asymmetry. This finding suggests that earnings management among underinvesting firms reduces information asymmetry. Therefore, underinvestment motivates managers to convey informational earnings management. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.",Information asymmetry; Informational earnings management; Malaysia; Opportunistic earnings management; Underinvestment,

Data were gathered from 14 in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with audit partners/managers of audit firms located in northern Malaysia. Cross-case analysis shows that perceived Internet benefits, the need for online communication, lack of time in accessing and exploring Internet applications, and lack of internal information technology (IT) expertise are closely related to entry-level Internet technologies usage among small and medium-sized practices (SMPs) in Malaysia. This study highlights the importance of perceived benefits in influencing internet usage and suggests both limited-users and non-users to familiarise themselves with Internet applications. Findings indicate that lack of time and internal IT expertise are among the key inhibitors to the usage of these technologies.

Does IFRIC 15 matter?

In the US, consistent with the approach taken by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Altomuro, Beatty and Weber (2005) found that reported earnings based on accelerated revenue recognition are value relevant. The subsequent elimination of this industry practice in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indeed caused a decline in earnings informativeness. In contrast, this study finds that reported earnings based on the existing accelerated revenue recognition policy are weak and are no better than operating cash flow in predicting the stock returns, market pricing and future operating cash flows of Malaysian property developers. At the same time, the planned new, more conservative revenue recognition policy based on a completion basis may not improve the decision usefulness of financial reporting among property developers, at least not in the short run. Rather, this shift in revenue recognition policy is expected to decrease accrual-based earnings management opportunities, and managers may begin to focus on managing real activities instead (Cohen, Dey, & Lys, 2008). © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.",Accelerated and conservative revenue recognition; Decision usefulness; IFRIC 15; Reported earnings,

Several studies, the majority from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, have examined the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and firm performance. Those studies yielded different results, affected by the nature of the prevailing governance system for each country. Investigating New Zealand's listed firms could enhance the diversity of the growing body of work that examines this relationship. Though the majority of studies only tested a linear relationship between variables, a number of studies have found a non-linear relationship between board structures, ownership structures and firm performance, and this study confirms the non-linear relationship. Using a balanced panel of 79 New Zealand listed firms, this study employs a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for robustness. The result reveals that board of directors, board committees, and managerial ownership have a positive and significant impact on firm performance. Meanwhile, nonexecutive directors, female directors on the board and blockholder ownership lower New Zealand firm performance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.",Board structure; Firm performance; Generalised Linear Model (GLM); New Zealand listed firms; Ownership structure,

The findings suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the real output and the financial sector. The causality tests reveal that the real output has strong relationships with the real estate and banking sector. From the PECM, the contribution of the banking sector is higher than that from other financial indices. The Kuala Lumpur stock exchange and the real estate contribute the same percentage to the output growth. Meanwhile, financial services accounted a small percentage to the output growth. This finding concludes that the better development in the banking sector stimulates GDP growth in Malaysia.

This finding indicates that free cash flow may be invested unproductively, thus contributing to inefficient usage of assets. This study has also empirically demonstrated that foreign and managerial ownership provides monitoring on the use of the companies' assets, especially in companies with high free cash flow.

Using a sample of Australian acquisitions during the unconstrained accounting environment from 1988 to 2004, we find the percentage allocation of purchase price to IIAs averaged 19.09%. The percentage allocation to IIAs is significantly positively related to return on assets and insignificantly related to leverage, contrary to opportunism. Efficiency suggests an explanation: profitable firms acquire and capitalise a higher percentage of IIAs in acquisitions. The target's investment opportunity set is significantly positively related to the percentage allocation to IIAs, consistent with information-signalling. The paper contributes to the accounting policy choice literature by showing how Australian firms make the one-off accounting policy choice in regards allocation of takeover purchase price (which is often a substantial dollar amount to) in an environment where accounting for IIAs was unconstrained. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.",Accounting policy choice; Identifiable intangible assets; Information signalling; Opportunism; Purchased goodwill,

Overall, a loser-winner portfolio yields highly significant returns.

Over investment, however, leads to a decline in executive directors' equity value in large shareholders controlled firms. In addition, one percent of over investment can explain 12% of earnings management. Nevertheless, earnings management does not explain executive directors' compensation.

Working capital financing preferences: The case of Mauritian manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),2012,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867137374&partnerID=40&md5=0ac5ce899bf65cc0fbde95cacabb3e93,"This paper investigates the approach of small- to medium-sized Mauritian manufacturing firms to working capital finance using a survey-based approach and case studies. Financing has been cited as one of the most common problems faced by SMEs and is often viewed as one of their main barriers to growth. Using parametric and nonparametric techniques, the important variables that affect the demand for financing are examined. Interestingly, it is observed that the sample firms adopted more informal sources of financing and networking to meet their financing requirements. The financing preferences of the firms were predominantly short-term and there was conclusive evidence that they were reluctant to move down the pecking order for fear of losing control of their businesses. The findings confirmed that internal resources, non-bank sources and short-term debt represent the main sources of financing. The research findings provided some new evidence in support of the different approaches to financing working capital. These SMEs used more informal sources such as shareholder loans and bootstrap finance. These results indirectly suggest that firms experience significant information costs that prevent them from gaining access to the traditional sources of financing. The findings of the study will be useful to the financial institutions that fund SMEs and to policy makers. ©Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia 2012.",Financing preferences; Informal sources; Mauritian SMEs; Pecking order; Working capital finance,

A long-run equilibrium relationship between interest rate, industrial production and numbers of IPOs using cointegration and Vector Error Correction models is found. The impact of interest rate on the numbers of IPO numbers is far greater in the cold IPO regime than during IPO hot regime using Markov regime switching regression model are also found. The empirical finding seems to detect direction of the IPO market reasonably. The results show that hot IPO market regime evolves when the investors begin experiencing extremely high initial returns and their expectation about the future interest rate provide an indication about entrepreneur's/manager's willingness to move to the IPO market. On the other hand, when a government pursues monetary tightening, investors believe that future earnings are expected to shrink due to higher interest rate in future, and valuation of shares would be affected due to lower dividend yield, it keeps investors away from the IPO markets causing cold IPO market. ©Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia 2012.",Interest rates; IPOs; Malaysia; Markov regime switching regression,

The CPI- and PPI-based real yen/USD rates and real effective yen rates are examined using newly improved unit root tests allowing for endogenous break(s) in the linear and non-linear manner. We identify structural breaks in 1985 and 1997/98, respectively, via the linear tests from Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997), but the results were mostly against the PPP hypothesis. The test from Saikkonen and Lütkepohl (2002), however, provides sufficient support for the non-linear adjustment of real exchange rates towards long-run PPP (purchasing power parity), which suggests the goods market integration between the two nations. The exchange rate misalignment is somewhat less evident after the Plaza Accord 1985, and stronger evidence for PPP is found in the post-1999 period. This is supported by a smaller persistency of real exchange (half-life < a year) found in sub-sample analysis. In brief, our findings reveal that the Japanese authorities have implemented a PPP-oriented rule as a basis for their exchange rate policies in the presence of structural break(s) and non-linearity. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.",Endogenous breaks; Half-life; Non-linearity; Real exchange rates,

We use the spot and futures crude palm oil daily prices from the period of January 1996 to August 2008. Using a dynamic model, we estimate three different mean specifications that involve the intercept, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) within the Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (BEKK) model. The risk minimisation results exhibit that the Intercept-BEKK and VAR-BEKK models tend to give the most variance reduction within the in-sample and out-sample analysis, respectively. However, Intercept-BEKK remains to outcast the other models in giving the most utility function. The empirical evidence shows that different mean specifications will generate varying hedging performance results, especially in relation to the risk minimisation result. However, the difference in the performance among the tested models is small, especially within the investor's utility function measurement. Since a more sophisticated model does not warrant better hedging performance results, we suggest that a parsimony model may be appropriate when improvising the hedging performance. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.",BEKK model; Hedging performance; Hedging ratio; Mean variance; Minimum variance,

Self-efficacy refers to the belief that a person has the capacity to organise and execute the course of action required to produce the desired outcome. The study employs a field experiment involving auditors from small and medium audit firms to evaluate internal control audit tasks. Using hierarchical regression analysis, the results indicate that auditors with high self-efficacy perform better audit judgments than those with low self-efficacy. The results also show the negative effects of task complexity on audit judgment performance. High self-efficacy contributes to better audit judgment performance when the tasks are simple. For complex tasks, however, high self-efficacy does not contribute to better audit judgment performance.

The study finds that there has been recently a reasonably high level of underpricing in the Malaysian IPO market. Contrary to the prediction of this study, the results indicate that dual leadership structure and board reputation (i.e., multiple board memberships) are positively and significantly associated with the extent of IPO underpricing. It appears that the separation of board chair and CEO positions signals low quality for the IPO firm. Because of the risky nature of IPO firms, investors tend to favour continuity in leadership. Directors who hold outside board memberships with other firms also have a negative effect on investors' assessments of firm quality. Potential investors feel that directors with numerous board seats are inclined to become distracted in which case monitoring intensity is likely to suffer. Other board variables, namely, board independence (i.e., board composition) and board size, do not significantly link to underpricing. Finally, the study finds that both firm size and the total number of risks factors disclosed are negatively and significantly related to underpricing. Overall, these results provide evidence supporting that good corporate governance practices are likely to help potential investors identify quality IPO firms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.",Board of directors; Initial public offerings; Signalling hypothesis; Underpricing,

Using data from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, the empirical results indicate that the selected countries do care about inflation and the output gap.

We generate price forecasts based on each multiple by regressing the historical prices on different value drivers. We use two forecast evaluation criteria, namely root mean squared error and Theil's inequality coefficient. We find that price-to-earnings provide the best price forecast compared to the other three price multiples, price-to-book value, price to cash flow and price to sales. We also develop price forecasts based on pairwise combinations of these price multiples. The value driver combination book value-sales appears to be most efficient in terms of error minimisation. However, historical price to earnings as a standalone multiple performs better in equity valuation vis à vis all combinations of value drivers. We recommend that historical price to earnings (P/E) is the best price multiple for developing price forecasts in the Indian environment.

It provides additional insight into the role and incentives of firm owners and could affect the company's ability to increase value (value creation activities). This research relies on an empirical model using VAICTM to measure IC performance. The data consists of all companies listed on the Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation Market (MESDAQ) market in between 2005 and 2007. Family ownership appears to have a negative effect on IC performance. A high degree of family ownership implies a high probability of opportunistic behaviour among families pursuing their objectives at the expense of value creation activities. The results are valuable for capital market regulators in monitoring the efficiency of value creation investments.",Foreign ownership; Government ownership; Intellectual capital performance; Malaysia; Management ownership,
"Granting employee stock options (ESOs), market reaction and financial performance",2009,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70749114624&partnerID=40&md5=964fdf1d16a84da8f351e9d0a30eff31,"This paper examines several issues related to the implementation of ESOs among Malaysian companies. We examine a total of 52 companies, 26 ESO firms and their matched industry peers over a span of 12 years. We find ESO firm stocks to have marginally higher mean returns and lower volatility than do their pre-ESO peers. Malaysian companies are more likely to initiate ESOs when the market valuation of their stocks is low. If there is any timing, ESO initiation is timed to be most favourable to employee recipients. Market reaction to ESO announcements is significantly negative. Furthermore, stock prices do not seem to recover to pre-announcement levels during at least the subsequent 20 trading days or one calendar month. In line with US findings, operating performance deteriorates for ESO companies. Comparative analysis of control firms rules out industry or external factors as elements of the deterioration. Firm size has been identified in previous studies as a determinant of market reaction and post-ESO performance. Indeed we find this to be the case for Malaysian ESOs. We find a positive announcement effect for large firms but a significantly negative one for small firms. Though puzzling, the market reaction makes sense when we consider the poor operating performance post-ESO of small firms relative to large ones. It appears that the impact of an ESO is negative for small firms but neutral for large ones. The market appears to anticipate this outcome and react accordingly. An ESO realigns the interest of the stakeholders of a company. Employee recipients gain, while shareholders mostly lose. Bondholders of large ESO firms are only marginally affected, but those of small firms stand to lose from the diminution of profits and increased leverage post-ESO. Based on our results, it will be difficult to make a case that the objectives of and rationale for an ESO are being fulfilled.",Employee Stock Options; Financial performance; Market reaction,

The behaviour of price multiples in India (1990-2007),2009,Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70749156147&partnerID=40&md5=7df580016971975b0668590892d702ca,"In this paper, we examine the behaviour of price multiples in India from 1990-2007. The distributions of price multiples tend to be normal over our study period, thus making the mean and standard deviation of these multiples relevant parameters for equity analysis in the Indian context. Further, sectors with high price multiples exhibit greater volatility in these multiples. This may result in greater price forecast errors for these sectors. We also find a very weak relationship between price multiples and their fundamental determinants. The cross-sectional linear models do not seem to be good descriptors of price multiples. However, price-to-book value (P/BV) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios do reflect corporate fundamentals in the case of the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, which tracks 30 stocks that are large in size and account for a major part of trading activity. In contrast, the fundamental determinants do not seem to drive price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratios, even for our limited universe of index stocks. This may be owing to the fact that earnings multiples are more driven by sentiments due to the actions of noise traders than by fundamentals, which influence the behaviour of value traders. Further, earnings are a bottom line number and thus are severely affected by accounting biases and judgments. The price multiples also seem to be sensitive to market conditions and therefore are generally greater in upturns, with the exception of infrastructure-related sectors. Our results are relevant for market stakeholders, who use price-multiple information for strategy building and policy decision making.",Discounted cash flows; Price earnings ratio; Price multiples; Price to book value ratio; Relative valuation,

Ohlson's Value Relevance Model (Ohlson, 1995) is also used, associating stock prices with both earnings and book values of these firms to gauge their relative value relevance. Our findings suggest that reported earnings and equities based on CAS are not significantly different from those based on IAS. We infer from our results that the CAS regime has converged with the IAS more substantially than was previously believed and that most existing literature that involves studying the practical differences of CAS from IAS may have been superseded by these findings.

This study uses a longer time period than ARIMA (i.e., daily data of 80 and 35 years for the S&P 500 and HSI, respectively) to develop and test the models. The two competing models are rigorously evaluated in terms of widely-used penalty-based criteria, such as directional accuracy, as well as in terms of trading performance criteria like annualised return, the Sharpe ratio and annualised volatility via a simple trading strategy. Moreover, the robustness of the two models is tested for 36 test periods. Empirical results show that ANN works better than ARIMA and delivers consistent results across the periods tested. These results support ANN's robustness and its use in formulating a strategy for trading in the S&P 500 and HSI time series.",ARIMA; Artificial neural network; Forecasting; Stock market; Time series analysis,

The paper examines the multifractality of index price series on daily data of Nikkei 225, All Ordinaries, Hang Seng, KLSE Composite and Straits Times Index. Wavelets, short form waves with local support are used for time/scale decomposition of financial time series. The multifractal spectrum (MFS) of daily index prices is calculated with Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima method described in Yalamova (2003). The MFS may reveal trading time irregularities suggested by the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (Calvet and Fisher, 2002). The trading time deformation process may uncover information on the efficiency of the trading system that would be useful for regulatory and reorganization purposes. Multifractals describe the cascade of volatility of returns and are suited for research at different time scales simultaneously unlike ARCH type models. In addition, this method provides dimension estimates for the detection of emerging chaotic patterns. The Hurst exponent calculated from the scaling function indicates persistence in volatility of index returns. The choice of data around the October 1997 drawdown is based on the scientific evidence that markets as complex dynamical systems reveal their properties better in extreme conditions. © 2006, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

Although there is evidence of a theological critique of economics and the world of business, there seems zero supply or demand for extending this to accountancy. There have been some attempts to provide such broad definitions of religion that virtually everything is included, and in this vein accountancy would be included. However this is a skewed and misleading use of language. In a ‘secular’ age there remains residual use of religious language, which occasionally infiltrates accountancy, but only in general metaphorical terms, and never with reference to the essence of accounting. As notions of corporate governance are applied to religions, accountancy has an inevitable role to play, as it does in the accounting for religions. This is the impact of accounting on religions. What is difficult to divine is any realistic theologising on accountancy. © 2006, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

Productivity is measured by the Malmquist index, using a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. The Malmquist productivity measures are decomposed into two components: efficiency change and technical change index. Efficiency change is again decomposed into pure efficiency and scale efficiency. Overall, the results show that Total Factor Productivity (TFP) has slightly increased for the whole industry in which efficiency change is found to be the most important source of productivity growth to Malaysia's banking industry as compared to technical component that contributes a negative change to the overall TFP growth. In this case, the scale efficiency is found to be a more important source of efficiency change than pure efficiency component. This implies that the size does matter in improving bank efficiency. Negative growth of technical efficiency indicates a great potential for the industry to increase productivity through higher utilization of technology as well as technological knowledge dispersion. Continuous training programs to familiarize and improve technical expertise appear to offer better prospects for Malaysia’s banking industry to achieve greater TFP growth. © 2006, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

The basis of the immediacy cost is in the manner a bank stock up funds as inventory to cater for a loan commitment made to its customer. The strategy adopted in the pooling of funds acts as a penalty cost for borrowing in the last minute. RBX characterizes a banking firm with two possible roles: being a broker when the RBX moved towards 1 and an asset transformer when the RBX moved towards 0. The study successfully operationalized the developed RBX by using a monthly three months KLIBOR rate as a proxy of the uncertain interest rates environment and λ, as the proxy for immediacy costs for the period of 1982 to 2005.

The majority of the companies in the sample have an ultimate controlling owner, particularly an individual or family. As controlling owners have on average, rights of control over a greater percentage of shares in any given company than their rights to participate in the cash flows from that company, controlling owners may have an incentive to expropriate minority interests through methods such as inefficient corporate diversification. The risk of such expropriation would be expected to be reflected in the value of highly diversified companies. The results of the research provide no evidence to support the argument that diversification reduces the value of companies. However, the finding is consistent with the argument that high control rights of controlling owner might encourage expropriation of minority interests through corporate diversification strategies.

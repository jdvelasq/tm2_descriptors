"Who sees what? One print advertisement and a dual semiotic analysis","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981289202&partnerID=40&md5=891cb2b2cc654ce3a9facdf74992c86b","This research investigates consumer interpretations of one print advertisement with a dual semiotic approach. The research design features 20 in-depth interviews with participants from ten different cultures, where participants were asked to tell the story that the ad depicts. This investigative process generated consumer narratives that were analyzed with a dual semiotic approach comprising an application of both Peirce's Semiotic Triangle (cf. Grayson and Shulman 2000) as well as Greimas's (1983) Actantial model. The findings demonstrate that across a diversity of cultures consumers interpret this print ad either with or without recognition of a key expressive element (object) in the ad. Interpreting the ad in recognition of the intended object of the ad renders a story that screams a concealed meaning - as intended by the creative designers; interpreting the ad without recognition of the intended object renders a somewhat confusing story. The dual analytic approach reports similar findings from both semiotic viewpoints, thus enhancing the credibility of the output. The findings of this research therefore include advertisement design implications for practitioners.","Advertising; Greimas; Narrative analysis; Peirce; Semiotics",""

This paper provides an alternative to existing lines of thinking by offering a more holistic, multisensory approach to humans' perception of cuteness with regard to animal mascots and animals themselves. We adopt a biosemiotic approach to cuteness and product design studies with the employment of Umwelt theory and associated concepts of multisensory perception. Additionally, we analyze Kindchenschema, that is different visually perceivable characteristics that are considered to be properties of cute animals, in order to establish the multisensory aspect of the affective dimension of cuteness. In explicating the interaction between the senses, we analyze cases of sensory incongruence that can affect one's perceptual experience of animal characters and animals. We then argue for the need of a multisensory approach to the study of cuteness and the implications such an approach has for marketing research and applied products'/services' design. © 2018 University of Kassel.","Animal mascots; Biosemiotics; Cuteness; Product design; Umwelt",""

It traces an established global semiotic language of hospitality, and how a set of images and textual conventions have come to define both the hospitality industry and the hospitality experience in contemporary marketing practices. The ability to recognize and to understand the theoretical foundations of this language when utilized alongside traditional marketing creates a more holistic form of marketing practice. This paper puts forward the proposition that marketing is fundamentally a cultural activity that requires an in-depth understanding of its social and cultural foundations. It is only once this has been achieved that we can create effective and customized marketing campaigns that generate relevant meaning for the consumer.","Dining; Food; Hospitality; Interpretation; Marketing; Methodology; Semiotics; Sign vehicle; Websites",""
"IKEA: Ego and its alter in intercultural communications","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981313654&partnerID=40&md5=3e950b9ce773fb88b02a5e6eb24839b0","The present article discusses how the Swedish furniture company IKEA deployed its communication strategy in Germany, and how it became established in the German market as a Swedish brand. In 2012 Germany still is the top-selling country for IKEA. In fact, today, many people in Germany directly associate IKEA with Sweden, mainly due to its audiovisual advertisements. By analyzing audiovisual advertisements which were aired by IKEA in the mass media of television and the Internet, including YouTube, during the period 1997-2007, it will be shown in detail how the company draws on, but also how it constructs German stereotypes about the Swedes and the Nordic countries. But the company also picks up important and frequently discussed themes, which can be encountered in contemporary German society. In order to grasp the interaction between the Swedish company and the German consumer culture, Göran Sonesson's cultural semiotic approach and particularly the concepts of Ego- and Alter cultures are employed.","Culture; Dialogue; Ego-and alter; Germany; IKEA; Swedishness",""
"On the spectral ideology of cultural globalization as social hauntology","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058671585&partnerID=40&md5=26ea781374aebf27607f03ddd344fa97","Globalization allegedly constitutes one of the most used and abused concepts in the contemporary academic and lay lexicons alike. This paper pursues a deconstructive avenue for canvassing the semiotic economy of cultural globalization. The variegated ways whereby ideology has been framed in different semiotic perspectives (Peircean, structuralist, poststructuralist, neo-Marxist) are laid out. By engaging with the post-structuralist semiotic terrain, cultural globalization is identified with a transition from Baudrillard's Political Economy of Signs towards a spectral ideology where signs give way to traces of différance. Subsequently, the process whereby globalization materializes is conceived as a social hauntology. In this context, global citizens engage in a constant retracing of the meaning of signs of globalization that crystallize as translocally flowing ideoscapes and mediascapes. The propounded thesis is exemplified by recourse to cultural consumption phenomena from the domains of cinematic discourse, computer-gaming, food and social gaming. © 2018 University of Kassel.","Critical semiotics; Cultural globalization; Différance; Scapes; Social hauntology; Spectrality",""

Specifically, it examines two cause-related marketing campaigns of Starbucks within a critical-semiotic framework, by drawing on Kenneth Burke's concept of Identification and Jacques Lacan's concept of Desire. I argue that traditional theories of argumentation and ethical consumption fail to illuminate the burgeoning sophistication of ethical branding, which I label civic branding. As I illustrate in this paper, civic branding attempts to untie the problematic ""cash nexus"" of ethical consumption and interpellate branded citizens rather than ethical consumers. It displaces the ethical commodity with a sense of direct civic engagement, while also exploiting logics of Desire by perpetually enticing individuals back to the well of civic brand identification.","Cause-related marketing; Citizenship; Ethical branding; Ethical consumption; Starbucks",""

In particular, we examine the representation of children in Cypriot print advertisements as main subjects in the construction of advertising messages for food. The selected target group is mainly parents or adults who have children. The present study focuses on the iconic dimension of verbal and non-verbal signs of twenty-six advertisements. Our study shows that advertisements for children's food in Cyprus localize global cultural values such as family, safety and food quality for children through codified iconic (plastic visual) signs that connote characteristics of ""Cypriotness"".","Advertising; Children's food; Content analysis; Cultural values; Iconic signs",""
"The semiotics of modernist space in the branding of organisations: A multimodal critical discourse analytic approach","2015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981186533&partnerID=40&md5=be969e02fc5919bd5945579496edd891","It is common to find the extensive use of modernist type space in corporate branding: across visual designs of documents; in images that show clean airy spaces; and in building design. In this paper, we look at this use of space as a communicative tool in the rebranding of Örebro University in Sweden, as it was reorganized around marketized principles. By drawing on the perspective of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, we examine the semiotic use of space in externally and internally targeted documents, with a view to showing how this plays an important role in connoting, both to the public and internally to staff, a very specific set of priorities, processes and employee identities. By using Bakhtin's (1981) concept of the chronotope we show how space is fused with time. In these documents time tends to be highly compressed and erases the more complex and inter-related details of long-term, and deeply inter-connected activities both within the university and in society at large. While this might ultimately be detrimental to the core mission of a research/education institution, it serves the purpose of communicating the effectiveness of the university brand's transition.","Chronotope; MCDA; Rebranding",""

The topic is introduced by exploring the ongoing and significant connection between language, culture and food, taking phrases and rhymes from historical sources and comparing their use. The aim is to establish cross-disciplinary synergies between semiotics and cultural analysis and to shed new light on marketing issues in the alcoholic drinks sector. The methodology section features the first ever analysis of alcoholic drinks' labels from four Celtic national minorities (N = 1.937) that illustrates what proportion of labels exists in each minority's language. The paper further explores unique branding positions in relation to the marketing theory of positionality, and positional innovation. It concludes with a discussion of Spolsky and Cooper's (1991) third sign rule and the concept of linguistic landscapes in relation to alcoholic drinks' labelling.","Alcoholic drinks branding; Celtic; Cornish; Labelling; Positional innovation",""

"For a semiotic model of cultural branding and the dynamic management of a brandosphere in the face of user-generated advertising","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981164241&partnerID=40&md5=0cf5b4570a147f40809c63b0d400360a","The aim of this paper is twice foundational. First, it aims at providing a sketchmap for a semiotically informed model of cultural branding that is currently lacking and second to identify how this model could be fruitfully applied for managing a brand's share of cultural representations, over and above its market share, as well as the textual sources of a brand language as (inter)textual formation. The propounded cultural branding model of the brandosphere is of inter-disciplinary orientation, spanning the relevant marketing and semiotic literatures, with an emphasis on Lotman's cultural/textual semiotics and social media, with an added focus on user-generated advertising (henceforth denoted as UGA). The brandosphere is envisioned as a marketing semiotic contester to the almost monopolizing cultural branding model of Douglas Holt (2004) in an attempt to demonstrate that marketing semiotics may constitute a standalone discipline that is capable of addressing, both conceptually and methodologically, various marketing-related research areas, rather than an ornamental add-on to consumer research.","Brandosphere; Cultural semiotics; Share of cultural representations; User-generated advertising",""
"An anatomy of the multimodal rhetorical landscape of the world's most valuable brands","2013","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981342147&partnerID=40&md5=4829d062de8b0ea4ce0b03ca041af4ff","This paper furnishes an anatomy of the rhetorical configuration of representative advertising narratives from the most valuable brands (based on WPP's BrandZ 2012 Report), while seeking to demonstrate the usefulness of classical rhetoric in understanding narratives that involve other than verbal modes and to contribute to the ongoing research on visual, verbovisual and multimodal rhetoric on both conceptual and methodological levels. The filmic syntagms are segmented by applying the rhetorical taxonomy of operations (adjunction, suppression, substitution, permutation) that was adapted by Groupe μ (1970) from Quintilian, with the aid of the content analytic tool Atlas.ti 7, and a list of 39 rhetorical figures that partake of these operations. The definitions of the involved figures are expanded with view to providing (partial) answers to the ongoing plea for adapting traditional figures in a highly visio-centric culture, of which advertising filmic narratives constitute a remarkable example. Furthermore, three novel figures are put forward, viz. accolorance, pareikonopoeia and reshaption, with view to capturing salient facets of this visio-centric culture. The ensuing discussion draws on the findings of the content analytic study, while highlighting not only which figures recur most frequently in the selected corpus, but, moreover, how they surface in different modes and interactions among modes, thus yielding a 'rhetorical first mover advantage'.","Advertising narratives; Branding; Content analysis; Multimodal rhetoric",""

It establishes architectural discourse as a sign-system that produces symbolic capital within the wider framework of the identity-building process. The shift from ethics to aesthetics, from functional, utilitarian retail venues, to glossy design interiors, has recently emerged in the financial community. New design concepts of retail banking are currently being tested to accompany innovative initiatives in the area of consumer marketing. In the finance sector, where symbolic capital ranks as a critical reputation asset, architecture increasingly conveys corporate values and takes part in institutional myth-making. By presenting an analysis of architectural semiotics, the paper argues that the multi-sensory (visual-sonic-olfactory-tactile) congruity of architectural narratives generates denoted and connoted meaning. An empirical illustration of Societe Generale's branch on the Champs-Elysees shows how architectural discourse establishes idiosyncratic brand identity. As the semiotic exploration of architecture remains significantly under-represented in the marketing semiotic literature, the paper seeks to open a new territory in this emerging field.","Architectural semiotics; Brand identity; Financial communication; Marketing aesthetics",""

In both of these senses, advertising discourse today is the favoured, and in fact almost exclusive, domain of rhetoric. In this essay, we consider the revival in recent decades of both traditions, by Chaïm Perelman and Groupe μ, respectively, and their importance to publicity, in particular to advertising pictures. In both senses of the term, rhetoric relies heavily on the presuppositions that are to a greater or lesser extent shared between the initiator of the message and its recipients. In the case of rhetorical figures, it is the organisation of the world of our experience according to topological properties such as neighbourhood, sequence, enclosure, and the like that has to be taken for granted; in the case of persuasion, more particular socio-cultural values have to be shared. We will see, however, that publicity occupies a paradoxical position from this point of view, since it has to rely on a consensus to have any influence, but must at the same time redefine the objects of our experience. As we will see in the case of Absolut Vodka, it was redefined for the international consumer as part of a rich European heritage, while car service was redefined for a Turkish audience into the likeness of fast food.","Presuppositions; Rhetoric; Rhetorical figures; Source adaption; Target adaption",""

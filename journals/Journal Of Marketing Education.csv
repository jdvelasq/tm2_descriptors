"Inclusivity and Diversity: A Systematic Review of Strategies Employed in the Higher Education Marketing Discipline","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150264795&doi=10.1177%2f02734753231159010&partnerID=40&md5=9de690622b319f1e416aeb00ad72df81","This paper reports on a systematic review into inclusivity and diversity in the higher education marketing discipline. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria and are analyzed to identify the inclusion and diversity identities that have been studied, synthesize strategies that have been identified as successful in supporting inclusion and diversity in the classroom and propose a future research agenda to further scholarly understanding within the marketing discipline. The findings suggest that most prior studies have focused on cultural diversity or diversity in general, and the strategies identified as effective were (a) utilizing technology to support inclusion and diversity, (b) developing curriculum that takes into consideration the diverse society we live in, (c) integrating projects into curriculum that are focused on diversity and inclusion, and (d) considering extra-curricular activities to deepen students’ inclusivity and diversity skills. © The Author(s) 2023.","diversity; higher education; inclusion; marketing; vulnerability",""
"Marketing Analytics Curriculum Integration: An Exploration of Resource Availability for Faculty","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169685705&doi=10.1177%2f02734753231195591&partnerID=40&md5=23b287b51b8bf23d82da3b9473322241","This study builds on the long-identified gap between the marketing industry and marketing academia. The research investigates the relationship between resource-based factors and marketing faculty’s intention to use marketing analytics technology. The theoretical framework for this study is the concerns-based adoption model (CBAM). Resource-based factors explored included technical support, managerial support, financial support, and time. The methodology included a randomized sample of Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) marketing faculty, and the statistical analysis used was multiple regression. Perceived technical support, time to integrate technology, and administrative support are all related to the intention to use marketing analytics technology. Overall, these results indicate that administration within AACSB business schools should consider the resources faculty need to adopt marketing analytics technology into the marketing curriculum, and faculty should consider methods to advocate for such resources. © The Author(s) 2023.","marketing analytics; marketing curriculum; marketing technology",""
"Reimagining an Experiential Learning Exercise in Times of Crisis: Lessons Learned and a Proposed Framework","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127814615&doi=10.1177%2f02734753221084128&partnerID=40&md5=439a37b973eb1b23f742d2c67bb9939f","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced marketing educators to innovate and adapt their existing teaching methods. This article presents and discusses an experiential learning exercise called the market-immersion project (MIP) and how it was adapted to suit online teaching. The MIP was an integral part of the course on the “bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) and rural markets,” which had to be pivoted as a photoessay exercise due to the limitations of not being able to venture out for a physical immersion. The design, implementation, and grading are elaborated for both exercises, and lessons are identified for marketing educators. Building on the lessons from two experiential learning exercises and using Kolb’s experiential learning theory, a six-step model of short-term field immersion is proposed. The proposed framework could be useful for marketing educators who want to use experiential exercises, including field-based exercises, in their courses in the postpandemic scenario. Finally, implications for theory, marketing education, limitations, and future directions are presented. © The Author(s) 2022.","bottom-of-the-pyramid; experiential learning; field immersion; marketing education; pedagogical innovation; photoessay",""

In this article, we argue for the inclusion of a wider macro-sustainability focus, one that “hacks” marketing education. With that objective in mind, we developed and delivered an introductory marketing course that integrated both the micro and the macro, thus infusing the course with macro-sustainability. This was done through an “expanded voice” perspective that included alternate complementary micro and macro class sessions while using a traditional managerial marketing textbook supplemented by macro-sustainability materials. We also integrated a controversies approach to support discussion and learning. We taught this course to 150 undergraduate students and conducted both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the course, including comparing results with an “unhacked” marketing course. Findings indicated increased awareness of macro-sustainability topics and movement on appreciation of sustainability and the role marketing can have in achieving this awareness. Finally, we offer a model of how marketing classes at all levels can be “hacked” with a macro-sustainability approach. © The Author(s) 2021.","macro-sustainability; macromarketing; marketing education; pedagogy; sustainability",""

However, massive open online courses (MOOCs) tend to face an issue of course dropouts, and this cannot only be attributed to factors like course content or value. Social interactions among students and interest-generating elements of MOOCs are equally important elements of online learning ecosystems. Therefore, this study approaches the problem from the perspective of the social exchange theory with insights into the cognitive evaluation theory to predict the effects of social interactions and gamification rewards on the process of studies. The data from an experiment and a subsequent survey of marketing course participants were used to analyze student satisfaction and dropouts through the lens of the social exchange theory and to see the effects of expected and unexpected gamification rewards. This contributes to the knowledge about factors that influence online course discontinuation, provides managerial and educational insights on dropout reduction, and specifies directions for further studies on the use of gamification elements in MOOCs. © The Author(s) 2020.","gamification; marketing; massive open online courses; online learning; rewards; social exchange theory",""

Findings from 345 senior-level marketing students indicate the heaviest use of the strategic approach, followed by the deep approach, and then the surface approach. Results also suggest that strategic and deep learning approaches are associated with higher perceptions of the quality of the academic program. Surface learning is the least preferred approach and negatively associated with the perception of academic program quality and satisfaction with academic achievement.

"Educating Marketing Students to Understand Designers’ Thought-Worlds","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112823788&doi=10.1177%2f02734753211038997&partnerID=40&md5=532af5ca410e644165f161c23ed0eb89","Marketers and designers are likely to work together on innovation teams as they both have customer satisfaction as their end goals. Collaboration between these disciplines in innovation teams is often impaired due to the different thought-worlds that drive decision making: intuitive versus rational. To facilitate collaboration between design and marketing it is valuable to teach marketers about designers’ ways of thinking. Approaches to teaching design thinking to marketing students often focus on students becoming more creative, intuitive, and innovative themselves. However, the integration of the two disciplines does not require that marketers become designers, and vice versa, as both bring unique skills necessary for successful innovation. An educational framework is presented that aims to teach marketing students an understanding of the thought-world of design thinking rather than to become design thinkers themselves. The focus is on recognizing how the others’ approach to the same goals are complementary to their own approaches instead of being different or “wrong.” This framework is unique in aligning design thinking phases with critical thinking phases—marketing students’ dominant thinking style—through specifically chosen activities to scaffold the understanding of an intuitive, divergent, and creative thinking approach to the development of innovative marketing ideas. © The Author(s) 2021.","creativity/creative problem solving; critical thinking; design thinking; innovation; marketing education",""

Yet, marketing educators contend with insufficient theoretical guidance and practical pedagogical methods in the course design that aligns with industry expectations in teaching analytics within the novel context of digital marketing. Addressing this void, this paper presents a case study operationalizing a practice-informed model through two experiential learning methods—simulations and client-based projects–in teaching these courses. These methods, grounded in three practice-informed dimensions (i.e., knowledge, hard skills, and soft skills), are incorporated to structure two separate sections of a DMA course over distinct semesters. Preliminary findings from student data regarding actual and perceived learning outcomes suggest a slight edge for the simulation approach over the client-based project approach. However, our faculty reflection delves deeper into the benefits and challenges of both approaches. This case study aims to offer insights and recommendations for marketing educators considering incorporating a practice-informed approach integrated with experiential learning methods to teach their DMA courses. © The Author(s) 2024.","client-based project; digital marketing analytics; experiential learning; practice-informed model; simulation",""

This study builds on the literature regarding employer branding and talent acquisition by examining the effect sales program sponsorship has on students. Grounded in organizational reputation theories, brand equity, and the literature on corporate sponsorship, it is proposed that sponsoring a sales program leads to positive student–firm related perceptions. Additionally, it is predicted that classroom engagement in the form of coteaching enhances these positive effects. Two natural field experiments, one involving two semesters of professional sales students (n = 90), the other involving four semesters of professional sales students (n = 174), are conducted to test the conceptual model. Results confirm the study’s predictions that sponsoring firms are perceived more favorably by students, and classroom engagement enhances these positive perceptions. Finally, results suggest that firms with lower initial familiarity among students have the most to gain in terms of enhancing student perceptions through coteaching. © The Author(s) 2021.","employer branding; recruiting practices; sales; sales education; sponsorship",""

Indeed, contemporary marketing research is more likely a function embedded within an array of generalist job duties that also require soft skills and the ability to analyze and present data to upper management. As a result of this research, educators should have a heightened awareness of the following: (a) the disconnect between the marketing research curriculum and current industry needs, (b) the changing role of marketing research as diffused throughout the organization, and (c) the broader set of skills and techniques required of entry-level marketing graduates. As a possible solution to these issues, this research proposes an integrated model whereby instructors can help their students navigate the current landscape by choosing an appropriate pedagogical path to assist students in their career goals. © The Author(s) 2021.","availability of careers; employer needs; market research; oral communication; surveys; written communication",""

The purpose of this article is to discuss the challenges and opportunities of teaching macromarketing and sustainability concepts to business students so that more macromarketing managers would develop and exert their influence in marketplaces around the world. Important points include (a) the imperative for macromarketing-minded educators to advocate for curriculum changes in their own business schools, and (b) the need for macromarketing-minded educators to become more capable teachers of macromarketing and sustainability content with students more skeptical about such content.

With access to clickstream data from an online e-educator, we found 62% of the sample binged their learning by concentrating their studies within the semester rather than distributing their online activity throughout. Two types of binge learning emerged as significant: Front-bingers, who accessed the majority of their education early, performed more similarly over time to those who spaced their learning activities. Back-bingers, who accessed the majority of their material late in the semester, did not perform as well.

The pedagogy of vulnerability is premised on risking self-disclosure as an act of courage. Self-expansion theory is grounded in personal relationships whereby individuals are motivated for personal growth and identify with others to gain access to their resources. In the context of marketing education, self-expansion stems from enhancing student self-awareness for personal growth as well as perceived vulnerability and relatedness of the instructor to encourage access to expertise. The KMA was conducted at three universities and assessed to determine its usefulness as a self-expansion exercise. Survey results indicate that students found the activity contained self-expansion characteristics, and they recommend it for future use. The results of the pretest and posttest analyses also demonstrated an increase in student self-awareness, perceived instructor vulnerability, and perceived instructor relatedness.

First, a thematic review of the literature based on the modules of capabilities developed by the Digital Marketing Institute and the American Marketing Association contributed to identifying four eras of digital marketing education research. Next, the authors assess areas of research coinciding with the topical review to assess relevant research in each area. We conclude with recommendations for research to fill the gaps, including calls for work in search engine optimization, analytics, and email marketing, as well as greater attention when submitting article keywords, as finding papers when searching EBSCO or Web of Science depends on relevant keywords. © The Author(s) 2023.","digital marketing education; digital marketing eras; marketing keywords; thematic review",""
"Changing Perceptions of Marketing Ethics and Social Responsibility in Principles of Marketing","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101915576&doi=10.1177%2f0273475321995553&partnerID=40&md5=1baaf6f20e02b05edacc356e1e6c7454","The principles of marketing course usually includes coverage of marketing ethics and social responsibility. This study attempts to gain an understanding of students’ perceptions of the importance of marketing ethics and social responsibility and to see if these perceptions can be enhanced. Students were provided one class period lecture on the topics with prelecture and postlecture evaluation. The study addressed marketing ethics and social responsibility as distinct constructs. Postlecture there was an improvement in marketing ethics perceptions for all majors, with nonmarketing business majors showing the most improvement. Postlecture perceptions of the importance of social responsibility increased significantly with nonbusiness majors showing the lowest level of improvement. Changing perceptions of importance can motivate long-term engagement in beliefs about the significance and value of business ethics and social responsibility. © The Author(s) 2021.","consumer; employee; environmental; marketing education; marketing ethics; social responsibility; societal concerns",""
"The Academic Response-to-Failure Scale: Predicting and Increasing Academic Persistence Post-Failure","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061608265&doi=10.1177%2f0273475319826628&partnerID=40&md5=85dfae0d801ab65fae806ca1a797707a","When students experience failure in the pursuit of a marketing degree (e.g., on a test or a course), do they persist or relent their academic efforts? Relenting can lead to long-term academic failure and severe negative consequences for students, universities, and society. Thus, identifying students prone to relenting and directing resources to help them persist is important. We address this need by leveraging prior research on the response-to-failure construct to develop and validate a new measure: the Academic Response-to-Failure Scale. Two studies validate the measure, and two additional studies show that it predicts post-failure persistence and relenting more effectively than 12 related measures. Because the scale uses students’ chronic cognitive and emotional responses to subgoal failure to predict post-failure relenting, it can be applied to design interventions that modify these responses to improve persistence. A final study tests one such intervention, showing that it improves post-failure persistence, particularly for students who otherwise tend to relent. We provide recommendations on how the Academic Response-to-Failure Scale can be used to identify vulnerable students, to design interventions that can help increase these students’ persistence, and to target those interventions and create meaningfully differentiated learning environments. © The Author(s) 2019.","academic; differentiated learning; failure; goals; individual differences; marketing; motivation",""

Using an interpretive and convergent mixed-methods design, we discover four clusters of students that vary in terms of their game-motivational bases and views on gamification elements. Social completionists want to study together with others and enjoy the social aspects of gamification. Highly motivated completionists could be described as ambitious students who enjoy social learning but are also internally motivated and willing to accept most gamification elements. Independent completionists want to immerse themselves in learning but prefer the individual and noncompetitive elements of gamification. Pure completionists are the “let’s get it done” group, who want to focus on completing their studies and are likely to be critical toward any gamification. We propose that higher education should take into account the differences in students’ game-playing motivations and fine-tune their gamification efforts to engage and motivate different kinds of students. Finally, we provide suggestions to marketing educators on how to consider the various motivational bases of the participants in gamified experiences. © The Author(s) 2022.","cluster analysis; game-playing motivations; gamification; higher education; marketing education; mixed-method",""

Given the extra resources needed to maintain multiple majors, in a time when higher education budgets are being strained, a need exists to understand how students make choices among these majors and what students perceive to be the advantages of general marketing majors versus specialized marketing majors. Using social cognitive theory, we examine how students make selections among choices in marketing-related majors, focusing on influence and compatibility factors. We surveyed 608 marketing majors representing one general and five specialized marketing majors. The findings indicate that, compared with general marketing majors, students’ choice of a specialized major is significantly more likely to be influenced by faculty and other students in the major. Also, the results show that students rate specialized majors better than a general marketing major in terms of self-efficacy, culture, and professional fit. On the other hand, students rate the general marketing major better than specialized majors in flexibility. These results have implications for supporting the priorities of students in both general and specialized majors. © The Author(s) 2021.","higher education; major recruitment; major selection; marketing advising; specialized major; university enrollment",""

This research aims to review the academic literature on how Higher Education Institutions incorporate the SDGs into the marketing curriculum. In this regard, the expected outcome is to assist marketing academics in developing a curriculum aligned with the SDGs. An integrative literature review including 40 articles led to three core themes: Integration, Transformation, and Leadership. Building on these themes, the article contributes to marketing education through the 3Es framework (Engage, Expand, Enact) for embedding the SDGs in the marketing curriculum: “Engage” integrates sustainability knowledge into the existing marketing curriculum by fostering debates and reflection around the SDGs. “Expand” transforms values and attitudes among marketing students and staff using transformative and experiential pedagogical tools. This leads to “Enact” with leadership and partnerships within and outside the university, which leads to collaborative actions aligned with the SDGs. © The Author(s) 2024.","marketing curriculum; marketing education; pedagogy; SDGs; sustainability; sustainable development",""

The authors utilize a mixed-methods design to examine CSPs and their effectiveness in marketing research and analytics courses. In Study 1, qualitative research yields student insights regarding the desired characteristics of a CSP. Study 2 illustrates that CSPs boost student engagement through perceptions of course relevance. However, students’ subjective interest in the client represented a boundary condition for this effect. That is, CSPs did not offer value to students who lacked inherent interest in the client. In Study 3, a discrete choice model analysis outlined what attributes make clients interesting for students.

We address this gap through a qualitative exploration of student experiences of navigating the new normal which they were abruptly thrust into near the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Using a guided introspection methodology and a Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, we unearth a dynamic process of psychological and behavioral changes that students experienced in response to the environmental changes brought about by the pandemic. We theorize that environmental dissolution and displacement trigger psychological reorientation, causing students to undertake behavioral practices of restructuration and reconfiguration that, over time, result in a degree of psychological revaluation. Our overall framework represents a fluid conceptualization that is not only more descriptive of real-world student progress but also more parsimonious in its account of key dimensions of student experience during the pandemic.

The synthesis of transformational leadership, context-dependent fixation hypothesis, strength of weak ties perspective, contagious motivation, and constructivist learning frameworks form the interdisciplinary foundation for the proposed contagious motivation and creative experience model (CMCEM). The proposed marketing classroom model is tested using a structural equation model of N = 540 marketing undergraduate students. Findings indicate that CDT is an important individual characteristic that affects classroom dynamics. Importantly, when students exhibit higher levels of CDT, they perceive higher project uniqueness, higher levels of motivation, higher other student motivation, and more positive course experiences. In addition to other findings, the CMCEM emphasizes the powerful combination of CDT, individual student motivation, the contagious nature of that motivation on other students through well-structured group projects, and the importance of instructors as transformational teachers. © The Author(s) 2021.","contagious motivation; context-dependent fixation hypothesis; course experience; course satisfaction; creativity; groups; project uniqueness; social learning theory; structural equation modeling; teams",""

"A Students’ Preferences-Based Approach to Select Methods for Detecting and Handling Free-Riding","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100901526&doi=10.1177%2f0273475321992109&partnerID=40&md5=f7a5e092f4879e18bc7b1592d1fd5262","Free-riding is a serious challenge in group projects. While there are various methods to reduce free-riding, marketing educators still face a difficult task when selecting an appropriate method for their course. In this study, we propose a students’ preferences-based approach that supports marketing educators with the selection of methods to detect and handle free-riding. To measure these preferences, students completed an online survey based on a choice task about two methods to detect free-riding and a ranking task about four methods to handle free-riding (n = 254). Their answers were analyzed using chi-squared tests, Borda scores, and rank-ordered logit models. The results show that (a) neither Dutch nor international students have a clear preference for one of the two detection methods (the reporting system vs. the process evaluation system), (b) grade discussion (a possible reduction of the free-rider’s grade based on a conversation with the course coordinator about each student’s contribution) is the most preferred method to handle free-riding, and (c) international students have a stronger preference for stricter handling methods. Marketing educators can apply the proposed approach, or use our specific findings, for designing methods to reduce free-riding in their courses. © The Author(s) 2021.","free-riding; group project; multicultural groups; social loafing; student preferences; teamwork",""

This study proposes that employing the Fishbowl method, which divides students into “fish” or “observers” to facilitate active problem-solving and analytical reflection, can effectively empower students to augment their learning and performance in marketing analysis by strengthening their metacognition. This research also explores the moderating effects of task complexity and students’ divergent thinking. Two field experiments (41 Cohort 22/23 students in Study 1; 39 Cohort 23/24 students in Study 2) were implemented. The results revealed that the Fishbowl method significantly enhances students’ metacognition, which affects their task-solving performance. Furthermore, students with higher (lower) divergent thinking perform better and are better suited to the observer (fish) roles. This moderating effect was strengthened when the task complexity was high. This study bridges the use of the Fishbowl method with the enhancement of metacognition in the context of marketing analytics courses. Appropriate utilization of the Fishbowl method during marketing analytics courses, along with grouping students based on their thinking traits, can significantly enhance learning effectiveness and performance. © The Author(s) 2024.","divergent thinking; Fishbowl method; metacognition; task complexity",""

The dynamic nature of social media makes it difficult for even practitioners to keep up; therefore, the gap between academia and industry continues to grow. This gap presents significant challenges for marketing educators to keep course content current so students are ready for the workforce. To identify which types of social media pedagogical assessments best meet industry needs and make recommendations for bridging this gap, this article uses a three-study approach consisting of content analysis of job descriptions, practitioner interviews, and student perceptions of two commonly used pedagogical assessments: simulations and client-based projects. Results show the critical need for social media meta-skills and technical skills, with client-based projects significantly improving meta-skill acquisition by undergraduate students compared with simulations alone.

Collecting first-hand institutionally administered SETs (N = 6,123) over a seven-year period, the extended data collection phase includes 21 semesters and 240 undergraduate courses. Study findings reveal that students perceive full-time faculty as more knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and better prepared for class than part-time faculty. Full-timers are also better able to communicate the subject matter and develop assignments focused on student learning than part-timers. In contrast, students perceive part-time faculty as better able to relate the course material to the real world, develop exam questions that reflect lectures and assignments, and return graded material more quickly than full-time faculty. Compared with part-time faculty, students perceive full-time faculty as being more rigorous and tougher in terms of grading.

It also abruptly curtailed in-person large gatherings, including academic conferences. Although many marketing scholarly professional organizations suffered a negative financial impact, the quick transition to offer completely online live events allowed many marketing educators to attend a virtual conference for the first time. After having experienced the benefits of virtual attendance, will marketing educators return to in-person attendance when it is deemed safe to do so? Marketing educators can earn credit for serving in scholarly professional organization leadership roles and for organizing and participating in academic conferences offered by those organizations. Thus, there is a vested interest in having profitable events to support the organizations. This study seeks to answer the question, what motivates marketing educators to attend in-person and virtual academic conferences? Grounded in self-determination theory, relatedness and competence are examined as marketing educator motivations.

It contributes to understanding by incorporating the concept of collective, or collaborative engagement where there is a scarcity of research despite the widespread application of group assessment in business education, and marketing education in particular. We employed canonical correlation analysis as an exploratory technique to gain initial insight into its efficacy for student engagement. We contend that digital storytelling shows promise as an inherently social and interactive learning task to provide an authentic assessment for a range of marketing problems. In turn, these attributes provide a stimulating vehicle for student engagement that can promote learning and satisfaction. © The Author(s) 2022.","assessment; canonical correlation analysis; digital storytelling; education administration issues; innovative teaching methods; learning approaches and issues; marketing education issues; student engagement; technology in classroom",""
"Heuristics and the Choice of Method in Entrepreneurial Marketing Education","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167356929&doi=10.1177%2f02734753231190886&partnerID=40&md5=8983ea50f943861acae0247bb7d49e10","This article exhibits that entrepreneurial marketing educators recur to their own heuristics to deal not only with the challenges that relate to their mentees’ entrepreneurial projects, but also with the operationalization of their teaching and methodological approaches. Based on the identification of heuristics derived from a convenience sample of 20 entrepreneurship educators, this research characterizes four archetypes of educators: academics, experts, entrepreneurs-in-residence, and mentors. Findings indicate that academics refer to the most common and successful practices, whereas experts qualify methods that fulfill their purposes and follow best practices. Entrepreneurs-in-residence mirror their own startup experiences, involving a certain level of pragmatism, and mentors base their decisions on experience, choosing practices that they judge suitable. Each profile tends to replicate heuristics patterns in the selection of the education method, suggesting an impossibility to separate context and experience from the methodological choices that determine entrepreneurial marketing education, whose learning process is presented as an adapted version of the model originally proposed by Kolb for students. This article contributes to the academic discussion of the role of educators in entrepreneurial marketing, offering an exploratory explanation as to why and how different educator profiles choose their teaching and methodological approaches. © The Author(s) 2023.","educator; entrepreneurial marketing; heuristics; learning approaches and issues; learning styles; level/type of education; marketing education issues; undergraduate education",""

Having sufficient time to complete essential planning is important, as is the punctuality of meeting deadlines. Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT) explains the relationship between deciding to perform a task and expected incentives, consequences, and the cost of delay. We analyzed the time (in seconds) that business students submitted weekly quizzes before Saturday night deadlines (1,587 quiz submissions). Self-discipline was measured as a student’s self-evaluation of their ability to start tasks promptly. We find that self-discipline, by itself, was associated with lower average quiz scores. However, self-discipline combined with greater punctuality was associated with higher quiz scores. High self-discipline associated with low emotional stability resulted in earlier average quiz submissions, which resulted in higher quiz scores than submitting work closer to deadlines. These results indicate using internal pressure like anxiety to initiate studying and completing schoolwork can lead to better academic performance. Based on TMT, students appear to use deadlines to reverse calculate the amount of time before a consequential deadline. This translates into a form of negative reinforcement (avoidance), as opposed to positive reinforcement for punctuality.

Specifically, by including ChatGPT in their lessons, marketing educators can both materially enhance learning experiences and better prepare students for future jobs with marketing firms that rely on ChatGPT in practice. Noting that ChatGPT has downsides, this research identifies several steps educators should take to minimize the risks. Finally, the authors propose an agenda for continued research into how marketing educators can and should use ChatGPT, with the explicit recognition that ChatGPT is evolving rapidly, so that, the research agenda will need to adapt as well. © The Author(s) 2023.","ChatGPT; generative AI; marketing education",""

We answer this question with a qualitative systematic literature review of every contribution published in five marketing and management education journals from inception through May 2020 that provides recommendations for evidence-based best pedagogical practice. Contributions were screened to identify empirical studies that employed measures of actual learning in an appropriate experimental design and reported analyses that met certain statistical standards. Of the 4,160 articles examined, 55 studies met our criteria. Based on the studies’ results, we developed a model for understanding the teaching methods that are most effective for achieving actual learning in marketing and management education.

Sweeping changes in technology and society have certainly affected how marketing research is designed and implemented—but how has this affected teaching of this important topic? Although the purpose of marketing research is still to better understand target customer needs, the tools are different now: customer data are typically collected using technology-based interfaces in place of such instruments as mailed, telephone, or in-person surveys. Observational techniques collect more data electronically rather than requiring a human recorder. Similarly, sampling has changed: sample frames are no longer widely used. Many of these changes are not yet fully discussed in marketing research courses. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in and availability of courses and programs in marketing data analytics, which teach specialized skills related to analysis and interpretation of electronic databases. Perhaps even more importantly, new technology-based tools permit greater automation of data collection and analysis, and presentation of findings. A critical gap is identified in this article; specifically, effort is needed to better integrate the perspectives of data collection and data analysis given current research conditions. © The Author(s) 2020.","change over time; course content; depth interviews; learning approaches and issues; level/type of education; marketing education issues; marketing education issues; marketing education issues; marketing research; undergraduate education",""

An incomplete 3 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design was used to expose students enrolled in a basic marketing course to hypothetical feedback scenarios that varied the aforementioned factors. N-way analyses of variance and analyses of covariance revealed main and interaction effects. Students generally responded more negatively to higher versus lower amounts of critical feedback provided by the instructor. By contrast, when peers provided the feedback, students in most cases responded similarly to low and high levels of feedback, and they indicated that a high level of peer feedback was more helpful than a low level of peer feedback. Allowing students the opportunity to revise their work had two interesting effects.

This study empirically tests the effectiveness of the proposed approach by developing and conducting a cost-efficient, easy-to-implement experiential learning activity where marketing students and advanced English as a Second Language students interview each other about consumer behavior differences. The activity led to a perceived increase in cultural knowledge, motivation, and confidence in the students’ ability to communicate with people from other cultures. Overall, students deemed the activity a valuable part of their education. Students’ CQ was positively correlated with the self-reported (perceived) prior experience-based and studies-based intercultural competence.

But, is this commonly held belief correct? In the current study, the notion that faculty scholarship exhibits a positive association with teaching evaluations is investigated. Reflecting the data structure of faculty nested within university, the current study uses hierarchical linear modeling, and finds that scholarship displays a positive correspondence with teaching evaluations, but only for male faculty publishing in elite or top-tier marketing journals. Although this linkage is only found under specific conditions, it stands in contrast to much of the extant literature, which reports little to no correlation between research and teaching evaluations. In addition, significant control variables and interactions, at both the faculty level (i.e., gender, faculty title) and university level (i.e., tuition, entry GPA, flagship university), are identified. In total, the findings suggest that while there is an association between elite publications and student evaluations, the primacy of research in the academy may, nonetheless, not always be in the best interest of students. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","assessment; balance of teaching; education administration issues; general multivariate statistics; marketing education issues; measuring teaching effectiveness; methodology; research and service; scholarship",""

Levels of self-efficacy (low to high) and implicit theories (more malleable view of abilities to more fixed views of abilities) are varied, with cumulative GPA included as well in regression analysis. Results show that a malleable view of abilities leads not only to lower levels of overall satisfaction with a grade but also less anger and likely influences students to strive to improve.

However, students may feel uncomfortable about information systems and database technology, which they may perceive as complex and dry. This case describes how the development of a course on data-driven marketing makes use of service design methods. The experiential learning innovation is based on the optimization of customer journey mapping, which encompasses theoretical marketing concepts, modern database architecture and practical digital marketing knowledge. As a visualization of individual interactions with a product, service, or brand, customer journey mapping helps explain the way an interaction occurs in one moment and how it influences all other moments. By taking the “data as a service” perspective on the customer journey, students benefit from a more innovative and creative approach to data-driven marketing, which helps improve their attention and motivation. © The Author(s) 2018.","customer journey mapping; data as a service; data-driven marketing; experiential learning; persona development; stakeholder map",""

Based on social cognitive theory, we investigate how personality (Big Five personality factors and Trait Competitiveness), ability (ACT, GPA, and Academic Self-Efficacy), and social factors (role models, and perception of salespersons) affect interest and choice. Our results indicate that although the regression models explain a reasonable amount of variance, models that work for business students do not work equally well for engineering students. Also, our analysis reveals that factors that explain interest do not explain actual choice, and vice versa. In addition, we uncover subtle gender difference when it comes to actual choice for a sales curriculum.

To do so, we develop a conceptual model, based on signaling theory, that focuses on how students formulate their intention to pursue a given sales position. Our research utilizes a two-study approach. First, we explore the desired entry-level sales skills communicated by employers through job advertisements. Next, we examine both student and advertisement characteristics and their distinct relationships with the satisfaction with the job ad and the intention to apply for a sales position. Our study is unique, as we examine distinct undergraduate groups’ (sales, marketing, other business, and nonbusiness students) responses to sales job advertisements.

Students that have acquired an education in sales during their undergraduate program have been found to have a more realistic perception of sales as a profession, to require minimum training, to have lower turnover, and to require less time to be more productive. This has been attributed to the success of sales education curricula and sales education techniques at the collegiate level. This study examines the importance of sales students’ cultural intelligence and how it influences their adaptive selling behaviors and sales role-play performance in a cross-cultural selling situation.

Their lack of awareness and misconceptions regarding a sales job are two reasons behind this negative perception and lack of students’ “work readiness.” Using a conceptual model on student intention to pursue a sales career, this study has two goals: (a) to understand whether students recognize the changes in the salesperson’s role and (b) to investigate whether new understanding of these changes has any impact on students’ feelings and perceptions regarding selling as a career choice. After a preliminary qualitative analysis, a survey was carried out in a European country (Italy). Findings suggest that students are partly aware of the salesperson’s role, but they have a limited understanding of the evolution that has taken place in that role.

From the perspective of customers, the focus lies on technological and value changes. In terms of competitors, the analysis centers on the growing number of alternative suppliers of business education and the geographic shifts in the business school landscape. As to the company dimension, I comment on the vast number and heterogeneity of business schools and suggest that they are heading toward a business model competition.

This research examines a group assignment method, herein called the flocking method, designed to reduce free-riding by improving students’ motivation and availability to contribute to the group. A quasi-experiment is described in which students were flocked, or matched, according to their schedule availability and willingness to devote time to the course, such that motivated students (i.e., those who planned to devote more time) were grouped with other motivated students with similar schedules, whereas unmotivated students were grouped with other unmotivated students with similar schedules. Compared with self-selected groups, students in flocked groups not only reported less free-riding, they also performed better on group and individual assignments, indicating an actual reduction in free-riding. Additionally, compared with the most prominent methods for reducing free-riding examined in literature, the flocking method of group assignment reduces resource demands on the instructor and students, making it as efficient to implement as it is effective.

Indeed, considerable evidence suggests that customer experiences are falling far short of company aspirations and customer expectations. To further CXM understanding, we conducted a three-credit undergraduate marketing course on CXM. Given the inherent experiential nature of CXM, we enhanced student learning by including a field immersion component. Specifically, on-campus class sessions were supplemented with a weeklong field immersion at Walt Disney World Resort.

Students are expected to enter the classroom prepared to engage in thoughtful knowledge application activities; however, many students have not adequately prepared, leading to minimal team contribution and learning. Readiness Assurance Testing is often implemented to help enforce student preclass preparation. These individual and group quizzing techniques can help motivate some students to keep current in the readings, but they do not assist students in learning comprehension. In order to improve learning comprehension and document preclass preparedness, an innovative note-taking method, Connected Notes, is offered as a way to assist students in recording, organizing, and connecting content in personally relevant ways. To improve comprehension and stimulate deeper levels of learning cognitive science supports the effectiveness of creating connections through multiple pathways. Students generate connections between chapter concepts and their consumer experiences, their careers, and company examples in preparation for team-based activities.

Relying on the extant literature of procedural justice, we hypothesized that when students perceive no fair process that determines their grades, then: (a) the relationship between distributive justice perceptions and SET will be stronger and (b) the indirect effect of grades on SET via distributive justice perceptions will be stronger.

Results of this study suggest prior online ratings, both positive and negative, do affect subsequent online ratings and bias them. There are several implications. First, both negative and positive ratings can have an impact biasing subsequent ratings.

To help combat the situation globally, educators must develop and utilize effective sales ethics pedagogies. The first step involves understanding cross-cultural sales ethics perspectives. A convenience sample is drawn from five countries (United States, France, Germany, Indonesia, and New Zealand), and the Personal Selling Ethics Scale (PSE-2) is successfully used to examine culturally specific and gender-based evaluation differences. Gender-based ethical perspectives are of particular interest due to the growing gender diversity within sales professions. The study finds that cultural traditionalism/secularism and individualism/collectivism affect sales ethics evaluations. Likewise, gender and moral ideology affect evaluations. Women are more sensitive to ethical misconduct than men, and absolutist are more sensitive than exceptionists, situationists, and subjectivists.

Lifestyle aspirations and relative ease of completion motives tend to be generally more important to marketing than AF and management concentrators, while career outcomes are more important to AF concentrators compared with marketing and management concentrators. Comparing marketing students in the United States to their counterparts elsewhere, those in China are significantly less attracted to lifestyle aspirations, reputation, and career outcomes, while those in the United Arab Emirates show no significant differences in career outcomes or reputation compared with those from the United States.

This article seeks to explore how marketing students perceive and use textbooks, what barriers inhibit their use, and how these barriers might be overcome. Qualitative exploratory and quantitative confirmatory research conducted at a British university reveals that reading assignments from the textbook are rarely completed. The textbook is primarily used as a handbook of definitions to help with the completion of coursework and as a revision aid for exams. The explanation for the lack of reading is less clear. The qualitative research suggested textbooks are cumbersome, inaccessible, and boring and that students perceive reading assignments to be unimportant because of their lack of integration into classwork. However, the quantitative study was less emphatic and revealed a neutral attitude toward textbooks, with less confidence that changes to the style of textbooks would encourage more reading.

The growing use of online teaching evaluations has enabled educational administrators to expand the time period during which student evaluation of teaching (SET) surveys can be completed by students. This added benefit increases the complexity of data collection and introduces new questions related to the time window during which SET survey administration should commence and stop. This article examines the role of the timing of SET survey completion on student satisfaction measures in the context of online marketing courses. The results indicate that there are significant differences between those students who respond early to survey invitations and those who respond late. Early responders and late responders reflect different segments of the student body, have different course evaluation formation dynamics, and exhibit different grade expectations. The findings suggest the existence of systematic biases in SET scores related to response rate, requiring educators to closely examine policies related to the timing of SET survey administration. © The Author(s) 2014","course evaluation; faculty assessment; student satisfaction",""

The two resulting Kano maps show the same delighting attributes although other satisfaction attributes are also similar. The findings reveal the importance of the personality of professors and the characteristics of professors that (a) are desired by students, (b) are not desired by students, (c) affect student satisfaction the most, and (d) affect satisfaction the least. The results also demonstrate how professors and universities can focus attention on those attributes most likely to influence satisfaction. No attributes of professors are classified as basic or taken for granted factors by students, although three attributes are excitement factors that have the potential to delight students.

In fact, this method puts the onus of learning on the students and empowers them to co-create content and subsequently learn through classroom discussions. This is followed by a brief classroom guide on the process of creating a participatory photo novel. Student evaluation and feedback are discussed.

The authors find that although students enjoy using many of the course management tools, they do not see the tools as highly effective at enhancing the learning experience. When designing courses and considering if or how to use course management tools, it is critical for faculty to consider the connection between the Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education and the specific technology tools.

Therefore, higher marketing education emphasizes creativity in several ways. However, assessing creativity and creative problem solving is challenging and tools for this purpose have not been developed in the context of marketing education. To address this gap, we analyze the use of Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy as an assessment tool in creative problem solving and in doing so develop an assessment framework by contextualizing SOLO taxonomy for client-based marketing development projects. We first introduce earlier literature on assessment and SOLO taxonomy. We then describe a client-based marketing course on creative problem solving. We use SOLO taxonomy to analyze the outcomes and development processes of six student projects and in doing so develop an assessment framework for creative problem solving. Finally, we give suggestions for teachers on how to enhance creative problem solving and its assessment in marketing classrooms. © The Author(s) 2013.","assessment; client-based projects; creative problem solving; experiential learning techniques; innovative teaching methods",""

Can professors use Twitter to engage students in conversation about a marketing course? The authors argue that Twitter has many benefits for marketing educators who are interested in engaging students in experiential learning. In a real-time environment for student learning, professors may use Twitter for direct communication with students to generate discussion and interest in the course topics and examples. Just as marketers use Twitter to generate interest, discussion, and brand image, educators can use Twitter to generate this interest in a course through social media. Furthermore, Twitter is a fast, easy method for making announcements, solving student issues, and performing course-related administrative duties. In three studies, both quantitative and qualitative data suggest that when students engage in Twitter use with the professor, students feel better prepared for future careers. In addition, students indicate that Twitter facilitates achieving traditional educational goals. The qualitative data offer insights into potential problems.

Concurrently, the demand for well-qualified salespeople has intensified partly due to high turnover. This article contends that there may be a disconnection between student expectations of a sales job when they leave school and what they actually experience on the job. Using salesforce socialization as a theoretical foundation, this study compares students’ versus salespeople’s perceptions of sales jobs in terms of realism and congruence with outcome and behavior-based job performance indicators as well as perceived ethical control. When considering job performance and ethics, the results show that students have a highly idealistic perception of sales when compared to those in the actual field of sales. For marketing educators it is imperative that efforts are focused on helping students form more realistic expectations for a sales career.

An online survey was conducted with 288 participants using the critical incident approach. Results indicate that predictors of intention to complain differ based on the target of complaint behavior (school, friends, or unknown others) and the mode of complaint (in person or using the web). Specifically, the more dissatisfied students are, the more likely they are to complain to the school and to friends either in person or using the web but not to unknown others. Students complain to the school only if the effort involved is minimal and they believe the school will respond. Students complain to friends and unknown others in person if they feel the school will respond to negative press. Personal characteristics also influence intentions to complain. Students with a propensity to complain broadcast their negative experience via the web, grade conscious students tell their friends but only in person, and heavy social media users inform their friends using the web.

Sales knowledge and sales-related self-efficacy have been established clearly to be determinants of future sales performance in industry. This article is a first step in examining the role self-efficacy plays within the context of sales education. More than 500 students, who have completed or are currently enrolled in at least one sales course at one of approximately 20 colleges, completed an 85-item survey for this study.

Marketing math and elementary financial understanding are essential employability skills, particularly given the contemporary emphasis on marketing metrics, but the evidence is that marketing graduates are often relatively weak in such skills. This article suggests that one educational strategy to improve numeracy and financial skills may be through the use of a marketing simulation game. Through the simulation game, students are exposed to marketing calculations and financial data in an engaging context that simulates the real world. It is hypothesized that marketing students' numeracy and financial skills, and their self-efficacy with respect to marketing calculations, will improve following participation in a simulation game where numerical and financial analysis are necessary activities. Using a quasi-experimental research design, it is found that there are substantial and significant improvements in numerical and financial performance after participating in a simulation game, but that there is no improvement (and possibly a small decline) in self-efficacy related to these tasks.

The study describes FMIT, a novel type of mentoring, reviews its benefits, and reveals the threats to its rewarding implementation. Three major elements related to rewarding intradepartmental mentoring were identified-organizational support, knowledge sharing in mentoring discussions, and handling emotions in mentoring. Accordingly, FMIT requires the establishment of an official status and permanent support structure. An existing colleague relationship and a long-term experience of collaboration provide facilitative conditions both for knowledge sharing and other rewards for both actors. The courage and ability to give and receive constructive feedback makes the mentoring relationship mutually beneficial. Organizational support in the form of training and coaching reduces the emotional challenges, further highlighting the importance of organizational commitment to FMIT. © The Author(s) 2012.","Facilitators and hindrances in mentoring; Faculty mentoring; Intradepartmental mentoring; Self-ethnography; Teacher mentoring",""

Thus, the marketing graduates being produced from universities are often lacking in the skills that 21stcentury marketers require. Where the focus of the article is on marketing education, a broad analysis of the content of marketing textbooks and degree programs is presented and an ""old Marketing DNA"" presented. The study also adopted an inductive approach to data collection where the aim was to investigate the exact nature, constituency, and role of marketing in organizations. Qualitative in-depth interviews were undertaken with senior marketing managers and executives in U.K. organizations. Findings are organized into the areas of customer-led marketing, value-driven strategic marketing, channels, data-driven marketing, and online and off-line integrated marketing communications. The article concludes that there is a disconnect between marketing education and marketing practice and goes some way to recommending what the response of marketing academia should be through the ""new Marketing DNA.""

In this article, the authors describe a semester-long, team-based retail audit project that is structured to elicit active student engagement with consumer behavior course material via concrete, hands-on, real-world experience. For the project, students form teams to organize and conduct an observational audit of a live retail setting. In the process of completing the project, students engage with course content on their own, with their team members, and importantly, within a focal store environment, thus experiencing for themselves the effects of that content on their own shopping behavior, as well as that of others. Compelled by the project's active pedagogy to engage in discovery, students learn not only the ""what"" and ""why"" of marketing concepts, strategies, and techniques but also ""how to"" implement them.

An experimental design wherein students were offered different numbers of choice options when previewing, as in a syllabus or other course description, a major class project in a hypothetical Retailing Management course, examined the effects of within-course choice on perceptions of the course. The results indicate that, before they are required to engage in the course choices and make an actual decision, students prefer to have more choice. This is evidenced by their perceptions of the course’s desirability and value to their future careers, perceptions of the quality and fairness of the course instructor, and emotional reactions to the level of choice. However, when required to engage in the choice, students responded more positively to having fewer choices. Likewise, students not as interested in marketing responded more positively to having less choice.

In order to better understand the decision to pursue sales education, more than 500 undergraduate business students at a large Midwestern university participated in a survey that examined the factors influencing their decision to pursue sales education within a business major. The findings indicate that the choice of sales education is driven by students’ appreciation for creativity and people skills and their own interests and abilities, but the students’ school advisors (either college or high school) have significant influence as well. In today’s data-driven world, sales jobs depend on the use of analytical and intensively quantitative skills, yet our results indicate that sales students lack appreciation and enjoyment of the quantitative aspects of their major and potential career path. © The Author(s) 2014.","business education; marketing education; quantitative skills; sales education; student perceptions of sales",""

By following this standard format, where discussion of qualitative research methods is usually limited to focus groups and depth interviews, academics are potentially penalizing students and their future employers by providing them with a restricted set of abilities. Are we producing a generation of future marketing managers who rather than embracing the possibilities for deep understanding will instead limit themselves to the mainstream? In the article the authors consider the value and viability of introducing ethnographic techniques into the marketing research curriculum to complement existing qualitative methods and provide four examples to demonstrate this. The authors do not negate the need for marketing courses to continue to teach students the ""basics"" of marketing research but rather challenge the idea that this archetype provides all the necessary skills.

Results indicate that women evaluate sales ethics scenarios as less ethical than males and that varying positions on these ethical frameworks partially explain the divergence. Results also imply that today's sales educators should primarily emphasize moral idealism when teaching sales ethics. Ethical codes and situation-based frameworks can aid this effort. When teaching relativistic individuals, educators can supplement idealistic methods via the use of cognitive moral development frameworks. © The Author(s) 2012.","Ethical pedagogy; Gender ethical evaluations; Moral idealism/relativism; Personal Selling Ethics Scale; Sales scenarios",""

Research regarding the relationship between specific cultural measures and academic honesty is sparse in the context of marketing and business programs in higher education. This study surveys marketing and business college students from 13 different countries about their perceptions of questionable behaviors concerning academic honesty and measures Hofstede's commonly studied cultural dimension of individualism/collectivism as a direct test of the cultural hypotheses presented. As predicted, collectivist business students are more tolerant than individualist business students concerning questionable academic behaviors that are unilateral (e.g., copying material/papers from the Internet or looking at another student's exam without the knowledge of the other student), collaborative (e.g., getting exam questions/answers from others or free riding in a group), and delaying (e.g., requesting due date/exam date delays or assignment extensions with false information). In alignment with the theory of reasoned action, results also show that a positive attitude about the value of teamwork (relative to individual work) mediates the effect between collectivism and questionable academic behaviors that are collaborative.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the most prolific scholars may not always be the most eminent. Taking a personal brand-building perspective, this study examines a wide range of factors that may influence the attainment of scholarly eminence in the marketing discipline. Using a sample of 297 marketing academicians, this study finds that although a raw volume of publications influences eminence, publishing top-tier publications is even more significant. Perhaps most interestingly, this work highlights several different professional paths that can lead to scholarly eminence, including a tradeoff between publishing sole-authored pieces and ""A""-level volume, and the eminence-enhancing effects of various professional activities.

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that attitude strength should moderate the influence of attitudes on normative beliefs. Normative beliefs, in turn, are posited to mediate the influence of the Attitude × Attitude Strength interaction on student self-identity as a critical thinker. Thus, students with strong and positive attitudes regarding critical thinking will have strong normative beliefs associated with the skill, and these beliefs, in turn, will affect self-identity as a critical thinker. Results, based on a sample of students participating in critical thinking-oriented classes, support these hypotheses.

This study empirically explores whether an understanding of culturally anchored values provides a better customer segmentation measure to predict learning style preferences than existing domestic and international student measures. Three questions are empirically addressed: Do business students' culturally anchored values explain variation in learning style preferences? Do students' culturally anchored values predict a preference for a more student- or teacher-driven learning environment? and Can an understanding of culturally anchored values provide a better customer segmentation variable to identify learning style preferences than the more commonly used categories of domestic and international? This study found that culturally anchored values provided stronger predictors of learning style preferences than domestic and international student categorizations.

Recognizing the challenges of developing and running complex student projects, the authors extend theory to propose that the experience of reciprocal interdependence between team members enhances student integration learning and that reciprocal interdependence can be decoupled from project complexity. At the individual level, reciprocal interdependence is an interpersonal experience that can develop even in noncomplex tasks. Integration learning can therefore occur even in unrealistic, abstract, short-run student team project assignments. This matters because it gives educators additional options for structuring student project team assignments to generate the desired learning outcomes.

Recent literature encourages researchers to test multivariate models of Teaching Effectiveness. Seven main constructs known to influence Teaching Effectiveness have been variously selected for inclusion in previous literature; however, previous multivariate studies have examined only a subset of these constructs, with the majority considering four or fewer constructs. The comprehensive model of Teaching Effectiveness developed in this study examines the main and mediated influence of all seven constructs on Teaching Effectiveness. Data have been collected from undergraduate marketing students. Three constructs (Clear Communication, Delivery Dynamism, and Assessment Fairness) contribute directly to Teaching Effectiveness. Real-World Knowledge, Rapport, Subject Organization, and Subject Difficulty contribute indirectly to Teaching Effectiveness. Consistent with previous research, these findings highlight the importance of personal attributes (communication, delivery, real-world knowledge, and rapport) on Teaching Effectiveness. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Marketing education; Structural equation modeling; Teaching Effectiveness",""

This article explores one such dynamic at both intra- and intergroup levels. Using data generated from multiple sources, it was identified that students who are actively contributing to group processes have difficulty distinguishing between students, and indeed groups, that are socially loafing and those that are genuinely struggling with the material. As a consequence, the struggling students are subject to incidences of socially destructive behaviors, critically harming their ability to develop. This has the potential to harm not only the individual struggling student and their group but also burden the other members of the class with a class member that will never be able to meaningfully contribute. Using social interdependence theory, a framework is proposed to explain how this confusion among contributing students arises. Recommendations are made regarding how to design curriculum so as to minimize the incidence of this phenomenon as well as intervention strategies to mitigate its effect should it present. © The Author(s) 2011.","loafing; project; reflexive; social; struggling",""

The recurring emphases on subcategories such as empathy, communication and personal style, approachability, and accessibility underscore the need for marketing educators to maintain personal interactions with students. The insights provided are purposeful because the predominant themes, and certainly the level of emphasis of each, may be used to improve the education process. © 2843360, Sage Publications.

Challenges are discussed in recognizing the fragility of curiosity through an understanding of the factors that suppress it. Drawing on existing research in education, psychology, and marketing, a synthesized pedagogical reversal is suggested-instead of pursuing learning in the form of students' acquisition of knowledge, the focus should be on students' exploration and appropriation of knowledge and marketing knowledge through their curiosity and thinking. The pedagogical differences are discussed in terms of expectations, measures of success, and what students leave with upon completion. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Curiosity; Marketing education; Pedagogy; Questioning; Thinking",""

The effect has been explained as a matter of competency. If true, then students who do not know what they do not know are put in a double bind. They do not have the cognitive ability to recognize their own level of skills and consequently are unaware of any need to change or develop those skills. Another explanation of the effect suggests that students are generally aware of their performance but consistently overestimate their abilities in a systematic fashion. This study examines these two hypotheses and finds no evidence that the overestimation was due to lack of cognitive competence.

The process includes faculty commitment, consensus, collaboration, and compromise; stake-holder input; points of distinction; unifying themes; intended learning outcomes; instructional design; approval; a transition plan; launch; and evaluation and continuous improvement. The authors believe that departments of any size can implement a similar redesign process to develop a curriculum that is strategically consistent with the department's core competencies and focused on learning outcomes that are fundamental to any marketing career. © 2007 Sage Publications.","College and university; Curriculum; Curriculum change; Educator; Marketing",""

This research introduces an individual difference variable found in the business environment that has not been examined in a classroom context. The lone wolf appears to play a role in how teams function and perform. Described by practitioners and academics, the lone wolf is identified by a preference to work alone, a dislike of group process and the ideas of others, and a proclivity to see others as less capable and effective. This study finds the lone wolf phenomenon among marketing students working in teams through self-ratings and the assessments of team members. Furthermore, the inclusion of lone wolves on teams is found to have a negative impact on student team performance. Implications of these findings and ideas for managing the team process when lone wolves are present are considered. © 2005 Sage Publications.","Classroom management; Group dynamics; Student teams; Team member differences",""

The authors examine these hypotheses with publication data from a set of marketing journals during 1991-2000.

Multidimensional scaling analysis suggests that the underlying structure of these perceptions can be described by the labels: enjoyable, challenging, and real world. Internships, class discussion, and case analyses were seen by students as the learning activities that most contribute to their learning.

And, of particular concern to marketing educators, the current research finds that marketing majors cheat significantly more than their peers in other business disciplines. The research results also indicate that students are much more likely to cheat in situations in which friends (versus mere acquaintances) are involved. The study identifies a robust false consensus effect in which the respondents significantly overestimate the degree to which others cheat.

This article discusses the ramifications of metacognition and transfer and offers methods through which they can become a standard part of marketing educational pedagogy.

The aim was to determine if marketing attracts individuals who have a greater predisposition to unethical behaviors given that marketing is often reported as the most unethical of all business activities. The Defining Issues Test (DIT) was used to measure MRA. Although frequently used to measure the MRA of undergraduate students, the DIT has not been used within the marketing domain. The findings indicate that marketing students do not exhibit a lower level of MRA than other business disciplines. Marketing students are no less ethical in their thinking than those pursuing other business careers. The perception of unethical behavior is more likely to be a product of the visible nature of marketing activities to consumers. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Defining Issues Test; Ethics education; Marketing education; Marketing students; Moral reasoning ability",""

Academics reflect this as (1) establishing advertising objectives, (2) determining tasks to achieve specified objectives, (3) determining costs for each of these tasks, and (4) totaling the costs. The authors maintain that the implementation of the objective and task approach requires the use of methods of both prioritizing alternative expenditures and setting a cutoff point. These points are often neglected by academics, including textbook writers, when defining the approach.

Project-based learning activities on the Internet's World Wide Web can be used to emphasize the importance of intelligence to marketing decisions, introduce students to intelligence processes and content issues, and differentiate legitimate activities from those that are not. © 2000, Sage Publications.

By helping students develop a study routine based on rehearsal, chunking, and elaboration of course material, both memory and comprehension are improved. In two exploratory studies, students using the proposed method received higher test scores than those using a more conventional approach. This method is recommended for students who may not already have developed sound study skills or for those who may want to improve their knowledge of the subject as well as their grades. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Despite the rapid advance of cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet and the World Wide Web into higher education, this imperative still remains. The present study investigates marketing students’ perceptions of different modes of tutorial that supplements rather than replaces traditional face-to-face lectures. The three alternative modes investigated were a face-to-face approach and two Web-based approaches— one asynchronous (bulletin boards) and one synchronous (chat rooms). Findings indicate that face-to-face tutorials are most highly rated in terms of the effectiveness of the learning environment and several other criteria.

When a student selects marketing as a major, he or she is choosing not just to receive the attributes and benefits of the major but also to become something through a process of role-identity development. The more effectively this identification process takes place, the better the outcomes for the student and, potentially, for marketing educators. This article identifies and empirically demonstrates variables that marketing educators can influence to facilitate the role-identity development process. As marketing educators work to attract more and better undergraduate students to marketing, it may be time to pay greater attention to enhancing the identification process that links students with marketing. © 2002, Sage Publications.

"Determinants of Student Evaluations of Global Measures of Instructor and Course Value","2000","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84993724877&doi=10.1177%2f0273475300222005&partnerID=40&md5=49c8c8bd6187992815936c0ccedd1108","Using structural equation modeling (LISREL) with a sample of business students, this study addresses important issues with respect to student evaluations. After reviewing past research and using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis suggests the existence of five latent variables in student evaluations: organization, workload/difficulty, expected/fairness of grading, instructor liking/concern, and perceived learning. Next, adding structural paths, these variables are used to model the formation of student evaluations. The models developed demonstrate that student evaluations may lack discriminant validity, the extent to which a measure does not correlate with other constructs it is not supposed to measure (e.g., expected/fairness of grading does have a large impact on ratings of teaching ability). Moreover, the use of student evaluations is compounded by the common usage of global measures in student evaluation practice. Here, the use of overall course value and instructor rating are contrasted. The results are disparate, raising questions about the use of summative measures (i.e., of what should they be composed, if used at all). © 2000, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.","",""

The need is real to develop ways to bring integrated, cross-functional insights into the classroom. To that end, various ways have been presented to integrate business courses. Team teaching using faculty from different functional areas and combining two or more functional areas to cover relevant topics are two ways to accomplish the task. This article focuses on a third approach to integration. By using principles of market segmentation, the authors have developed a professional services marketing course that focuses on the specific needs of various non-marketing audiences. Their objective was to develop a framework for an integrative course that would provide non-majors with an understanding of what marketing of professional services requires and an appreciation of its value in the creation of new business opportunities. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Expertise in the fields of marketing, management, advertising, business history, logistics, social history, anthropology, consumer economics, and economics provided interesting and diverse approaches to the study of marketing history. Papers were presented in the following categories: (1) history of marketing thought, (2) historical methods and sources, (3) macromarketing history, and (4) history of marketing practice in terms of promotion, channels, and methods. Marketing history continues to attract scholars interested in marketing practices, concepts, and methods employed prior to coinage of the term “marketing“ as well as those who wish to apply historical techniques to later marketing developments. As a discipline marketing has a long and rich history of experience awaiting additional scholarly efforts.

External sources such as licensing, joint development programs, subcontracting, and acquisitions or mergers are also neglected by these authors in product life cycle discussions. Since business managers routinely consider external sources for product development and improvement programs, these textual presentations do not accurately reflect marketing practice. We argue that these authors should consider the use of external sources in their presentations of product strategy development and suggest how this might be accomplished. In the long run, more consideration of external sourcing at all levels of marketing curricula will alleviate some of the problems students have in learning these concepts, contribute to more marketing involvement in external sourcing strategies, and help internationalize the marketing educational process. © 1986, Sage Publications.

"Matching the marketing curriculum to market needs","1979","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868577206&doi=10.1177%2f027347537900100103&partnerID=40&md5=13bb8c311a3f908c5c582a17781358c3","There is a strong need for marketing educators to carefully identify their markets and then make certain that their pro duct offering matches up well with market needs. One useful approach is to define the student as an intermediate market who buys and processes for resale, and the employer as the end market or final customer. To match the product offering to the expressed needs of these markets indicates the need for a change in curriculum design to switch the emphasis from sub ject matter acquisition to managerial skills development. The managerial skills desired by employers who hire our Business School graduates include written and verbal communicating, problem solving and decision making, project planning and im plementing, interpersonal competence, and others. Our course offerings should be so designed that the development of these skills becomes the primary product or objective and subject- matter mastery becomes the by-product. © 1979, Sage Publications.

The purpose of this article is to describe some of the discontinuities that are likely to occur as a result of changes in the preparation of today's marketing students and to suggest some practical ways business organizations can prepare for these changes. © 1981, Sage Publications.

The authors cite specific instructor strategies for encouraging adequate preparation before class both by individuals and study groups. Also, negative aspects of study group such as the ‘group parasite syndrome’ are presented, as well as methods of control. Similarly, desirable and undesirable forms of post-class behavior are identified. Practical techniques are presented for encouraging students to think about a case after class discussion has ended. The paper concludes with a discussion of “case ethics” and methods of encouraging desirable behavior. © 1980, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.","",""

This paper reports student evaluations of a CAI program. Student users held more positive attitudes toward CAI as an educational tool. Non-users who had access to, but did not use the CAI program, perceived the computer- assisted, self-instructional program as difficult to use. The main problems were“finding time to use terminals”and“finding terminals available for use.”Benefits were: review opportunities, help in studying for examinations, and the immediate feedback. These findings suggest that CAI is a viable learning device in the introductory mar keting course. © 1979, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.","",""

Practitioners and students agreed on the relative importance of mar keting topics. Most important topics were marketing strategy, advertising, buyer behavior, and the marketing concept; least important topics were industrial marketing, international marketing, nonbusiness and service marketing, and physical distribution. © 1982, Sage Publications.

The elasticities of these four decision variables change in each time period, as they might during a “typical” life cycle.

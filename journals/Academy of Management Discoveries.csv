EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPLEXITY AND FIRM PERFORMANCE,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168447611&doi=10.5465%2famd.2022.0056&partnerID=40&md5=513f409dbd3b5b8ed65647b9cc66d746,"How With unknown consequences, the compensation complexity of executives has been rising. We define and measure executive compensation complexity and relate it to accounting; market; and environmental, social, and governance metrics of firm performance. Chief executive officer (CEO) compensation complexity negatively affects all three types of firm performance. We explore theoretical explanations for this relationship and find that cognitively complex CEOs can better deal with complex contracts. The negative complexity effects disappear if firms use only financial goals. Complexity is more harmful in unstable and munificent industries. Complexity also mitigates the negative effect of CEO tenure on long-term performance. In addition, firm performance suffers if the top management team members have heterogeneously complex contracts. Robustness checks support these findings. We conclude that the trend of adding more metrics to executive compensation contracts is not a generally preferable solution to the new and more intense agency problems that firms encounter. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
FOOD AND FAT AT WORK: EIGHTY-THREE MOMENTS FROM A BINGE EATER’S PROFESSIONAL LIFE,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197604995&doi=10.5465%2famd.2022.0239&partnerID=40&md5=63221747c6defbfdfea8b60081e39eb3,"This paper explores binge eating disorder at work. Through autoethnography, experiences and documentation from the first decade of the author’s career (2014–2023) are culled in an effort to examine and convey how food and body challenges related to binge eating disorder may interact with various aspects of working life, such as socializing, collaborating, mentoring, dressing, eating, traveling, attending meetings and conferences, and carrying out basic professional responsibilities. The story has marks of privilege: the job is white-collar and cushy, the demographics and socioeconomics are largely advantaged. The hope is that such a perspective may nonetheless advance our understanding, representation, and discussion of food and body struggles at work. Examining how binge eating disorder may be battled, endured, succumbed to, managed, feared, hidden, shared, ignored, coped with, detested, obsessed over, and despaired of brings forth how individuals may live and work with multiple bodies at once—where each body has its own profile of behaviors and experiences, each body’s comings and goings are not wholly predictable, and most bodies are unwanted yet resistant to efforts to discard them. The paper concludes by considering implications of this body multiplicity for our understanding of identity, purposive action, motivation, masculinity, and empathy. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
GLOBAL CAREERS AND COMPENSATION: FROM INITIAL PENALTIES TO A “SUPERGLOBAL” PREMIUM,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190940444&doi=10.5465%2famd.2022.0028&partnerID=40&md5=c37c56ff313dfa44514799757589e358,"This paper examines the relationship between international mobility and financial compensation for knowledge workers pursuing business careers. While some theoretical arguments suggest that international mobility may lead to higher pay, others suggest that it may lead to performance problems and lack of recognition, which could reduce financial rewards. Empirical research on the topic is limited, with cross-sectional data providing little insight into the relationship between international mobility and compensation over time. Our study overcomes this challenge by using a panel data set on the career histories of 1,322 MBA graduates. The results reveal a curvilinear relationship between international mobility and compensation over time. Making one or two international moves can have substantial negative effects on pay. However, further moves are associated with pay growth, and there is some evidence that those who move countries multiple times (“superglobals”) obtain substantially higher pay. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on international mobility and business careers. © 2024, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,
"SO, WHAT DO YOU DO? EXPLORING IDENTITY CLAIMING BY ENTREPRENEURS",2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185289003&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0149&partnerID=40&md5=a05ebf16ea402d73cf76039cb4aed9b7,"The way we respond to the casual question “What do you do for a living?” involves making claims about work-related identity. As individuals often have multiple identities, including at work, deciding which identities to claim over others may not be straightforward. We explored how 29 entrepreneurs across Canada, the United States, and Australia respond to this question. Contrary to what would be predicted from prior research, these informants largely resisted claiming the label of “entrepreneur” in informal social interactions. Instead, informants claimed labels based either on roles they held or occupations in which they currently or previously worked. Several also claimed labels that were “self-effacing,” and downplayed their role in their organization. In exploring the rationale for these claiming decisions, we found that the broader social context— including cultural meanings of being an entrepreneur and conversational norms— played a key role in determining individual identity claiming. We also identified two motives underlying these contextual factors: the need to be comprehensible and the need to avoid creating distance between themselves and their interaction partner. We discuss the implications of these findings for the research on both identity claiming and entrepreneurship. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

BETTER TOGETHER: MEMBER PROACTIVITY IS BETTER FOR TEAM PERFORMANCE WHEN ALIGNED WITH CONSCIENTIOUSNESS,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197656851&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0208&partnerID=40&md5=7ba0fa0eaf74dc6a85f92e8ffc808b18,"Proactivity—the tendency to create change in the work environment—typically improves team performance. This relationship is far from perfect, however. We explore inconsistencies in team proactivity literature to answer an important question: When is member proactivity beneficial or dysfunctional for teams? First, we consider the composition of member proactivity at the team level and whether a simple “more is better” heuristic neglects a more complex relationship linking member proactivity to team coordination and performance. Second, we explore whether proactivity is better when aligned with another individual difference focused on the propensity to plan and coordinate with others (i.e., conscientiousness). In two studies, we compare traditional additive and configurational compositional approaches to these two attributes with a new attribute alignment approach, allowing us to examine the co-occurrence of proactivity and conscientiousness within some team members relative to others. First, we find that team member proactivity–conscientiousness (P–C) alignment predicts the performance of MBA consulting teams better than the other team composition models we consider. Then, we replicate this finding in a laboratory simulation, finding that it occurs because P–C alignment improves team coordination. Our results demonstrate that member proactivity is most effective for teams when aligned with conscientiousness. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
GUIDEPOST EXPLORATORY RESEARCH ON ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVISATION: ROADS TRAVELED AND THE ROAD AHEAD,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197589095&doi=10.5465%2famd.2024.0106&partnerID=40&md5=2dafed7312dd8ac77829692d6f2963ce,"Before the 1990s, the phenomenon of organizational improvisation (OI) as a distinct process was poorly understood and undertheorized in the organization theory, management, and strategy literatures, in spite of its pervasive occurrence in practice and its impressionistic mentions in interesting work. As editors of the recent Routledge Companion to Organizational Improvisation, we believe that ongoing phenomenon-focused work that builds on granular data and unexpected discoveries represents a crucial ongoing frontier for OI research. In this Guidepost, we illustrate the crucial role of phenomenon-focused research activities in the early exploration and ongoing work to understand OI, and flag four especially promising areas for ongoing discoveries: premises, practical skills, outcomes, and micro-processes. For each, we highlight specific issues where new exploratory work – drawing on quantitative and qualitative data—can offer a springboard to new, impactful understanding and action. This essay is a companion to Karl Weick’s recent Guidepost where he reflects on the 30th anniversary of his 1993 ASQ Mann Gulch Disaster paper, which played a key role in legitimizing deeper scholarly attention to OI. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
"NOW, WOMEN DO ASK: A CALL TO UPDATE BELIEFS ABOUT THE GENDER PAY GAP",2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189154715&doi=10.5465%2famd.2022.0021&partnerID=40&md5=81b307d8d291f6d299558689ad7e3b31,"For over two decades, gender differences in the propensity to negotiate have been thought to explain the gender pay gap. We ask whether a “women don’t ask” pattern holds today among working adults. We compare estimates of gender differences in negotiation propensity (Study 1) with actual patterns from master’s in business administration students (n 5 1,435) and alumni (n 5 1,939) from a top U.S. business school (Studies 2A and 2B). Contrary to lay beliefs, women report negotiating their salaries more (not less) often than men. We then reanalyze meta-analytic data on self-reported initiation of salary negotiations to reconcile our findings with prior work (Study 2C). While men reported higher negotiation propensity than women prior to the 21st century, the gender difference has grown neutral and then reversed since then. Negotiation propensity rose across time for both men and women, although to differing degrees. Finally, we explore the consequences of the now-outdated belief that “women don’t ask,” finding that it increases gender stereotyping, even on dimensions unrelated to negotiation, and it is associated with both greater system justification and weaker support for legislation addressing pay equity (Studies 3 and 4). Our research calls for an updating of beliefs about gender and the propensity to negotiate for pay. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
REVALUING ORDINARY MOMENTS: DISRUPTING GENDERED POSITIVE SELF-CONCEPTS THROUGH A NARRATIVE FEEDBACK INTERVENTION,2024,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191027250&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0021&partnerID=40&md5=0a4c6ad6a16687252c03a2fc10f69172,"How do people craft a positive self-concept? How does the content of positive self-concepts change in response to feedback? Our research seeks to answer these questions by analyzing data gathered from two different samples before and after a positive-feedback intervention. Collectively, our findings identify three narrative themes that people use to articulate how they add value to their workplace and communities: Mobi-lizing, Connecting, and Task Engaging. Further, we found that while our participants’ ini-tial positive self-concepts showed gendered patterns, these patterns were largely diminished after the positive-feedback intervention. In addition, after the intervention, the content of participants’ positive self-concepts were broadened and enriched. In post hoc analyses we explored possible mechanisms underlying these patterns of change. We then theorize that noncomparative, positive narrative feedback from significant others across multiple domains provides people with the opportunity to revalue ordinary actions and build a more integrated understanding of their value. We discuss the implications of these findings on strength-based research, positive identities, and gender identity construction. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Drawing on repeated interviews with a sample of 30 global professionals before and after the start of the pandemic, we explored how global professionals’ prior experiences and specific characteristics of the pandemic influenced their interpretations of and responses to the disruption. We discovered three response pathways. First, participants who recounted tensions in how they related to distant others at work before the pandemic viewed the globally shared nature of the disruption as an opportunity to alleviate these tensions by plugging in to bond with others. Second, respondents who had experienced ambivalence regarding their work interpreted the pandemic-induced travel restrictions as an opportunity to ease the ambivalence by pondering over their work identity. Third, participants who experienced discrepancies between their local self and their mobile aspirational self prepandemic interpreted the pandemic and the associated travel bans as a threat to their aspirations and momentarily paused their identity work during the pandemic, in keeping with the event’s temporariness. Through our discoveries, we develop a process model of how individuals address their prior identity tensions following major work disruptions, and we advance the identity and global mobility literatures. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

An improvised escape fire intended to create a safe area saved only one life. This suggests that the success of an improvisation depends on the relationship between wariness and understanding. That relationship, conceptualized as a “surface of apprehension,” is shaped by at least four contingencies: one’s raw experience, elements that are analyzed out of flux, the personal bearing of what is at hand, and the words selected to render this finitude sensible. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,
"Do boards and the media recognize quality? An assessment of ceo contextual quality using pay, dismissal, awards, and linguistics",2023,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151311735&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0042&partnerID=40&md5=d05863aab95ef162f20e8ebfae4b35f8,"A critical issue in corporate governance is identifying, rewarding, and retaining highquality CEOs. But, over time, do evaluators accurately assess a CEO’s contextual quality? Further, which signals may be used to discern this quality? Through two studies, this paper seeks to address these long-standing questions. In Study 1, we explore how boards compensate and dismiss CEOs and the media grants awards over time based on contextual quality. We then discover that the language spoken by high- and low-quality CEOs on earnings calls differs in the absence of clear performance signals. In Study 2, we broaden this analysis and apply a deep learning-based natural language processing model to show that quality corresponds with the content of CEOs’ speech to investors. Specifically, we show that contextual quality corresponds with a CEO’s “unscripted novelty,” which refers to their tendency to discuss new topics during the unscripted portion of earnings calls. We further show that unscripted novelty leads to positive stock market reactions. Taken together, these discoveries offer insights for scholars and practitioners into the accuracy of quality assessments and distinctive patterns underlying high- and low-quality CEOs’ speech. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Does their method of voting matter? We ran an experiment in which 93 groups simulated counterterrorism pursuit teams and had to determine which of three suspects represented the greatest threat. Groups that used “multi-voting” in their unofficial votes—whereby members had multiple votes to distribute across options—were 50% more likely to choose the correct suspect than groups that used plurality or ranked-choice voting. This was because the members of the multi-voting groups were more likely to identify the correct suspect even before their team discussion. In this article, we look at various voting methods used for presidential elections, Hugo Award winners, and American Idol contestants. We show how different voting methods can lead to entirely different results and provide initial evidence that multi-voting may be a superior method for group decision-making. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,
RADICAL AND SWIFT ADAPTIVE ORGANIZING IN RESPONSE TO UNEXPECTED EVENTS: MILITARY RELIEF OPERATIONS AFTER HURRICANE DORIAN,2023,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180453891&doi=10.5465%2famd.2020.0213&partnerID=40&md5=3d7dc8b3872535206facb07158a84b66,"The relief operations by a military task force in response to Hurricane Dorian presented an empirical puzzle. The task force adapted in a radical and swift way after arrival in the disaster-struck area. Within just a few days, it hardly resembled the organization that had set out to provide relief. The nature and speed of this adaptation could not be explained by the existing literature. Thus, I pose the question: “How does radical and swift adaptive organizing in response to unexpected events unfold?” The study builds on 31 interviews and rich visual data, consisting of 711 photographs and 12 videos, to shed more light on this process. The main discovery in this paper is that frontline personnel swiftly deconstructed and reconstructed key elements of the organizational structure, producing radical changes in authority, plans, safety standards, routines, and ties. The interim organizational response structure that emerged from this process enabled successful relief operations. The paper contributes to the coordination literature and research on temporary organizations. It also highlights the insights that visual data can provide into processes unfolding in extreme contexts. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We address this issue by analyzing how chance events and political dynamics coproduce strategic change. We study the history of the Nokia Corporation between 1986 and 2015, focusing on the event structures that led to the divestment of core businesses on two separate occasions. Our findings show how chance events and resulting political dynamics generate periods of collective indeterminacy where multiple, competing strategic scenarios become apparent. These emerge either directly from chance events or indirectly from political dynamics as coalitions translate chance events into their preferred scenarios. The search for a new strategic direction then ensues through the emergence and elimination of alternative scenarios until an acceptable scenario is converged upon, ending the period of collective indeterminacy. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Little is known, however, about how individuals spend their time or how their experiences impact them after they return to work. Drawing on narrative interviews with 50 diverse professionals, we discover that sabbaticals combine “building blocks”2 distinct periods dedicated to recover, explore, or practice2 into three typical trajectories: Working holidays (alternating recovery and practice), free dives (alternating recovery and exploration), and quests (unfolding from recovery to exploration to practice). While participants returned from all sabbaticals feeling affirmed in their own voice, periods of exploration and practice were associated with the extent to which sabbaticals fundamentally changed their self-narrative and disrupted the trajectory of their working lives. Those on working holidays tended to return to their former lives (though with a greater confidence and need for balance), while free divers pursued better fitting but similar work (e.g., a change in position or employer), and questers were most likely to make drastic career changes. Our model extends the breaks literature and authenticity scholarship, and offers insights to those considering a sabbatical. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

We examine here consumers called “cosmopolitans” (individuals who think beyond a single geographical place) and those called “omnivores” (individuals who show a taste for variety in genres). We study this difference between audience members in exploratory analyses of dining, looking at consumption trajectories of specific diners from their reviews of restaurants, posted in a popular online platform. From this open-ended analysis, we discover that many omnivores are not cosmopolitans and vice versa, despite much theory suggesting otherwise. In further empirical analyses, we study a large sample of online restaurant reviews, allowing us to follow the dining behavior and attitudes of over 380,000 individuals from 2005 to 2019. We find that the effects of cosmopolitanism depend on being an omnivore; we also find both cosmopolitans and omnivores make authenticity attributions more frequently than other reviewers. In looking at neighborhoods and types of restaurants visited, we find that diversity (of both the organizations visited and the demography of neighborhoods visited) heightens a diner’s sensitivity to authenticity, suggesting intentional diversity-seeking behavior. These findings suggest avenues for future theory and empirical research. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
NETWORK LEADERSHIP AND TEAM CREATIVITY: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF NEW YORK CITY JAZZ BANDS,2023,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162685501&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0092&partnerID=40&md5=d7afca28f9388e30e67f56632fd2b60e,"Jazz bands exemplify the creative economy of teams engaged in flexible and precarious work. Theory is conflicted concerning how leadership of such audience-facing organizations affects outcomes. For the 346 New York City jazz bands active in 2010, we explored how formal and network leadership related to music creativity and popularity, as well as to band longevity through the year 2021. Formal leadership may direct band members toward joint creative outcomes. Or such leadership may harm the free-flowing energy that fuels creative performance. Network leaders engage in brokering connections across the network of jazz musicians; or building status through connections to central people. The network in this case consisted of ties between people who had overlapping band memberships. We found that formal leadership negated band creativity but made no difference to band popularity or longevity. Network leadership, defined as status, facilitated both creativity and popularity, whereas brokerage had no discernible effects. Interestingly, creative bands were less likely to endure. In the creative industries, formalized hierarchy may be less important for a team’s creative output than representation in the external market for talent and aesthetic judgment that well-connected network leaders bring. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Prior research has shown mixed evidence about the influence of pay disper-sion, and most studies have conceptualized and measured pay dispersion based on its variance and range. I seek to examine whether the effects of pay dispersion on firm performance change when pay skewness—the lopsidedness of pay distribution—is taken into account. Consequently, I explore the following questions: (a) What is the main effect of pay skewness on firm performance? (b) What is the joint effect of pay dispersion and pay skewness on firm performance? Based on the results of longitudinal analyses using five-wave panel data, my results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between pay skewness and firm performance. More impor-tantly, the drawbacks of pay dispersion are mitigated when the pay distribution is left-skewed (i.e., low pay skewness; more winners), and the drawbacks of pay dispersion are exacerbated when the pay distribution is right-skewed (i.e., high pay skew-ness; more losers). © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Indeed, some evidence indicates that using humor in presentations may even be detrimental to women, hindering their perceived competence and status. Yet, given that women continue to be underrepresented in high-status positions, less is known about whether humor can benefit high-status women under certain circumstances. We explore the use of humor in Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) Talks, in which speakers from a variety of domains are given a platform to share their expertise with a global audience—often using humor to get their message across. Challenging the gender stereotype, our analysis of 2,407 TED Talks reveals that using humor increases influence, especially for female speakers. We investigate multiple indicators of influence, including number of views, how inspiring the talk is, and the perceived leadership qualities of the speaker. A deeper analysis of highly influential talks on social science topics (92 talks) reveals that the benefits of using humor stem from perceptions of speakers’ warmth and competence but not from the type of humor used. These findings are consistent with research showing that women are rewarded when they violate agentic stereotypes related to competence. Our discovery underlines the power of humor as a means to extend one’s influence and deliver a successful presentation in the digital age, especially for women. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

To find an answer, one must distinguish the genuine skills and experience of the founding team—that is, actual expertise—from how the founding team presents itself, which we label expertise signaling. We analyze data on 4,190 new ventures drawn from Crunchbase and self-styled profiles that the founders of these companies posted on LinkedIn. In terms of both liquidity events and amount of capital raised, we found that expertise signaling by startup founders played a significant role in company success. To be sure, when predicting a liquidity event, actual expertise was still the strongest predictor. However, when it came to raising funds we were sur-prised to discover that founders’ expertise signaling was actually a more powerful predictor than their actual background and experience. Our findings have important practical implications and highlight the need for better theories of the role of the founding team in entrepreneurship and venture financing. © 2023, Academy of Management.

STAYING APART TO WORK BETTER TOGETHER: TEAM STRUCTURE IN CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS,2023,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174149123&doi=10.5465%2famd.2020.0238&partnerID=40&md5=1b989660dcfbbeb60239c3674599c1e5,"Organizations often leverage cross-functional teams to create innovative solutions and products, yet collaboration across functional boundaries is inherently challenging. Research on small teams has largely suggested that, to facilitate team creative outcomes, subgroups should integrate across functional boundaries by increasing communication. In contrast, research on larger cross-functional teams (e.g., multiteam systems) has suggested that too much communication across knowledge domains can worsen team out-comes. Using a quasi-experimental design, we investigate the influence of these two different team structures on cross-functional team communication and subsequent innovation outcomes. Contrary to the prevailing recommendation for an integrated team structure in small teams, results illustrate that integrating teams, and the resultant extensive cross-functional communication, does not enhance team innovation outcomes. Rather, teams with greater functional subgroup differentiation, though exhibiting relatively less cross-functional communication, exhibit greater cross-functional synthesis. These results suggest important implications for managers of cross-functional knowledge integration work, as well as the future study of cross-functional teamwork of all sizes. © Academy of Management.

HOW DO IMMIGRANT FAMILY BUSINESSES ACHIEVE GLOBAL EXPANSION?

Yet, little is known about how embeddedness evolves from family to global and how it helps IFBs to establish themselves in a host country, survive the related challenges, and thrive in the international market. By drawing on the lived experience of 25 highly successful family business entrepreneurs in Australia, we develop an integrated process model and identify a four-phase chronology of IFBs’ success toward global expansion: arriving, establishing, expanding, and thriving. Further, this model links these transitory phases to the IFBs’ embeddedness that evolves from family to local, host country, and global. Our findings suggest that while family embeddedness is critical over time, its scope is limited as the IFBs form new, more extensive networks toward the global market. IFBs act as boundary spanners, blending local and international resources to create value. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings are shared in the concluding section. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

At present, we lack a clear understanding of how self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) living in these countries interpret and respond to such initiatives. The United Kingdom’s 2016 “Brexit” referendum decision to leave the European Union presents an example of one such initiative potentially impacting the mobility, U.K. identification, and future aspirations of European SIEs living in the United Kingdom. We draw on 41 in-depth interviews with SIEs from 18 European countries who had voluntarily chosen to relocate to the United Kingdom, and analyze how they interpreted the Brexit vote, as well as its impact on their identities and migration plans. We identify four types of SIEs based on their perceived mobility and identification with the United Kingdom prior to the Brexit referendum, each of which was associated with a distinct reaction pattern related to the outcome of the referendum. Our findings have implications for the study of SIEs, as well as for talent managers charged with their retention.

In highly regulated high-income countries, multiple actors are involved in managing refugee employment and offer support to overcome its various barriers. Our research breaks new ground by focusing on the dynamics between these actors. We conducted 80 interviews with refugees, employers, governments, employer associations, refugee support organizations, and public employment services in three Western European countries. We conceive of the field as a refugee employment ecosystem in which complementarity is the key mechanism that aligns the various actors’ activities to achieve the goal of refugee employment. Complementarity means that actors not only fulfill their different roles but also step in, fill gaps, and add to others’ activities. Three microfoundations undergird this complementarity: individuals’ motives, respon-siveness, and perseverance. By showing how refugee employment ecosystems are inhab-ited and sustained by individuals whose activities go beyond their assigned actor roles, we contribute to theory development in research on refugee employment and help to humanize theorizing about ecosystems at large. We also offer practical guidance on how to increase the resilience of refugee employment ecosystems. © Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

While evidence indicates that overseas doctors have less positive career outcomes that may result in pay gaps in comparison to their U.K.-trained counterparts, extant theoretical explanations have been slow to consider the crucial role of workplace practices and the degree to which pay gaps differ between multiple identity sub-groups. Adopting an intercategorical approach to analyze statistical survey data from 5,753 NHS doctors, we examine how pay gaps stem from career barriers and management support in male and female international medical graduate, European Economic Area, and U.K. doctors. Our findings provide insights into intersectional variations in career barriers and pay gaps for skilled medical migrants which point to penalties for migrants, especially migrant ethnicized women. Based on our findings, we extend theoretical explanations of pay gaps by conceptualizing themas a complex multi-layered concept that embraces workplace practices as well as intersecting demographic identities. We also contribute to theory on skilled migration by highlighting the counterintuitive shape of management support on migrants’ careers and by diversifying extant understandings of constraint and enablement in migrant careers. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

In crossing city boundaries, migrants interact andlearn from host city artifacts; thus, we illustrate the facilitating and constraining role ofthe host city on migrants’ ability to apply and translate their foreign career capitallocally. We discover career recontextualization that embodies not only transfer, but alsotranslation and transformation, of career knowledge from home to host city context,through local boundary objects (e.g., city artifacts) as intermediaries. Career recontextualizationis enacted via three unique types of career action: Career orienting, cross-boundarycareer adaptation, and creative career action (e.g., new boundary object creation). Thus, weextend boundary object theory to the city context and explore the role of transferring workrelatedknowledge as well as the ability to control and influence careers of newcomers.Finally, we provide a novel perspective on the intricate relationship between career recontextualizationandmigrant integration in the host city, leading to a discovery of two uniquetypes of integration (functional and holistic). © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

This issue affects China’s within-country migrant entrepreneurs, who are increasingly women, because egalitarian gender-role perceptions increase the resources provided to female entrepreneurs by key stakeholders, including other migrant entrepreneurs. Currently, we know little about gender equity and gender perceptions evidenced at the intersection of two significant trends in China: (a) rural–urban migration and (b) entrepreneurship. We first analyzed business acumen indicators of a nationally and geographically representative sample of 4,660 entrepreneurs in China (Study 1). Second, we analyzed differences in gender perceptions regarding female business acumen of 293 migrant entrepreneurs in Beijing (Study 2). The perceptions of all entrepreneurs in rural areas (Study 1) and of male migrant entrepreneurs originally from rural areas (Study 2) are the most consistent with traditional gender-role stereotypes. However, male migrant entrepreneurs’ tenure and interactions in Beijing and all entrepreneurs’ exposure to higher proportions of female entrepreneurs were associated with more egalitarian perceptions. Migrant entrepreneurship in China provides insights into the differential influence of gender and home region socialization on the gender stereotypes and business-related perceptions of those immersed in locations with more egalitarian gender stereotypes. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Yet, given the diversity of institutional contexts that host refugees, calls have been made to expand research on how institutions influence refugee entrepreneurship. We respond to this call by presenting herein an abduc-tive study of Syrian refugee entrepreneurs in an emerging market (Egypt) who managed to establish and maintain entrepreneurial ventures despite institutional voids (i.e., where key institutions are either missing or underperforming). The work offers an extension of the institutional voids perspective for studying refugee entrepreneurs, known as “refugee-economy voids.” These account for the influence of national and international formal and informal institutions on refugee entrepreneurs. To address refugee-economy voids, we also discuss three strategies used by refugee entrepreneurs: (a) masking strategies, (b) jockeying strategies, and (c) informal crowdfunding strategies. This paper also provides new evidence dealing with the supportive role and solidarity of the host country’s nationals with refugee entrepreneurs. On a policy level, the findings can inform the development of targeted policy interventions to address refugee-economy voids across different host countries and to improve support for refugees’ self-reliance through entrepreneurship. © Academy of Management.

The context of “nonelite” returnee entrepreneurs remains particularly overlooked by management scholars. This study widens our knowledge by exploring what determines returnees’ decisions to allocate their initial financial investment to microenterprise start-ups instead of the other routes open to them. Drawing information from a sample of 93 African and Latin American migrants supported by an “assisted voluntary return and reintegration program,” the analysis explores the impact of returnee entrepreneurs’ heterogeneous preparedness to return and entrepreneurial motivations behind how much of their available budget they choose to allocate to entrepreneurial investment. The results show that the availability of resources to ensure the satisfaction of basic needs at the household level in the country of origin and other factors related to the returnees’ motivations to establish small businesses drive such entrepreneurial investment allocation decisions.

The implications of immigrant contribution perceptions are still largely unknown. Building on a dualdimension framework, this paper explores and presents the perceived immigrant contribution construct and develops a scale as a tool to measure perceptions of economic or realistic (i.e., physical resources) and symbolic (i.e., cultural resources) immigrant contributions. Five studies provide evidence for the scale and construct validity in both general and workplace-specific contexts. The inclusion of this construct will allow future scholars to capture an alternative perspective and gain additional insights into immigrant-directed attitudes and behaviors, guiding future research toward a more positive psychology approach to studying immigrant perceptions and its organizational implications for workplace well-being, treatment, and integration. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

However, how those stereotypes and biases impact sponsors, and the effectiveness of the referrals that they provide, is not well-understood. Drawing on evidence of reversals of gender bias, we explore the impact of sponsors’ gender and tenure on the effectiveness of their referrals in the context of Supreme Court of the United States law clerk hiring decisions. This is an appropriate setting because success in the application process for these elite early-career positions is contingent on having a strong recommendation from a judge with which the candidate has previously worked, making it ideal to study gender differences in the effectiveness of referrals. Analyses show that candidates recommended by male sponsors are more likely to be hired compared to those recommended by female sponsors overall, but this dynamic is also dependent on the sponsor’s tenure and the candidate’s gender. For female sponsors, higher levels of tenure are associated with better hiring outcomes for their female candidates only. None of the other gender combinations benefit from sponsor seniority. Possible mechanisms, limitations, and implications for future research directions are discussed. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

We go beyond such a view and present findings suggesting that digitalization may also affect how people relate to a firm. The guiding intuitions of our research are that digitalization may impede firm anthropomorphization—that is, the attribution of humanlike capacities of mind (“agency” and “experience”) to firms—which may affect stakeholder relations. Specifi-cally, we suspect that digitalization is likely to undermine a firm’s ability to establish and maintain the sort of communal (trusting and cooperative) relations that stakeholder theory sees as crucial for value creation. We find support for these intuitions in four experimental studies (total n = 819): people attribute less experience (but not less agency) to more digitalized firms and this reduces their willingness to affiliate with, trust, or enact prosocial behavior toward such firms. We also find that these effects are stronger for communally oriented respondents, and that one reason that people are less inclined to enter into a relationship with a more digitalized firm is that they believe that this will make it more difficult to enact communal behaviors. Together, our findings suggest that firm digitalization may, ceteris paribus, undermine firms’ ability to gener-ate value. © Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

At the same time, organizations often seek to build collaborative cultures where employees frequently help one another. Thus, a question arises as to how growth mindsets impact other-directed behaviors, such as helping. To address this research question, we develop the concept of a work growth mindset—a mindset specific to growth opportunities at work—and we explore how it influences helping across a pilot study and five experimental studies. Study 1 (an online experiment) and Study 2 (a within-person field experiment) show that employees help coworkers more after participating in a work growth mindset intervention. Studies 3A–C explore the mechanisms underlying this relationship and the circumstances in which growth-oriented employees help others. These experiments show that a work growth mindset makes employees more other-oriented and likely to help, but that this effect relies on the extent to which the helping opportunities can be seen as enabling both self-and other-development, allowing for both the helper and the help recipient to grow. We discuss the implications of our find-ings for theory and the future of the growth mindset at work. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Specifically, I investigate how firms respond when they fail to meet targets they have adopted for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Analyses reveal that the most promi-nent effect of failing to achieve greenhouse gas emissions targets is to “reoperationalize” the target—that is, to change how the target is defined. Any effect on problemistic search to improve environmental performance is, at best, modest and is itself diminished by reoperationalization. Together, these findings suggest an interesting discovery related to why business adoption of explicit environmental targets has not had a more pronounced or persistent effect on arresting damage to the natural environment: some firms may be addressing failure to achieve environmental goals by reoperationalizing their aspirations rather than making efforts to improve environmental performance. To borrow a sports metaphor, instead of competing harder to win the match when they are behind, some firms may be “moving the goalposts” during the competition when it comes to achieving environmental performance targets. © Academy of Management.

These workers have a wide array of attire options, from “work outfits” (which are consistent with the content of work) to “home outfits” (which are consistent with remote work settings). Media accounts suggest this shift has created a new outfit: business tops with casual bottoms. Although this “Zoom mullet” outfit has been called “the perfect pandemic work-from-home attire,” it is not fully consistent with either the work or the home context. To investigate the psychological consequences of attire on remote work-ers, we conducted two multiday experiments. We randomly assigned remote workers, both within-and between-participants, to wear “work attire,” “home attire,” or “mixed attire” (work attire on top/home attire on bottom), and measured their authenticity, power, and engagement at work. The experiments produced three key findings. First, Home Attire increased authenticity and engagement. Second, Work Attire did not con-sistently increase power. Finally, the media-hyped Mixed Attire outfit did not produce any psychological or work-related benefits. To understand these effects, we introduce the concepts of “enclothed harmony” and “enclothed dissonance,” which capture whether one’s attire is symbolically consistent with one’s context. The results suggest clothing choices, even for remote workers, are psychologically and organizationally impactful. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

To address this issue, we investigate perceptions and responses to white-collar professionals with secondary employment across five empirical studies. Overall, we find that individuals who are evaluating potential service providers tend to discount multiple jobholding white-collar professionals along several dimensions. Among these, a perceived (lack of) competence in their primary jobs is one mechanism explaining why multiple jobholders tend to receive lower evaluations. Through this series of studies, we also provide incremental evidence regarding when this discounting effect is mitigated, including the availability of information regarding the motivation for holding multiple jobs, the perceiver’s level of social identity complexity, and the professional’s primary occupation.

ENVISIONING ENTREPRENEURIAL ENGAGEMENT IN NORTH KOREA,2022,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128894347&doi=10.5465%2famd.2020.0066&partnerID=40&md5=1732fc9f37db57a309a1169cb11b0039,"Entrepreneurship research has long been interested in the emergence of new business activities in various geographical and institutional contexts. However, these studies have largely focused on market and transition economies at the expense of planned economies. To address this limitation, our study focuses on an extreme case: how people envision their entrepreneurial engagement in North Korea. Drawing on prospective entrepreneurial narratives by North Korean university students, our empirical analysis identifies and elaborates four types of narratives envisioning entrepreneurial engage-ment: economic patriotism, industrious collectivism, individualistic heroism, and personal dreamwork. We show how types of prospective entrepreneurial engagement reflect different motivations and development goals, and how they align with, or deviate from, the dominant institutional discourse in a rigidly planned economy. In conclusion, we advance entrepreneurship research by introducing new ways of studying and theorizing prospective entrepreneurial engagement under extreme institutional constraints. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,
Choreographing Creativity: Exploring Creative Centralization in Project Groups,2022,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140120634&doi=10.5465%2famd.2020.0076&partnerID=40&md5=c9887e6cbf2a3a9f5c4777ab36229677,"Research at the intersection of creativity and leadership has predominantly focused on how leaders support employees’ creativity. We break new ground by examining how creative project leaders generate ideas and influence products throughout group project work. Through an inductive study of modern dance groups attempting to develop and perform new choreography, we discovered that high creative team environments did not produce the most creative products; instead, the most creative products were associated with more leader-driven contexts. We show how contexts varied with regard to the level of “creative centralization,” which we define as the extent to which creative contributions and decisions converge on a focal person. Combinations of six different creative work processes—concept-focused launch, action-focused launch, leader experimentation, cocreation, additive synthesis, and evaluative synthesis—enabled the emergence of variations in creative centralization and its associated outcomes. Our findings reveal new research puzzles at the intersection of creativity, leadership, and group work, as well as how leaders manage compositional creativity over time. © 2022, Academy of Management.

NOBODY HOME: A PARALLEL PROCESS INVESTIGATION OF A CHILD WELFARE AGENCY,2022,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152465465&doi=10.5465%2famd.2021.0068&partnerID=40&md5=0076643bb6d35ab9496a6e87d3f2b8d1,"During action research related to the persistent burnout of social workers in a child welfare agency, I discovered that members regularly referred to how the agency was “just like” client families. I explore the possibility that the likeness between the two social systems was not simply coincidental but reflected a parallel process by which client family issues were unconsciously “absorbed” into the agency. Parallel processes related to indi-viduals and groups have been noted anecdotally but have not been examined in organization–environment relations. I collected and analyzed data to uncover key paral-lels and infer the absorption processes by which they were created. I discuss those paral-lels as agency reenactments of key client family dynamics—of disconnection, abuse, neglect—and note individual and collective collusions that maintain those dynamics. I thus show how what happened in the agency to enable persistent social worker burnout was intimately related to what happened to the agency at its boundary with key aspects of its environment. This realization expands possibilities for scholars to take seriously the subterranean flow of emotions across organizational–environment bound-aries that shape the absorptive capacity of organizations. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

To this end, we use population-level data of CEOs in Denmark over the 2000–2012 sample period. Applying a difference-in-differences research design, we study matching pairs of firms with married and divorcing CEOs. We find that CEO divorce is associated with significant underperformance—as measured by operating return on assets (OROA) and industry-adjusted OROA—but only under specific circumstances: in small firms, in high-growth industries, when children are present in the CEO household, and when the income difference between the CEO and spouse is high. Overall, in addition to social implications, we find that CEO divorce can have significant economic ramifications for firms. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

The empirical literature on quantifying the effect of acquisition experience on the performance of future acquisitions is an anomaly—only half the studies published in top management journals have reported such a positive association. We meta-analyze this literature. Our study contributes three primary discoveries: (a) We robustly establish the positive relationship between acquirer experience and performance after accounting for the statistical quality of each study. Just as this result is nonobvious to academic observers of this conversation, it is also apparently nonobvious to investors—the effect size from studies using stock market reaction as a proxy for performance is indistinguishable from zero in all specifications and significantly less than from those using accounting-based measures. (b) The positive association of experience to performance strengthens in study settings characterized by a moderator previously explored among industrial workers: Com-plexity. In particular, experience is more positively associated with performance in cross-border and multi-industry settings, as well as those where the performance metrics reflect information that is more available to insiders than to outsiders. (c) We document the consid-erable discord in this literature and highlight its probable sources and remedies. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2022.",,

Over this time, the organization (“Rebelient”) went through several identity transitions wherein members of the organization came to understand that who they wanted to be as an organization was not possible because of differing expectations held by various inside and outside stakeholder groups. Discrepancies arising from those difficult-to-meet expectations led to repeated cycles of adaptive sensemaking, as members sought to understand what was happening. Our analysis of Rebelient’s identity transitions focuses primarily on a subtle form of adaptive sensemaking (semantic sensemaking) as a way not only to advance our understanding of intangible processes involved in identity transitions, but also to investigate an underexplored realm of sensemaking. Our findings have implications for the study of both organizational identity and adaptive sensemaking. © 2022, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

This article reports the results of a three-year longitudinal study of the implementation of a successful technology-enabled innovation program in a leading professional services firm. The research was conducted using a cooperative research methodology involving academics and executives cocreating knowledge together and an abductive approach to theorizing to explore technology-enabled innovation in this important type of organization. The process of developing a capability for technology-enabled innovation was found to be supported by the commitment of leaders, the presence of certain catalysts for change, and a carefully crafted management process sympathetic to existing culture and practices. As the research proceeded, two additional insights emerged that helped explain the success of the innovation program: experimental space and intellectual space. Experimental space includes new formal processes and practices and new physical spaces for encouraging and guiding the search for innovation. Intellectual space includes thought leadership, increased workforce diversity, as well as developing a greater openness to external knowledge sources. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Across six studies, we investigate people’s perceptions of startup companies and examine how people evaluate a startup’s morally questionable behavior. We find evidence for a “virtuous stereotype,” such that companies associated with the startup label are perceived as more virtuous than established companies (Study 1a). As a result, startups receive less moral condemnation than established companies for their morally ambiguous behavior (Study 1b and Study 1c)—an effect that does not seem to spill over onto nonmoral transgressions (Study 2a). In addition, startups elicit less disapproval when their transgression is morally ambiguous compared to morally unambiguous, suggesting that, when possible, observers provide a benign justification for the startup’s transgression (Study 2b). Finally, we find that people prefer not to morally scrutinize the behavior of startups when given a choice (Study 3). Overall, these results suggest that the simple label of “startup” may endow a firm with moral credentials that lead observers to give startups the benefit of the doubt when they transgress. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

While it is clear that an open source community transcends multiple geographic locations, we do not yet know whether location-based agglomeration effects are present in these communities. We take a critical look at this aspect by investigating whether new and spin-off project initiations are more concentrated in geographic locations that already have many prior projects initiated in those regions, even after accounting for the locations’ endowments. Using data from a popular open source community (GitHub) from years 2008 to 2011 inclusive, we find the presence of not only agglomeration effects but also aggregation diseconomies beyond a certain level. Our findings have implications for research on open source communities and agglomeration effects, in addition to generating practical implications. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2022,",,

To fill this gap, we study the networking behavior of female and male job-seekers in a strategic research setting. In Study 1, we use server logs to directly observe job-seeking MBAs students’ outreach to alumni and show that female students reach out to at least as many men and to significantly more women than their male classmates. In Study 2, 46 interviews reveal that in addition to all the same networking that men do, female job-seekers also networked, primarily with women, to assess two aspects of fit that men were less concerned about: gender dynamics and support for parenting. Taken together, our results suggest that both genders engage in schmoozing to get a job, but women also engage in scouting – a heretofore undocumented form of gender-homophilous networking aimed at finding employers and career options that give women a fair chance at professional success. We discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of gender differences in networks and career attainment. © 2022, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

To conduct this exploratory work, we use a large panel data sample of 11,635 company-years from 82 countries for the period 2003–2013. We find that services firms, after the crisis, could derive better returns from R&D, and that the changing returns to R&D may be contingent on firm-specific idiosyncrasies, general industrial environments, and national institutional quality. Our results find support in both the exogenous shock model and Schumpeterian theories, but only to an extent, thus demonstrating the need for further theorization on the influence of R&D on a firm’s performance in the post-crisis period. We address the question of whether returns to R&D in the services industry are impervious to business environment turbulence. We find that they are not, though persistence in R&D, contingent on the firm, industry, and country-level factors, could be crucial for their per-formance. Notably, low market share, high leverage, stability in the services sub-industries, and sound national institutional quality might be important to derive returns from innovative activities. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Drawing on a combination of institu-tional-and organizational-level theories, we assess the complex relationship between nine potential antecedents of SIM and its formalization, across 152 social entrepreneurs in Chile’s social sector. Using configurational comparative methods, we discover and map four novel approaches to social impact measurement, revealing a much more diverse and counterintuitive reality. We also find that, in emerging settings, factors assumed to be central to formalization in mature sectors play a peripheral role at best. By offering a multilevel explanation of what matters and when for SIM in an emerging social sector, this paper offers empirical evidence on how to better capture and report SIM and expands the theoretical understanding of SIM as a governance and accountability mechanism in social entrepreneurship. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2022.",,

While this support can be financial or nonfinancial, we know relatively little about the nonfinancial support donors provide. Donors’ words can have substantial positive and negative effects on sufferers; however, donors are also often limited in the extent to which they can provide relevant support due to unfamiliarity with suffer-ers’ lives. Therefore, it is important to investigate the messages donors leave on campaign pages. In this inductive study, we investigate online responses to a school shooting to explain how donors’ responses to charitable crowdfunding campaigns manifest. The emergent crowdfunding model of public displays of compassion suggests two core types of responses depending on the nature of the public appeal. Our insights extend the boundaries of the theory on charitable crowdfunding by illustrating the benefits of relaxing implicit assumptions regarding the nature of value creation and the uniformity of donor responses. The study has implications for organization theory on nonmonetary value creation in crowdfunding, heterogeneity in crowdfunding responses, and compassion-organizing and culture-building in organizations. © 2022, Academy of Management.

Our findings trace cost escalation to fundamental changes of the project organizational governance structure and concomitant renegotiations of the value to be created and the value distribution. Specif-ically, we link substantive cost hikes to (a) early negotiations to agree a value proposition that unifies a core group of autonomous actors under a shared form of governance, and (b) collective action problems that arise as key nonmarket stakeholders are brought into a poly-centric governance structure to encourage cooperation in joint local value creation activi-ties. We also associate cost hikes, although less substantive, to market transactions with suppliers and to bilateral agreements with other nonmarket stakeholders that stay excluded from direct participation in governance-related decisions.

However, we know little about the boundary conditions of psychological safety, such as how it operates at the organization level and if and when it is helpful over time. In this research, we explore how organization-level psychological safety, in conjunction with another aspect of workplace climate, felt accountability, impacts organizational performance over time. Our study context is the New York City public school system, a context rife with uncertainty and calls for change, including pressure on teachers to produce and improve student outcomes. Utilizing over 170,000 survey responses from teachers in 545 schools across three years, our multilevel analyses unexpectedly show that psychological safety is not on its own, nor necessarily, “helpful” with regard to organizational performance over time. Indeed, the best conditions for fostering organizational performance occur when psychological safety is relatively low and felt accountability is relatively high. Thus, these two dimensions of workplace climate appear to be interrelated in critical ways over time, albeit unexpectedly. We conclude with implications of our discoveries for future research, and propose new lines of research on the roles of interdependence, attention, and time for studying psychological safety at the organization level. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Whether governments can effectively identify and reward the most promising ventures is a topic of considerable debate. We examine the selection capabilities of the largest such government program in the United States—the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. No prior work has systematically evaluated whether SBIR priori-tizes the most promising technical and commercial ventures. We are able to do so by exploiting a quasi-natural experiment made possible by the sudden release of additional funds through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). Since our sample consists of two sets of firms having received SBIR grants—one prioritized through the regular-funded process and a second group funded through the additional ARRA money— we can ascertain whether the prioritized ventures outperform the others, while controlling for the treatment effect. Our evidence supports the view that governments can effectively implement entrepreneurial programs, and we provide some insight into the capabilities underlying effective selection. Moreover, the evidence reveals that governments are capable of selecting risky ventures—the kind that might produce high impact. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

To answer this question, we apply the CEO in context (CiC) variance partitioning technique to estimate the CEO effect—the amount of the total variance in an outcome measure that can be attributed to CEOs—on CSR. Estimated across the two most widely used data sets of CSR in empirical research, namely KLD and Asset4, we find that CEOs explain about 30% of the total variance in CSR. The CEO effect is also remarkably stable when it is estimated individually across different subcategories of CSR or on a sample of exogenous CEO transitions. The CiC technique is unique in terms of how it distinguishes between contextual determinants and CEO-related determinants of firm outcomes. We therefore also provide estimates of the CEO effect that we derived from applying other commonly used forms of variance partition methodology (VPM) to the two data sets of CSR. We discuss the implications of our findings for the literatures on upper echelons, CSR, institutional theory, VPM, and research on CEOs’ bearing on company actions and outcomes in general. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Low social class origin is a likely candidate for such disadvantage, as it is associated with disadvantage on other measures of attainment, but there is a dearth of research relating social class to the attainment of management positions, particularly relative to other sources of disadvantage such as gender and race. We show that in the United States, individuals from lower social class origins are substantially less likely to be managers, and the disadvantage is comparable in magnitude to the disadvantage experienced by women and African Americans. A key mechanism behind this social class disadvantage is education, but there are others, mostly relating to deficits of cultural capital associated with lower social class origins. We also examine the magnitude of social class disadvantage for attaining management positions around the world, and find that it is substantive in almost every country, and associated with indicators of national culture, such as individualism and materialism; with economic indicators, such as gross domestic product per capita and the unemployment rate; and with measures of human development, such as child mortality. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

However, there is paucity of research on whether changing organizational strategies and practices have led to the improvement of overall ecosystem health. It is time to shift the focus of scholarship from measuring environmental strategy to measuring the impact of organizations on the natural environment. This is possible via interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary scholarship that brings together scholars from several management disciplines and natural sciences to enrich the theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches needed to tackle these complex phenomena. Such phenomena-driven research has the potential to gather diverse theoretical streams, span functional areas, and cross levels of analysis by focusing on a problem domain rather than restricting itself to the bounds of a discipline or a theory. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research focused on environmental impacts has also the potential to open up a meaningful area of management scholarship with relevance for practitioners and policymakers seeking to develop solutions to address rapid environmental destruction and climate change. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,
THE WAY WE MAKE EACH OTHER FEEL: RELATIONAL AFFECT AND JOINT TASK PERFORMANCE,2022,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152390212&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0095&partnerID=40&md5=8839eef785229bd3112afd0c0a97f6a9,"When two people work closely together to perform a task interdependently, do the emotions they elicit in each other matter for their joint performance? If so, which emotions matter most, and does performance itself affect which emotions arise? Our study discovers the unique role of relational tension in dyads as an antecedent and an outcome of joint task performance. We analyzed longitudinal archival and survey data on surgeons working in dyads to execute visceral surgeries, with a sample including 1,315 surgeries conducted before the relational survey, and 475 surgeries afterward. Of all forms of relational affect we considered—how relaxed, excited, alert, nervous, tense, or lethargic surgeons felt when working with each other—we found that only relational tension predicted subsequent surgery performance. Regarding the antecedents of relational affect, the past performance of a surgeon dyad explained only relational tension. But not all forms of past performance mattered. Only having experienced performance peaks lowered relational tension, while performance valleys and averages had no effect. No form of positive relational affect had a discernible role as either an antecedent or an outcome of joint performance. These findings chart new territory on the affect–performance link, with implications for management theory and practice. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

We focus onleader narcissismandexamine howit affects two specific organizational culture dimen-sions—collaboration and integrity. In two field studies and three laboratory studies, our results reveal that people who are more narcissistic are less likely to demonstrate collaboration and integrity in their behavior, and when we examine leaders specifically, we find that those higher in narcissism prefer and lead organizational cultures that are less collab-orative and place less emphasis on integrity. In our laboratory studies, we show that narcissists endorse policies and procedures that are associated with cultures with less collaboration and integrity, and that employees follow the culture in determining their own level of collaboration and integrity, suggesting that narcissistic leaders’ behavior is amplified through culture. We discuss the potentially enduring impact that narcissistic leaders have in engendering cultures lower in collaboration and integrity to enable future theory-building connecting leader personality to organizational culture. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

Our repertory grid data reveal that actors recog-nize the importance of error prevention, but also appreciate that emergent and unexpected issues require error management in order to trap, address, or mitigate problems in the making. Errors are also regarded to play an important role in adaptation, innova-tion, and learning. However, our interview data and analysis of incident investigation reports reflect a narrower range of factors and indicate a strongly institutionalized pre-disposition toward error prevention. Findings provide practical implications for the management of process safety and for incident analysis, which may be overlooking the importance of error management, and also for individuals at the sharp end of plant operations who may be coping with the gap between what they believe is important in terms of process safety and what they bring to the surface, share, and document. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

These results suggest that people’s judgment may be highly influenced by visual information. Further, people do not seem to fully recognize how much visual information factors into their decisions, such that they neglect the more substantive metrics that they explicitly cite and value as core to their decisions.

I suggest the value of enhanced scholarly attention to our own practices, and as a stimulus to such scholarship I discuss two related phenomena: the news media’s attention to bullying and harassment in academia, and a Facebook group entitled “Reviewer 2 must be stopped.” Both are salient in contem-porary academic interactions, both are very pertinent to, and inform understanding of, dynamics that we regularly study, and neither is adequately understood conceptually.

Knowledge errors occur when a professional service worker does not know certain facts about a client or lacks an adequate cognitive representation of a client’s profile. Using the case of “patient-centered medical homes” (PCMHs)—high-performance primary care clinics where workers are constantly acquir-ing information about patients to ensure their health and safety—I explore how PCMH workers handle knowledge errors at work. Through qualitative analysis, I find that PCMH workers encounter the threat of knowledge error from information that is incom-plete, outdated, incorrect, or unknown. To address these threats, they acquire information via four modes—gathering, verifying, expanding, and sensitizing—that generate two different forms of knowledge for the organization: (1) “maximized knowledge,” whose use is intentional to achieve organizational aims (e.g., to perform diagnoses); (2) “elaborated knowledge,” which represents new understanding, but whose use is com-paratively less scripted (e.g., a patient’s living situation). These discoveries suggest how different modes of information acquisition afford distinct opportunities for error prevention at the knowledge level, and that greater precision is needed when theorizing the ways in which organizational actors acquire information. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

Across three studies, we qualitatively discovered and quantitatively explored “joint problem-solving orientation” as a new team factor. Interviews with members of teams formed across sectors to design new processes indicated that established approaches to working across boundaries, such as increasing team familiarity, were undermined by team member fluidity. A joint problem-solving orientation emerged as an enabling factor that differed across teams. Building on the qualitative findings, we col-lected survey data on 299 cross-sector teams and conducted an online laboratory study further developing the joint problem-solving orientation construct. Survey results showed that joint problem-solving orientation varies across fluid cross-boundary teams and contributes to explaining team performance. Online study results found that joint problem-solving orientation is appropriately measured at the team level, demonstrates discriminant validity against conceptually related measures, and exhibits a consistent relationship with perfor-mance. Together, these studies elucidate the compounding challenges of boundaries and team fluidity and determine joint problem-solving orientation to be a measurable factor for predicting team performance. For large-scale problems requiring cross-sector teamwork, understanding how people can collaborate across boundaries in fluid combinations is vital. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Complementing prior literature centered on the option value of innovation projects, our main focus is on the firm characteristics associated with the propensity to abandon projects. In our empirical context of product innovation, firms that select out projects during development (selectors) prove to run more projects and engage in more varied activities than their counterparts (nonselectors). This likely facilitates the reallocation of resources from discontinued projects and makes opportunity costs more salient. Selectors also organize differently. They tend to sequence resource-allocation decisions, have dedicatedportfoliomanagers, and incentivize efficient abandonment. These organization-design features likely counteract the tendency to prolong project commitments. Our discoveries lay groundwork for future inquiry into explanations of firms’ heterogeneous ability to organize innovation in uncertain market environments. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

This puzzle arises because IPOs face immense growth expectations and the short-term market demands of shareholders while encountering a liability of newness challenge and a myriad of CSR issues that might be pursued. Consequently, we explore (a) how they engage in CSR activities relative to industry peers, (b) whether they engage in the CSR issues that are material or immaterial for their industry, (c) what firm characteristics affect an IPO’s investment in CSR, and (d) whether those CSR activities have discriminating effects associated with post-IPO corporate financial performance. Our results show that IPOs generally have lower overall CSR ratings relative to industry peers. However, this is because IPOs discriminately focus their efforts on the CSR topics that are material for their industry. Moreover, IPOs withthe most net positive material CSR activities relative to industry peers also exhibit significantly positive post-IPO abnormal returns and experience fewer post-IPO stock delistings. Overall, our study shows that IPOs are strategically managing their CSR investments by emphasizing material rather than immaterial CSR issues. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Image concerns are a potential barrier, specifically concerning how a leader will be perceived by employees when adopting an error management orientation. Using an experimental study (Study 1; 73 student and nonstudent participants) and a field study (Study 2; 454 employees and 95 leaders), we explore the relationship between leaders’ perceived error orientation and employees’ perceptions of the warmth and competence of those leaders. Moreover, in Study 2, we extend our findings by testing the indirect effects of leader error orientation via perceived leader warmth and competence on indicators of employees’ work-related outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, turnover inten-tion, work engagement, employee job performance). Our findings provide the first evidence to suggest that leaders should not be reluctant to apply error management in their practice, as it offers benefits both for employees’ perception of leaders and for employ-ees’ work-related outcomes. To inspire future research, we propose an integrative theoretical model of the interindividual effects of leader error orientation on employee-perceived leader warmth, competence, and work-related outcomes at both the individual and team levels. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

Using video data from F** kup Nights Brussels (part of a global community sharing professional failure experiences), we analyze the verbal and visual elements used to publicly describe errors and subsequent failures. Our findings establish six distinct narrative genres: namely, fable, documentary, Greek tragedy, modern tragedy, tragicomedy, and absurdist fiction. We connect the characteristics of errors to these specific genres of failure narrative and describe the communication outcome pursued by each genre. By identifying failure narrative genres and delineating their expected public impacts, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of error communication and error management in organizations. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

Using grounded theory methods, we step into the shoes of federal employees active in Open Opportunities, a digital market for temporary assignments in the U.S. federal gov-ernment. We find that employees use such temporary assignments to craft a liminal space in which they can explore new skills, establish new professional ties, and claim new professional identities unavailable in their full-time jobs. However, due to its visi-bility, this way of crafting can also generate substantial supervisory pressures that resist it. These pressures may induce an image cost, and trigger increased frustration, stress, and strain in people’s jobs. As we describe this new job crafting pattern, we pay attention to both its benefits and burdens, and the impact thereof on people’s efforts to stretch themselves at work.

This is, in part, because individuals can choose different behavioral strategies to acquire sta-tus. For example, some adopt behaviors that create value, such as working hard and developing relevant expertise. Others adopt behaviors that project value, often through deceptive behaviors such as misrepresenting one’s contributions. Current approaches to studying status pursuit have made these different behavioral strategies difficult to detect. In this paper, we explore the possibility that an explanation for this problem lies in the fact that individuals’ behavioral choices are a function of both the type of goals they pursue and reasons why they are pursuing them. Using an empirically abductive approach and the theoretical lens of goal content theory, we find that conventional measures of status pursuit subsume both “authentic” and “contingent” goals, and their accompany-ing intrinsic motives, and are associated with different behavioral strategies. This is an important discovery, as it enables empirical demonstration that the motives associated with contingent—unlike authentic—status goals are strongly associated with value-pro-jecting behavior, and this relationship is enhanced when there are opportunities for public recognition. Overall, our findings offer a new way of explaining and conceptualizing status pursuit. © 2021, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Using big data in combination with a machine learning-aided analysis, we discover a positive sentiment bias associated with entrepreneurship present in two major English-language media outlets: The New York Times and the Financial Times. Over 800,000 excerpts from 12-and 16-year periods were analyzed. Those containing the words “entrepreneur” and “founder” were found to have much more positive sentiment than did excerpts with the words “manager” and “executive.” A parallel analysis of the FANG companies (i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Net-flix, and Google) in comparison to a set of older and more established Fortune 500 companies produced similar results. While more work is needed to verify the link between media biases and career choice, we believe this media bias promotes entrepreneurship, resulting in lower (average) incomes and higher risks for those engaged in this career path. However, because entrepreneurial activity can create positive externalities in the broader economy, this bias, while financially disadvantageous for the average entrepre-neur, may be beneficial overall for society. © 2021, Academy of Management.

The government contracting arena is highly opaque to outsiders, and firms competing for such contracts avoid political attention to maintain this opacity. Yet, in exploring factors that disrupt opacity and reduce CPA efficacy, scholarship has primarily investigated political issue salience or political issue visibility. However, firms operate within a broader, nonpolitical information environment, and scholarship has ignored how such information may disrupt the value-generation potential of political exchange opacity. We thus question whether nonpolitical outside attention to politically active firms disrupts political exchange opacity and affects firms’ ability to use CPA to receive government contracts. Further, we explore how the affective tenor or tone of media reporting impacts firms’ ability to influence government contract awards through CPA. Using a 16-year longitudinal analysis, we discover that both general media visibility and positive media reputation negatively moderate the CPA–contract awards association. The findings expand existing literature by uncovering how general media attention and media reputation may draw attention to political exchange participants, and impact firm CPA efficacy in achieving tangible outcomes. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Building upon substantial literatures on proprietary disclosure, research has begun to rigorously document antecedents and outcomes of intermediated disclosure. However, theory remains rela-tively silent on how two important aspects of this mechanism—lack of audit oversight and provision of evaluative ratings—create incentives for uptake of an overlooked mode of misleading disclosures: false accounts. Moreover, research has not defini-tively addressed the degree to which intermediated voluntary disclosures are verifi-able or truthful, nor the associated significance for long-term institutional credibility. This study uses forensic analysis of detailed corporate disclosures to one prominent intermediary to develop and validate novel constructs that establish evidence of false claims. Our findings demonstrate that firms routinely manipulate intermediary ratings with false claims, undermining institutional and societal goals. The results identify several factors that may improve ability to differentiate substantive firm performance from false accounts.

This, however, cre-ates challenges to sharing errors. Based on case studies of two consulting organizations, both explicitly committed to positivity, we explore how consultants make decisions about error sharing. We discover two versions of positivity (trait based and experience based), which are coupled with two different organizational mindsets (fixed vs. growth). These pairs shape an organization’s view of errors, and they create different cultural contexts for error sharing. With trait-based positivity and a fixed organizational mind-set, the predominant emotion when committing errors was shame; only costs of error sharing were seen, and errors were shared only with a small group of trusted peers. With experience-based positivity and a growth organizational mindset, the predominant emotion instead was guilt; both costs and benefits of error sharing were considered, and errors were shared more widely. These findings contribute to research on error management by laying the ground for further theorizing about the relationship between organizational norms and values, emotions, cost–benefit considerations, and decisions about error sharing. They also hold implications for managers regarding how to emphasize the positive without muting error sharing. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

This paper reports insights based on an attempt to apply this type of intervention in the technology sector. Adapting a social-belonging intervention from educational psychology, we implemented a quasi-random field experiment, spanning 12 months, with 506 newly hired engineers (24% of the sample was female) in the R&D function of a West Coast technology firm. We did not find a statistically significant effect of the treatment on a core attainment outcome—bonus relative to base salary—that exhibited a significant gender gap, with women receiving proportionally lower bonuses than men. We did not find anticipated gender gaps in promotion rates or social network centrality, and we also did not find a statistically significant effect of the treatment of women on these outcomes. Drawing on meaningful differences between educational versus workplace settings, we identify four theoretical moderators that might influence the efficacy of social-belonging interventions adapted from educational settings into the workplace. Finally, based on the limitations of our study design, we provide four rec-ommendations that future researchers might adopt. © 2021, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

We discover that groups do differ in the returns they achieve to resources, and they do so systemati-cally—returns to one resource correlate with returns to another. These results indicate a latent, general ability to transform resources, one that we find is associated with a group’s coordinated attention (manifest in “bursty” email communication patterns). We suggest that the discovered general ability reflects collective intelligence, and we discuss implications of our findings for research on collective intelligence, as well as the implications of our approach for surfacing new phenomena currently masked by the domi-nant focus on average effects. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

THE THEORY OF AGENCY REDUX,2021,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130489818&doi=10.5465%2famd.2019.0136&partnerID=40&md5=421386e0efdbcdf0aabc0017b5376273,"The theory of agency has found applications across the social sciences as well as in management fields; there are literally thousands of papers that employ it. Unlike many popu-lar theoretical approaches in social science, however, the theory of agency has no standard citation. Most applications to date have employed variations on the economic theory of agency, with the most cited article being Jensen and Meckling (1976). Most literature using agency has featured the assumptions, terms, logics, and domain common to approaches in economics. But agency theory did in fact have a distinct origin: it was first proposed, independently, by Mitnick (1973, 1974, 1975), beginning the institutional stream, and by Ross (1973, 1974), for the economics stream. Revisionist work on agency theory has taken for granted that the task involves extensions and repairs to the economic theory of agency. The present Guidepost essay argues that many of the criticisms do not necessarily apply to institutional agency theory. Work should return to an institutional approach that focuses on incentive relations rather than incentives; relationships of con-trol, such as authority and responsibility, not just decisions; attention to how the inevita-ble imperfections of agency are managed, not just how they are corrected; the exploration of complex motivation, including terminal values; the influences of social norms on agen-cy; and the design and functioning of systems of assurance that permit imperfect institutions to remain credible. © 2021, Academy of Management.

“IT’S NOT ALL PUPPIES AND SUNSHINE”: VETERINARY WORKERS’ EMOTIONAL COMFORT ZONES AND COMPANION ANIMAL EUTHANASIA,2021,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152461454&doi=10.5465%2fAMD.2018.0037&partnerID=40&md5=47cf12f83911f0c844743d4917f6b06f,"In order to generate knowledge about how workers react to intensely emotional workplace experiences, we conducted 54 interviews with employees at five veterinary clinics, focusing on the task of companion animal euthanasia. Although many veterinary workers struggle to cope with the intense emotions of euthanasia early in their careers, over time they learn about their personal preferences for feeling and expressing emotion during euthanasia. We term these preferences for emotional experience “emotional comfort zones.” These comfort zones vary from worker to worker, with some preferring to be more immersed in the intense emotions of euthanasia and others more detached. Further, workers learn how to regulate their emotions in order to stay within their comfort zones, sometimes aided by aspects of the situation such as routines, but also sometimes hindered by events that can “pull” or “shock” workers into uncomfortably intense, unwanted emotions. We explain how these and other findings contribute to improved understanding of how workers manage intense emotions at work, and present implications for managers and employees. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",affect; emotional labor; emotions; human–animal work; qualitative research methods; stress,
THE MORNING INBOX PROBLEM: EMAIL REPLY PRIORITIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL TIMING NORMS,2021,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152405044&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0210&partnerID=40&md5=2fba62014e6384bfdb9691a307335a49,"To which emails do employees first respond? This paper explores the near-universal ele-ment of being an employee responsible for attending to an organizational email account. Using a large email corpus of an organization across five years, we explore various response heuristics that might be guiding how organizational members make reply priority decisions. Study 1 simulates what we call the “morning inbox problem”—deciding whom to reply to when emails from multiple respondents have been received. Our analysis reveals that organizational members use the following heuristics in reply priority decisions: (a) order of arrival, (b) contents that can be inferred from the subject line rath-er than from the email body, (c) effort required to reply, and (d) expectation the sender has with respect to time-to-response of the email. These patterns of reply priority reveal a new construct—organizational timing norms, which are norms that govern the temporal dimension of intraorganizational interactions. Study 2 explores the organizational implications of timing norm violations. We show that organizational members sending out-of-sync replies constitute a “bottleneck” in organizational communication and is a predictor of employee turnover. We discuss the implications of our discoveries and un-derscore the potential value of studying timing norms in organizational routines. © Academy of Management Discoveries Online only 2021.",,

WHO ADOPTS AN ERROR MANAGEMENT ORIENTATION?

While previous research has stressed the role of self-efficacy in explaining who adopts an error management orientation (EMO), our findings from three empirical studies in an auditing context indicate another powerful yet neglected individual difference: humility. In Study 1, we draw on qualitative data collected through 18 months of participant observations and 38 interviews to reveal the role of humility in adopting an EMO. In Study 2, we refine our findings by quantitatively exploring and testing the relationships of both humility and self-efficacy with various facets of an EMO. We find positive relations of humility with all examined facets, and find that humility predicts these facets over and above self-efficacy. In Study 3, we replicate and extend our findings by drawing on an additional sample and by exploring the role of past performance for these relationships. Again, we find that humility is a robust predictor of key EMO facets over and above self-efficacy as well as past performance. The discovery of the role of humility challenges the predomi-nant consideration of self-efficacy, and has implications for studying error orientation, error management training, and error management culture. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

To shed light on this finding, we examine whether entrepreneurial orientation (EO) changes across eight weeks in a sample (n 5 17) of B corps pursuing certification relative to a sample (n 5 24) of emerging ventures not pursuing B corp certification. Our abductive, exploratory research finds that EO does not change over time as a function of B corp certification pursuit. However, after further examination of these data, findings show that firms pursuing B corp certification, at the study launch, demonstrated lower EO, and that the EO gap between the two types of companies remained throughout the study. We found this curious, and we thus examined our data for possible explanations with regard to prosocial motivation. We then augmented our quantitative data with qualitatively de-rived insights from eight semistructured interviews with participants to more fully examine the developmental processes at work in B corp certification pursuit. We discuss the implications of our findings, from both theoretical and practical points of view, and we describe multiple compelling lines of future research that can build on this exploratory research. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

Our research reveals, across two distinct samples and methodologies, that an individual’s motivation to learn is higher when they perceive performance by another person to be more exceptionally successful, as compared to perceiving the other’s performance as a more “normal” success. We also observe, in line with prior research, marginal support for the notion that motivation to learn is higher when individuals perceive others’ performance as more of a failure; thereby suggesting a curvilinear relationship between perceived performance and motivation to learn. Our second study demonstrates that the relationship between others’ performance and the motivation to learn is mediated by interest and moderated by surprise. We discuss the implications of these results for provoking new theorizing, measurement, and practical implementation of learning in organizations. © 2021, Academy of Management.

In the modern era, image is vulnerable to rapid transformation because the media, a powerful social arbiter, exerts a strong influence on image construction processes. To better understand these pro-cesses, we analyzed media accounts concerning Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno in the immediate aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal at the university. For decades, the media had portrayed Paterno as a moral beacon who personified “success with honor.” When the Sandusky scandal erupted, however, the media rapidly (within 5 days) transformed Paterno’s image from moral beacon to moral disgrace. Our findings identify key media sensebreaking, sensemaking, and sensegiving processes that help to explain how this swift media image transformation occurred, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications for organizations and for prominent figures associated with them. Especially distinctive is a finding that the media leveraged a preexisting negative recessive narrative into a dominant narrative to quickly and dramatically transform image. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020,.",,

The primary finding and contribution of this study is a pathway by which interactions of failure attributions and emotions lead to effective entrepreneurial reentry in the aftermath of a failure. Specifically, we identify three trajectories of reentry: separation (reentry with minimal modifications), reinforcement (no reentry), and metamorphosis (reentry with substantial modifications). We describe the differences between the trajectories and detail three dimensions of our primary contribution: negative emotions are not necessarily an obstacle to reentry, as previously thought; perceived controllability is critical in explaining reentry; and the evolution of attributional/ emotional responses over time as a result of the interplay between these concepts is central to explaining effective reentry. © 2020, Academy of Management.

Across three studies, findings converge upon the explanation that listeners who challenge the thoughts and feeling of venters were the most helpful for problem-solving. The helpfulness of these responses did not depend on providing relevant information to solve the problem, but instead, the benefit came from the signal to rethink their initial reaction. Results also indicate that the listeners who are most likely to provide those “challenging” responses (who we call challenger listeners) are not the listeners that venters typically choose. Instead, venters prefer supportive listeners—which is likely the reason that the positive utility of venting has been difficult to detect in previous research. Consistent with the extant literature, venting with or without a response in our studies never made venters feel better. © 2020, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Attempting to predict these consequences based on theories of counterfactual thinking, comparative evaluation, and other similar phenomena leads to competing explanations of what may occur. Some perspectives would suggest idea generation should lead to an increase in satisfaction with the status quo, whereas others suggest the opposite. In this study, we empirically explore these predictions to determine the psychological consequences of idea generation. Our data suggest that new ideas can serve as upward counterfactuals to experiences, possessions, or organizations, which then make those experiences, possessions, or organizations seem worse by comparison. We conclude by building theory based on these results, as well as discussion the practical implications of these findings for managers and organizations. © 2020, Academy of Management.

In study 2, we confirm that leader activities are typically evaluated more positively than managerial activities, even in situations that are specifically designed to favor managerial skills.

We tracked the progress of a sample of 142 HTNVs founded at the Israeli government’s Technology Incubator Program in the 1990s through 2001, 2004, 2010, and 2018. The results demonstrate a surprisingly strong effect of early sales traction, signifying the achievement of early product–market fit in an HTNV’s earliest years, on long-term (a decade) and very long-term (two decades) survival, and also on survival-at-scale (i.e., relatively high sales levels). In our sample, HTNVs that made sales in each of their earliest years reduced the hazard of closure, over a 20 year period, by around 90% compared with HTNVs who made no sales in their earliest years. It also sig-nificantly increased the chances of survival-at-scale among those HTNVs that survived over the long or very long term. In contrast, the effect of early external investment on survival was positive in the short to medium term but then faded over time. We propose an underlying mechanism to explain the surprising finding of distal effects of early pro-duct–market fit that builds on imprinting theory, resourcing theory, and the concept of market-based assets. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2021.",,

Here, we examine the time employees spend dealing with their health benefits administrators. Using a nationally representative sample, we found that the direct cost of the time spent by employees dealing with health insurance administration was approximately $21.57 billion, with 53 percent of that time spent ($11.4 billion) at work. The time spent on administrative burdens can also have spillover effects on employee attitudes. Specifically, we found that, controlling for self-reported health and various demographics, people who spent more time on the phone with their health insurer were less satisfied with their current workplace, less engaged, more likely to report significant stress, more likely to have missed a day or more of work, and more likely to feel burned out at work. The estimated cost of additional absence was $26.4 billion, and the productivity cost of reduced satisfaction was approximately $95.6 billion. Benefits constitute about 30 percent of employee costs, but there has been little study of how the “sludge” asso-ciated with accessing those benefits absorbs employee time and affects attitudes.

These changes are associated with shifts in complementor performance outcomes.

Yet there remains a lack of detailed insight regarding the effects of these technologies on traditional control. To convey a better understanding of such datafication technologies in employee management and control, we used a three-step, exploratory, multi-method morphological analysis. In step 1, we developed a framework based on 26 semi-structured interviews with technological experts. In step 2, we refined and redefined the framework in […] and redefined the framework in four workshops with scholars specializing in topics that emerged in step 1. In step 3, we evaluated and vali-dated the framework using potential and actual users of datafication technology controls As a result, our refined and validated “Datafication Technology Control Configuration” (DTCC) framework comprises 11 technology control dimensions and 36 technology control elements, offering the first insights into how datafication technologies can change our understanding of traditional control configurations. © 2020, Academy of Management.

UNPACKING PARTICIPATION AND INFLUENCE: DIVERSITY’S COUNTERVAILING EFFECTS ON EXPERTISE USE IN GROUPS,2020,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096880909&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0044&partnerID=40&md5=e49e07f424231b1eb40ef274485dc50f,"Although organizations frequently use groups to solve complex problems, groups often fail to use all available expertise, thus generating suboptimal solutions. To better understand why this occurs, we distinguish between two processes that are related to expertise use but often empirically conflated: participation and influence. Using detailed process data from a lab-oratory study of 544 individuals working in 136 four-person groups, we find group members with relatively more expertise tend to participate more and have more influence. However, we find dissimilarity from the rest of the group (in terms of gender) disrupts the relationship between individual expertise and participation. Simultaneously, conditional on participa-tion, the same dissimilarity strengthens the relationship between expertise and influence. These patterns aggregate such that group diversity (again, in terms of gender) affects group performance in opposing ways—detracting from the alignment between group member expertise and participation but enhancing the alignment between group member expertise and influence, resulting in an overall null effect of group diversity on group performance. We also explore the effects of race diversity on participation and influence. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for research on diversity and intragroup processes. © 2020, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

We term this phenomenon as government experimentation. Scholarship has tended to examine national efforts, yet local governments are in an ideal position to tailor programs to the local market context, given their proximity. Nevertheless, we have a limited understanding regarding how local institutions experiment. The aims of this article are twofold. First, we outline our methodological approach for building a unique dataset that classifies the portfolio of U.S. state government technology-based economic development policies from 2000 to 2015. We turn to the State Science and Technology Institute as the primary data source. Among the set of 1,659 state-led actions, we classify the context, topic, and lever. Second, we offer descriptive and comparative analyses of this local government experimentation. In considering the spread of each state’s policy port-folio, we highlight four distinct experimental archetypes—hub specialists, public entre-preneurs, industry architects, and ecosystem designers. Finally, we consider theoretical, managerial, policy, and methodological implications that could be derived from our characterization of this phenomenon of local government experimentation. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

The expansion of such services potentially creates a new realm of unregulated activity that blurs the boundaries between public and private space and may undermine the principle of equal access to goods and services. We investigate access for people with disabilities to Airbnb rentals using a randomized field experiment of 3,847 lodging requests. We find that hosts were less likely to preapprove requests from travelers with blindness, cerebral palsy, dwarfism, or spinal cord injury than to approve travelers without disabilities. The differences are only partially attenuated among hosts advertised as “wheelchair accessible,” and the host responses did not vary significantly by whether the response was made before or after Airbnb required all users to agree to a new nondiscrimination policy. A supplementary MTurk survey of hosts found that both physical accessibility concerns and negative attitudes play independent roles in the lower likelihood of preapprovals for travelers with disabilities, supporting both taste-based and social models of discrimination. Our findings raise questions about the reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which applies to hotels but not to most Airbnb hosts. The platform economy appears to create substantial challenges in ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. The findings can inform theoretical development on discrimination, boundaries of the firm, and economic regulation of organizations. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

The logics of crowd work were different from the dominant logics of expert research at Amnesty. We detail how seemingly contrasting logics can coexist as complementary without leading to transformative change. We find that the coexistence re-quired major resource injections because of the foreignness of the underlying practices of crowd work. We discover and appropriate xenografting as an organizational approach for understanding this coexistence. Xenografting adds a new approach to logics pluralism and a temporal dimension to the digital transformation literature. © 2020, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Even “shared value” approaches insist that the win-win formula always meets the needs of the bottom line first. Recently, however, scholars have called into question the effectiveness of the “business case” justification and have even suggested that it might do more harm than good. The problems arise because the business case may not actually motivate managers to act, it may be alienating to those for whom the business case is being made, and it may create moral struggles for the people who feel they must make the business case to justify social action. As a result, although the field of strategic management and management more generally has been focused on establishing if, or under what conditions, corporate social responsibility is associated with financial performance, emerging research suggests that this kind of evidence would not necessarily have a positive impact on making a change. © of the Academy of Management.",,

In three studies using different methodologies (an online survey, an experimental online study, and a field study including multiple sources of data), the current work re-veals novel curvilinear relationships between leadership styles—transformational and management-by-exception passive—and followers’ outcomes in the context of employee safety (i.e., safety motivation, behaviors, and accident rate). Combining leadership theory with Mischel’s (1973) theoretical framework of situational strength, we propose that leaders create strong situations when there are high levels of perceived clarity and consistency of their leadership style. High levels of a specific leadership style provide unequivocal infor-mation, which enables followers to understand the desirability of specific safety behaviors. Low levels also convey a clear and consistent message to followers because the leaders consistently, clearly, and predictably demonstrate nonleadership and followers know what to expect from the leader. As demonstrated in a fourth study, however, moderate levels of a specific leadership style were perceived by followers as less clear and consistent and thus could create “weak” situations that eventually reduce safety at the individual and team levels. These findings have significant implications for the leadership literature and for employee safety outcomes, suggesting an array of possibilities for future research. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

The development of valid individual-level measures of organizational legitimacy, reputation, and status presents an essential step in the ad-vancement of organizational theory toward a multilevel perspective on these constructs. To address this research agenda, we examine the dimensions along which one can distinguish cognitive legit-imacy, sociopolitical legitimacy, reputation, and status judgments, and, in a series of four studies, we develop direct, reflective measures of these social judgments at the individual evaluator level, report correlations among them, and explore associations of our measures with extant measurement instruments. The proposed scale departs from instruments proposed in the extant literature in several respects: (1) it is generalizable across different social contexts, (2) it is not affected by changes in the importance of specific dimensions, and finally, (3) it empirically discriminates among different types of social judgments and highlights areas where empirical distinctions among constructs are blurred. The findings lay the empirical foundation for more nuanced research on cognitive legitimacy, sociopolitical legitimacy, reputation, and status and shed light on previously unexplored relationships among these constructs. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

Our results show that, after empirically accounting for “resting the starters,” the magnitude of the associations that have been previously taken to indicate coaches’ racial bias becomes small and not statistically distinguishable from zero.

Matching survey-based data on P4P adoption by 1,309 Danish firms with wage, demographic, and medical prescription data of 318,717 full-time employees, we find a 4–6 percent increase in the usage of antidepressant and antianxiety medication after firms adopt P4P. This change is strongest in low-performing and older workers. We also find that workers select in and out of P4P firms based on mental health considerations, which implies that mental health effects influence turnover. We similarly show that low performers are more likely to leave following P4P adoption. Finally, we show sizable but imprecise response differences from female and male employees to the mental health threat of performance-based pay. Women with latent or potential mental health concerns appear to leave firms after P4P adoption, whereas men do not. Although we cannot claim a causal relationship, collectively, our results suggest a model where performance-based pay forces many employees to choose between leaving or else depression and anxiety. Our study expands the existing work by showing that the mental health costs of performance-based pay can be severe enough to necessitate pharmaceutical treatment. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

As the economy is becoming increasingly knowledge-based and service-oriented, the professional service firms (“PSFs”) are of particular importance. Being characterized by high knowledge intensity, low capital intensity, and professionalized workforces, these firms have developed certain management practices and organizational forms. However, despite being persistent and remarkably successful over time, PSFs are starting to change. This article suggests that digitalization is the driver of these changes and draws on empirical data from law firms to analyze the effects of digitalization on the distinctive characteristics of PSFs. The findings show that digitalization enables legal service delivery at lower levels of knowledge intensity, whereas it increases capital intensity for most firms and decreases the professionalization of the workforce. Consequently, this article argues that digitalization has changed the distinctive characteristics of PSFs, which promotes new practices, allows for variation, and transforms their competitive contexts. In light of these findings, we should reconsider our understanding of PSFs. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

Understanding this is cru-cial for attaining employees’ acceptance, and so for successful initiative implementation. Drawing on timely cases of digitalization-induced change initiatives triggered by Industry 4.0, the digital networking of the manufacturing industry, we investigate manufacturing employees’ thoughts and feelings with regard to this proclaimed fourth industrial revolution. We employ the Zaltman metaphor elicitation technique (ZMET), a semi-structured, in-depth interview format, to unearth individuals’ deep-seated beliefs and values, and thereby identify five distinct frames (utilitarian, functional, anthropo-centric, traditional, and playful) which drive employees’ attitudes toward Industry 4.0. Based on this inductive approach and our further analysis of frame adoption patterns, we make a first step toward a cognitive theory on the perception of digitalization-induced change that foregrounds employees’ perspectives and helps us understand why and when certain employees accept digitalization-induced change, whereas others do not. Our findings inform managerial practice on (i) how to promote far-reaching digitalization initiatives across employees and (ii) how to address the individual employee via frame-contingent communication to increase the likelihood of successful implementation. Furthermore, our study adds to theory on cognitive frames, ambivalent attitudes toward change, and framing effectiveness. Finally, our study makes a methodological contribution by adapting ZMET, a market research technique (geared toward customers), to the manufacturing shop floor (geared toward employees). © Academy of Management Discoveries 2020.",,

Through the research reported here, I developed theory in this area by exploring how people make sense of a particular form of insight: self-referential insights—or epiphanies—concerning their work or career. My findings indicate that although people view their epiphanies as having played a critical role in resolving psychological tension they once faced, the cognitive operations underlying epiphanies are so inscrutable that people ultimately focus their accounts on the conditions in which they believe their epiphanies were born. As these accounts reveal, people are inclined to at-tribute their epiphanies to serendipitous circumstances. At the same time, people believe their epiphanies came about because they were open to the possibility of being transformed and attuned to events that could help trigger this transformation. These findings provide cause to rethink assumptions in the field of management underlying research on inter-pretation and attribution and illuminate the potentially critical, although undertheorized, role of “readiness” in fostering epiphanies and solving problems at work. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Our results show that business model explains a significant amount of variance in ROA (5.1 percent) and market share (7.9 percent), indicating that business model matters—it is comparable in importance to industry effects. Finally, our results indicate that the business model effect varies with op-erating experience, suggesting that, over time, businesses are able to develop capabilities for idiosyncratic business model design.

In AI, we show that a number of large corporations including Google, Facebook, and their Chinese counterparts hire leading researchers and publish increasing amounts of high-quality basic research. Conventional explanations of corporate science fail to fully explain why corporations would undertake this research and disseminate their results. We suggest that a central aspect of digitalization—the rising importance of data as a strategic resource—drives corporate participation in AI science and publication. Owning strategic data resources makes firms lead users of AI tools, gives them a novel comparative advantage over universities in doing research in AI, and constitutes a specialized complementary asset that facilitates value appropriation. We conclude that the phenomenon we observe reflects an overall shift in the sources of competitive advantage in AI, from exclusivity in technology to exclusivity in data. © 2020, Academy of Management.

Across three studies, using an abductive, incremental research strategy of corroboration and extension, we build an initial typology of categories of cues. Our findings show that, as the literature suggests, members use Outcomes as a source of cues. More interestingly, Outcomes play only a minor role in the sources of cues participants use. Instead, we find that group members draw more heavily on Motivation, Affect, and Common Understanding as sources of cues when they recall prior experiences in groups. We discuss the implications of these discoveries, highlighting the need and potential to further explore the role of members’ experiences in group theorizing, and their implications for general conceptual frameworks for the study of groups, as well as for opening new directions for more complex understandings of groups. © 2020, Academy of Management.

Firms are increasingly using blockchains for various applications; the most prominent of which to date are digital currencies. In this article, we aim to increase our theoretical understanding of the driving forces behind the success and volatility of digital currencies. We use a detailed dataset of 345 digital currencies for our explorative analysis and identify some of the key factors that can explain their performance. We find that the success and volatility of digital currencies depend on their business type (i.e., whether they relate to a platform business or not) and on their technology type (i.e., whether they are based on their own specialized blockchain technology or on a third-party standardized platform blockchain). Our findings suggest that, paradoxically, to obtain the promised benefits of this decentralized technology, firms need to centralize part of it to retain control over critical strategic dimensions (data and rules for transaction). We discuss the implications of our discovery for other contexts undergoing digital transformation. © 2020, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

To understand why and how CBEs successfully come into existence, we conduct an exploratory case study of two community-based pubs founded in rural Bavaria, Germany, in the 2010s. Using abductive data analysis, we uncover several collective identity mechanisms that spur community mobilization and entrepreneurial action. Specifically, we find that, whereas an incumbent collective village identity lays the ground for successful CBE creation, an emergent enterprising community identity is critical to go beyond venture inception. Through identification with the entrepreneurial project, supporters develop a lasting commitment to it—reinforced over time through artifacts, rituals, and celebrations—which further feeds and sustains its implementation. Our study paves the way for future research on entrepreneurship, collective action, and identity in local communities. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

Exploring these questions furthers our understanding of how high-technology founders’ experiences influence their firms’ outcomes taking into consideration gender. Data show the variety of career paths that lead to women starting technology firms. The study discovers that female and male high-technology entrepreneurs have very similar education and occupational backgrounds. However, the backgrounds of founders play a significant role in the likelihood that their firms suffer a negative closure, are acquired, or obtain venture capital, but in different ways depending on gender. These results confirm the importance of examining heterogeneity in women entrepreneurs’ background. Moreover, the study highlights that similar types of human capital can be regarded and experienced differ-ently.

Financial innovation is one way through which resources can be secured, while also providing business opportunities for market actors. The insurance sector, in particular, has been at the forefront of such innovation, developing financial instruments to manage the flooding, fire, and storm risks that characterize an increasingly unstable world. We examine one such financial instrument—the catastrophe bond—which transfers extreme risk from insurers and reinsurers to capital markets. Using a comprehensive database of all catastrophe bonds issued through March 2016, we find that the modeling which underlies catastrophe bonds is not demonstrably better than guesswork at predicting the financial consequences of extreme events. Moreover, secondary data reveal that market actors are under no illusions about the level of precision and accuracy provided by the models. Our analysis suggests that catastrophe bonds do not lend themselves to analysis through con-ventional sociological theories of financial markets. Drawing on theories of ignorance, we reflect on the social arrangements that sustain financial markets in contexts of extreme uncertainty. We conclude with some cautionary notes for harnessing financial tools in support of the SDGs. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Using multiple qualitative data sources, I find that Chinese-style developmental leadership integrates authoritarianism and benevolence, two seemingly paradoxical leadership approaches. Specifically, when Chinese leaders consider their subordinates’ development their core duty and make it their priority, they (1) emphasize discipline by instantly correcting mistakes and granting a second chance in the condition of absolute obedience; (2) take the initiative to remove obstacles that prevent subordinates from cultivation, of which subordinates may not be aware; (3) insist on the pursuit of excel-lence in the face of challenges to allow subordinates to discover their full potential; and (4) engage in role modeling to urge subordinates to comply with their instructions as a means of dealing with crises. Such behaviors in turn enhance subordinates’ professional capabilities, interpersonal insight, and self-transcendence. I further contrast developmental leaders with exploitative ones, who alternate authoritarianism and “pseudo-benevolence” in the face of conflicts of interest, and conclude with a theoretical model of how Chinese leaders’ integration of authoritarianism and benevolence approaches is possible and an effective form of developmental leadership. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Newcomers learn these unwritten rules through organizational socialization. In organizations with dominant and subordinate groups, structural power can shift between groups as the resources they control ebb and flow. We examine how entering the organization in a dominant group affects (1) the ability to exert influence following subsequent structural shifts in power and (2) the rate at which people learn to wield influence. On one hand, entering in a dominant group may boost self-efficacy and cat-alyze social learning about effective influence tactics. On the other hand, entering in a dominant group may make people susceptible to the adverse psychological consequences of experiencing power, which inhibit social learning. We examine these dynamics in the context of the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2005. We find partial support for both accounts: (1) senators who entered in the political majority were less effective than their counterparts who entered in the minority at converting subsequent structural shifts of power into influence; however, (2) majority entrants learned how to wield influence following such shifts at a faster rate than did minority entrants.

For these companies, the social issue of obesity constitutes a strategic social–business tension. We conduct a qualitative study of the print media coverage on the public debate around obesity to analyze how companies discursively respond to strategic tensions around this widely salient issue. We identify the accepting-defensive approach to strategic social– business tensions that companies use to protect the autonomy over their core business vis-à-vis pressures and demands from the public debate around obesity. We unearth the two discursive mechanisms—choice of discursive tactics and construction of ten-sions—that underlie this accepting-defensive approach. In contrast to what the literature on organizational tensions suggests, corporate responses to strategic tensions go beyond the dichotomy of accepting-constructive and rejecting-defensive responses.

We analyze the relationship between nonprofit density and city sustainability as well as the moderating effect of the socio-economic characteristics of the cities in which LENOs operate. We find that a higher density of LENOs is associated with a reduction in a city’s toxic contamination and an increase in the number of buildings with an environmental certification. Interestingly, we find that this relationship is stronger in cities that have greater education levels, are more innovative, host large corporations’ headquarters, and have a higher per capita income. However, the link between LENO density and city sustainability is lower in communities with higher income inequality. We discuss the plausible mechanisms governing these relationships and suggest future directions for organizational research. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

Social network research has traditionally defined brokerage in structural terms as a broker who stands between two disconnected parties. Alongside this structural definition, network research has generally made assumptions about, but rarely measured, the brokerage processes engaged when individuals inhabit such network po-sitions. More recent work argues for explicitly addressing brokerage behavior, principally in the form of three brokerage action orientations that focus on distinct brokerage action: joining network contacts (or tertius iungens), mediating between network contacts, and separating network contacts. We advance this emerging research stream by developing measures of mediation and separation brokerage orientations. These two measures, alongside the preestablished tertius iungens measure (Obstfeld, 2005), present the op-portunity to study the role of multiple brokerage orientations and social network structure together. In Studies 1, 2, and 3, we provide evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of each measure. In Study 4, we establish criterion-related validity by demon-strating the importance of each measure on network structure and innovation outcomes. In so doing, we lay the groundwork for future research to explore how brokerage behavior orientations influence additional organizational phenomena. © 2019, Academy of Management.

This study investigates the migration, work, and adaptation experiences of North Korean escapees living and working in capitalist South Korean society. Using grounded theory methods, we uncover an underlying mechanism of cross-regime work adaptation, the internalization of capitalist work norms into the migrants’ personal values. This mechanism is linked with the migrants’ adoption of an opportunity-focused approach to the new environment and the emergence of post-migration goals in response to perceived opportunities. This adaptation process is par-ticularly characteristic of those motivated to escape for economic reasons, whereas those motivated to escape by political reasons actually resist assimilation. As a function of pre-and postmigration experiences, individual migrants are found to differ in their in-ternalization of capitalist work norms—from high (integration of norms) to moderate (compliance with norms) to low (resistance to norms). High internalization is linked to such work-related adaptation behaviors such as acquiring new skills and building supportive workplace relationships. We offer theoretical and practical implications for work adaptation in cross-cultural settings and for cross-regime migrants in particular. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

It is easy to find examples of how boredom can engender other negative emotional states that often lead to somewhat negative—albeit unintended—outcomes (e.g., risky or de-linquent behaviors). But does boredom invariably lead to negative consequences? Could being bored also have less obvious effects, such as increased creativity? We explore the consequences of being bored using three experimental studies that manipu-late boredom and identify the benefits for creativity of being bored. In Study 1, we found that boredom helped boost individual productivity on an idea-generation task. In Study 2, we showed that the boredom manipulation only increased boredom and not other negative activating emotions (i.e., anger and frustration), thus highlighting boredom’s unique effect on creativity. In Study 3, we found that boredom did not universally increase creativity for a product development task; instead, only those individuals with a high learning goal orientation (LGO), high need for cognition (NOC), high openness to experience, and high internal locus of control (LOC) showed a significant increase in creativity when feeling bored. These counterintuitive findings offer an empirical basis and theoretical motivation for viewing boredom as a variety-driving emotion that motivates individuals to engage in novelty-seeking responses—i.e., engaging in different, often unusual, ways of doing things that are unlike typical or predictable responses. Building on our findings, we discuss how organizations can use this untapped resource to motivate employees for positive outcomes. © 2019, Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,

Our study reports results based on a novel, hand-collected dataset of 249 mainly privately held North American certified B Corporations over 2011–2014. Our results, derived from a difference-in-difference framework, and augmented with insights from a set of in-depth interviews, identifies a short-term growth slowdown arising from certification, which is more pronounced for the smallest and youngest firms. These findings highlight the need for management theorists to pay greater attention to internal re-organization costs and external benefits flowing from B Lab certification; they also carry important practical implications for organizations contemplating certification. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

As business activities breach planetary boundaries, sustainable development is more critical and urgent than ever. Yet, the world has not stood still as the broader field of management studies contemplates the importance of sustainable de-velopment. Major advances in digital technologies and the erosion of social institutions has created a perfect storm, so that sustainable development may be an even more elusive ideal. In this Guidepost, I discuss the implications to sustainable development researchers and management researchers more broadly, specifically speaking to the contexts we explore, the theories we employ, and the methods we apply. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,
EMBEDDEDNESS ACROSS GOVERNANCE MODES: IS THERE A LINK BETWEEN PREMERGER ALLIANCES AND DIVESTITURES?,2019,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069663078&doi=10.5465%2famd.2017.0134&partnerID=40&md5=9ba71956fc539e230a0dd076e07b83c3,"The present study explores whether and how an organization’s different types of governance modes—alliances, mergers, and divestitures—may be intertwined over time. As such, we consider whether boundary decisions may be socially embedded not just within, but across different governance modes. In particular, we focus the analysis on a specific three-stage temporal sequence, which represents a common trajectory of consecutive governance modes: (1) alliance, followed by (2) merger, followed by (3) divestiture. Based on data from the Securities Data Company (SDC) Platinum database and the Compustat database, our survival analysis results indicate that premerger alliances are significantly associated with divestiture likelihood: mergers between organizations that had been involved in an alliance before entering into the merger are found less likely to be divested. The article’s results underline the merits of simultaneously considering multiple types of ties when analyzing issues related to organizational embeddedness, complement recent research on sequential corporate strategy patterns, and shed new light on the important empirical phenomenon of premerger alliances. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

Across four experiments, I investigate people’s beliefs about the authenticity of algorithmic work, compared with human work. People believe algorithmic work is less authentic than human work because they believe it exhibits com-paratively less moral authenticity, or sincerity relevant to a specific category (Experiments 1 and 2). However, people do not distinguish between human and algorithmic work when it comes to type authenticity, or accuracy when it comes to repre-senting a specific category. Because of these authenticity attributions, people also believe algorithms’ characteristically moral decisions are relatively less ethical than identical human decisions (Experiment 3). To address these perceptions, organizations can in-crease algorithms’ seeming authenticity by highlighting human involvement in their creation or training processes (Experiment 4). I discuss implications given the increasing prevalence of automation. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

Although government incentives exist for the development of drugs for rare diseases, these inter-ventions have yielded insufficient progress. Drawing on an in-depth case study of rare diseases therapies, we explore how the practices of two nonprofit organizations allowed them to circumvent the endemic market and government failures involving positive externalities by using generic drug repurposing—i.e., seeking new therapeutic applica-tions for existing generic drugs. Beyond elucidating the potential of generic drug repurposing for those suffering from rare diseases, our discoveries provide important insights into the mutual constitution of organizational arrangements for societal challenges and the practices they host. By showing how organizational arrangements can both reinforce and extend practices such that they enable practitioners to achieve a standard of excellence, our study advances practice theory and research on the comparative efficacy of alternative organizational arrangements for tackling societal challenges. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,
BACKSTAGE INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION: CORPORATE ENDORSEMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS,2019,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086334287&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0154&partnerID=40&md5=ba17872a559fca889cfc3aca0d6edf23,"In September 2015, the United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals as the global development agenda. Since then, many companies have endorsed the goals. However, research has yet to address the emergent interorganizational processes that led to corporate endorsement of the goals. In this article, we address the question: What were the emergent interorganizational processes over time and space that led to corporate endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals? To answer this question, we draw on a longitudinal ethnographic study of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development from 2008 to 2018 and other sources of qualitative data. Our main discovery is that member companies’ endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goalswastheresultofemergentandun-foreseen interorganizational dynamics between two initially separate collaborations. We find three common antecedents (organizational convening capabilities, existing visions for global sustainability, and overlapping professional networks) and three triggering mechanisms (cross-fertilization by a science-based boundary object, embrace of disequilibrium, and boundary spanning work) to explain member companies’ endorsement of the goals. We show how the amalgamation of these three triggering mechanisms over time and space drove rare interorganizational dynamics that led to business endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019, Academy of Management.

WORK–LIFE BALANCE AS A HOUSEHOLD NEGOTIATION: A NEW PERSPECTIVE FROM RURAL INDIA,2019,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096909728&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0105&partnerID=40&md5=9cf973ab4d621e97f76567e973faa984,"Bringing more women into the formal workforce is an important component of corporate strategies, development efforts, and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, these policies often do not consider the household work that women already do to support the survival of their families, making work-for-wages impossible or creating time famines for women who attempt to do both. Thus, for women to engage in work-for-wages, they must find a way to alleviate their work-for-households. Using the analytical lens of household decision-making from anthropology, our analysis of working women in rural India shows that, far from being an individual decision about time allocation, women’s ability to work formal jobs was a family project to reallocate labor. These insights suggest that the focus on the individual in work–life balance literature and policy-making inadequately represents a phenomenon that involves other household members, implicitly or explicitly. It also highlights the need to broaden our definition of “work” to include both the paid and unpaid labor that is vital to people’s survival. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

Although prior research has demonstrated the benefits of developmental networks, we know relatively little about how these networks change over time or the antecedents of developmental network dynamics. As research on career and adult development theory has suggested, professional development occurs within a dynamic, relational context; therefore, exploring network dynamics may enable future research to gain greater in-sight into how career trajectories unfold. In a 10-year, four-wave prospective longitudinal survey study of 136 U.S. business school students and more than 1,600 of their relationships, we explore the dynamics of developmental networks, including the starting points (intercepts) and the rates of change (slopes) of the content of help provided (average career and psychosocial support) and the networks’ structure (network density, tie closeness, and communication frequency). Our multilevel longitudinal analyses show how these network characteristics change over time and how the content and structure of the support provided covary. Furthermore, we explore individual-and organizational/ industry-level antecedents of network change trajectories. We conclude with implications of our discoveries for future theory-building and research on developmental net-works, mentoring, and careers, and offer suggestions for consideration for practice. © 2019, Academy of Management.

SUSTAINABLE CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION: BUILDING A GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR SOCIAL IMPACT,2019,Academy of Management Discoveries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083487078&doi=10.5465%2famd.2018.0112&partnerID=40&md5=e6daf5b107eb4b4c03b8c0cead4e3012,"Addressing societal issues increasingly requires multistakeholder collaboration. Yet, cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) are often difficult to form and maintain because of coordination problems and conflicting interests of the organizations involved. To better understand how organizations overcome these challenges, we take a micro-foundational approach. First, we conducted an in-depth case study of a consulting firm to examine the emergence of a platform for CSPs. Second, using survey data from 665 employees, we identified critical elements that contributed to the stability of the platform. Our findings reveal how a for-profit organization can play a key role in coordinating other organizations to achieve social impact. We found that the emergence and stability of the platform were based on a novel operating model that aligned senior leaders’ interests in improving employee retention, employees’ desire for meaning in their work, and em-ployees’ willingness to make short-term financial sacrifices to participate. Our study suggests that for-profit firms can play a central role in social impact collaborations but that doing so requires alignment of internal interests through intrapreneurship. It also underlines the potential value of using a micro-foundation approach in future research into CSPs. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019.",,

To understand how agents resolve the performance paradox, we conducted a mixed-methods study with call center agents in a large financial services organization. In study 1, we examined agents’ moves using a discourse analysis of calls. We discovered 10 discourse moves that reflect two novel strategies for call center customer service: solidarity building and conversation control. In study 2, we assessed the effects of the two discourse strategies on agents’ paradox resolution. Configurational analyses show that agents who resolved the paradox synthesized solidarity-building and conversation-control strategies effectively. Conversely, agents who emphasized only on solidarity building or conversation control experienced performance trade-offs. Our findings suggest that to overcome the triple trade-offs between courtesy, efficiency, and effectiveness, call center agents must execute a complex dance of moves to build solidarity with callers while controlling the conversation. We discuss implications of our findings for research and practice on customer service and performance paradoxes. © Academy of Management Discoveries.",,

WHY HAVE ALL WESTERN INTERNET FIRMS (WIFS) FAILED IN CHINA?

In contrast to western firms from other sectors, which have all achieved different levels of success in China, no WIFs, from search engines, internet content providers, and social networks to e-commerce and sharing economy platforms, have been able to beat their Chinese competitors and achieve sustainable operational success in China. Government censorship and control and cultural differ-ences between China and the West are often cited as the main reasons for such failures, but similar conditions existed in other countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, or Saudi Arabia, which did not prevent WIFs such as Google from dominating more than 90 percent of their search markets. Existing international business theory, the Ownership-Location-Internalization (OLI) eclectic paradigm, failed to offer plausible explanations. Using comprehensive empirical evidence gathered from two rounds of elite interviewing, this article identifies the key factors and the prevailing narratives from both the inside view and outside view to explain why all WIFs have failed in China. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. Future research should examine the key factors that led to the systematic failure of WIFs in China, particularly by testing propositions and developing new theoretical frameworks. The lessons from this research will shed light on our understanding of globalization strategies in rapid-changing industries, with potential implications for general management theories in the digital age. © Academy of Management Discoveries 2019,.",,

"Employee-organization relationship, psychological ownership and contextual performance: A social exchange perspective",2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858387782&partnerID=40&md5=bd8c384f438041187ff1510be570e874,Data obtained from 254 supervisor-subordinate dyads were used to test a moderated mediation model of the processes linking perceptions of organization-based social exhange and contextual performance. Path analytic tests of the model revealed that the indirect influence of perceptions of organization-based social-exchange on job dedication (but not interpersonal facilitation) through psychological ownership was stronger when procedural justice was higher than when it was lower. The results partially supported the hypothesized moderated mediation model.,Contextual performance; Organization-based social exchange; Psychological ownership,Contextual performance; Procedural justice; Psychological ownership; Social exchange
It is not just what you have but how you present it: How subcategorization affects opera market identies,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863358804&partnerID=40&md5=b4955217a854de50ceab57407af2b6ca,"This study examines how organizations can shape external perceptions of their market identities by merely changing the ordering of identity-defining features within the product offerings that define their market identities. We argue that organizations can increase or decrease the perception of subcategories and therefore ultimately the appeal of a market identity by deliberately interspersing identity-defining features. Statistical analyses of the seasonal opera repertoires from 79 U.S. opera companies from 1995 to 2005 support for our arguments: The interspersed ordering of operas within a repertoire affects season ticket sales positively, whereas it does not affect single ticket sales.",Categorization; Category; Identity,Categorization; Category; Identity; Product offerings; Subcategorization; Commerce
Harnessing positive mood for team learning facilitation: The role of perceived team feedback,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858414219&partnerID=40&md5=ce60b2b08c8c21a810b3163e80eb8047,"This study examines the influence of individual team members' positive mood and perceived team feedback on their facilitation of team learning. Results of multilevel analyses using a sample of 186 members from 27 work teams showed that positive mood was positively associated with the team learning facilitation of individual members if they perceived high team feedback, but not if they perceived low team feedback. Further, team-level analyses demonstrated that members' aggregated team learning facilitation was positively related to the supervisor's ratings of team innovation. These results offer new insights into why the contributions of individual members to their team's learning may differ and suggest that, if managed effectively, members' positive mood may be an important resource in facilitating team learning and innovation.",Positive mood; Team feedback; Team learning,Multi-level analysis; Positive mood; Team innovation; Team learning; Team members; Work team
Alternative paths to competitive advantage: A fuzzy set analysis of the origins of large firms,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858411867&partnerID=40&md5=4f587f8077ae0effd5d06b2c43f5b1eb,"Scholars have documented the importance of national level factors for the competitive success of firms on a global scale. These studies typically identify multiple factors that are behind the competitive advantage of firms in particular national clusters. However, there has been relatively little research identifying whether these factors are all collectively necessary to produce the outcome or whether few of these factors in different combinations are sufficient to generate the shift in competitive advantage. In this paper, we study the evolution of one industry across six countries in which the competitive position of national firms changed considerably during our one hundred year analysis period. Our results show that the unequal distribution of resources may lead to alternative causal pathways to competitive advantage.",Competitive advantage of nations; Fuzzy set; Industry evolution,Competition; Fuzzy sets; Industry; Alternative path; Competitive advantage; Competitive advantage of nations; Competitive position; Competitive success; Global scale; Industry evolution; Multiple factors; National level; Factor analysis
"Leader development, identity, and goal orientation: A study of personal change trajectories",2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858380743&partnerID=40&md5=bc22ce19e3170700dd5abfe1e730df1f,"Leadership development is a topic of widespread interest; however, relatively little is known about the developmental process or factors that might influence it. To address this shortcoming, the personal change trajectories of participants (N = 1315) engaged in team-based action learning projects (k = 205) to promote leader development were estimated using multilevel growth modeling techniques. Evidence was found in support of differences in the initial leadership effectiveness levels across participants as well as differences in the shape or form of their personal trajectories. Based on recent theorizing on leader development (Day, Harrison, & Halpin, 2009), hypotheses were proposed and tested predicting that adopting a leader identity would serve as a within-person, time-varying covariate of leadership effectiveness and that goal orientation would serve as a between-person, cross-level moderator of the personal change trajectories. Results suggested full support for the role of leader identity and partial support for goal orientation, with the most consistent and beneficial effects associated with a high mastery or learning goal orientation.",Goal orientation; Identity; Leader development,Action learning; Beneficial effects; Covariates; Goal orientations; Growth modeling; Identity; Leader development; Leadership development; Learning goals; Time varying; Trajectories
Compensatory legitimation: Naming strategies and the categorical imperative,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858380621&partnerID=40&md5=98b55fc0fe34cdf88e5c53ad9e5ec016,"This article simultaneously considers two alternative sources of legitimacy which have been studied independently in the literature: category conformity and common naming strategy. I develop the notion of ""compensatory legitimation"" as the mechanism through which organizations employ common naming strategy to overcome the categorical imperative and counter-balance the potential legitimacy loss of category spanning. Using data on the U.S. film industry from 1982 to 2007, this study shows that for film sequels where common naming provides a compensatory legitimatizing tool, rather than imposing economic and social penalties, genre spanning helps reduce audience satiation and leads to higher box office revenue. In addition to the legitimatizing function, organizational name can also be manipulated to a certain extent and meaningful subtitles can be attached to common naming to signal organizational distinctiveness. The results indicate that the signaling effects of text subtitle strategy in the U.S. film industry are significantly larger when accompanied by genre spanning. All results remain solid after a series of robust checks.",Category; Legitimacy; Naming strategies,Alternative source; Box office; Category; Film industry; Legitimacy; Naming strategies
Does task type moderate the effect of feedback sign on motivation and performance?,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858394491&partnerID=40&md5=5d7d8fab682fd898bf03c33c4561e33e,"Applying regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), we hypothesized that task type, as an antecedent to situational regulatory focus, moderates the effect of feedback sign on motivation and performance. First we pre-tested and established the effects of different tasks on perceived prevention or promotion foci; then we tested the moderating effect of task type on the effects of feedback sign on motivation and performance. The results indicate that individuals working on tasks requiring vigilance and attention to detail increase their self-reported motivation (Study 1) and actual performance (Study 2) more following negative feedback than following positive feedback, whereas the opposite is true for people working on creative tasks. These findings suggest that (a) regulatory focus not only affects performance, but that the performance of different tasks also affects regulatory focus; (b) variability in feedback sign effects can be partially explained by regulatory focus and task type.",Feedback sign; Motivation; Regulatory focus,Motivation; Attention to details; Moderating effect; Motivation and performance; Regulatory focus; Sign-on; Task type; Feedback
Multinationalization in response to reforms,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858387015&partnerID=40&md5=e37f5236fb4b14ce9164f472a18d7975,"We analyze the impact of structural reforms on the multinationalization strategy of developed, developing, and leastdeveloped country firms. Structural reforms are a form of institutional change whereby a countryâ€™ s institutional framework is realigned to improve governance and facilitate market functioning. We argue that structural reforms help firms become multinationals by reforming institutions that support the international competitiveness and multinationalization of firms. However, we propose that structural reforms have a differential impact on the multinationalization strategy of firms depending on the level of institutional voids in the country. Specifically, we argue that structural reforms have the highest positive impact on the multinationalization strategy of developing-country firms, followed by developed-country firms, and then by least-developed country firms. Structural reforms especially accelerate the multinationalization of developing-country firms by reducing institutional voids that constrain their competitiveness, institutional voids that are not prevalent in developed countries. However, this is not the case for firms from the least-developed countries because countries have to be above a threshold of institutional development for their firms to fully benefit from structural reforms. As such, structural reforms reduce the multinationalization gap between developed and developing-country firms, but increase the gap between least-developed country firms and those from more developed countries.",Developing countries; Multinationalization strategy; Structural reforms,Developing countries; Industry; Societies and institutions; Developed countries; Institutional change; Institutional development; Institutional framework; International competitiveness; Least-developed countries; Multinationalization strategy; Structural reforms; Competition
Differential effects of networking on career mobility,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858384943&partnerID=40&md5=95e63969f01f9741b1d7edec763539f6,"Do specific networking subcales predict specific mobility events? Prior research has established relations between networking and career outcomes, but has usually studied only a single outcome and has rarely developed theory why some networking subscales, but not others are related to an outcome. In the present study, we suggest that networking subscales differentially predict career mobility. Drawing on networking research as well as on career mobility research, we hypothesize that internal networking predicts intraorganizational promotions and external networking predicts organizational change. We use a prospective, longitudinal research design (N = 166 employed individuals) to examine these assumptions. We measure networking with a multifaceted questionnaire (internal vs. external networking and building vs. maintaining vs. using contacts) and assess participants' first career mobility event in the subsequent twoyear period (i.e., getting promoted vs. changing organization vs. staying in the same job). Multinomial logistic regression analyses show that internal networking predicts getting promoted as well as organizational change, whereas external networking only predicts organizational change. Moreover internal networking subscales show a distinct relation with the timing of promotions suggesting that using contacts predicts temporally proximal promotions whereas building and maintaining contacts predict more distal promotion events.",Career mobility; Networking; Social capital,Forecasting; Management; Regression analysis; Differential effect; Longitudinal research; Mobility research; Multinomial logistic regression; Networking; Organizational change; Social capitals; Research
Entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance: The role of the senior team,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858384942&partnerID=40&md5=3f1679cd1b5424bed7bfe6317d160869,"Prior studies have argued that entrepreneurial orientation plays an important role in explaining firm performance. Using lagged data from 346 firms, our study investigates how senior team attributes moderate the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance. In addition, we assess the impact of the upper echelon attributes with respect to the level of environmental dynamism. Diversity positively moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance. However, this effect is dampened in dynamic environments. In contrast, the positive moderating effect of shared vision on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance exists only in dynamic environments.",Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm performance; Senior teams,Dynamic environments; Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm Performance; Moderating effect; Senior teams; Shared vision; Industry

Drawing on team learning literature, our research proposes that learning orientation and learning behavior together mediate the relationship of transformational leadership and team behavioral integration. Using the structural equation modeling approach, we find that transformational leadership promotes, directly and indirectly, team behavioral integration, while learning orientation and learning behavior produce direct effects. Moreover, learning orientation and learning behavior also intervene in the relationship of transformational leadership and team behavioral integration. The paper contributes to group dynamics perspective and team learning research by highlighting the prominence of behavioral integration in work team settings within the broad context of team leadership, learning climate, and learning behavior.",Behavioral integration; Team learning; Transformational leadership,Research; Group dynamics; Learning behavior; Learning orientation; Structural equation modeling; Team leadership; Team learning; Transformational leadership; Work team; Integration

Although conceptual and qualitative reviews have emerged, no study has explicitly attempted to examine the mediating role of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we develop moderated mediation model on social capital, knowledge transfer and performance. We distinguish between structural and relational capital, and argue that knowledge transfer is a necessary step in converting potential benefits of social capital into organizational outcomes. We also demonstrate how organizational boundaries (i.e. intra- and interorganizational context), and environmental context (i.e. the type of industry) moderate the relationships studied. By aggregating and consolidating existing research, our study not only reveals new insights into how social capital influences organizational knowledge transfer and performance, but also provides meaningful directions for future research.",Knowledge transfer; Performance; Social capital,Knowledge management; Research; Environmental contexts; Knowledge transfer; Meta-analysis; Organizational boundaries; Organizational knowledge; Organizational outcomes; Performance; Potential benefits; Relational capital; Social capitals; Economic and social effects

In addressing this tension, this study investigates how the battle for technological dominance affects firms' propensity to disclose knowledge in scientific journals. This study contributes to theory by showing that firms' publications in scientific journals, besides helping them access external knowledge to create innovations, as prior research emphasized, are an important arena where they compete to appropriate value from the innovations that they have already created.",Innovation; Management of technology and innovation; Research and development; Strategy; Technology,Industry; Innovation; Technology; Competitive advantage; External knowledge; Management of technology; Research and development; Scientific journals; Strategy; Competition

The results of this longitudinal, multi-source study (N = 384) indicated that high levels of performance were more strongly related to power ratings for highly politically skilled employees, and higher levels of performance were not related to power for individuals deficient in political skill.",Performance; Political skill; Power,Multisources; Performance; Political skills; Power; Power ratings; Skilled employees; Social sciences
Prospering in a hypercompetitive environment: The roles of TMT dynamics and competitive behavior,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863351100&partnerID=40&md5=423ca44fa043089c660029ad0882bf42,"Research on hypercompetition has focused extensively on the search for its existence and prevalence in the economy with relatively less attention to how firms can successfully manage in a hypercompetitive environment. Competitive dynamics research, on the other hand, has contended that firms advance by continuously taking competitive actions and responding to the actions of rivals but with little emphasis on the environmental context. The present study merges these closely related but thus far disparate research streams. It develops hypotheses that relate the intensity of the hypercompetitive environment to a firm's volume of actions, performance, and TMT managerial processes that we term socio-behavioral integration. Using a survey based sample of 201 Taiwanese firms and a structural equation modeling approach, findings show that such an environment is associated with reduced firm performance and TMT integration and indirectly influences action volume. The paper contributes to hypercompetition and competitive dynamics research by providing an integrated perspective of competitive behavior within the broad context of hypercompetitive environment, TMT dynamics, and firm performance.",Competitive dynamics; Hypercompetition; Top management teams,Dynamics; Integration; Research; Competitive behavior; Competitive dynamics; Environmental contexts; Firm Performance; Hypercompetition; Structural equation modeling; Top management teams; Industry
Lying by omission: The effect of withholding negative information on organizational learning,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863353886&partnerID=40&md5=86daf69df0ba4ae2d3e076194eb77a9a,"A central premise of the Behavioral Theory of the Firm is that performance feedback drives organizational learning (Cyert and March, 1963). With a few notable exceptions, most theoretical and empirical work so far assumes that performance feedback, whether positive or negative, is truthfully reported. Yet, performance feedback may be subject to systematic distortion - people in organizations are more likely to truthfully report positive, desirable feedback than negative, undesirable feedback. We raise the following question: Is the omission, or systematic distortion, of negative feedback detrimental to organizational learning? To study this, we design a simulation model of organization learning where organizational members do not always report the truth. We find that a moderate amount of information distortion is in fact beneficial to the organization. In contrast, when all negative information is reported, organizational learning performance is inferior because the organization is assumed to focus on local, immediate problems. However, we also find that when all negative information is distorted, performance is also inferior because the organization's perception of reality is at odds with reality itself. A moderate amount of distortion, however, generates the highest organizational performance.",Computer simulation; Organizational learning; Organizational silence,Computer simulation; Feedback; Amount of information; Behavioral theory; Negative information; Organization learning; Organizational learning; Organizational performance; Organizational silence; Performance feedback; Simulation model; Knowledge management

We argue that the use of relational governance is driven by perceptions of exchange hazards. In a departure from extant literature, we propose that the benefits accruing from observed relational governance in the outsourcing relationship depend on the manner in which exchange risks are shared. This highlights the role of the formal contract used to govern the relationship and the risk-sharing instituted therein. Formally, we hypothesize that relational governance provides benefits to an exchange partner only in those contracts in which they are exposed to greater risk. Therefore, we argue and show that the relationship between relational governance and vendor profitability is moderated by the formal contract used in the project. We test these arguments by examining 105 software projects completed by a software outsourcing vendor for multiple clients. We conclude with a discussion of the research and managerial implications of our findings.",,Profitability; Software engineering; Software testing; Managerial implications; Multiple clients; Risk-sharing; Software outsourcing; Software project; Outsourcing

As individuals gain experience, they become more skilled with tasks unique to the firm and better understand its culture. As workers gain experience together, this shared knowledge can improve coordination and effectiveness of interdependent, firm-specific tasks and processes. Improved performance at the group and firm level should result when firm specific jobs are matched with long tenured employees with considerable experience working together. For workers in more generic jobs, firm tenure and shared experience should have less effect on performance. We find support for these predictions through our analysis of thirteen years of rich data from the National Football League for offensive and defensive line players and teams, although we do find differences in the effects of tenure versus shared experience.",Firm-specific knowledge; Human capital theory; Strategic human resource management,Human resource management; Personnel; Firm-specific knowledge; Human capitals; Knowledge and experience; Shared experiences; Two sources; Industry

Despite significant attention focusing on the exchange and endorsement value of these relationships, and how they are formed, little attention has been given to their capacity to generate innovations. Using a multi-case, inductive study of eight technology collaborations between ten firms in the computing and communications industries, this paper examines how inter-organizational relationships engender innovation and adaptation in unpredictable and interdependent environments. Comparisons of successful and unsuccessful collaborations show that generating collaborative innovations depends not only on appropriate design conditions (e.g., governance form, social embeddedness) as suggested by prior literature, but also on using appropriate organizational processes that lead relationships over time. While less successful collaborations are associated with domineering leadership or consensus leadership processes, successful collaborations use a rotating leadership process that creates transient unilateral leadership opportunities for each partner. Rotating leadership involves alternating decision control between partners to engender high-quality contributions of technologies and IP, fluctuating cascades of network activation which dynamically modify innovative team composition, and zig-zagging relationship trajectories that effectively search the broader space of potential innovations. A broader contribution is to reframe inter-organizational relationships as organizational symbiosis, a state of organization that engenders mutually reinforcing adaptive changes to partner's strategies and structures.",Alliances; Innovation; Organization,Mergers and acquisitions; Societies and institutions; Alliances; Collaborative innovation; Communications industry; Decision control; Design condition; Governance forms; High quality; Innovative teams; Inter-organizational relationships; Organizational process; Social embeddedness; Innovation

To examine the applicability of the construct of political skill (Ferris et al., 2005) developed in a North American context to its interpretation within other cultures, we studied 198 Russian-speaking employees and found support for the cross-cultural generalizability of this construct. The construct confirmed the hypothesized four-factor structure, as well as demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity. Political skill was found to be positively related to emotional intelligence, conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion, and negatively related to neuroticism. We also provided validation evidence for the Political Skill Inventory (translated into the Russian language) on a non-American sample, thus making the instrument available for further research and managerial practices in Russia, and the former Soviet Union countries, where Russian is the operating language. The study further explored the explanatory potential of political skill. Political skill was found to be predictive of career success outcomes operationalized as a perception of career success, but not as objective career success measured as the number of promotions or bonuses. Contrary to our hypothesis, political skill was positively correlated with withdrawal intentions. Building on conceptual articles on contextualization (Johns, 2006; Mowday & Sutton, 1993), this study fills an important gap in the extant research by providing examples of how context (namely, discreet contextual variables of individual hierarchical position and tenure with an organization) may affect individual political skill and its outcomes.",Cross-cultural generalizability; Cross-cultural measure validation; Politicall skill,Contextual variables; Contextualization; Cross-cultural generalizability; Cross-cultural measure validation; Emotional intelligence; Interpersonal aspects; Managerial practices; North American; Organizational performance; Political skills; Politicall skill; Soft skills; Soviet Union; Social sciences

In this scenario, ""Territorial Governance"" is not only a governance process applied to urban and territorial policies but also a complex process that has specific characteristics stemming from its objective and territory and helps achieve the broader goal of territorial development and cohesion. Thus, understanding ""territorial"" needs is relevant. This aspect has emerged in recent decades and is characterized by increasing involvement of territorial entities. Citizen panels, open meetings, and public assemblies, for example, engage citizens, organizations, and firms with the goal of promoting sustainable development and direct participation in territorial governance policies. In particular, recent decades have seen the spread of a specific way of involving private and public organizations in the decision-making process related to territorial policies: the creation of public-private partnerships. The purpose of this paper is to examine this topic in depth, focusing on the impact that public-private partnerships may have on territorial governance. Specifically, in reviewing the governance theory literature, our goal is to propose a new model of territorial governance with specific elements derived from the experience of public-private partnerships. To do this, we fix our attention on a specific type of public-private partnership engaged in territorial development and cohesion: the Local Action Group (LAG). In particular, using a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study uses a sample of 63 LAGs located in Italy to highlight the LAG's role in challenges that territorial governance faces.

We posit that individuals that have diverse, heterogeneous knowledge relative to their colleagues and who can draw upon diverse contacts from across and outside their organization will have high status among their colleagues for developing new, creative solutions. The analysis is based on a comprehensive study of the knowledge and networks in an office of consulting engineers.

The 'hows' of dynamic capabilities: Underlying processes and their drivers,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858397462&partnerID=40&md5=1cecd6cb3e807958ab0a44411f69c950,"Recent theoretical discussions have emphasized that organizational processes are a central feature of capabilities. Little is known, however, about the underlying processes through which organizations undergo a change in resource position or operational capability and how these processes are associated with dynamic capabilities. A review of case studies that draw upon the dynamic capabilities approach is conducted to shed light upon this relationship and explore what enables the underlying processes through which dynamic capabilities are developed and deployed. Demonstrating that there is no strict distinction between the processes of dynamic capability development or deployment, our analysis of the case studies reveals that six classes of underlying processes exist that underpin both building new capabilities and putting existing capabilities into use. The core contribution of our paper is insight into the operation of an organization's dynamic capabilities. Findings show that dynamic capabilities operate as a function of a bundle of reinforcing underlying processes, which in turn emerge from core drivers that promote, guide, support and direct these bundles. Overall we contribute to the emerging discussion on the ""process side"" of dynamic capabilities by emphasizing refocusing this discussion on the relationship of dynamic capabilities, underlying processes and their drivers as a primary consideration for future research.",Drivers; Dynamic capabilities; Processes,Truck drivers; Dynamic capabilities; Operational capabilities; Organizational process; Processes; Research

We observe that most firms opt for similar integration structures for their incremental and radical NPD processes. At the same time, though, we find strong evidence that 1) firms that apply a cross-functional integration structure for the radical NPD process perform significantly better in terms of breakthrough innovation performance than firms that apply a functional integration structure for the radical NPD process and, 2) firms that apply a functional integration structure for the incremental NPD process perform significantly better in terms of derivative innovation performance than firms that apply a cross-functional integration structure for the incremental NPD process.

We focus in this study on two types of exploration, i.e., exploration from partners (EFP) and exploration beyond partners (EBP), to distinguish a dual role of a firm's innovation external corporate venturing partnerships. Both types of exploration refer to learning from external knowledge sources, but in a different way. On the one hand, a firm can overcome local search by exploring new technologies building on its partners' capabilities and technological strengths. On the other hand, a firm can further explore new technologies from other companies with which the focal innovating firm has had no prior external corporate venturing partnerships before (non-partner firms). In the latter case, although the external corporate venturing partnership does not govern the relationships between the focal firm and other companies, it may still impose influences on the exploratory learning of the focal firm from the non-partner firms. This dual role of external corporate venturing partnerships with regard to exploration deserves more attention because the extent literature has overlooked the second indirect role of external corporate venturing partnerships. Our findings show that external corporate venturing partnerships may enhance EFP and EBP. Furthermore, the significance of the influences of external corporate venturing partnerships on EFP and EBP is different, depending on the governance modes of the partnerships. We also found technological distance between the focal innovating firm and its external venturing partners has very different influences on EFP and EBP.",Alliance networks; Direct and indirect role of allies; Exploration,Natural resources exploration; Corporate venturing; Direct and indirect role of allies; Dual role; Exploratory learning; External knowledge; Innovation management; Local search; Technological distance; Technological strength; Mergers and acquisitions

How are the different existing units in the acquirer company affected by the acquisition of another facility? I argue that two important factors to understand the effects of acquiring another unit are geographic proximity and operational similarity. Using a unique dataset from a family-owned Brazilian agribusiness company, I find that an existing unit that is geographically close to a recently acquired unit experiences a decrease in its performance. In contrast, an industrial unit that is operationally similar to an acquiree experiences an increase in its operational performance. The evidence also shows that these two effects tend to decrease over time. Finally, the size of the existing unit counteracts these effects. The results illustrate the complexity of the relationship between acquisition events and performance across the firm.

However, determining what nanotechnology means, whose research counts as nanotechnology, and who gets to speak on behalf of those who do nanotechnology - essentially, the process of drawing boundaries around the field - is a highly political process of constant negotiation with significant implications for funding, legislation, and public support. In this paper, we focus on the construction of a high-profile moments of controversy about nanotechnology's possibilities: a debate between K. Eric Drexler and Richard Smalley, published as a ""point-counterpoint feature"" in Chemical & Engineering News. Rather than treat the debate as a stand-alone event of scientific controversy, we seek to broaden analysis to include, in addition to the statements of the key actors, important institutional and organizational contexts - particularly the role of science journalism and editorial decision-making. We situate the debate in its broader social, political, and cultural context in the hope of revealing important dimensions of how nanotechnology - as a field-in-tension - works. We highlight the role of the media in shaping the debate by simplifying a complex set of uncertainties into two polar views and drawing in Drexler and Smalley as focal actors to represent these opposing positions. We also shed light on the role of entrepreneurial and institutional actors in constructing the boundaries around an emerging technological field. As such, we provide a useful corrective to theories of institutional entrepreneurship, which tend to reify a few individual actors' efforts to shape those boundaries.",Framing; Media; Social construction of technology,Decision making; Cultural context; Emerging technologies; Framing; Media; Organizational context; Political process; Public support; Social construction of technology; Nanotechnology

Work assigned to teams is proposed to have varying degrees of Work Synergy Potential. This potential arises out of a differential sensitivity of task and task interdependence configurations to team processes. Work Synergy Potential is proposed to moderate the relationship between team autonomy and team effectiveness such that the benefits of using autonomous team designs will more likely be achieved when the work has a high synergy potential.

We develop a modeling structure that allows us to compare the viability of focus and flexibility when firms struggle to achieve temporary advantage in uncertain business environments. Quite surprisingly, we find that strategic focus is the right strategy when uncertainty frequently shifts the basis of successful business models, a finding that seriously questions the viability of strategic flexibility.",Strategic flexibility; Strategic focus; Temporary advantage,Adaptive capabilities; Business environments; Business models; Business opportunities; Modeling structures; Strategic flexibility; Temporary advantage

According to the horizon problem hypothesis, retiring CEOs may reduce expenditure in long-term investments. Since investing in social responsibility-related areas tends not to have an immediate impact on firm performance, I expect that retiring CEOs may reduce expenditure in social responsibility-related areas. In this paper, in addition to examining the occurrence of the horizon problem in the new context of CSP, I evaluate the behavioral assumption behind this opportunistic CEO behavior. While previous research generally assumes that the primary motivation behind this opportunistic CEO behavior is the compensation maximization at retirement, my finding suggests that CEO's concern about postretirement career may be more attributable. In further support of the post-retirement career concern argument, the result shows that providing CEO with a post-retirement job opportunity as a director of the board mitigates the negative impact of CEO retirement on CSP. In contrast, granting long-term compensation (e.g. stock option) to CEOs, which has been considered a primary solution of the horizon problem, is found not to have a statistically significant mitigating effect on the negative relationship between CEO retirement and CSP.",Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Horizon problem,Behavioral assumption; Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Horizon problem; Long-term investment; Mitigating effects; Social responsibilities

Using constructive developmental theory, we propose a two-stage model of individual growth and development in a dyadic follower-leader relationship. Constructive developmental theory concerns an adult's developmental movement or fundamental advancement in one's sense-making structure. Developmental movement is regarded as a major, profound-level change developing an individual into a higher-level entity, who has a more mature way of understanding the self and the world. Our proposed model suggests that any individual at a higher order in a follower-leader dyad is able to facilitate the developmental movement of their dyad counterpart. The model presented has two stages; the first stage discusses the creation of LMX as a necessary first step in paving the way for the subsequent advancement. The second stage of the model presents various mechanisms that can facilitate the developmental movement once positive LMX has been developed.",Constructive developmental theory; Followers; LMX,Constructive developmental theory; Followers; Growth and development; Leader-follower; Positive changes; Singular sources; Traditional models; Two stage model

Despite the variance in explanations, it is widely assumed that the widespread use of child labor is an inevitable feature of modernization. However, the experiences of nineteenth century Australia suggests that we need to be wary in making generalizations based solely upon Western European and North America events. In Australia, many factors - geography, climate, the nature of work, the role of the state in manufacturing - combined to limit demand for child labor. Such structural impediments are unlikely to have been unique to Australia.

Despite research on oppression, resistance, and emancipation, CMS scholars do not tend to focus on the field's own domination or to ensure that its emancipatory agenda offers any practical impact. The author loosely draws on Bourdieu's notions of habitus and symbolic violence to make sense of his experience of attempting to fit in the CMS community as a scholar interested in practical applications of CMS insights. The author argues that the estrangement between theory and practice in CMS is symptomatic of the same phenomenon in the broader organization studies community and that CMS is uniquely positioned to help organization studies become a phronetic science, both practical and capable of addressing questions of power and values, essential to management practice.",Bourdieu; Practice; Relevance,Bourdieu; Management practices; Marginalization; Organization studies; Practice; Relevance; Theory and practice

This literature provides an explicit characterization of the mapping from the value creation possibilities of firms in an industry to the value capture (i.e. profits) of individual firms. While the received theory implicitly assumes frictionless interactions and perfect rivalry, we incorporate a simple friction parameter that moderates the degree of rivalry in the market. In addition, we introduce barriers to entry and allow for the possible emergence of firm heterogeneity. Our aim is to make value-based analysis even more effective at integrating industry and firm/resource levels of analysis. We find that there is a non-monotonic relationship between industry-level frictions and firm value capture. We show that the effects of rivalry and barriers to entry on industry attractiveness cannot be analyzed independently. Firm heterogeneity emerges naturally with the introduction of frictions and advantaged firms prefer industries with lower levels of frictions than disadvantaged firms.",Formal modeling; Industry analysis; Value creation and value capture,Competition; Firm heterogeneity; Formal model; Friction parameters; Industry analysis; Levels of analysis; Value captures; Value creation; Value creation and value captures; Friction

Direct reciprocity predicts that obligation toward network members increases to the extent that one receives resources directly from others. In the case of socio-emotional resources, such as friendship and mentorship, this obligation is mediated by affective closeness. Indirect reciprocity predicts that obligation is felt toward others simply as a function of their inclusion in one's network, implying that obligation increases with the others' degree of embeddedness in the network. Results from two network surveys supported these hypotheses.",Network; Obligation; Social exchange,Felt; Networks (circuits); Embeddedness; Indirect exchange; Indirect reciprocities; Obligation; Social exchange; Human resource management

According to Burgelman and Grove's (2007) qualitative investigation of Intel Corporation's evolution from 1976 to 2005, corporate longevity depends on how a firm's strategic leaders facing nonlinear industry dynamics balance autonomous (exploratory) and induced (exploitative) strategy processes. They suggest that strategic leaders should increase exploitation when their firm introduces decisive changes in the rules of competition, whereas they should augment exploration when other players introduce significant rule changes in their industry. In this paper, we simulate Burgelman and Grove's (2007) model to examine their heuristics for balancing exploration and exploitation over time and find support for it. Finally, we discuss our findings and draw implications for future research to help firms and their strategic leaders to achieve adaptive ambidexterity.",Adaptive ambidexterity; Balancing exploration and exploitation; Strategic dynamics,Dynamics; Adaptive ambidexterity; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Implications for futures; Industry dynamics; Intel corporations; Strategic dynamics; Strategic leaders; Strategy process; Competition
Assessing differences between realized and anticipated gains from Electronic Health Record adoption,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088715842&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44246093&partnerID=40&md5=9d0606d74db2497ec448f5df61fc4dc2,"Background: Return on investment (ROI) concerns related to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a major barrier to the technology's adoption. Physicians generally rely upon early adopters to vet new technologies prior to putting them into widespread use. Therefore, early adopters' experiences with EHRs play a major role in determining future adoption patterns. Objective: The paper's purposes are: 1) to map the EHR Value Streams that define the ROI calculation; and 2) to compare Current Users' and Intended Adopters' perceived Value Streams to identify similarities, differences and governing constructs. Data Source: Primary data collected by the Texas Medical Association, which surveyed 1,772 physicians on their use and perceptions of practice gains from EHR adoption. Methods: Using Bayesian Belief Network Modeling, Value Streams are constructed for both current EHR users and Intended Adopters. Principal Findings: Current Users and Intended Adopters differ significantly in their perceptions of the EHR Value Stream. Intended Adopters' Value Stream displays complex relationships among the potential gains compared to the simpler, linear relationship that Current Users identified. The Current Users identify ""Reduced Medical Records Costs"" as the gain that governs the Value Stream while Intended Adopters believe ""Reduced Charge Capture Costs"" define the Value Stream's starting point. Conclusions: Current Users' versus Intended Adopters' assessments of EHR benefits differ significantly and qualitatively from one another. Accelerating EHR adoption requires the realized gains of Current Users be clearly mapped for potential adopters to evaluate in comparison to their anticipated gains.",Bayesian belief network model; Electronic Health Records; Value stream,Bayesian networks; Knowledge based systems; Records management; Adoption patterns; Bayesian belief network models; Complex relationships; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Linear relationships; Perceived value; Value streams; eHealth

In this study, we incorporate both the spillover effects and competition effects of foreign entrants and develop an integral framework of inward and outward investment relationship between different pairs of home and host countries. Our analysis of Venture Capital (VC) investments worldwide of 1980-2007 period shows that there is a strong connection between the inward and outward VC investments of pair countries. Moreover, this connection is contingent upon the relative stages of VC industry establishment of the pair countries, which entail various spillover effects and competition effects. When the host country is a laggard and the home country is a leader in the VC industry, the impact of inward VC investment on outward VC investment between the pair countries is the most prominent. Meanwhile, the host country's propensity to make outward VC investments to the home country will be enhanced with an increased number of co-investments between the two.",Inward investment; Outward investment; VC industry,Competition; Indium compounds; Competition effects; Host countries; International expansion; Inward investments; Outward investments; Spillover effects; Vc industries; Venture Capital; Investments

Theoretically, we identify three paths along which an MNC evolves toward building the first R&D center in the host country.

However, in order to effectively utilize group knowledge, members of these teams need a clear sense of one another's expertise. Unfortunately, assessments of relative expertise in groups can be extraordinarily errorprone, given the human tendency to rely on efficient but noisy schemas and heuristics. The purpose of this paper is to consider the factors that lead to more mindful and, ultimately, more accurate expertise attributions in task groups. We begin with the observation that mindful expertise attribution can be modeled as a motivation problem using expectancy theory. That is, in order for group members to move beyond superficial and stereotyped expertise attributions, they must see value in doing so (valence) and they must feel that exerting that effort will be both successful (expectancy) and beneficial (instrumentality). We build on this basic observation to propose an ""expertise dependence theory"" of mindful competence attributions in task groups, a theory that finds valence in relations of expertise dependence and finds expectancy and instrumentality in characteristics of the perceiver, task, and group. Propositions based on this theory specify the conditions under which we might expect group members to be more effortful and more accurate in forming expertise assessments.",Expertise; Groups; Motivation,Error prones; Expectancy theory; Expertise; Group members; Groups; Task groups; Motivation

I will discuss the relationship between CSR policies and employees' attitudes and behavior, specifically perceived organizational support, organizational identification, and withdrawal cognitions, while considering the role of moderating factors. In addition, I incorporate the impact of employees' perceptions of firm CSR activities as well as a new construct, personal social action, which captures the extent to which employees pursue social action at work. The theoretical model I present will also provide an avenue for additional research on CSR and internal stakeholders. In addition, the results will have significant managerial implications, illustrating to firms how they can leverage their CSR initiatives to appeal to their employees.",CSR; Organizational identification; Turnover,Human resource management; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Employee attitudes; Managerial implications; Moderating factors; Organizational identifications; Perceived organizational supports; Theoretical modeling; Turnover; Economic and social effects

We surveyed buyers on a B2B exchange and found that buyers trust suppliers more if the suppliers' countries have higher national integrity, a better legal structure, and if the suppliers have been verified by a third party. Furthermore, as the number of transactions between buyers and suppliers increases, legal structure of the suppliers' countries has lesser effects on buyers' trust but national integrity remains influential.

In a field study of 184 employees in a bank nested within 42 workgroups, each headed by a branch manager, we find that a leader's exchange relationship with his/her own boss (LLX) as well as the leader's centrality in his/her peer advice network significantly impacts LMX with their members. Specifically, both LLX and leader centrality were positively related to LMX with members. Further, our results also indicate that the member's centrality in their peer advice network moderates these relationships such that they are stronger in situations where member centrality is low, suggesting that the leader's social ties are even more important to forming high quality LMX when the member is lacking such ties.

The dynamic model suggests that an industry's geographic concentration will be at a relatively low level in the fragmentation stage, increases in the shakeout and maturity stage, and stabilizes in the decline stage. In each stage, we discuss the mechanisms underlying geographic concentration from both the economic rationale, which focuses on economic gains from geographic proximity, and the sociological rationale, which highlights heterogeneous entrepreneurial opportunities. Data from the Ontario's wine industry (1865 - 1974) provide support to our hypotheses.",Geographic concentration; Industrial cluster; Industry life cycle,Breweries; Location; Wine; Economic gains; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Geographic concentrations; Geographic proximity; Industrial cluster; Industry life cycles; Maturity stages; Wine production; Life cycle

Organizations that join an organizational field temporarily can 'surf' with the existing institutions. Three implications of the introduction of temporality for research on institutions are discussed. First, we introduce the notion of host and home fields by looking at temporary organizations in a field.

We investigate this relationship considering the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as an independent variable. GHG emissions are a direct indicator of the environmental performance and effectively measure the firm's efforts in mitigating the impacts related to its processes and products. Second, we investigate the drivers that lead to an increase in the firm's environmental impact empirically exploring the link between market performance and GHG emissions. To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of worldwide listed companies derived from the Global Fortune 500 index. A longitudinal analysis is run through a two-stage least square regression over the period 2002-2005.

Since the demise of apartheid in South Africa, there has been a huge transformation in the economic, political and social landscape. Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) represents a key phenomenon that has driven this transformation, striving to increase the black wealth through corporate ownership. BEE transactions have typically involved the sale of an equity stake in a company, frequently at a discount, to black empowerment groups. Thus, BEE appears to represent corporate social responsibility that can provide value for the company while also benefiting the previously disadvantaged population. Yet, the benefits of BEE have been questioned. Critics point out that shareholders are forced to sell shares to empowerment groups, diluting their own position. This study explores whether BEE represents a value-creating corporate social responsibility action. We delve into this debate of BEE by examining the economic impact of BEE for the shareholders, thereby shedding light on the potential contributions or issues raised by BEE deals. We find positive and significant average abnormal returns for the South African firms that engaged in black economic empowerment transactions that were completed at a discount. However, we find negative and significant average abnormal returns for the South African firms that engaged in black economic empowerment transactions that were completed at a premium. Furthermore, for empowerment deals completed at a discount, the size of the equity stake was positively associated with abnormal returns. We also tested for the effects of the timing of the BEE deals and found little impact on returns to BEE deals. Our findings suggest that the corporate social responsibility aspects of BEE deals were rewarded when pursued in earnest.",Black economic empowerment; Corporate social responsibility; South Africa,Shareholders; Abnormal returns; Black Economic Empowerment (BEE); Black economic empowerments; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Economic impacts; Emerging markets; Social landscapes; South Africa; Investments

I argue that the scandals generated substantial challenges to the legitimacy of executive compensation practices, and in particular, executive stock options. Using panel data on executive compensation in the S&P 500 between 2001 and 2005, I examine how institutional pressures emanating from these legitimacy challenges led to changes in the value of executive stock options. The findings reveal that during this period, corporations facing investigations for corporate fraud and shareholder activism provided executives with less valuable stock option grants. In addition, the results suggest that CEOs faced constraints in their power to extract rent through their compensation arrangements, and independent directors were able to reduce the value of executive stock options. The analysis therefore reveals that both institutional environments and the structure of corporate boards have important influences on the structure of organizational practices that have important implications for income and wealth inequality.",Executive compensation; Institutional theory; Scandals,Executive compensation; Executive stock options; Independent directors; Institutional pressures; Institutional theory; Organizational practices; Scandals; Shareholder activisms; Managers
The strategic response of business group affiliates in emerging markets to increased inward FDI,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088341250&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44257932&partnerID=40&md5=d659caff05c5d5012bcfaa50b294e772,"We study the impact of inward FDI on the strategic response of emerging market firms whether or not to expand their operations. Building on transaction cost economics and social network theory; we argue that the response of these firms depends on their financial and technological strength, on whether they are affiliated to a business group or other network, and on the composition of that network. Business group affiliates tend to have more access to flexibility in terms of resources and capabilities by virtue of being part of a network of firms. However, not all firms within the business group benefit equally from their association, because they may or may not be a central constituent of their network. The more central a firm is within its business group, the more likely it is to benefit from its relationship with the group. We therefore argue that centrality within a business group positively moderates the relationship between inward FDI and a firmâ€™s decision to expand its domestic operations. Furthermore, we argue that the centrality of a firm vis Ã-vis domestic and foreign firms provides similar advantages for the firm than the centrality of a business group affiliate. Based on a sample of 9007 public companies in India for the period 1988-2007, we generally find support for these arguments.",Business groups; Foreign direct investment; Networks,Commerce; Investments; Networks (circuits); Planning; Business groups; Domestic operations; Emerging market firms; Foreign direct investments; Resources and capabilities; Strategic response; Technological strength; Transaction cost economics; Costs

We draw on two prominent literatures in strategy. First, we assume that competitive advantages are eroded over time by rivals' imitation and innovation, an idea that is central to the work on hypercompetition. Second, we assume that firms' actions to create new advantages are generally subject to time compression diseconomies, which is a basic premise of the research on firm speed. Our dual analysis of industry macrodynamics and firm microdynamics allows us to address a series of novel strategy problems. Our results generate empirically testable hypotheses that revisit some of the conventional views on environmental turbulence. The central principle behind our results is that leader firms may not always have incentives to accelerate the development of new advantages when they experience shorter periods of sustainable competitive advantage. Faster imitation and innovation cycles in an industry undermine not only the current advantage of the leader, but also the returns from investing in future competitive advantages. Whether the former effect dominates the latter to provide sufficient incentives to accelerate the deployment of new advantages is contingent on multiple moderating factors.",Hypercompetition; Time compression; Turbulence,Competition; Turbulence; Competitive advantage; Environmental turbulences; Hypercompetition; Sustainable competitive advantages; Theoretical modeling; Time compression; Time compression diseconomies; Turbulent environments; Sustainable development

Although there has been considerable research on interorganizational network tie formation, this research has tended to emphasize the importance of previously formed network ties and affiliation-based status. In contrast to these factors that are largely beyond an organization's shortterm control, I explore the extent to which organizations may ""purchase"" their network embeddedness using the more immediate levers of favorable deal terms and evaluation speed. Integrating a power/exploitation logic and a signaling logic, I argue that both an organization's relative deal terms and its partnership evaluation speed have a curvi-linear (inverted-U) relationship with the organization's formation of new network ties. Using 3,261 reviews in which anonymous entrepreneurs rated the relative deal terms and evaluation efficiency of 547 U.S.-based venture capital firms, I test and find support for this argument. Overall, I extend the inter-organizational network dynamics literature by highlighting relative deal terms and partnership evaluation speed as important, albeit highly constrained, influences.",Inter-organizational networks; Network dynamics; Venture capital,Mergers and acquisitions; Purchasing; Embeddedness; Inter-organizational network; Network dynamics; Network embeddedness; Network tie; Potential partners; Venture Capital; Venture capital firms; Investments

Yet as numerous real-world blunders attest, apologies are not always effective. Whereas many apologies lead to forgiveness and reconciliation, others simply fall on deaf ears. Despite the fact that apologies differ in their effectiveness, most research has focused on apologies as dichotomous phenomena wherein a victim either a) receives an apology or b) doesn't. Psychological research has yet to elucidate which components of apologies are most effective, and for whom. The present research begins to address this gap by testing the theory that perpetrators' apologies are most likely to inspire victim forgiveness when their components align with victims' self-construals. Regression and hierarchical linear modeling analyses from two studies support the primary hypotheses. As predicted, victims who emphasize the independent, relational, and collective selves reacted most positively to apologies that contained offers of compensation, expressions of empathy, and acknowledgements of violated rules/norms, respectively. These effects were robust across three levels of harm severity.",Apology; Forgiveness; Self-Construal,Apology; Forgiveness; Hierarchical linear modeling; Most likely; Psychological research; Real-world; Self-Construal

I further argue that higher pay attracts talented executives who are more capable, experienced, and well connected to acquire critical resources, and thus will improve post- succession performance.

In organisation studies, ANT has been part of a movement away from a functional emphasis on organisation as a discrete structural entity and towards the study of processes and practices of socio-technical organising. Despite its popularity, ANT is considered a controversial approach, not only for its insistence on the agency of non-humans, but also for promoting a sociological approach that appears to lack substantive political critique. Focusing on the study of organisation(s), we suggest that while 'early' ANT studies were problematic in this latter respect, ANT's 'further development' - under what has become known as the 'ANT and After' literature - sees an approach capable of offering insights relevant to the development of a critical perspective on organization(s), notably through its advocacy of a 'political ontology' of organising.",Actor network theory; Critical management studies; Politics,Ontology; Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Critical management studies; Critical perspectives; Politics; Social theory; Sociotechnical; Structural entities; Network theory (graphs)

Drawing from transaction cost and social network theories we empirically investigate the geographic and social contexts of alliance partners and the influence these factors have on alliance governance structure in the context of biotechnology-pharmaceutical alliances. Using a sample of 393 alliances formed during the period 1995 through 2000, results of this study show the location of the pharmaceutical firm headquarters and the credibility of the biotechnology firm influence the type of governance structure chosen while the location-based technological munificence of the biotechnology firm and the credibility of the pharmaceutical firm did not appear to influence the alliance governance structure.

In this article we reexamine the psychological underpinnings of Teece's framework. Arguing that his analysis currently downplays the significance of emotional/affective and non-conscious processes, especially intuition, in sensing, seizing and transforming strategic assets and capabilities, we incorporate the latest advances in social cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics, in an attempt to rectify this imbalance. In so doing, we develop a series of countervailing insights and new prescriptions for the development of dynamic capabilities, prescriptions that require economic actors to blend effortful forms of analysis with the skilled utilization of less deliberative, intuitive processes, thereby harnessing the cognitive and emotional capacities of individuals and groups.",Cognition and capabilities; Dynamic capabilities; Strategic cognition,Business enterprise; Cognition and capabilities; Cognitive neurosciences; Conscious process; Dynamic capabilities; Micro-foundations; Strategic cognition; Strategic management; Enterprise resource management

In this new approach to the field of diversity research, we investigated (a) the effect of organizationallevel age diversity on collective perceptions of age discrimination that (b) in turn should influence the affective commitment of employees, which is (c) an important trigger for overall company performance. In a large-scale study that included 133 companies, a total of 8,884 employees provided data on their perceptions of age discrimination and affective commitment on the company level. Information on firm-level performance was collected from key informants. We tested the proposed model using covariance structural equation modeling procedures and, overall, found support for all hypothesized relationships. The findings demonstrated that age diversity seems to be related to the emergence of age discrimination in companies, which negatively impacts overall firm performance through the mediation of collective affective commitment. These results make valuable contributions to the diversity and discrimination literature by establishing perceived age discrimination on the company level as a decisive mediator in the age diversity-performance link. The results also suggest important practical implications for the effective management of an increasingly agediverse workforce.",Age discrimination; Age diversity; Demographic change,Affective commitments; Age discrimination; Age diversity; Cross-organizational; Demographic changes; Diversity performance; Effective management; Structural equation modeling; Personnel

Unlike previous research, this paper supports a curvilinear relationship for FDI from foreign countries, not investments from within Greater China. These finding suggest a theoretical explanation for some contradictions in the empirical FDI literature. In economies where low technology FDI is not intense, a positive significant relationship between FDI and labor productivity should be observed. In economies where low technology FDI is intense, FDI can exhibit to have a negligible or even negative relationship with labor productivity.

We argue that the affiliates' internal resources and domestic market position confers greater intra-group bargaining power which allows them to respond to institutional changes through explorative search behavior in other geographical markets. Empirical results, based on panel data of firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry (1992-2007), support our theorization. In particular, we find that relative to independent firms, business group affiliated firms are less likely to pursue internationalization as a strategic response to institutional changes. However, those affiliated firms with higher level of non-financial resources and more dominant market position have higher levels of internationalization than both affiliate firms lacking internal resources and market position, as well as independent firms. A counter-intuitive finding in our study is that financial resources possessed by an affiliate negatively impacts internationalization.",Business Groups; Emerging economies; Internationalization,Business groups; Emerging economies; Financial resources; Geographical market; Institutional change; Internal resources; Internationalization; Pharmaceutical industry; Commerce

A growing number of industries create value through complex combinations of science, but managing their innovation effectively requires more insight into how scientists know things for innovation. We summarize three different processes of knowing: science as an intuitive, holistic sense, science as a community of practice, and science as the basis for social bonding. Then we draw on 85 interviews with scientists engaged in drug discovery to explore how they generate and use knowledge. We find that these scientists know how to create new products through a collective sense of the scientist: a holistic intuitive and sensory knowing that incorporates their deep understandings of patterns in nature with situated complexities of products, in our case of how compounds behave in the body. Collective means that everyone needs this sense. The collective sense of the scientist is generated by three different social structurings of work: connections to the larger scientific communities; engagement with the sensory body at work around a ""feeling for the organism;"" and connections along the entire process of product innovation. We illustrate all three social structurings, and develop implications for how managers can redesign their organizations to foster them.",Innovation; Intuition; Science,Community of practice; Drug discovery; Intuition; Product innovation; Science; Scientific community; Scientific knowledge; Technology transfer

We propose ways in which firm leaders can create team emotional tones that involve appraisals of reduced uncertainty in work interactions and coping ability (e.g., calmness, agentic disappointment) in order to help the competence modification process; team emotional tones that involve appraisals of noveltycomplexity and coping ability (e.g., interest, frustration) to help the competence definition process; and team emotional tones that involve appraisals of future achievement of valued goals and coping ability (e.g., hope, agentic fear) to help the competence deployment process. We illustrate our theory with organizational actions drawn from the renewal of Nissan between 1999 and 2002. Finally, we link our model to the literature on dynamic capability and temporary advantage.",,Deployment process; Emotional state; Modification process; ON dynamics; Organizational process; Strategic renewal

We define process alignment in terms of process rigor and process consistency; similarly, we define process adaptability in terms of process agility and customizability. We hypothesize the positive effects of these four process variables on team coordination effectiveness which in turn positively affects project success. We also hypothesize that team boundary dispersion and requirements dynamism moderate the positive effect of process ambidexterity on team coordination effectiveness. Using cross-sectional survey data from both project managers and project stakeholders, our results show that process ambidexterity has significant effects on coordination effectiveness. Process rigor, process consistency, and process agility exhibited positive effects on coordination effectiveness, but process customizability did not. We also found that the positive effect of process consistency on coordination effectiveness became stronger as team boundary dispersion increased and that the positive effect of process agility on coordination effectiveness became stronger as requirements dynamism increased. Team boundary dispersion and requirements dynamism also had a negative direct effect on coordination effectiveness. In addition, process rigor has been found to have a direct effect on project success above and beyond the mediating effect of coordination effectiveness.

Greener firms have a larger number of shareholders but a smaller percentage of institutional owners and ownership stakes, suggesting that while environmental performance makes firms more attractive to individual investors, greenness has the opposite effect on institutional investors. The individual investor results help explain why prior research has found a positive relationship between environmental performance and stock price. Our results for institutional investors persist for each of the five institutional investor classifications in our sample. In particular, the institutional investor category that includes pension funds, university endowments and foundations, which is the largest institutional investor group in our sample, displays the highest negative sensitivity to green stocks. Nonetheless, we find that firms with higher environmental performance have higher stock market liquidity. Green firms also have a higher analyst following and larger advertising expenses.

This may be the result of past studies overlooking the reality that succession often results in the predecessor CEO remaining on the scene as chair of the board. Using the concept of managerial discretion, we propose that retention of the predecessor diminishes the impact of succession as an inertia breaking event and reduces the latitude of action available to the successor, leading to reduced strategic and organizational change and reduced performance extremeness. To test these hypotheses we analyzed 139 CEO successions across several high-tech industries between 1994 and 2002. Results provide strong evidence for the discretion reducing impact of predecessor CEO retention as board chair. More specifically, we find that retention of the predecessor as board chair results in reduced organizational and strategic change as well as a reduction in the extremeness of performance outcomes. Further, upon departure of the predecessor as board chair, there is an immediate increase in both change and performance extremeness.",CEO succession; Discretion; Duality,CEO succession; Discretion; Duality; High tech industry; Managerial discretion; Organizational change; Performance outcome; Strategic changes; Strategic planning

The problems we are concerned with are intellectual isolation, misleading and self-deceptive rhetoric and ideological closure, all of which arguably hinder the development of novel theory. These problems are exacerbated by their cumulative nature; that is, isolated theory-building communities of practice inevitably become constrained by their rhetorical practices, which in turn results in ideological closure. We offer three connected strategies to address these issues. First, to address intellectual isolation, we suggest a relational, boundary crossing strategy. Second, to avoid being misled by rhetoric, we suggest an interpretive empiricist approach to the development of theory from data. Third, to address ideological closure, we suggest a radically reflexive approach. Taken together, these approaches may stimulate the generation of new advances in organization theory.",Ideology; Rhetoric; Theory,Boundary crossing; Ideology; New theory; Organization theory; Reflexive approach; Rhetoric; Theory; Theory building

In our extended model, we argue that the specificity of a production process depends not only on the layout of the process but also from the flexibilities that can be achieved with advanced manufacturing technologies, for instance. Similarly, we argue that the product dimension of the original matrix should be extended to a task environmental complexity measure, where the product variety is only one element among others. Furthermore, we propose that the production process should not be aligned with the task environmental complexity alone but also with the dynamism of the task environment. We test our extended model with empirical data from 151 manufacturing firms.

I propose that the entrepreneur's choice between internal and external venture formation is affected by formal organizational structures (i.e., incentive systems) and informal social structure extending beyond the parent organization. Using unique data on the mutual fund industry over the period 1979-2006, I show that the parent organization induces internal venture formation by providing fund managers with higher compensation and greater discretion. However, the impact of incentives is limited by the fund manager's informal social network of preexisting ties to her school colleagues. Specifically, I find that fund managers imitate previous entrepreneurship choices of other school network members. Additional analyses show that the effect of school ties is amplified by the spatial proximity of school network members, and is greater within same-gender school ties - providing support for inter-actor influences rather than isomorphism. Together, the study offers important theoretical implications for understanding the entrepreneurship process and how it interacts with the boundaries of a modern organization in a knowledge-based economy.",Entrepreneurship; Networks; Organization theory,Knowledge based systems; Managers; Networks (circuits); Entrepreneurship; Incentive systems; Informal social networks; Knowledge based economy; Nascent entrepreneurs; Organization theory; Organizational structures; Parent organizations; Investments

Firms that are capable of pursuing strategic entrepreneurship (high advantage-creating and high advantage-enhancing tendencies) tend to dynamically change their network structures. They often create new structural holes and subsequently close those holes by encouraging partners to closely collaborate with one another.

In the first experiment, advisors must compete with other advice sellers. In the second, advisors and decision makers are paired. Overprecision exists in both studies, and it helps advisors' sell their advice. However, the market also exacerbates overprecision.

This study contributes to the existing literature on business model design by providing a theoretical and empirical investigation of four different business model designs, elaborating on how they are related to performance and how this relationship is moderated by the environment of the firm. We use data from 228 entrepreneurial ventures in a partial least squares analysis (PLS). Our evidence highlights the positive and stable performance contribution of efficiency-, novelty- and lock-in-centered business models across contexts. Complementarities-centered business models, however, are only positively and significantly connected to performance in case of low environmental uncertainty and high competitive intensity. Our study provides support for utilizing the contingency approach to examine the effects of business model designs.

Management academics' intention to influence values - Model development and evaluation,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087998391&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44243039&partnerID=40&md5=c79d3ddb250483c17afbcf97bd9f093c,"The relevance of green management is increasing. However, it involves an often unquestioned prerequisite, the presence of social and environmental values. Hence, in support of green management, imparting values to business through research projects and through education to students, tomorrow's managers, plays a special role. However, in previous debates, the role played by management academics in the process of conveying values has been largely neglected, and academics intentions to exert potential influence have remained unquestioned. In this paper we develop a model to explain management academics behavioral intentions to influence values through research and teaching. The suggested model encompasses the internal value base of academics, as well as the external perspective on perceived opportunity and support to influence values. The model is evaluated against empirical data from 1,741 management academics worldwide. It is shown that the external elements of perceived opportunity and perceived external support are the most relevant in explaining intention.

I posit that entrepreneurs rely more on referral based search when their interpersonal networking behaviors focus less on adding new contacts and more on maintaining existing contacts. I then propose that entrepreneurs are likely to add more new exchange partners when they rely less on referral based search. The empirical analysis employs a longitudinal design using data coded from the business cards of new contacts formed over a two-month period by a panel of Indian entrepreneurs operating business-to-business ventures in a single industry sector. This study makes a theoretical contribution by delineating actors' behaviors that shape evolution of their local network structure and its performance consequences.,Networking Behaviors; Personal Networks; Referrals,Business to business; Empirical analysis; Industry sectors; Longitudinal designs; Networking Behaviors; Personal networks; Referrals; Shape evolution

Building on Scott's (1995) regulative, normative, and cognitive institutions, we investigate how institutional difference between the home and host country influences the choice of host country and the entry strategies (equity level and entry modes) with respect to parent resources (technological capability, marketing capability, organizational slacks, and financial resources). Interestingly, we found that institutional distances in different dimensions differently determine the choice of host countries and appropriate entry strategies to overcome the hurdles arising from these distances. Moreover, we also found that institutional distances not only directly affect the entry strategies but also act as a mediator between the parent resources and the entry strategies as well. In other words, parent resources exert both direct and indirect effects on the entry strategies. This paper contributes to the extant literature in many ways. First, a more complete paradigm international business strategy is proposed. Second, we extend the past research by examining the effects of institutions from varying dimensions. Third, we demonstrate the linkage between the micro level, firm-level characteristics and the macro level, country's institutions in the analysis of entry strategies. Finally, we extend the geographic reach of FDI to those firms from Taiwan, a newly-industrialized economy.",Entry strategies; Institutions; Resources,Entry strategy; Institutional differences; Institutional theory; International business; Newly industrialized economies; Resources; Taiwanese high-tech firms; Technological capability; Societies and institutions

Prominent approaches to measure TMM are based on indices of within-group agreement (e.g., rWG, r*WG, and aWG) or proximity matrices (e.g., Pathfinder networks and QAP correlations). However, there are several shortcomings of these indices, when they are applied to measure TMM, most importantly the missing separation between team-specific and general agreement. These indices overestimate the existence of team-specific mental models if there is a common agreement beyond team borders. As an alternative, we develop a TMM index (rRG) that is based on random group resampling. The advantage of this index is its focus on team-specific agreement rather than on general consensus. We demonstrate its usefulness by comparing it to other agreement indices theoretically and in an empirical example. Furthermore, we provide a rationale to determine the statistical significance of the index and point out its limitations.",,Common agreement; Mental model; Pathfinder networks; Random groups; Shared cognition; Statistical significance; Team mental models; Within-group agreements; Cognitive systems

However, the theory falls short of describing how signals might emerge and propagate in real-world settings.

Adopting a longitudinal perspective, I deductively draw out how signals are expected to emerge and evolve in both economic and institutional theory.

Based on prior work on the measurement of the different types of diversity, we show that the most common diversity indexes (i.e., Blau's index, Teachman's index, Gini coefficient, coefficient of variation, and standard deviation) are systematically biased whenever they are used in field studies in which the overall sample comprises groups of varying sizes. Using simulated data, we illustrate this bias inherent in all of the common diversity measures. This bias can lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the impact of group size and the relationship between group diversity and group outcomes. We offer bias-corrected formulas and suggest that diversity researchers henceforth use these adjusted versions when investigating the effects of group diversity in organizational settings.

An important means of accomplishing this objective is the implementation of confidential information (CI) rules.

The goal of the research reported here was to begin to fill this gap in the literature. We conducted 55 interviews with employees in two high-tech firms, and based on data gathered in those interviews, we developed a theory of employee CI rule following. We theorize that employees' acceptance of CI rules is a key antecedent of rule following, and that rule acceptance is in turn determined by employee perceptions of CI rule obstructiveness, effectiveness, importance, fairness, and ambiguity. Practical implications of the theory are highlighted for organizations interested in improving their confidential information practices.",Confidential information; Intellectual property; Knowledge management,Intellectual property; Knowledge management; Academic literature; Confidential information; Empirical examination; Employee perceptions; Employee response; High-tech firms; Personnel

Our results suggest that from a set of nine corporate context categories, four enhance decision speed (financial incentives, target definition, process-related involvement, and HR-/career incentives), one has a negative influence (content-related involvement) and four have no direct effect (arenas for discourse, coercive enforcement, sanctioning, and conflict resolution). Combining these insights with our inductive analysis, we are further able to provide explanations for why certain categories influence decision-making speed.

In other words, competitive actions mediate the relationship between resources and performance. We tested these hypotheses using a five year (1995-1999) panel data sample of 110 firms in the in-vitro medical diagnostic substance manufacturing industry.

Thus far, scholars have examined sources of discretion that are relatively proximate to focal executives, primarily organizational and industry characteristics. The idea that managerial discretion emanates, in part, from the broader environment, specifically the national context in which a company is headquartered, has generally not been considered. In an empirical examination of 15 countries, I find that certain national institutions - cultural norms favoring autonomy, norms tolerating unpredictability, a common-law legal tradition, and employer flexibility - are associated, as hypothesized, with the degree of managerial discretion available to CEOs of public firms in a country, as rated by a panel of international business experts. In turn, I show that nationlevel managerial discretion is associated, again as hypothesized, with the magnitude of effect - both the absolute and proportional effect - that CEOs in a country have on the performance of their firms.

Most research in this field focuses on knowledge sharing activities of MNC subsidiaries. Relatively little is known about their capabilities for protecting valuable knowledge from spilling over to host country competitors. We extend this stream of research by investigating MNC knowledge protection strategies that go beyond formal methods (patents, copyrights, trademarks) to include strategic ones (secrecy, lead time, complex design). We conceptualize the breadth and depth of a firm's knowledge protection strategies and relate them to the particular situation of MNC subsidiaries. Moreover, we argue that their approaches differ with regard to host country challenges and opportunities. We address these issues empirically, based on a harmonized survey of innovation activities of more than 1,800 firms located in Portugal and Germany. We find that MNCs prefer broader sets of knowledge protection strategies in host countries with fewer opportunities for knowledge sourcing. However, munificent host country environments require targeted sets of deep knowledge protection strategies instead. We deduce that these results are due to a need for reciprocity in knowledge exchanges to benefit fully from promising host country knowledge flows.",Knowledge protection; Multinational companies; Patenting,Lead compounds; Patents and inventions; Country comparisons; Innovation activity; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge protection; Knowledge spillovers; Multi-national companies; Patenting; Strategic knowledge; Formal methods
Institutional transitions and firms' political behaviors,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087997489&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44268298&partnerID=40&md5=19d95c0af88cf3e30b16d5c6d8427c97,"How does institutional underdevelopment facilitate firms' political activities such as lobbying and bribing? How do these activities differ across different types of institutions? Are lobbying and bribing substitutes or complements? Linking new institutional economics with the literature on corporate political strategy, I develop an integrative model illustrating the interactions between institutions and firms' political behaviors. This study contributes to the literature by examining how and why institutions matter in firms' choices of lobbying and bribing, using data on approximately 15,000 firms in 26 transition economies. The results show that weak institutions cause more bribing but less lobbying, and individual institutions have differential effects on firms' political actions. In two distinct time periods, as institutions evolve to feature more market competition, firms are more engaged in lobbying and less involved in bribing, suggesting that lobbying is a substitute for bribing. When a bi-directional causality is applied, lobbying is complementary to bribing, whereas bribing is a substitute for lobbying in the static model.",Bribing & lobbying; Firm political activity; Institutions,Societies and institutions; Corporate political strategy; Differential effect; Firm political activities; Integrative modeling; New Institutional Economics; Political activity; Political behaviors; Transition economy; Competition

Further, those with a Benevolent view of God had lower external locus of control scores than those with an Authoritarian, Critical, or Distant view of God, and belief in God's anger was found to be positively correlated with external locus of control scores. Finally, those who believed in a Distant God had lower levels of conscientiousness than those who believed in a Benevolent God, and belief in God's engagement with the world was found to be correlated with higher levels of conscientiousness.",Ethics; Religion; Values,Ethics; Locus of control; Religion; Values; Philosophical aspects

Using a sample of 1057 US employees, I demonstrate that the antecedents leading to formation of a workplace friendship can explain the differential effects of workplace friendships on several job outcomes. Specifically, the findings illustrate that: 1) friendships that were formed as a result of affective reasons have the strongest effects (positive or negative) on job outcomes, 2) individuals who form friendships for instrumental reasons are more likely to be absent from work and leave the organization, 3) friendships that were formed on the basis of trust are the most beneficial for organizations. Overall, these findings illustrate that friendships and their effects are not only a function of the current relationship, but of its origins and progression.

Firm heterogeneity in speed capabilities and entry into the emerging submarket of Atlantic Basin LNG,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087222803&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44265954&partnerID=40&md5=b88396d63d40ac521cd1ca3b926bff97,"Studies on market entry and commitment versus flexibility identify conflicting incentives in entry decisions into new market opportunities: an early entrant faces less competition but may make costly mistakes due to a lack of learning opportunities, whereas late entrants can learn from precedent but also face higher costs from preemption. One limitation of these studies is that they typically treat entry timing as independent from firm capabilities and ignore the antecedents to entry. In this study, we test hypotheses regarding the role of intrinsic speed capabilities as an antecedent to the entry decision. Our basic premise is that intrinsic speed capabilities should give firms an advantage in accumulating resources for entry by reducing the costs from preemption. We predict that a firm with speed capabilities will be more likely to enter later than slower firms. Furthermore, since intrinsically faster firms should face lower overall entry costs than slower competitors, we predict a higher entry hazard rate for firms with speed capabilities. This study tests and finds support for these predictions by examining the entry timing and entry hazard of firms in the Atlantic Basin of the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry from 1996 to 2007. Findings from this study contribute to the literatures on firm capabilities, first mover advantages, corporate entrepreneurship, and international business.",Firm capabilities; First mover advantages; New market entry,Commerce; Forecasting; Hazards; Speed; Conflicting incentives; Corporate entrepreneurship; Firm capabilities; First mover advantages; International business; Learning opportunity; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); New market entries; Liquefied natural gas

(2004)'s notion of ""nested structuration"" into the distributed team context. In doing so, we recognize the globally-distributed team as an entity but also attend to the organizational and institutional systems and local identity groups that team members simultaneously inhabit. This makes visible the significance of stress, influence and adaptation within globally distributed teams and between such teams and related nested systems. We illustrate dialectical adaptation dynamics through which cross-national tensions around authority structures, reward systems and project control were transformed, and we highlight the central role of middle level managers in mediating stresses.

A noted gap in the literature exists in the empirical testing of SAW's associations with outcomes that have organizational implications (Giacalone et al., 2005). Additionally, little quantitative work has been done on the ultimate effects of the SAW and attitudinal outcomes relationship. This study may be the first to posit and test quantitatively a model of SAW's direct and indirect (mediation) effects through attitudinal variables on behavioral outcomes. The results demonstrate that associations exist between SAW and attitudes and behaviors. SAW's direct affects were posited to be positive on both attitudes and behaviors. In both cases, the path coefficients are strong and statistically significant. This study also tests two mediation relationships, finding that affective organizational commitment mediates the relationship between SAW and both voice and helping behaviors and that job satisfaction does not mediate the relationship between SAW and both voice and helping behaviors.",Attitudes; Outcomes; Spirituality at work,Attitudes; Behavioral outcomes; Empirical testing; Mediating roles; Organizational Commitment; Outcomes; Path coefficients; Spirituality at work; Job satisfaction

We propose a formal model of status-based competition that contrasts two competing alternatives. The first, following Merton (1968), is the ""Matthew Effect,"" according to which a tournament's architect directs excess resources to elite actors, and thus widens the distribution of rewards by favoring cumulative advantage. The second is the ""Mark Effect,"" under which a tournament's designer instead pushes excess resources to marginal actors, and thus tightens the distribution of rewards through engaging in redistribution. Our results indicate that the Mark Effect is better for the social welfare of most tournaments, but that the Matthew Effect is preferable for elite tournaments, such as top R&D labs, that rank highly against other tournaments. Our main contributions are twofold: We find that, counter to the thrust of Merton's (1968) work, cumulative advantage is not invariably optimal for the functioning of status contests; and we identify circumstances in which the production of superstars is likely to make contests for status better off in aggregate.

Using a sample of 14,329 biotechnology patents produced by 271 firms from 1980 - 2007, we examine how joint patenting through strategic alliances with various types of partners leads to varying degrees of technological breadth. Further we propose that the relationship between joint-patenting and technological breadth is moderated by the accumulation of successful joint patenting experience, which we sub define according to the partner type. Our findings reveal that joint patenting does expand a firm's technological breadth, particularly when firms collaborate on inventions with academic partners.

As syntactic mechanisms, emotions facilitate (or impede) exchange with others, modifying the distribution of conversations among agents and, therefore, changing the way they make sense of themselves and of their situations. As semantic mechanisms, emotions provide the relevance of a person, object or situation to the agent, thus tilting the enactment of the environment in specific ways. Finally, as pragmatic mechanisms, emotions help induce the emergence, maintenance or collapse of stratified orders. We illustrate how emotions enter and operate in agents' sensemaking through a revisit of Barley's hallmark explorations of structuring processes in two radiology departments, and show how the introduction of emotions as causal mechanisms - present all through Barley's pages, but not recorded in his process model - enhances causality attribution.

I draw from research in capital intensive industries to propose how the intensity of escalation may vary with differences in the level of vertical integration. I use a natural experiment-a Court of Appeals' landmark decision overruling regulatory oversight over previously protected natural resources in one of the locations-to identify causation in the sequence of firms' moves.

Still, research evidence has not consistently shown these remedies to be effective. Noting that these traditional mechanisms aim to resolve the agency problem by extrinsically influencing the CEO's behavior, we seek to provide a broader understanding by considering how intrinsic drivers of behavior might mitigate agency costs. In particular, we draw on the literature on organizational identification to examine how a CEO whose identity is intertwined with the organizations will be motivated to avoid corporate actions that impose agency costs. We further consider how traditional control mechanisms, which represent agency costs in themselves, are made less effective when organizational identification is high, as they are rendered somewhat redundant. Using survey and archival data from 793 large U.S. firms, we find a negative effect of CEO organizational identification on agency costs-measured as a) CEO personal use of corporate aircraft, and b) unrelated firm diversification-and we find that organizational identification weakens the negative effects of incentive alignment and board independence on those outcomes. Our theory and supportive findings suggest how a CEO who makes little distinction between self-interest and organizational-interest will be likely to eschew actions that benefit the self over the organization, and less influenced by extrinsic control mechanisms.",CEO compensation; Corporate governance; Organizational identification,CEO compensations; Corporate governance; Extrinsic control; Financial incentives; Incentive alignment; Independent directors; Organizational identifications; Organizational interests; Flight control systems
Creating mutual value with base of the pyramid producers,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088181889&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44244276&partnerID=40&md5=bb430ab8afde49abdad17d547d0bee9e,"Base of the pyramid (BoP) literature is grounded in the proposition of mutual value creation, an important but not yet well-tested relationship between business development and poverty alleviation. The focus of this paper is to begin to address this gap by assessing how business ventures serving BoP producers address local constraints and create mutual value. Using a case study methodology, we analyze sixty four ventures to identify the constraints faced by BoP producers. These are classified into productivity and transactional constraints. While the former set of constraints inhibits local value creation, the latter severely diminish the value capture potential of BoP producers. From an in-depth analysis of eleven agricultural ventures selected from the larger set, we articulate the various ways in which these ventures have addressed the constraints to create more local value for and enhance value capture by BoP producers. We find that by addressing a greater number of constraints, business ventures create greater value not only for local producers, but also for themselves.",Base of the pyramid; Mutual value creation; Poverty alleviation,Base of the pyramids; Business development; Business ventures; Case study methodologies; In-depth analysis; Local constraints; Poverty alleviation; Value creation

Results show that the comfort of students in evaluating others increases over semesters although this effect could not be directly attributed to the use of the peer evaluation system. Similarly, the effectiveness of students, as perceived by peers, also increased over semesters. This effect, however, could be directly linked to the use of the system. The results of this study underscore the benefits of centralizing peer evaluations for the assessment of important skills and their development in higher education.

Following Wasserman's and Faust's (1994) classification of network properties, this paper examines how network centrality, informal ties, and network position of an individual agency would affect organizational performance measured by goal alignment, service quality, expenditure change, revenue growth, and resource generation methods. This study uses the Community Social Service Study data (N=290), which provides comprehensive organization performance information and social network data for investigating the relationships between network properties and organizational performance. Controlling for organizational characteristics, social service organizations with higher prestige are more likely to implement services that target a particular group of clients, and are highly correlated with revenue growth whereas ones with higher degree of centrality are more likely to adopt diversified revenue raising activities, and are correlated with decreasing total expenditures. In addition, ones with higher percentages of informal ties are more likely to implement services that target a particular group of clients, associate with higher service outcomes and quality. However, network position does not play a significant role in predicting organizational performance. This study has established a linkage between network properties and organizational performance. Administrators at the social service agencies should find it useful to know that agencies can achieve multiple performances from increasing network capacity, and it is important to maintain informal ties with other organizations within a social service provision network.",Inter-organizational relationships; Organizational networks; Performance,Inter-organizational relationships; Network centralities; Organization performance; Organizational characteristics; Organizational network; Organizational performance; Performance; Resource generations; Quality of service

We analyze bank failure rates and risk orientation and show that the NYCHA successfully organized private cooperative arrangements that enhanced its member banks' survival chances, and reduced their risky behaviors. We argue the strength of the NYCHA rests on its nature of localism, due to the institutional constraints of bank branching. We also find that the survival benefit of the NYCHA on its member banks diminished after the Federal Reserve was founded, suggesting that the substitution of government regulation on the private industry-level institution can bring about unexpected organizational outcomes.",Bank regulation; Industry self-regulation; Institution change,Bank regulation; Cooperative arrangements; Government regulation; Industry cooperation; Industry self-regulations; Institution changes; Institutional constraints; Organizational outcomes; Failure analysis

We employ the extended Karasek model (DCS) to guide our investigation. We use a field survey to collect data from nurses working in different hospitals in the four countries. We test the strain, iso-strain and buffer hypotheses of the model across the four samples. Our results show that job demand, job control, and supervisory support are important variables in the prediction of stress among nurses in China, Japan, Argentina, and the Caribbean. Based on our findings we suggest that the DCS model has universal significance although its workings vary across national contexts. We find strong and broad support for the strain hypothesis incorporating job demand and supervisory support. Support for the strain hypothesis varies for job control across the four samples. The iso-strain hypothesis is supported only in Argentina. The buffer hypothesis in its original Karasek formulation is supported only in Japan. However, the buffer hypothesis using the expanded Karasek formulation is supported in China, Japan, and Argentina.

We focus on two aspects of sense-making-the issues on which people focused their attention and the ways in which they construed these issues. To understand how people made sense of the situation, we analyzed individuals' verbatim reactions to the events of 9/11 as they appeared in media sources during the aftermath of the attacks. With respect to attentional focus, we hypothesize and find that individuals in roles with greater power focused their attention less on human response and more on issues related to coordinated action (e.g., terrorism, resources, and infrastructure). With respect to construal, we find that position power (and not expert power) was positively associated with descriptions of the events surrounding 9/11 that were more abstract (vs. concrete), positive (vs. negative), and certain (vs. uncertain).",Disaster; Power; Sense-making,Disasters; International trade; Coordinated actions; Human response; Position power; Power; Sense making; World Trade Center; Terrorism

One of such factors cited in the economic and organization literature is corruption. We argue that the political power of the actors and the institutional settlement in the field between politically powerful actors plays a more important role in influencing the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies than the level of corruption. Methodologically, the paper combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches. First, using qualitative evidence from Ukraine and Germany, it explores the role that corruption in a country plays in adopting environmental policies. In the quantitative stage of the analysis, it uses country level data to test whether corruption is a confounding variable for the adoption of alternative energy sources, and if the use of alternative fuels is associated with the level of institutional settlement among the dominant players. The findings suggest that the power of institutional actors in initiating and promoting institutional change has a greater impact on the introduction and diffusion of environmental policies than the level of corruption in a society.",Corruption; Institutional settlement; Technology adoption,Alternative fuels; Biofuels; Environmental protection; Alternative energy source; Corruption; Environmentally-friendly technology; Institutional settlement; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Renewable Energy industries; Sustainable technology; Technology adoption; Crime

We use transaction cost economics and real options reasoning to develop and test how uncertainties in alliance transactions affect firm performance, and how governance choices moderate performance outcomes. Data obtained on 827 biotechnology alliances among 353 firms from 1995 through 2003 were used in an empirical test of our model using hierarchical regression in a two stage approach. Results support our argument that firm-level performance is negatively related to firm-level uncertainties presented by the firm's alliances, and the technological diversification of the alliance portfolio. We find that the choice of governance form moderates these performance effects in distinctive ways. We discuss the joint influence of transaction cost, real options reasoning, and alliance portfolio diversification and offer implications for theory, research, and management practice.",Alliance governance; Alliances; Uncertainty,Biotechnology; Alliance governance; Alliances; Hierarchical regression; Management practices; Portfolio diversification; Technological diversification; Transaction cost economics; Uncertainty; Costs

The research model was tested using data gathered from 545 respondents through an experiment. Structural equations modeling (SEM) using partial least squares (PLS) validated the instrument and the proposed model. Results suggest that the influences of personalization on the privacy risk/benefit beliefs vary upon the type of personalization systems (covert and overt), and that personal characteristics moderate the parameters and path structure of the privacy calculus model.

In the first view, organizations continuously adapt to changing environments via a series of ongoing small changes. In the second view, inertia prevents ongoing change and environmental pressure builds until relatively rare, punctuated change occurs. We combine these perspectives to develop a model that tests whether and how inertia building organizations can adapt on a continuous basis. By integrating assumptions of continuous change into Sastry's (1996) modelling of Tushman & Romanelli's (1985) punctuated equilibrium theory, the paper has two main findings: first, we find that by adding a timepaced fit measurement routine, and by raising parameter values for rate of change and desired performance to the punctuated equilibrium model, we are able to demonstrate that continuous change of inert organizations may dramatically improve long term performance and reduce risk when compared to punctuated change. Second, we find that that organizations' capacity for continuous change is counter intuitively limited by the organizations' capacity to build inertia.",Continuous change; Inertia; Organizational change,Risk perception; Changing environment; Continuous change; Environmental pressures; Inertia; Long term performance; Organizational adaptation; Organizational change; Punctuated equilibrium; Risk assessment

To marshal evidence on this point, we design a simple model of partner selection in which firms ally for the purpose of learning and innovating, and in doing so create an industry network. We abstract completely from network-based structural and strategic motives for partner selection and focus instead on the idea that firms' knowledge bases must ""fit"" in order for joint leaning and innovation to be possible, and thus for an alliance to be feasible. The striking result is that while containing no social capital considerations, this simple model replicates the firm conduct, network structure, and contingent effects of network position on performance observed and discussed in the empirical literature.",Innovation; Simulation; Social networks,Social networking (online); Alliance formation; Empirical literature; Empirical research; Innovation network; Knowledge complementarities; Network structures; Simulation; Strategic alliance; Range finding

Conversely, the horizontal relationships with competitors were related to integrated governance structures and collective knowledge processes.

First, it provides a synthesis of the literature, which yields a characterization of reflexivity as a particular form of threshold concept. Second, it details a particular approach to the challenges of teaching reflexivity, together with examples that show how the threshold concept framework was evidenced in students written reflections generated in response to the class.

Isomorphism in organizational self-representation in the World Wide Web?

Over the last 15 years a new means for organizational selfrepresentation has emerged: the Internet. The Internet presence of an organization is an easily accessible ""window"" to study organizational ""window-dressing."" It is unclear whether the phenomenon of organizational isomorphism due to institutional pressures not only holds for structural characteristics of organizations but also for the self-representation of organizations on the Internet. In this article we will analyze if and how environmental conditions influence selfrepresentations of organizations with respect to their Internet presentation. From a neo-institutional perspective organizations should create facades which reflect societal expectations which differ between different social fields. We have developed a quantitative approach to analyze organizational self-representations in the World Wide Web. With this approach we have collected information of hundreds of websites with thousands of web pages, developed rough indicators of organizational self-representation activities and compared these features with environmental conditions of the analyzed organizations. We can confirm our main hypothesis that there are already significant tendencies of isomorphism in the self-representation of organizations in the World Wide Web.",Internet; Isomorphism; Self-representation,Internet; Websites; Environmental conditions; Institutional perspective; Institutional pressures; Isomorphism; Quantitative approach; Self-representation; Societal expectations; Structural characteristics; Set theory

However, there has been a lot of debate as to whether or not conflict is beneficial to innovation. This paper aims to shed new light on this relationship by taking the debate to the intersubgroup level and studying the impact of intersubgroup task, relationship and process conflicts on innovation. Furthermore, this study extends the conflict contingency framework, according to which the effects of these three types of conflict on innovation vary depending on moderating influences. Going back to early conflict theory, a distinction is made between perceived and actual incompatibilities or overt and latent conflict respectively. This paper aims to show that both are equally important in that the latter can alter the former's effects. Using teams consisting of entrepreneurs and angel investors, the empirical results reveal that perceived task and relationship conflict, but not process conflict, negatively impact a company's innovation output. However, perceived conflict's negative effect can be reduced by low levels of latent conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs.",Conflict; Innovation; Venture capital,Conflict; Conflict theory; Intra-group conflicts; Key process; Organizational innovation; Process conflict; Relationship conflicts; Venture Capital; Investments

Nevertheless, firms that balance exploration and exploitation across these domains gain in profits and market value. Moreover, increases in firm size that exacerbate resource allocation tradeoffs and routine rigidity reinforce the benefits of balance across domains and the costs of balance within domains. Our domain separation approach offers new insights into how firms can benefit from balancing exploration and exploitation. What matters is not simply whether firms balance exploration and exploitation in their alliance formation decisions but the means by which they achieve such balance.",Alliance; Exploration-exploitation; Performance,Technology transfer; Alliance; Alliance formation; Balance exploration; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Exploration exploitations; Organizational research; Performance; Performance effect; Commerce

The general research question explored is whether a course on ethical decision-making in business could positively influence students' confidence in their abilities to handle ethical problems at work (i.e., moral efficacy), boost the relative importance of ethics in their work lives (i.e., moral meaningfulness), and encourage them to be more courageous at raising ethical problems at work even when there may be negative consequences for themselves (i.e., moral courage). Specifically, the study used a rigorous quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design with a treatment (N=40) and control group (N=30) to determine if a graduate level course in business ethics could influence students' levels of moral efficacy, moral meaningfulness, and moral courage. Findings revealed that participants in the business ethics treatment course experienced significantly more positive increases in each of the three outcome variables when compared to the control group. The largest increase was in moral efficacy, followed by moral courage, and finally, moral meaningfulness.

Both projects with an exploitative and explorative objective have been shown to be mandatory to ensure the long-term success of technology-based organizations. However, many companies have difficulties in finding efficient and successful approaches to different types of R&D pro-jects and particularly to those that involve a high level of innovativeness. The aim of this study is to adopt a new theoretical concept called effectuation that was originally developed in the entrepreneurship research. This concept brings in a new perspective on the issue of how to accomplish successful R&D projects by focusing on the decision making in uncertain situations. First, characteristics of an effectual approach in the context of R&D projects are developed and clearly delineated from conventional prediction-based control strategies hereinafter called causa-tion. Second, a thorough qualitative and quantitative scale development process is applied. Ex-pert interviews and a pilot study (123 R&D projects) are used to develop a multi-factor meas-urement model of effectuation and causation respectively. These measures are validated in a fol-low-up study with a larger sample of 400 projects. Third, the new measures are applied to test two central hypotheses: (a) effectuation is positively related with the success in highly innovative contexts, (b) causation approaches are particularly beneficial in projects with a low level of in-novativeness. Structural equation modeling is used to test the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that nonpredictive control approaches consistent with effectuation are an important predictor of suc-cessful highly innovative R&D projects. At the same time causation proves to significantly en-hance performance of projects that involve a low level of innovativeness.",Effectuation; Project performance; R&D projects,Competition; Competitive advantage; Control strategies; Effectuation; Innovative product; Prediction-based; Project performance; Scale development; Structural equation modeling; Decision making

We tested two mechanisms that may explain why individuals are attracted to companies that engage in CSR: person-organization fit (e.g., individuals who care about the environment are attracted to like-minded companies because such companies represent a good fit with their identities) and signaling (e.g., individuals use information about a company's community involvement to infer how employees are treated). Participants (N = 180) reviewed the web pages of three companies, including a target company whose pages contained the CSR manipulation (CSR-Community, CSR-Environment, or No-CSR). Results provided considerable support for the study hypotheses. Individuals had more favorable attitudes toward the target company, and overwhelmingly ranked it as their top choice, when its web pages contained CSR information. Supporting the personorganization fit mechanism, individuals higher on communal orientation were especially attracted to the target company when its pages included information about community involvement, and this relationship was mediated by a direct measure of person-organization fit. Supporting the signaling mechanism, expectations for favorable employee treatment were higher when the target company's pages included CSR information, and the effects of the manipulation on applicant attraction and job pursuit intentions were mediated by expected employee treatment.

Thus, a general, undifferentiated (between trait and method influences) factor affects all trait-method units. Attempting to partition this general variance into trait and method components is difficult, and perhaps misleading.

In the long run, therefore, differential ability to elevate corporate coherence or to refocus resources may well be a source of heterogeneous firm performance. In this paper, I identify the spinoff process as a mechanism with refocusing potential that has not yet been explored as such, and I investigate the impact of different types of spinoffs on their parents. I argue that spinoffs elevate corporate coherence by removing cognitive- or capabilities-based impediments to organizational learning or by imposing managerial discipline at the parent firm. When I test the framework on a hand-collected data set from the US automobile industry, I find that spinoffs that a) locate further from their parents on the capabilities space, b) impose managerial discipline at the parent firm, c) resolve a cognitive conflict at the higher echelons of the parent's hierarchy, and d) are initiated by managers, improve the parent's performance by reducing its mortality rate. In addition, the econometric analysis shows that having too many spinoffs too frequently is detrimental, calling for a thoughtful strategic management of spinoff activity by the parent.",Corporate coherence; Refocusing; Spinoffs,Managers; Statistical tests; Business organizations; Corporate coherences; Econometric analysis; Heterogeneous firms; Organizational learning; Refocusing; Spinoffs; Strategic management; Automotive industry

Employing a sample of 300 articles on medical and health-related topics, this paper examines the impact of the article's position within the two-mode affiliation network of articles and editors on article quality. This paper finds that the position of the article within both the local and global networks of articles and editors is significantly related to article quality. These results suggest that editors transfer information and knowledge from one collaborative environment to another on the same platform. Somewhat surprisingly, the direct collaborative processes have little relationship to article quality. Taken together, these findings suggest that the social aspects of Wikipedia are indispensable for understanding its collaborative processes.",Collaboration; Social networks; Wikipedia,Social aspects; Article qualities; Collaboration; Collaboration process; Collaborative environments; Collaborative process; Global networks; Transfer information; Wikipedia; Social networking (online)

While prior work in agency theory has argued that firms may fail to engage in profit maximizing behaviors due to misalignment between the goals of owners and managers, we contend that we are unlikely to observe pure profit maximizing behavior even in the case of the perfect alignment of goals that exists in owner-managed firms. We compare the competitive behaviors of owner-managed and professionally managed firms and find that, contrary to the expectations of agency theory, professionally managed firms are more likely to engage in behaviors consistent with profit-maximization goals. Consistent with the view that owner-managers are less concerned with maximizing profits, we observe that the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of owner-managed firms are all relatively less responsive to the underlying economic attractiveness of the markets in which they operate.",Agency theory; Competition; Firm goals,Competition; Managers; Agency theory; Competitive behavior; Firm goals; Objective functions; Ownership structure; Pricing decision; Profit maximization; Profitability

These situations constitute information intensive environments, as analyses of one's own strengths and liabilities and those of the opponent are necessary in planning effective action. However, current models of information processing in teams are insensitive to the effects of a team's strategic orientation with respect to playing offense versus defense. This paper expands recent social psychological thought on the effects of approach and avoidance goals in individuals to outline a process model of strategic orientation and information processing dynamics in teams. The model is developed through observations of eight counterterrorism teams in the intelligence community who explicitly adopted an offense or defense strategic orientation in evaluating current threats. Teams playing offense considered a narrower range of options, made better use of the special skills of members, and were more confident of their selected courses of action, while teams playing defense considered a broader range of options, made more use of external information, and were more comprehensive. The observations suggest broader theoretical implications for research on teams, as the ""offense"" and ""defense"" strategic orientations appear to influence fundamental team processes related to performance strategy and use of member knowledge and skill.",Information processing; Strategic orientation; Teams,Crime; Data processing; Counter terrorism; Current models; External informations; Intelligence communities; Process Modeling; Strategic orientation; Team process; Teams; Network security

In both constructions, workers' difference is systematically associated with lower surplus value. These discursive constructions are, on the one hand, firmly anchored in the material and discursive productive structure of the factory. On the other, they are deployed to legitimize the elimination of 1) phases of the production process that can be carried out by 'different' workers through outsourcing and 2) 'different' workers themselves in restructuring processes. Both modes of elimination are functional to increase the value extracted from labour.

But how did we arrive at such a point and how does knowing that help us understand the state of ""strategy"" today? The answer, we believe, can be found in history, in the two-centuries-old debate between Antoine-Henri Jomini (1779-1869) and Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831). In an attempt to make strategy both tractable and broadly applicable, while cloaking his work in a legitimizing patina of science, Jomini reduced strategy to a set of simple, prescriptive techniques for command and control. Clausewitz, however, argued otherwise. He warned of the immutable uncertainty of war and railed against the use of simple, prescriptive maxims. Ultimately, Jomini told his intended audience what they wanted to hear and carried the day, even though, over time, Clausewitz proved to be the far superior theorist. As we place this nearly two-century-old debate in its full historical, social and scientific context, we will not only better understand how we have developed today's received notions of strategy as we have, but also how strategy may yet evolve our notions of strategy in the future.",Complexity; History; Strategy,Business educations; Business practices; Command and control; Complexity; Scientific context; Strategy; History

It was hypothesized that newcomer informationseeking will mediate between tactics and adjustment outcomes. Newcomer work experience was expected to moderate the influence of tactics on information-seeking and adjustment outcomes. Data was collected from 244 graduates of an Asian university using a longitudinal design. Results show that social and content tactics are the strongest predictors of adjustment outcomes of role clarity, role conflict, role orientation and organizational commitment. Newcomer experience moderates the effects of tactics on the information-seeking facets, and on organizational commitment.

We did not find evidence for mediation between serial socialization tactics and job satisfaction. Our study contributes to the newcomer socialization literature in three ways. First, we introduce social exchange (via LMX) as a potentially potent mediating mechanism within the socialization process. Second, we capture more poignantly the influence of the immediate supervisor within the newcomer adjustment process - wherein most research focuses on organizational-level sources for socialization.

In particular, they find that the predictions of the uncertainty management model hold among those with low, but not high, group identification. This effect is demonstrated on perceptions of fairness, reactions to treatment, and desire for social change. This pattern was expected because group identification neutralizes the threats posed by uncertainty. That is, group identification itself helps individuals manage uncertainty and thus reduces the need for the uncertainty-reducing function served by fair treatment.

Their findings, however, have been contradictory due to data and methodological limitations. The German hospital sector is large, and several different ownership types have co-existed for decades, making this a fruitful field for studying the effects of ownership on efficiency. Objective: The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relative efficiency of public, private for-profit, and private nonprofit hospitals in Germany. Based on the findings of previous studies we hypothesized that in Germany public hospitals are more efficient than private for-profit, and private non-profit hospitals. Methods: The data for our cross-sectional study were derived from the hospitals' annual reports collected and administered by the German Federal Statistical Office. This rich dataset covers all public, private for-profit, and private non-profit hospitals in Germany and contains hospital-level and patient-level information. In order to determine the impact of ownership on hospital efficiency we proceeded in two steps. First, bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to evaluate the efficiency of a panel (n = 952) of public, private for-profit, and private non-profit hospitals between 2002 and 2006. This was followed by a second-step truncated linear regression model with bootstrapped DEA efficiency scores as dependent variable. In this model we explored the impact of hospital organizational and environmental characteristics while controlling for patient heterogeneity. Results: The results of our analysis show that public hospitals performed significantly better than their private counterparts, while private non-profit hospitals outperformed private for-profit hospitals. We also found a significant positive association between hospital size and efficiency, and that competitive pressure had a significant negative impact on hospital efficiency. In addition we found a number of interesting interaction effects, between competition and ownership as well as hospital size and ownership. In particular, we found that private hospitals are especially inefficient in regions with strong competition and private hospitals are more efficient among the very large hospitals with more than about 1000 beds. Conclusion: The ongoing trend towards privatization in Germany and elsewhere may not be an appropriate way to ensure the best use of the scarce resources in the hospital sector, because public hospitals are more efficient than private for-profit hospitals. Our results suggest that private for-profit hospitals place greater emphasis on earning profits (i.e. higher revenues per case due to higher prices), whereas public hospitals, because of severe resource constraints, focus primarily on efficiency. Additional longitudinal studies are thus needed to measure and compare the performance of privatized hospitals. This could be a fruitful path to gain a better understanding of the consequences of ongoing privatization in the hospital sector.",Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency measurement; Hospital ownership,Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Privatization; Profitability; Regression analysis; Competitive pressure; Cross-sectional study; Efficiency measurement; Environmental characteristic; Hospital ownerships; Linear regression models; Relative efficiency; Statistical Offices; Hospitals

The availability of such innovation impulses, however, critically depends on the environment a firm is operating in. Little is known on how national environments differ with respect to the munificence in providing innovation impulses. These differences may be particularly pronounced between transition economies and established market economies. We argue that firms from transition and established economies differ in their search pattern and that these search patterns moderate the relationship between innovation inputs and outputs. Based on a sample of almost 7,000 firms from 13 European countries we find strong support for open innovation strategies in both settings. However, performance differs in established market and transition economy contexts.",Absorptive capacity; Search strategies; Transition economies,Absorptive capacity; European Countries; Innovation process; Market economies; Open innovation; Search patterns; Search strategies; Transition economy; Commerce

Results from an experimental field study carried out in the music industry indicate that task ambiguity moderates the predictive performance of managers and of analytical models. Also, the true value of expert intuition unfolds when managers with high levels of domain-specific expertise make predictions in highly ambiguous contexts. The study goes on to delineate the conditions in which collective intuition is most likely to increase judgmental accuracy. Finally, key findings challenge the robustness of previous research proposing an optimal 50:50 split between analytical and intuitive cognition to engineer higher quality decisions. In the music industry, the split shifts to 80:20 in low and 40:60 in high task ambiguity contexts for the most experienced managers. The optimal split becomes 90:10 when task ambiguity is low and 56:44 when it is high for less experienced managers. These differences further illustrate the importance of considering the external task environment and internal domain-specific expertise in assessing the role of intuitive and analytical information processing in managerial forecasting.",Bootstrapping models; Intuition; Music industry,Decision making; Forecasting; Ambiguous contexts; Bootstrapping model; Domain specific; Intuition; Model Manager; Music industry; Predictive performance; Task environment; Managers

We build on findings from the team faultlines literature in order to deepen our understanding of how the internal boundaries of work teams can be effectively managed. Whereas existing models of team faultlines have been inconsistent in terms of identifying which faultlines are most important for teams, we argue when and why certain subgroups matter and what leaders can do about them. First, we suggest that team members generally organize into three basic types of subgroups, cliques, coalitions, and cohorts, based on alignment of member traits related to identity, resources, and knowledge, respectively. Second, we extend Hackman's (1987; 2002) model of team design and leadership by proposing how certain leader behaviors are more likely to promote team effectiveness depending upon whether cliques, coalitions, or cohorts are activated.",Diversity; Leadership; Team effectiveness,Diversity; Internal boundary; Leadership; New approaches; Team designs; Team effectiveness; Team leadership; Team members

Drawing on Resource Based View and Transaction Cost Economics we argue that on average if synergies and common benefits outweigh non cooperative behavior and private benefits, there will be a positive association between the values created for the two partners. Conversely if private benefits and non cooperative behavior outweigh common benefits, there will be a negative association as partners derive value at the expense of the other rather than by creating new opportunities through the JV. Using a sample of 344 JVs and a simultaneous equation framework we find evidence of a positive association between the values created for the two partners after controlling for various factors. This suggests that on average the stock market perceives JVs to be positive sum games rather than zero sum games, and that the dominant source of value creation in JVs are synergies rather than resource appropriation. In addition we hypothesize and find that there is a positive association between the values created when both firms possessed relatively strong resources, and when the two firms were not direct competitors in product markets. In contrast there was a negative association when the partners were direct competitors in product markets, and when there was lack of JV experience. These latter findings provide insight into the relative effects of cooperative behavior and non cooperative behavior in JVs, and when each type of behavior becomes dominant.",Joint ventures; Resource based view; Transacion costs,Commerce; Costs; Mergers and acquisitions; Co-operative behaviors; Inter-relationships; Joint ventures; Non-cooperative behaviors; Resource-based view; Simultaneous equations; Transacion costs; Transaction cost economics; Behavioral research

A traditional way of addressing this need has been to send an expatriate from the onshore country to offshore country. Another approach is to assign project liaison roles to professional workers who have emigrated from popular offshoring destinations such India, Russia, China, and Eastern Europe and are now working inside US and West European firms. Behind this practice, however, there is an assumption that immigrant managers will enable effective collaboration by drawing on their dual onshore and offshore identities. Present study investigates the consequences of this practice in the context of offshoring software development work to India, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and China. It is based on several dozen interviews with offshore and onshore IT professionals. Interviews with offshore professionals revealed that the practice of nominating onshore immigrant managers as project liaisons is sometimes problematic. While shared language and knowledge of customs were helpful for collaboration, immigrants often adopted unfavorable attitudes towards their excountrymen. Some immigrant managers exhibit profound lack of trust and respect for their offshore counterparts engaging in micro-management behaviors. Some immigrant managers also relied on outdated knowledge of offshore business environments; yet, felt no need for updating this knowledge. Others yet refused to speak their native tongue. The study uses social identity theory and interviews with onshore managers themselves to explain these intriguing findings.",Boundary spanners; Offshoring; Social identity,Managers; Offshore oil well production; Boundary spanners; Business environments; Cultural boundaries; Management behavior; Off-shoring; Social identity; Social identity theories; Software development projects; Software design

Our research is an inductive study primarily based on interviews with 59 executives from firms involved in nanotechnology. We develop a grounded model of executives' labeling activities. The model suggests that firm-to-label alignment, label appeal and institutional pressures influence executives' propensity to employ a label in emerging domains of activity. Depending on their perceptions on these factors, executives employ three labeling techniques: claiming, hedging and rejecting. The paper concludes that a label is a symbolic resource to which ceremonial attachment may both propel and hinder its use. The study hence opens important avenues for further inquiries into the role of labels in emergent domains of activity.",Emerging domains; Labels,Emerging domains; Impression management; Institutional pressures; Labeling strategy; Labeling techniques; Labeling

Using a novel panel data of 4270 USPTO issued patents in genomics which yield 1279 patent-paper pairs, covering more than 400 unique life sciences firms and organizations, I find that a reduction in patent enforcement uncertainty and uncertainty over market value of the patent, facilitated by the granting of the paired patent over its corresponding scientific knowledge, work in concert to negatively impact the generation and accumulation of scientific knowledge within the firm. The decline in annual organization self-citations reflects a reallocation of scientists and scientific resources to alternative knowledge projects. This decline is most salient for firms operating and developing their scientific innovations in countries with stronger IPR institutions, for larger and more established IPO firms than smaller non-IPO firms and for private firms than public institutions. These findings have significant strategic and management implications for innovative firms and organizations that engage in knowledge-intensive activities and operate over national and geographic boundaries, especially in terms of the tradeoff they have to make between short-term exploitation of firm¡'s existing knowledge base and future exploration into important (and sometimes unknown) areas of research and market for ideas.",Knowledge production; Life Sciences and biotechnology; Uncertain intellectual property,Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Geographic boundaries; Intellectual property rights; Knowledge production; Life sciences and biotechnologies; Management implications; Scientific knowledge; Scientific resources; Uncertain intellectual properties; Patents and inventions

Moreover, recently some structural equation modeling programs (such as LISREL) report fit indices derived from the normal theory weighted least squares fÓ2 (C2) while the conventional rules were developed for fit indices derived from maximum likelihood fÓ2 (C1). Our simulation finds that using conventional rules but C2-based fit indices may not have enough power to reject misspecified models.

Performative competence includes the implicit and explicit knowledge of the lexicon, grammar and the socio-cultural rules and norms that guide and inform routine participants during performance. Routine performance is likened to a conversation among routine participants who draw from these elements and the routine artifacts to perform their activities. Conceptualizing organizational routines as language maintains the important notion of routines as combinations of actions and representations, and provides a vocabulary to describe and differentiate among the patterns found in routine performances and the patterns held in the minds of routine participants. The theoretical framework is used to investigate empirically the different elements of the IT support routine in two different organizations. Findings show that, although the two organizations share the same ""language,"" they ""speak"" it differently, and explanations why this occurred are provided. The study also reveals how interactions among the elements of the routine explain the routine stability, change, flexibility and efficiency.",Help desk; Language; Organizational routines,Essential elements; Explicit knowledge; Help Desk; Internal structure; Language; Language maintains; Organizational routines; Theoretical framework
Hubris or humility: Cautions surrounding the construct and self-definition of authentic leadership,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960296788&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44247841&partnerID=40&md5=117258af4768652fe461581aa6d5e531,"We critique the construct of authentic leadership and the problems associated with perceiving oneself as an authentic leader. We raise concerns regarding the conflation of authenticity with leadership and the assumptions that extensive self-knowledge, including moral self-knowledge, is necessary to be authentic. We note that reliance on others to validate one's authenticity may be no more than impression management. Moreover, claiming the mantle of authentic leadership may lead to rigid and global positive self-assessments resulting in hubris. Instead we argue for an aspirational approach to authenticity that avoids a quixotic search for self-knowledge and acknowledges that authenticity is best pursued not in the context of positive leadership attributes alone but under conditions of the rarely noted virtue of humility.",Authentic leadership; Authenticity; Humility,Authentic leadership; Authenticity; Humility; Impression management; Self assessment; Authentication
The follower's dilemma: Innovation and imitation in the professional services industry,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086490992&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44243219&partnerID=40&md5=a7dba5fe28c24bd3b2a92bafaf3a18d9,"Firms contemplating imitation of a competitor's innovation face a dilemma imitate a new, unproven offering, or forgo imitation and perhaps miss out on the next big thing. We examine the innovation imitation decision under environmental uncertainty, when theory predicts the greatest tension in the imitation decision. We apply information-based theories of imitation to evaluate both firm- and service-level factors important to the decision to competitor innovation imitation. Analyzing the largest 50 professional services firms over an 11-year period, we find that while firm-level factors increase imitation, service-level factors decrease imitation. Furthermore, firm- and service-level factors interact to affect imitation outcomes.",Imitation; Innovation; Professional services,Decision theory; Environmental uncertainty; Imitation; Professional services; Professional services firms; Service levels; Professional aspects
Investigating the sustainability of a sustained 360 process,2009,"Academy of Management 2009 Annual Meeting: Green Management Matters, AOM 2009",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992616789&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2009.44265101&partnerID=40&md5=b70801aa71f0b4630cb6941193edd67a,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the sustainability of improvement in managerial effectiveness from a sustained 360 process. Such a study is needed because most research on 360 feedback has not considered the need for follow-up support. In addition, many of the prior studies have been based a single feedback intervention. Furthermore, much of the research on management is contaminated with common source variance. Thus, this study investigates the changes in managerial effectiveness based on ratings by the superiors of managers who go through the 360 feedback process up to four times over an extended period of time.",360 feeback; Management development; Managerial effectiveness,Sustainable development; 360 feeback; Common source; Feedback interventions; Feedback process; Follow up; Management development; Management IS; Managerial effectiveness; Managers

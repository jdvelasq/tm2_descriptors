An empirical analysis of the relationship between capital adequacy and performance optimisation through a comparative standpoint among banking sectors in India,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198588950&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.139936&partnerID=40&md5=62bb7232494c7ff8750e82426d54e847,"This study aims to assess the impact of capital adequacy on the performance optimisation of the Indian banking industry across and among the banking sectors. The study employs a balanced panel data regression model to examine the firm-level balanced panel data of 78 banks from the public and private sectors over 15 years (2007–2022). The findings confirm that capital adequacy significantly impacts bank profitability across the industry, but there is also a sector-specific impact. This study provides the most recent information on the differences in tactics used by public and private sector banks to maintain capital adequacy standards. Furthermore, using two-step system GMM analyses, the possibility of heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and endogeneity was considered.

Human resource disclosure practices: a comparative analysis of public and private sector manufacturing companies of Indian corporate sector,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198603895&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.139928&partnerID=40&md5=c08fa68b9233110ecd4fe7222cfa7f4b,"The aim of the study is to identify the effect of a company’s characteristics on human resource disclosure index in public and private sector manufacturing companies listed in India. The outcome of one-way LSDV regression model depicts that in the case of public sector manufacturing companies, some hypotheses such as company size, type of auditor, total number of pages of an annual report have significant and profitability, liquidity have partly effect on HRDI. In case of private sector manufacturing companies, some hypotheses such as company age, ownership concentration, liquidity, total number of pages of an annual report have significant and company size, profitability have partly effect on the level of HR disclosure. Further, the outcome of the Mann-Whitney U test shows that there are significance variations of HR disclosure practices between public and private sector manufacturing companies listed in India.

"Structural change, information asymmetry and volatility in Indian stock market: evidence from pre-and-post-COVID-19 outbreak",2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192835834&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138390&partnerID=40&md5=39cac6a62ffc056f0bf71651b5fa28d2,"This paper examines the Indian stock market’s interconnection with the stock markets of the top four economies before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The log-returns of daily data for Sensex, S&P 500, SSE Composite, Nikkei 225 and DAX were used in the study. The log-return series of all stock indices were found to be stationary. The exponential-GARCH model is applied to assess the information asymmetry and to model the volatility spillover on the Indian stock market. The ARCH and GARCH terms were positive and significant during both the pre-COVID and post-COVID outbreak periods representing that market news and previous period variances were significantly increasing the volatility in the market. The ensemble of events during the pre-COVID period confirms the negative significant volatility spillover of bourses on the Indian markets, and continues to be so in the post-COVID period, except in case of the US market where there is a positive significant return and volatility spillover. The portfolio managers, regulators, policymakers and other market participants may consider the change in information transmission during the pre-COVID and post-COVID-19 outbreak phases from these foreign markets to India while making investment-related decisions.

The efficiency and the stability of efficiency rankings of Vietnamese commercial banks through mergers and acquisitions from 2008 to 2018,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198578344&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.139933&partnerID=40&md5=a81d9f4842ff360a7717f224c84010b8,"This study applied DEA window analysis in combination with non-parametric testing to evaluate the efficiency of the Vietnamese commercial banks pre-and post-mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as to test the stability of the banking efficiency during M&A period. The results showed that the average technical efficiency calculated from the window analysis model ranged from 81% to 99%. Many banks carrying out M&As have grown in all aspects such as increasing in scale, improving technology capabilities and success management. However, there were also some banks that showed weakness through M&As. The reasons for the inefficiency of those banks were mainly the excess of customer deposits in balance sheet of the banks and their bad debts.

The downside deviation quadratic programming for stock portfolio optimisation: an empirical study of shariah and conventional indices in Indonesia,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192820178&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138386&partnerID=40&md5=29b2f5c9fcdd52000a26983ef9810f80,"The quadratic programming (QP) for portfolio optimisation may yet be improved to generate better results on the risk. This study presents the downside deviation quadratic programming (DDQP) to optimise the risk of portfolio as a refinement of QP. The data deals with the price of stocks listed in Jakarta Islamic Index and IDX30 Indonesia for a definite interval. The selection of portfolio for all the stocks considered the sectoral approach. Upon selection, the DDQP model was constructed and applied to the selected portfolio before benchmarking to QP. The results showed that the portfolio group 1 had the best risk on the shariah platform, while the portfolio group 7 was superior to conventional. Additionally, the empirical analysis revealed that ten scenarios can be inferred based on the DDQP as it is consistently stable in producing a lower risk portfolio than the QP. Lastly, heuristic pattern search also verified the results of DDQP.

Firm size effect and the price and volume reaction to corporate news: evidence from India,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192823990&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138388&partnerID=40&md5=235db0c598a8727564f0eb4a1e57f773,"This study examines the price and volume reaction to corporate news for a sample of firms quoted on the National Stock Exchange of India, an Asian emerging market. We take into account the market capitalisation of the firms to examine the firm size effect on market reaction using the event study methodology. It is observed that small firms, on average, are associated with 1.12% and 0.43% more positive abnormal returns than large and mid-sized firms on the day of the positive news flow. On the other hand, when the news is negative, small firms, on average, are associated with –1.1% and –0.62% more negative abnormal returns than large and mid-sized firms on the day of the news flow. Further, the evidence suggests that the price reaction is consistent while the volume reaction differs according to the type and sentiment of the news in different size groups.

Impact of efficiency and ownership concentration in Indian banks on their NPAs: a panel data analysis,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192852481&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138392&partnerID=40&md5=153efb8854521faeb0e8f642e168a340,"Non-performing assets (NPAs) in banks are a serious issue and have attracted considerable academic research attention. This study contributes to banking literature by assessing banks’ technical efficiency (TE) by applying data envelope analysis (DEA) and NPAs for the sample of 34 banks in India from 2016 through 2019. This study empirically investigates the impact of technical efficiency and ownership concentration on NPAs of Indian banks by applying both static and dynamic panel data models. Ownership concentration is taken as the proportion of the holdings of promoters (promo), the institutional investors (iih) and retail investors (rih). The static model’s findings reveal that TE has a positive association with NPAs, while in the dynamic model, TE surprisingly has no impact on NPAs in Indian banks. Both models indicate ownership concentration has a mixed effect on NPAs depending on holdings. This study provides important insights into bank performance leading to economic growth.

Valuation effect of the extent and quality of corporate sustainability disclosure across sectors in Nigeria,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198586467&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.139929&partnerID=40&md5=70e4c1b4061ca800b725a1929cdcacc0,"This paper examines the value impact of the extent and quality of CSP disclosure across industries in Nigeria. Results reveal that the value effect of the scope and quality of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) disclosure varies among industries, indicating that the investing public in various industries see this information differently. Some investors see these data favourably and reward reporting entities with higher share prices, while others see superior quality reporting as the rationale for immoderate investment in a costly project, which has an adverse value impact on these industries. Nevertheless, other investors see no value in such information. The value impact also varies among CSP dimensions. The study has implications for managers, the investing public and for policy makers in strengthening policies that promote more socially responsible investment among sectors.

Firm attributes and discretionary disclosures of financial institutions in Nigeria,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192811127&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138387&partnerID=40&md5=a962bed9ded706effcccfe10daf8c48d,"Investors and other stakeholders require corporate reports that are comprehensive and informative in order to make sound economic decisions. However, few entities voluntarily disclose information about their performance and activities beyond mandatory reporting frameworks. This study examined the influence of firm attributes on discretionary disclosure of listed financial services firms in Nigeria. The study adopted an ex-post facto research design. The analysis revealed that the selected firm attributes jointly exerted a positive and significant effect on discretionary disclosure. The isolated effects were mixed. The study concluded that firm attributes affect the extent of discretionary disclosure of information by the financial firms in Nigeria and recommended that the management of firms should be intentional in disclosing non-mandatory information to meet the need of users and possibly enhance the reputation and brand value of their firms.

The nexus between liquidity and lottery-like features: evidence from Tehran stock exchange,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193265324&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138393&partnerID=40&md5=1595986852ba191a1048b04fa765982b,"To shed further light on the nexus between the stock liquidity and the lottery-like features, this paper provides evidence from the monthly data of the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from December 21, 2008 to May 21, 2020. Furthermore, we intend to clarify whether having lottery-like features in countries like Iran with religious, social and legal restrictions on gambling leads the stocks to be more liquid or not. Our target variables are illiquidity (the average of four well-established illiquidity benchmarks) and lottery-like (a defined dummy variable that is 1 or 0 for having or not having lottery-like features, respectively) and we define some control variables according to the previous researches. The econometric methods utilised in this study are GLS, Granger causality test and vector auto regressive model (VAR). The results evince that being lottery-like causes stocks to be more liquid and there is no decisive evidence to the contrary. Moreover, capital market participants perform overreaction to the lottery-like stocks despite the anti-gambling setting.

The final sample consists of 14,170 firm-year observations. We examine the applicability of two conflicting hypotheses: the agency cost hypothesis and the earnings volatility hypothesis to explore the impact of corporate diversification strategies namely international market diversification and product diversification on earnings management. We find that earnings management reduces as the extent of international diversification increases. Firms diversified across product segments are likely to have a higher level of real activities manipulation. Business affiliates with a higher degree of international market diversification have a lower level of discretionary accruals. The study provides useful insights to investors, analysts and regulators to make an informed decision on investments, forecasting earnings and policymaking respectively.

This paper contributes to the literature by developing a new index to measure the degree and evolution of financial integration of SADC. The index is calculated by weighting together a set of indicators for financial integration from four financial market segments namely the banking, money, Treasury-bill and equity markets. The results displayed high volatility during the period under review. This volatility gives an indication that prices react quickly to new information. The results also indicate a time changing pattern of integration among the member countries and are also influenced by both internal and external factors influencing the financial system of SADC. Integration scores have increased for those countries that have implemented financial reforms. We recommend policymakers to formulate a proper framework for regional financial integration to guide the integration process smoothly and contain key realistic milestones.

Shareholder identity and real earnings management: empirical evidence from Vietnam,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192816391&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.138391&partnerID=40&md5=821798101000a097e671128680543992,"The purpose of this article is to investigate the link between shareholder identification and real earnings management. Managerial ownership (MO), foreign ownership (FO), and state ownership (SO) are all used in the study to establish shareholder identity. The abnormal discretionary spending, abnormal production cost, and abnormal cash flows from operations are also used to assess real earnings management. The data of 390 Vietnamese listed companies was collected from the FiinPro platform, leading to a sample of 1,170 firm-year observations over the investigation period from 2017 to 2019. The study reveals that FO and SO have a large negative influence on actual profits management, despite the fact that they have the capacity to improve the quality of financial information to a greater level. In contrast, this paper shows no evidence for a relationship between MO and shareholder identity. Therefore, we suggested that policymakers should create favourable conditions to attract foreign investors as an effective monitoring mechanism and pay attention to the role of SO. Our findings also have significant implications for providing a more comprehensive understanding for firm managers and investors about the role of firms’ sustainable ownership structure in deterring and reducing earnings management.

We examine informational content of both channels of conveying value to shareholders of Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies between 2010 and 2017. Motivated by conflicting dividend policy theories and respective empirical findings, the study is aimed at proffering empirical evidence that assists equity investors’ investment decisions. Using an autoregressive distributed lag model in system GMM with panel data, both cash dividends and retained earnings exhibited a positive association with market capitalisation but, in both cases, the association lacks statistical significance. This means that both variables do not have information that explicates firm value variations. To forecast firm value, equity investors should therefore not rely on models anchored on either cash dividends or retained earnings. By extension, company executives are advised to avoid making dividend policy changes with the aim of positively influencing firm value. A novel contribution of this study is that investors are not worried about how value created is conveyed to them because they can still enjoy it in either form. We conclude that payment or non-payment of dividends neither creates nor destroys firm value.

The researchers paid a special attention to the variable accountings and macroeconomics in the explanation of the systemic risk. The results pointed out that the three first banks with an important systemic ranking are public banks (STB, BNA, and BH). The empirical validations revealed the presence of a positive dependence connection between the public and private banks and that the generation probability of a systemic situation is getting more important during the distress periods. The results of the determinants analysis explored that the liquidity risk, the credit risk and the financial institution’s inefficient level represent the main trigger factors of a systemic risk, along with an expansionist monetary policy that may lead to an accumulation of a systemic risk.

Further investigation confirms that there are certain firm-specific factors (e.g., firm size and age), managerial characteristics (e.g., founder status and excessive shareholdings) and corporate governance measures (e.g., board independence and separation between the CEO and chair) which moderate the positive effects of Islamic religiosity. Several important policy implications can be drawn regarding the selection process of the firms’ top executives which should consider certain managerial characteristics, the formulation of appropriate financing strategies according to the firms’ characteristics and the implementation of good corporate governance measures.

Reported risk categories in the prospectus and IPO valuation in Indian stock market: an empirical investigation,2024,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188172271&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2024.137364&partnerID=40&md5=e63eab11de7d6999b73103269e896d25,"The current study aims to identify the risk categories that may impact initial public offering (IPO) performance. It also investigates the impact of selected mutually exclusive risk categories on IPO performance. The current analysis examined 131 IPOs from 2011 to 2020 on the main board of the NSE in India. We gathered all the risk statements from the issuers’ IPO prospectuses and analysed their substance. To standardise and accept these categories across the research fraternity, a five-point Likert scale was established. Using principal component analysis, we find six broad categories of risk factors have been disclosed by the IPO firms, i.e., operational, compliance, management, equity, investment, technology and innovation risk. The results suggest that corporations prioritised financial soundness (liquidity position) over equity risk when disclosing investment risk. We also find that IPO firms with higher operational risk are more underpriced than firms with lower operational risk.

Secondly, the model is developed to examine the moderating role of audit committee effectiveness in the relationship between free cash flow and earnings management. Based on a sample of 255 firms belonging to the Amman Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2020, the results highlight the managers’ opportunistic behaviour in presence of free cash flows in order to increase reported earnings. It is shown that the independence and expertise have a vital monitoring role of managers’ behaviour that reduces earnings management. In addition, the moderating regression indicates also that the audit committee effectiveness affected positively the relationships between free cash flow and earnings management. Thus, the presence of such a committee restricts the managers in practising their opportunistic behaviours in presence of a free cash flow problem.

Although previous studies on this topic only exist from an international context, this paper presents evidence from South Africa by examining the effect of the South African volatility index (SAVI) on different Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed stock indices. The objectives of this study are to determine which GARCH model is most appropriate for modelling volatility in South Africa and whether the SAVI displays any relationship with the returns on equity indices. The study finds that the TGARCH model is the most suitable model for modelling volatility on the JSE. Thereafter, using a TGARCH model, it is observed that the SAVI is significantly positively related to the returns of all the chosen indices and that a leverage effect exists between them. The results provide important insight for investors, risk managers and policymakers.

Financial statements are the main source of data. Return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are the dependent variables measuring financial performance. The data is analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis. Correlation analysis reveals a non-significant negative relationship between CCC and profitability, whereas the control variables of size and debt exhibit a significant negative relationship with firm profitability. The regression results show that CCC has an insignificant positive effect on ROA but has a significant impact on ROE. Both size and debt have a significant impact on ROA and ROE. The findings highlight the need for the firms to focus on policies and strategies that will reduce the length of CCC to enhance profitability and firm value.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Botswana; cash conversion cycle; CCC; profitability; return on assets; return on equity; ROA; ROE,

Results of vector auto-regression suggest that one-month lagged sentiment index is a strong predictor of itself and aggregate stock market return with a positive sign, showing persistence and providing evidence of herd behaviour.

This study is conducted on a sample of 581 MFIs observed over the 2007 to 2015 period. It tests the effect of discretionary provision for loan impairment on future profitability by distinguishing different types of MFIs ownership. The results show that earnings management in MFIs tends to be opportunistic rather than efficient. The type of earnings management differs depending on ownership structure. Indeed, while cooperatives tend more to choose opportunistic earnings management, privately-owned MFIs manage their earnings efficiently. Furthermore, we found inconsistent evidence about earnings management in NGOs.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",earnings management; emerging economies; MFIs; microfinance institutions; ownership type; provision for loan impairment,

In particular, tax revenue is measured through tax revenue ratio or the government's total tax revenue to GDP. The research data were collected on a yearly basis in the period 1990-2019. Through the vector autoregressive (VAR) model, the paper has achieved great success when finding the positive impact of tax revenue (TAX) on economic growth in Vietnam; however, this impact is negative in the long term. Conversely, economic growth has a positive impact on tax revenue with one lag and three lags. In addition, economic growth in Vietnam is affected by domestic savings (SAV), trade openness (OP), government spending (GOV), and domestic investment (CAP); meanwhile, tax revenue is affected by domestic savings (SAV), trade openness (OP), and government spending (GOV). The paper is the first empirical evidence in Vietnam for the relationship between tax revenue and economic growth. Therefore, the research results have important implications for the Government of Vietnam to have a basis to administer tax policies in order to stimulate economic growth in a sustainable way.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",economic growth; tax policy; tax revenue; Vietnam,

The findings of the study show that governance structure variables, such as blockholder ownership and CEO duality, have a significant effect on total cash of CEO compensation while, board size and board independence are insignificant factors. Companies with blockholder ownership pay more CEO compensation suggesting that blockholder ownership is not a good governance mechanism to monitor corporate boards’ decisions. Companies with CEO duality tend to pay more compensation. This result suggests that the presence of the CEO in boards reduces the efficiency of the board in monitoring managerial decisions such as CEO compensation, which agrees with the agency view.

The study reveals a significant linkage between financial distress and earnings management and this association varies across accounting and market-based measures of financial distress. Also, the intensity of financial distress influences the direction (upward or downward) of earnings management. Interestingly, we find a stronger association of financial distress with accrual-based earnings management than real activity-based earnings management. Results also exhibit that the earnings management of financially troubled Indian firms is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The findings can help regulators and policymakers to design suitable policies to improve the quality of earnings reporting and constrain the possibility of earnings management.

It is found that liquidity deficit and credit risk have a tendency to exacerbate each other irrespective of demonetisation. The work finds that funding liquidity deficit faced by the banks increases interest rate volatility. Indications of debt rollover to alleviate proxies and indicators of credit risk are there too. All in all, the work shows that demonetisation had reduced liquidity problems but increased credit risk issues.

The long-term volatility forecast was done for an out of sample period of one year. The results provide strong evidence of the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity in the returns, suggesting that past news about volatility and lagged conditional variance has a significant impact on the daily volatility. The high degree of persistence indicates explosive volatility. The leverage effect coefficient signals that the impact of bad news on the current period of volatility is heavier than that of good news.

How COVID-19 pandemic and oil prices drive the Saudi sectors over investment horizons: a wavelet sector-based view,2023,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166418552&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2023.132204&partnerID=40&md5=5b60df3d6cbf614935cba77f3a45a6b4,"The Saudi economy has been severely shaken by the combined shocks inherent to the sharp fall of prices of oil as well as the tremendous propagation of the newly infectious disease (COVID-19). In this study, the focus is given to the assessment of COVID-19 impact on the leading Saudi industrial sectors over the investors’ investment horizons. We used three variants of the wavelet methods to achieve the study objective. The main advantage of the wavelet is to isolate the effect of oil price shocks and to account for the Saudi investors’ perceptions of the uncertainty inherent in response to the COVID-19 propagation in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, we check the toughness of our results using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model which is restricted to time scales. Our findings reveal a varying pattern of oil and COVID-19 over time scales and frequency bands across sectors. When isolating the oil impact, the COVID-19 effect is relatively low as compared to oil. These results are also supported by the NARDL outcomes. The results of our study propose operational implications for portfolio managers and policy makers and also pave the way for new research avenues.

Do earnings quality models affect different excess cash holdings models?,2023,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153525626&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2023.129546&partnerID=40&md5=19a3820156094b86c040f80bacd127eb,"With the increasing cost of external financing in Jordan, excess cash holdings are a dominant feature of industrial companies listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). This study provides empirical evidence of an information asymmetry problem by examining the impact of earnings quality on excess cash holdings. The results aim to help investors and creditors to evaluate the transparency of and confidence in financial reporting to enhance decision making and minimise the risk of default. The study employed three different models for earnings quality and two different models for excess cash holdings. Through examination of panel data, the study found that firms with poor earnings quality tend to accumulate excess cash holdings in order to isolate themselves from an information asymmetry problem.

To this end, it is important that the factors that drive shareholder value are identified and consistently emphasised. Drawing from the shareholder theory, this paper attempts to identify factors that strongly drive shareholder value of non-financial firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange during the period 2007 to 2017. Fixed-effect regression model is used in the study to estimate the relationship between various drivers identified in the extant literature and shareholder returns. The empirical result shows fixed capital investment, earnings per share, and return on equity are the main drivers of shareholder value among the sampled firms. They have a statistically significant and positive effect on shareholder value. Sales growth, operating margin, and free cash flow are not significantly associated with shareholder value. The study controls for interest expenses, firm size and age. This study is the first to examine the main drivers of shareholder returns on the GSE. In relevance, the study provides both managers and investors with useful signals about the factors that matter most in shareholder value creation, especially from the perspective of an emerging market.

The sample comprises all companies listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) at the end of 2009. A disclosure index was developed to determine the extent of SIR amongst the sample companies. The study used a longitudinal empirical analysis approach; a year-by-year analysis. The findings revealed a gradual upsurge and awareness of the requirements of IFRS-8 from year to year. Moreover, the reported results suggest that the post-implementation review of IFRS-8 has had a large and positive impact on SIR disclosures since 2014. This research should provide substantive insights for regulators and standard-setters in identifying best practices and spreading awareness of SIR, which in turn should allow SIR practices to become more standardised, making them easier to monitor and govern. Our study provides a longitudinal examination of segmental reporting practices in a developing country, such as Qatar, which permits direct examination of the progress made regarding the implementation and extent of SIR.

A sample of eleven conventional and three Islamic banks was used during the period 2011-2018. Applying a random effect panel data model revealed that banks engaged in income smoothing activities to decrease their income when their earnings were high but not to increase their income when their earnings were low. In addition, banks that reported losses in the previous year engaged in fewer income decreasing activities than banks that reported a profit; however, no evidence was detected of their engagement in income increasing activities. As per the use of LLP to manage regulatory capital or to signal future value, the findings did not support such practices. Moreover, Islamic banks do not appear to exercise different LLP practices or to have different incentives to manipulate LLP compared to conventional banks.

Using the proportionate stratified sampling technique, 64 usable questionnaires were received and the response rate was 28.2%. Non-response bias and common method bias were tested. From the factor analysis and multiple regression models, the following critical determinants were established: 1) ‘interaction between internal auditor and audit committee’; 2) ‘risk-based planning and guidelines’; 3) ‘moderating role of management support with Big Data Analytics’ for IA effectiveness in Indian context. The implications are the critical determinants that potentially influence this effectiveness in the changing business and technological environment which are important for policy decision purposes.

The results indicate that the market profitability index plays a moderating role rather than mediating role between investor sentiment and market liquidity. In the context of predictability, the results are contradictory. Apparently, in a perceptible illusion and logic of savings on the market, investors are unable to correctly anticipate the development of the market, which is rather relatively stable.

This study specifies the dynamic panel models and applies the two-step system generalised method of moments’ estimation that reduces the reverse-causality problem. The findings reveal that the average institutional quality index has positive impacts on debt maturity in developing nations. Furthermore, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption have positive impacts on debt maturity, separately. Moreover, institutional quality has positive impacts on debt maturity of listed firms in developing nations where legal enforcement quality is high, but it has negative impacts on the debt maturity of firms in developing nations where legal enforcement quality is low. The overall findings suggest that strong institutional quality and legal enforcement reduce bankruptcy costs; these encourage lenders to provide firms debt capital with long-term maturity.

A generalised method of moment was employed for the regression analysis. The evidence showed that the number of rural bank branches positively impacted their ROCE and ROE but negatively impacted their NIM. Consistent with the RBV theory, the study further found that the establishment of rural banks in cities positively impacted their performance. The number and location of rural bank branches can impact their financial performance.

The study reports that the bank returns are significantly negative during the pre-downgrade announcement period. Interestingly, the returns are negative again on the downgrade announcement day. Conversely, the bank returns turn insignificantly positive during the post downgrade announcement period. The study concludes that downgrades do not have a negative wealth impact on banks' stock returns after the announcement by credit rating agencies. Eventually, it results in early awareness of investors regarding the financial position of the banks, and it does not come as a shock to them. The study has a direct implication on short-term investors who rely highly on the announcements by rating agencies to make buy/sell decisions. Moreover, the study will also help the regulators and banks better understand the impact of such rating changes on stock returns.

Modelling the real exchange rate misalignment in the presence of outliers for developing countries,2023,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172905141&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2023.133406&partnerID=40&md5=8b165791faf8dee976bdc124a288439b,"Persistent real exchange rate misalignment is sometimes explained by the presence of a nonlinear adjustment process towards the long-run equilibrium. However, although the nonlinearity may be a feature for some real exchange rates, outliers and nonlinearity may easily be confused. The main purpose of this paper is to make the distinction between nonlinearity and outliers using robust estimation methods of maximum likelihood. Also, the nature of the real exchange rate misalignment is specified, based on the value of fundamentals, for a sample of African countries during the period from 1960 to 2015. According to the robust estimation procedures, the results of linearity tests are particularly interesting. Indeed, the apparent nonlinearity is significantly reduced when considering outliers, especially for South Africa, Ghana, Madagascar and Morocco. We can conclude that the source of the nonlinearity of the real exchange misalignment rate for the countries already mentioned is the existence of outliers in the considered series.

The central research question in this study is whether these restrictions have affected tax avoidance after firms reduced their APTS. Using a difference-in-difference design, this paper investigates and finds that reducing APTS leads to a significant decrease in tax avoidance. These results are consistent with the notion that the PCAOB’s restrictions, intended chiefly to enhance auditor independence, also led to this significant decrease in tax avoidance.

The panel data framework has been structured for a dataset of 442 companies for the time period 2013–2019. The women engagement in boardroom has advanced from meagre 5% in 2013 to 14% in 2019 after the introduction of gender-based quota in India. The empirical results substantiate that the impact of women directors on firm performance is weak. From the policy perspective, it is evident that amendments in the regulatory framework in board composition have led to more participation of women in leadership positions. However, it is suggested that further reforms are needed for encouraging women directors to act independently and foster more diversity in Indian boardrooms.

This paper has a purpose to understand the movement and volatility of MIBOR by exploring any cointegration of MIBOR with exchange rates of major currencies like – US dollar, Japanese yen, euro and pound sterling, to derive a model gauging volatility spill-overs and asymmetry of MIBOR. Based on the daily data from 01.01.19 to 21.01.21 VECM and E-Garch model is applied. MIBOR is found to be cointegrated with exchange rates of dollar and yen with error correction being done by the rupee-yen exchange rates. Volatility spill-overs were significant with previous error lag with no asymmetry due to any negative news. Findings have great implications to manage interest rates and liquidity in Indian interbank and money markets.

Asset pricing models: evidence from the Indian equity market,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142476181&doi=10.1504%2faajfa.2022.126963&partnerID=40&md5=25d31915aeacaa18ef66556d67a23d82,"The asset pricing model has been a core area of research in finance due to its applicability in corporate finance and security analysis. The present study attempted to evaluate the three popular asset pricing models viz., the capital asset pricing model, the Fama-French three-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model in the Indian equity market for the period of January 2009 to November 2018. The study also examined the role of the size, profitability, value, investment, and market factors in explaining the average equity returns in the Indian equity market. The empirical results reveal the inferior performance of a single market factor in describing the variations in average stock returns in comparison with the Fama-French three-factor model and the Fama-French five-factor model. Further, the size and value factors added to CAPM yield a vital melioration in explaining the variation in average returns of sample stocks.

Does accounting quality predict corporate cash holdings?,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138017102&doi=10.1504%2faajfa.2022.125063&partnerID=40&md5=a551d9688bdfc1bba40ce8f4e749bdab,"This study empirically examines the role of better accounting quality as a substitute for corporate cash holdings. It uses data for Indian firms during 2006–2016 and employs a host of panel models to test the studied relationship amid a set of idiosyncratic controls and robustness tests. It reports that firms with high discretionary accruals hold high levels of cash, implying poor earnings quality leading to cash accumulation. Results are highly consistent for alternative measures of accounting quality and cash holdings, and are robust to controls of cash holdings antecedents and endogeneity issues. Furthermore, analysis of group-affiliated firms reveals that while group affiliates suffer from poor earnings quality compared to non-affiliates, this does not have bearing on their cash holdings. The results imply that managers of Indian firms should focus on maintaining better accounting quality to alleviate the need to accumulate cash as a means of avoiding fundraising constraints when needed. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

This is happening since researchers failed to find answers in the short-term analysis and began looking for answers through long-term analysis. Most previous studies have been done either in big capital markets (US and the UK) or smaller capital markets such as Greece and Malaysia but not Indonesia. The share performance was measured through cumulative market adjusted abnormal return (CMAR) and buy and hold abnormal return (BHAR). The result of this study provides evidence of the presence of negative abnormal returns of the merged and acquiring firms. Moreover, the results show that cash payments are preferable in comparison to the share settlement. The results also reveal that the firms which are owned by families tend to outperform the firms which are not owned by families. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",BHAR; buy and hold abnormal return; CMAR; cumulative market adjusted abnormal return; Indonesia; merger and acquisition; share performance,

As a method of econometrics, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is applied. Financial repression policies, in other words, the central bank’s interventionist monetary policies have been assessed based on the endogenous money view using four indicators: the real interest rate, the legal reserve ratio, the unofficial exchange rate, as well as the bank credit to GDP ratio which can show the financial depth of an economy. The empirical results revealed that a rapid financial liberalisation policy could make the banking system riskier. Although the financial repression policies in the Iranian banking system have generally reduced the liquidity risk, the bank losses have been passed on through hidden taxes to depositors and domestic money holders, which illustrates the need for structural reforms in the Iranian banking system.

The study used a bi-sample structure through a judgmental technique that examined 126 and 96 firm-years between 2001 and 2017, which enabled us to test both pre- and post-bank growth-competition Boone model effects. We found evidence that in both the pre- and post-bank-growth eras, competition significantly increased small business loans consistent with 'competition-stability' hypothesis. A unit increase in the Boone-competition indicator resulted in a 3.8% credit supply. However, when we used concentration ratio (CR6), we found that pre-mega structure competition yields negative effects but that the post-growth effect on credit supply remains positive. Controlled macroeconomic factors yield a very significant effect on credit supply. Thus, policymakers should not ignore the variables in competition-monetary transmission policies in Nigeria. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",bank competition; Boone competition indicator; competition; growth; lending; MegaBank; small business,

It investigates the relationship between corporate disclosures (i.e., transparency), organisational commitment to law, a set of governance mechanisms (namely, board size, CEO decision-making power, and foreign ownership) and corporate performance while controlling for corporate specific characteristics such as size, type, age and leverage. The empirical results show that transparency indices have a puzzling pattern across different performance measures - namely return on assets, asset turnover and organisational growth.

However, there is little empirical evidence of the relationship between owner risk and firm valuation. We investigate the relationship using the unique owner risk index score data of Korean business groups. A high score means low owner risk. We find that there is a positive relationship between owner risk index score and firm valuation for Korean business groups. Specifically, the positive relationship is statistically significant in the professionalism and quality or ethical management without group dummy. The positive relationship is statistically significant in the transparency and accountability or ethical management with group dummy. The results suggest that owner risk is an important governance factor in affecting firm valuation. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",business group; corporate governance; firm valuation; owner risk,

The findings suggest that: 1) the CEO duality shows a significant positive effect on the firm value, while the board independence and board size have an insignificant effect on the firm value; 2) risk disclosure level allows investors to better predict future earnings growth. Furthermore, dividend policy and risk disclosure informativeness are significantly affecting the firm’s ability to raise money and its value in a positive direction.

It examines whether the magnitude and occurrence of earnings deviation post-MASB 26 is significantly lower than pre-MASB 26. Data is based on listed companies on Bursa Malaysia for two years before and after the introduction of MASB 26 in 2002. The t-test shows that the magnitude of earnings deviation pre-MASB 26 is significantly higher as compared to post-MASB 26. Sub-sample analyses also showed that the magnitude of both overstated and understated companies is significantly higher pre-MASB 26. However, Pearson chi-square shows that the occurrence of earnings deviation has increased post-MASB 26 which was contributed to by the increase in occurrence of understated quarterly earnings. This study provides evidence that the use of discrete method might enhance the quality of interim reporting. Whilst, alternative methods of accounting provide different benefits and drawbacks, this study highlighted the need for regulators to consider the objective of financial reporting in formulating the accounting standards.

Using event study, we analyse 137 listed target firms taken from Bloomberg in post-financial crisis era from 2009 to 2019. Our analysis does shows short-term gains on acquisition of Indian firms, with the gains being high in and around the event day. Moreover, the return is positive both for pre- and post-event day windows, though the pre-event day window return is higher as compared to post-event day window. Notably, the return for the shareholders on an acquisition announcement is higher for cash payment, as compared to other payment modes. Further, the wealth effect for acquisitions in the related industry is higher compared to the acquisitions in unrelated industries. We have done multivariate analysis with the cumulative average abnormal return as the dependent variable, and mode of payment and industry relatedness as independent variables. The analysis shows a higher return for acquisitions in the related industry with cash payment. The findings of this research by and large concur with earlier studies, and are useful for foreign investors to appreciate the market behaviour in acquisitions of Indian firms post 2009.

In this regard, the study uses a nonlinear validation method based on an analytical model that adds R&D investment variables to a corporate valuation model. The results indicate that Korean and Japanese firms experience an increase in corporate value when they make R&D expenditures but if the firms exceed their R&D expenditure limits, corporate value falls. In US and Chinese firms, R&D expenditures prompt a dramatic rise in corporate value when such expenditures are initially set to exceed certain limits, although R&D activities reduce corporate value in their early stages.

In this study, 195 tax auditors in Thailand are the samples of the study. Both structural equation modelling and multiple regression analysis are applied to test the research relationships. The results indicate that audit review positively affects audit efficiency and audit effectiveness, but it has no effect on audit quality and audit outcome. Both audit efficiency and audit effectiveness have a positive influence on audit quality and audit outcome, but audit quality does not relate to audit outcome. Also, professional skepticism is a moderator of the audit review-audit efficiency relationships and audit experience has a moderating effect on the audit efficiency-audit outcome relationships and the audit effectiveness-audit outcome relationships. Thus, audit review plays an important role in directly determining both audit efficiency and audit effectiveness and in indirectly explaining audit outcome. Accordingly, auditors should pay attention to studying, understanding and learning characteristics, qualifications and applications of audit review and utilise it as an excellent audit practice to increase audit efficiency, audit effectiveness, and audit outcome.

Family ownership (<=23%) or directors’ interests (<=18.4%) also have a significantly positive relationship with firm performance. High proportion of outside directors on the board and larger boards also impact performance significantly. Family control has a stronger impact on performance in case of younger firms. Also, when family members draw relatively smaller salaries that too affects performance significantly.

The results of this study show that the asset component on the balance sheet has a more positive effect on the increase in corporate value than the profitability and performance variables on the income statement and the cash flow statement. The empirical evidence of this study suggests that asset components should be regarded as major corporate value related variables in the Korean stock market.

There is an evidence of bi-directional causality between 50 Baht and 10 Baht gold futures trading volumes. The 50 Baht and 10 Baht gold futures trading volumes are useful in forecasting gold online futures trading volume. The response of gold futures trading volume to its own shock and 50 Baht gold futures trading volume shock vanishes within 5 days. The variability of gold futures volume is caused not only by its own innovations but also by 50 Baht gold futures trading volume shock. Therefore, it is significant to promote trading activity in 50 Baht gold futures market. Moreover, special care should be taken when there is a negative exogeneous shock to 50 Baht gold futures trading volume due to its contribution to the variability in trading volume of each gold derivatives contract.

Martingale effect of conventional vs. Islamic stock indices: evidence from the UAE,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135028598&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2022.124251&partnerID=40&md5=849f105d8491dae526d6f7d7d27296cf,"This study aims to identify the martingale effect of conventional and Shariah equity markets in the United Arab Emirates. The study employs the runs test for randomness, and the Breusch-Godfrey LM test and the variance ratio test using daily returns for the period January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2017. The empirical results indicate that the UAE's conventional equity market operated efficiently, while the Shariah equity market lacked randomness during the study period. The existence of stock-market efficiency in the conventional stock price index is considered an essential factor for attracting foreign portfolio investment. Nevertheless, the inefficiency of the Shariah market offers opportunities for well-informed investors to achieve abnormal levels of returns. However, having an inefficient Islamic market index points to the need for Shariah boards to make the market more transparent and ensure information flows are instantaneous. The findings of the study have useful implications not only for investors but also for regulators and policy makers in terms of the need to reduce economic distortions through more effective resource allocation. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Breusch-Godfrey LM test; heteroscedasticity; informational efficiency; martingale; UAE; variance ratio test,
Ownership concentration and firm valuation in a typical frontier market,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138063190&doi=10.1504%2faajfa.2022.125058&partnerID=40&md5=3b8bb5fc0d04880b894f64a67f5480fe,"This study investigates the valuation effect of concentrated ownership in a typical frontier market. Using an extensive sample of Vietnamese publicly listed firms, we find that the valuation effect is inconclusive before combined equity holdings reach a certain threshold beyond which market valuation increases exponentially with ownership. The latter log-linear effect can be interpreted as a more profound dominance of the monitoring incentives of large shareholders over the potential expropriation of minority shareholders at higher levels of concentration. Our finding reconciles the seemingly conflicting results of previous studies and contributes to understanding corporate governance practices in frontier markets. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",frontier markets; market valuation; ownership concentration; piecewise linear regression; Vietnam,
How price informativeness affects the sensitivity of investment-to-stock price in Vietnamese listed firms,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128777040&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2022.121767&partnerID=40&md5=ba78c3ad5e241c84c1e7d882e4653dde,"This study investigates the relationship between the stock market and firm investment from a price informativeness perspective. Using an unbalanced panel dataset of Vietnamese listed firms from 2007 to 2017, the results show that stock market valuation is positively related to firm investment in both static and dynamic models. Moreover, the investment of firms with a higher level of price informativeness is likely less sensitive to their stock prices than that of firms with a lower level of price informativeness. In addition, the development of financial markets plays an important role in determining investment and investment-to-stock-price sensitivity. The regression results also show that the role of price informativeness in the investment-to-stock price relationship is not much different among groups of firms with high and low-quality auditors, as well as those with small and large firms.

Furthermore, we attempt to explore the determinant factors on these associations. The financial information of 143 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange for the period of 2012 to 2016 was gathered. In order to assess conditional conservatism Basu's (1997) model has been used, and to evaluate the relationship between conditional asymmetry and cash flow information asymmetry control variables of lifecycle have been added to Basu model. The results indicate that there is no relationship between conditional conservatism and cash flow information asymmetry as well as firm lifecycle variables, which is used to assess unconditional conservatism, and cash flow information asymmetry. Furthermore, we find no allocative factor on the relationship between accounting conservatism and cash flow information asymmetry. This is the first investigation that is dealt with cash flow asymmetry and both types of accounting conservatism separately in emerging economies.

Determinants of corporate governance disclosures of Islamic banks in Sudan: implications for Shariah governance,2022,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131192657&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2022.123054&partnerID=40&md5=dacac7abbe9bdfaa10297a9f106249af,"The paper examines the association between the effectiveness of governance bodies in Islamic banks and corporate governance disclosure (CGD) in a sample of Sudanese banks. We analysed the content of annual reports and employed ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model with pooled effects. Consistent with previous studies in Islamic banks, the findings of this paper revealed low levels of CGD in Islamic banks of Sudan, which is only 39%, on average. The findings showed that Islamic banks with SSB members who hold advanced qualifications provided more information on CGD than their counterparts. However, we found that banks with SSB members who sit on more than one board tend to have lower CGD. In addition, we found that Islamic banks that have an established audit committee (AC), internal audit function (IAF) and low levels of governmental ownership have higher CGD levels. These results are robust to alternative empirical models. Our study adds to the ongoing debate of Shariah governance in Islamic banks. In particular, while we support that IAF may play a significant role in Shariah governance as recommended by the regulators of Islamic banking industry, our evidence shows that SSB multiple directorships, ceteris paribus, are not advantageous for Islamic banks. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Fixed effect model is used to examine study hypotheses. The findings indicate that information asymmetry positively affected earnings management. Moreover, the results revealed that audit quality negatively affected the relationship between information asymmetry and earnings management, meaning that audit quality can reduce the level of information asymmetry and mitigate earnings management. This study will contribute to corporate governance and auditing literature among Jordanian firms by providing beneficial information for regulators, investors and other stakeholders about how audit quality can restrict information asymmetry and reduce earnings management.

It has been hypothesised that higher the rank, faster could be the recovery of a bank based on multiple trigger values of these banks for three to four years from the date of revised PCA framework.

On the other side, bank efficiency was significantly predicted by liquidity risk, credit risk and funding risk. The robustness of results was also confirmed in the presence of the macroeconomic environment. Overall, this research provides a new insight into bank profitability and efficiency literature.

Using pooled mean group estimation on data drawn from five countries, the study did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that foreign investors exhibit home bias in the long run when they adjust their investment in line with past flows. Return chasing is not seen as the first order of business and is prioritised only in the long run, after foreign investors have gained knowledge of the market. Results show that foreign investors value countries with stable economies and invest more in the sampled markets with higher returns from industrialised markets. Policy makers should intensify efforts to make these markets more attractive for foreign investors, maintain good economic conditions and monitor developments in industrialised markets. This will assist them in reacting to variations or reversals in portfolio flows resulting from occurrences in such markets.

Further, the paper attempts to uncover the factors that explain value-based returns. In this paper, we inspected alternative sources of value effect recommended by the literature. The empirical results suggest that majority of the value premium is explained by the firm's size, value, liquidity, information asymmetry and institutional ownership factors. The study, therefore, confirms that rational sources explain the value effect in the Indian stock market. The study has important implications for market efficiency, regulators, retail investors and portfolio managers.

First, despite their positive impacts on dividend payout, family firms exhibit a lower dividend payout relative to net income. Second, growth opportunities increase the positive impacts of family ownership on dividend payout. A positive association between growth opportunities and dividend payout is also found. Third, the moderating effect of growth opportunities on the relationship between family ownership and dividend payout is present only in firms with family shareholdings, particularly those with high and medium ownership. These findings indicate varying dividend payout in the presence of growth opportunities for the different levels of family ownership.

Derivative financial assets were found to have a positive effect on earnings quality and a negative effect on sensitivity to market risk. On the other hand, derivative financial liabilities were found to have a negative effect on earnings quality and a positive effect on sensitivity to market risk. The study concluded that derivative financial assets tend to improve the performance of commercial banks in Nigeria and reduce their financial risk exposures than derivative financial liabilities.

The study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard error regression to estimate the model parameters. The results show that politically connected directors have significant positive influence on real earnings manipulations. We also establish that the interaction of politically connected directors with the board weakened the board monitoring power, and thus led to breach of corporate governance. The results also indicate that foreign CEOs and CEOs with financial expertise decrease the propensity of real earnings manipulations in Nigeria.

Financial restructuring of firms under weak bankruptcy laws - An Indian experience,2021,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116001474&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2021.117723&partnerID=40&md5=65475391d3121c979c89e89bbc173802,"This paper empirically investigates behaviour of firms with respect to capital utilisation under a weak insolvency and bankruptcy law using Indian corporate data over a period of 2000-2014. It suggests that firms resorted to higher borrowings after being subjected to restructuring under the corporate debt restructuring mechanism - an informal arrangement supported by the Reserve Bank of India. While firms managed to obtain more debt from lenders thereby signalling the possibility of recovery, we do not find any improvement in firm profitability post financial restructuring. This indicates that lenders in countries with weak insolvency regime postpone the day of reckoning. The empirical evidence corroborates the theory of agency cost of debt and the signalling hypothesis in the change in capital structure of firms.

Adjusting the consumption-based capital asset pricing model by the estimate bid-ask spreads based on daily highest and lowest prices in Iran,2021,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121143775&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2021.119481&partnerID=40&md5=da753cc32715aa0042864e63d7eff564,"This study aims to investigate a capital asset pricing model (CAPM) based on consumption within the capital market in Iran, which is adjusted using transaction costs and liquidity risk. The study is carried out on twenty portfolios, formed on the basis of liquidity criteria using seasonal data from 2009 to 2018. In other words, this approach is applied to analyse the target pricing model through transaction costs proxy and evaluation of the portfolios. Exploiting the proposed bid-ask spread estimator as the transaction costs proxy shows that liquidity-adjusted CCAPM explains a bigger portion of cross-sectional return changes compared to the traditional CCAPM model. In addition, the results show that disregarding transaction costs and liquidity risk may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the expected return.

It exposes these companies to several financial and economic hazards. This paper employs cross-country tax rates and economic freedom regressions for a sample of 82 countries to examine the determinants of investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) between 2010 and 2016. Besides, it analysis the role of economic freedom factors (legal system, sound money system, regulations, and trade freedom) and economic factors [gross domestic product (GDP) growth, trade level, inflation, and GDP per capita]. While the results of the study agree these factors are important to investments, FDI reflects a higher sensitivity to these factors. A sound money system and trade freedom have a high influence on FDI. The results also show that companies are eager to expand their investments wherever they find welcoming markets, financially and economically. This can benefit policymakers in home or host countries to increase investments and FDI.

This study investigates the impact of financial literacy on investment decision-making behaviour by taking mediating role of financial risk tolerance. The study employed quantitative research design and multi-stage random and convenience sampling. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 384 registered individual investors of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the relationships between the constructs. Results showed positive and significant impact of financial literacy on investment decision-making behaviour and financial risk tolerance among individual equity investors. Similarly, financial risk tolerance mediated the relationship between financial literacy and investment decision-making behaviour. The study suggests measures to policy makers for improving financial literacy among individual investors. It also proposes significant functional insights for stockbrokers, investment advisors, and financial managers through examining the investment decision-making behaviour of individual equity investors. This study serves as a guideline for academia to further develop/improve the financial literacy of future investors.

Evidence in this paper supports positive (negative) influence of foreign currency earnings (foreign capital), on earnings management. Results remain robust even when different measures of managed earnings, foreign earnings, and foreign capital are adopted, and also when controlled for firm level factors such as size, level of operations, and industry affiliation.

Despite the presence of inconsistent empirical evidence on idiosyncratic volatility, the current study aims to investigate the presence of idiosyncratic volatility from a frontier market such as Sri Lanka. Employing the Fama and French five-factor model together with the exponential generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH), the conditional idiosyncratic volatility of individual stocks of non-financial firms listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) was estimated. This study reveals the presence of idiosyncratic volatility of stocks in Sri Lanka. The results further indicate though the idiosyncratic volatility of stocks is useful in explaining the average stock returns, it is still questionable as to why there is a demand in the market for small stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility since the critical weaknesses in asset pricing models are mostly coupled with the small stocks.

Determinants of intellectual capital performance in banks: Empirical insights from an emerging market,2021,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116038063&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2021.117740&partnerID=40&md5=51103a8e2660d2dacac37f38d6ae43d3,"This study examines the determinants of intellectual capital performance (ICP) of banks in an emerging market. The value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC™) model is used to measure ICP and data envelopment analysis has been used to measure technical efficiency. We employ an unbalanced panel data of 32 banks over the period 2000-2017. The study found that income diversification, asset tangibility, human capital investment, cost efficiency, operational risk, leverage and bank stability are the main determinants of ICP. Diversification strategy interacts with other variables in informing ICP. Generally, to improve ICP, a focused strategy is favoured over a diversified strategy. However, to enhance value creation, some contextual peculiarities can be explored as guides to make strategic choices. The results and the implications are relevant for bank practitioners, financial analysts and management accountants in emerging economies. It is also relevant for the newly formed Financial Stability Council of Ghana, sector regulators, policymakers, educators and the research community.

By using a sample of highly traded commodity future contracts of the Indian commodity market from 2006 to 2016, this study confirms the exceptionally high abnormal profitability of the double-sort strategy. The abnormal returns of the double-sort portfolios are robust to transaction costs incurred for designing these active strategies. The application of a conditional multi-factor model and sub-sample analysis suggests that the return profile of these strategies is basically time-varying. Moreover, the low and insignificant correlation of double-sort portfolios with stocks and bonds confirms that relative strength portfolios of commodity futures can be effectively used to create a well-diversified portfolio.

We find strong evidence for market-timing ability, which increases with country openness, global emerging-market portfolio returns, economic growth and, to a smaller extent, derivative market size; and decreases with technological advancement. We also find no evidence for security selection ability. Our results suggest that market timing ability depends on market conditions and it may be important to control for such conditions in studies that seek to determine managerial performance.

This study has followed methodology similar to that of Kaul et al. (2000). The event methodology is used along with cross sectional regressions associating abnormal returns and demand shift. Overall, the empirical evidence in this study supports the downward sloping demand curves for the stocks.

Secondly, in order to quantify the long-run impact of dividend policy, panel data derived from 108 listed companies (809 observations) is analysed by using fixed effect model (FEM) and random effect model (REM). Our results show that the effect of dividend announcement on the stock price is positive around the announcement date. For the long-term impact, the results indicate a significantly negative relationship between payout ratio (PAYOUT), dividend per share (DPS) and stock price volatility, and a positive relationship between dividend yield (DY) and stock price volatility of the companies.

Investigation is done by building a panel model, showing the relationship between capital market and fiscal budget deficit. Estimation results reveal that the deficit significantly influenced the markets by exerting positive impact on market capitalisation and stocks traded, with the impact on stocks traded superseding that of market capitalisation. The impact of deficit is complemented by return on investment, exchange rate, financial openness, and money supply. The major implication of these findings is the high vulnerability of these markets to switch in fiscal policy from deficit budgeting to surplus budgeting, which may lead to decline in market activities. In view of this, attention needs to be focused on enhancing the role of financial openness and return on investment, which are also strong drivers of capital market development.

The findings show that earnings management is positively related to LLP regardless of the restructuring period, suggesting that LLPs can be used by Vietnamese banks as a mechanism for aggressive earnings management. There appears to be no capital management before the restructuring period. However, the findings indicate that Vietnamese banks use capital management with LLP during the restructuring period. Furthermore, the positive relation between LLP and future earnings during the restructuring period suggests that investors may view an abnormal increase in LLP as a signal of loan quality. The findings further demonstrate that LLP is positively associated with bank inefficiency, credit growth, bank size, and lending specialisation. State-owned commercial banks are found to reserve a greater level of provisions compared to privately owned commercial banks. Based on the research findings, we offer several implications for relevant stakeholders.

Empirical evidence arising from the study indicates that bank development exhibits interest rate sensitivity and changes in inverse direction with the interest rate. Moreover, the results strongly support asymmetry and nonlinearity in the relationship between bank development and stock market development. It is therefore recommended that policy efforts directed towards the development of the financial system should strike a balance between the linear/symmetric assumption and the nonlinear/asymmetric assumption.

Panel data from 13 selected Sub-Saharan African countries from 1996 to 2017 was used to help analyse the relationship through an econometric model in which gross domestic product per capita was the dependent variable while the six dimensions of governance were used as proxies for corporate governance. Foreign direct investment and trade were used as control variables. Accordingly, the results of the regression model show a significant good fit for the data with control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and voice and accountability being positive and significant except government effectiveness and regulatory quality that were insignificant.

It uses data on all companies listed and traded in the ASE, over the period of 2002 to 2018. The study uses the time-series regression approach of Black et al. (1972). To estimate the models, the study applies the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The study found that the models fail to capture the cross-section of average returns to portfolios sorted on size/book-to-market as well as size/momentum. The ability of the Carhart model in describing the returns to size/book-to-market portfolios is similar to that of the Fama-French model; however, the model better describes the returns to size/momentum portfolios. Unlike Al-Mwalla's (2012) conclusion, this study suggests using the Carhart model in practical applications that require the estimation of the ASE equity market returns.

This paper investigates the effect of sentiment on the returns of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), the main stock exchange in Bangladesh. The study uses indirect measures of stock market sentiment. Results show that sentiment impacts contemporaneous returns, followed by some corrections in the next month. Contrary to general belief, large firms are more vulnerable to market sentiment. There is a unidirectional (Granger) causality from market turnover to portfolio returns, and a strong bi-directional causal relationship between moving average changes and stock returns. When conditional volatility is considered, a significant impact of sentiment is observed, mainly on small-size portfolios. In the presence of other market-wide risk factors, sentiment factors reasonably explain individual stock returns. Overall, the study concludes that sentiment should be considered as a source of systematic risk for the firms listed in the DSE.

An attempt has been made to establish long-run relationship between the closing price of ETFs and closing index values using ARDL model. The study also analyses the research question in the presence of single and multiple structural breaks. Empirical results of the study show that the absolute pricing deviation is relatively small in the case of ETFs. Most of the ETFs have long-run relationship with the underlying index. The study confirms structural breaks in the ETF closing price time series. With the introduction of structural breaks, increase in the size of statistically significant long-run coefficients indicates an improvement in the speed of correction to the equilibrium level.

The interactions between these mechanisms tend to define which type of debt is the more effective discipline mechanism. Thus, this study aims to define the impacts of interactions between intensive board monitoring and ownership structures on debt maturity for all non-financial firms listed on the Saudi market from 2008 to 2013. The results reveal that board monitoring intensity encourages Saudi listed firms to apply more long-term debt. Both direct ownership by large shareholders and family-held firms as controlling shareholders strengthen the monitoring functions of the board and encourage Saudi listed firms to apply more long-term debt.

International financial reporting standards adoption and accounting quality: Evidence from Ghanaian listed firms,2021,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115993218&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2021.117724&partnerID=40&md5=cb9ec19aba403619a49d335964a293fe,"The adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by Ghanaian listed firms form the basis of higher accounting quality and reliability of accounting information from IFRS application. Existing literature suggests that the adoption affects the level of accounting quality. The aim of this paper is to examine whether the shift to IFRS minimises weaknesses in Ghana National Accounting Standards (GNAS) in measuring accounting quality. The paper employs research design metrics of discretional accruals, accrual quality, earnings smoothness, small loss avoidance and price-earnings to compute accounting quality of Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) firms. The results suggest that accounting quality has improved after the shift to IFRS. This research fills the gap in Ghana level, given that there was no such study. Also, this study gives evidence of improvement in the information environment of GSE capital market after the shift in terms of information quality and accounting comparability.

Tax incentives and industrial productivity: Evidence from Nigeria,2021,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099496565&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2021.111816&partnerID=40&md5=4a903d163ea52ddb59cb1afedbde0ad7,"This study investigates the relationship between tax incentives and industrial productivity in a protected industry. Based on available empirical literature, the nexus between tax incentives and direct investment, on one hand, and tax incentives and production volumes, has been largely established. However, the nexus between tax and within-sector productivity in a pioneer industry may vary across countries. Using data from Nigeria, the study examines the relative importance of tax amongst other industrial incentives in driving productivity within the cement industry. The findings show that while tax incentives may have improved production growth, it is not a significant driver of short-run productivity growth. Conversely, other non-tax incentives such as financing subsidies appear to have more impact on productivity. These findings provide new insight into the nexus between industrial policy incentives and productivity, and suggest that tax incentives may not be sufficient to drive the country's industrial agenda.

The study employs auto regressive distributed lag model, structural vector auto regression model, variance decomposition and impulse response function to examine the same. The ARDL model revealed the presence of cointegrating relationship between the macroeconomic variables of Asian economies and the global crude oil price. The impulse response function and variance decomposition analysis indicates the oil price fluctuations not having a significant impact on the given macroeconomic variables of the Asian economies taken under study. The study suggests that the Asian economies should implement policies to attract more FDI and promote the foreign sector. The governments should be more watchful while regulating the price level that may arise with a surge in oil price.

However, the nonlinear threshold relationship between the infrastructural development and FDI inflow is yet to be explored. The objective of this research is to find the threshold effect of infrastructure on FDI in Nigeria. Using Hansen's (2000) threshold regression over the period 1972-2015, the study found that the relationship between infrastructure development and FDI is nonlinear. Furthermore, the relationship between infrastructure and FDI is positive in both regimes; however, the marginal positive impact of infrastructural development in attracting FDI is more evident after the threshold level. The findings provide support to the regulators and policy makers to improve infrastructural development for attracting more FDI in the economy which can foster economic growth.

The study provides empirical evidence which shows that risk governance variables (enterprise risk management index, chief risk officer presence, board risk committee size, board risk committee activism, and board risk committee independence) have a positive and significant impact on firm value. Similarly, firm attribute variables (firm size and firm age) have a significant positive impact on firm value while on the contrary corporate governance variables (board size and board of directors independence) show a negative but a significant impact on firm value. The empirical evidence observed in this study reveals that the institutionalisation of risk culture, strong risk oversight functions and increase in risk accountability by the board have greater tendency to enhance the value of a firm. This study contributes to the growing literature in the area of corporate reporting, risk governance and risk management research in Africa.

A 2 × 2 factorial experimental design was conducted on a sample of 104 internal auditors from Egyptian commercial banks. The results reveal that internal auditors with an analytic cognitive style assessed a significantly higher fraud risk compared to internal auditors with an intuitive cognitive style. On the other hand, internal auditors with an analytic cognitive style assessed an insignificantly higher control risk compared to internal auditors with an intuitive cognitive style. Additionally, internal auditors who were involved in ITG assessed significantly higher fraud and control risks than non-ITG-involved internal auditors. Finally, analytic internal auditors who were involved in ITG assessed significantly higher fraud and control risks compared to intuitive internal auditors who were not involved in ITG. The overall results support the notion that internal auditors need to possess certain behavioural skills and technical skills to be able to engage in more strategic roles and, in turn, add value to their organisations.

The results of the feasible generalised least squares (FGLS) model indicate that, on the one hand, inflation, corruption and the stock market capitalisation and turnover ratios have a positive and significant impact on SMV. On the other hand, economic growth, financial freedom and stock market returns seem to have a negative and significant effect on SMV.

Even when controlling for firm size and leverage, it is found that the ratio of shares owned by the block holder shows negative and significant results (for both the logit and the tobit regression). This study proves that either the block holders are part of the management or they have strong board representation, so they do not consider dividend payouts as a disciplining and monitoring mechanism.

The model was developed based on a complementary hypothesis and employs a panel dataset comprising 440 firm-year observations. We found that a larger audit committee comprising directors and shareholders is more likely to reduce earnings manipulation in the form of artificial smoothing and managers’ discretion on earnings. The study also establishes that larger audit committee size is linked to an increase in audit price. Interestingly, we found that an increase in the price of auditing services minimises the likelihood of earnings manipulation. Also the audit price partially and significantly mediates the link between the audit committee and financial reporting quality. This study also informs regulators and policy makers of the importance of audit price in limiting earnings manipulation and boosting audit quality, which, in turn, enhances financial reporting quality.

The study used discretionary accruals (DA) as a proxy for EM and measured DA using balance-sheet approach and cash flow approach. DA was estimated using four models namely, Healy model, DeAngelo model, Jones model and Modified Jones model. The sample consists of companies included in the S&P BSE 500 index after excluding banks and financial institutions. The sample period is from 2007 to 2017 and the data is analysed using panel regression. The findings indicate that the relationship is significant and positive in the current year under the balance sheet approach. However, the relationship is significant and negative for the next year's performance under the cash flow approach. It indicates that earnings through accruals positively influence the firm performance in the current year. However, when the accruals reverse in the next year and cash flows reduce, there is negative influence on the firm performance.

This expectation stems from the perceived attractiveness of having enough available retained earnings to fund any potential future growth opportunities. However, research performed in various markets at the turn of the century has challenged this belief. This paper seeks to update this theory by investigating the relationship in a more current dataset, from 1988 to 2014. Furthermore, given the investment opportunities within emerging markets, the dataset pertains to South African listed companies. Assessing two different earning measures, over multiple years, a multivariate regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between dividend payout and future earnings. Dividend payout decisions are seen by investors as a predictor for future value growth and, as such, management should be aware of their associated dividend distribution decisions. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Financial flexibility and the debt maturity structure are important for a firm's survivability. During a crisis, highly leveraged firms cannot survive due to the inability to pay back and roll over their debt for longer maturity. Financial flexibility could contribute better capital structure decisions and reduce risk. This paper investigates financial flexibility and the impact on the debt maturity structure in Malaysian and Australian firms. The results suggested that Malaysian firms follow a pecking order theory, whereas Australian firms follow the trade-off theory. Financial flexibility firms are generally less leveraged. These firms were found to have less long-term debt in both countries. They prefer short-term debt since they are able to access financing resources at lower cost. Non-financial flexibility firms prefer long-term debt because of the reduced capability of repayment and the high rollover risk if they hold short-term debt.

We use panel data for a sample of 40 Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the stock exchange over the 2007 to 2016 period. Our results indicate that investment is sensitive to cash-flow but this investment cash-flow sensitivity is reduced when firms exhibit better governance quality. These findings suggest that improvement of corporate governance can solve agency problems and reduce financial constraints. We conclude that better governance leads to more efficient investment allocation in Tunisia.

This study also finds that board size and board composition do not have any significant relationship with voluntary disclosure. This study has implications for future researchers, regulators, and investors. Future researchers may find it interesting to examine board behaviour in order to understand the complexities of board operations as it affects their monitoring role. There is no evidence that the introduction of Corporate Governance Code by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission has led to improvement in the voluntary disclosure made by listed companies. There is therefore the need for regulators to improve their enforcement and compliance mechanism at ensuring that listed companies comply with the disclosure requirements. It may also be appropriate that certain disclosures be made mandatory, since the management may not have the incentives to make such disclosures.

This nonlinearity could be the cause of the inconsistency in the extant findings on the impact of debt maturity on firm performance. Our research provides evidence supporting a nonlinear relationship between debt maturity structure and firm performance. The results further show that financially constrained firms are more susceptible to liquidity risk when constrained firms are heavily financed by short-term debt, while when these firms employ much long-term debt the agency cost of debt becomes more worrisome. Therefore, compared to unconstrained peers, financially constrained firms are more likely to benefit from the use of long-term debt at short debt maturity structure, but are more prone to be suffering from long-term debt use when the latter firms are already at long debt maturity structure.

Factors that drive dividend payout decisions: An investigation in the context of Bangladesh,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088030745&doi=10.1504%2faajfa.2020.10029358&partnerID=40&md5=a4f6ccdcfb47410067f125192b4e84ff,"Generally, dividend policies guide the financial rewards of the shareholders. It is often a challenging decision for companies to determine the appropriate level of dividend for the shareholders. While some past studies argue that microeconomic factors drive the decision of dividend policies, many other researchers claim that it is the macroeconomic factors of a country which ultimately influence the dividend payouts. However, there is a paucity of research in this area for emerging countries like Bangladesh. This study thus examines impacts of a set of pre-determined microeconomic and macroeconomic factors upon cash dividend payouts by analysing a sample of listed firms of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), Bangladesh. Findings are analysed based on liquidity, leverage, growth, and size of the sample firms for microeconomic factors; while, macroeconomic factors are analysed upon dividends on an average basis. The results provide policy implications for shareholders, management, policymakers and the government of Bangladesh.

Impact of monetary policy announcements on bank index in India,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077888665&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.104414&partnerID=40&md5=810df4286705615ad98f83f690bf9b3d,Understanding the impact of monetary policy announcements on systemic risk and abnormal returns (ARs) of banking sector indexes is important to assess the changes in the cost of equity capital and arrive at a fair rate of return of bank stocks. Empirical studies of this nature from the Indian context are scarce. The present study analyses the impact of monetary policy announcements on systemic risk and abnormal returns of bank index in India. Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) along with Kalman filter was used to estimate the daily systemic risk (beta) and abnormal returns. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and event study methodology were used to assess the impact of monetary policy announcements on systemic risk and abnormal returns.

The herding behaviour on Pakistan stock exchange - Using firm-level data,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077875591&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.104407&partnerID=40&md5=08197115ac402a45ca77048de27fae60,"This paper analyses herding behaviour in the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX, formerly known as Karachi stock exchange, KSE) for a sample of 663 firms over a period of 13 years, from 2004 to 2017. For detecting herding behaviour, two dependent variables are used, i.e., cross-sectional standard deviation (CSSD) of Christie and Huang (1995) and cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD) of Chang et al. (2000). The results show no herding behaviour on the basis of both methods at different levels of market movements. The absence of the herding behaviour may be because these firms belong to different sectors which may follow their respective industry portfolios but not the overall market; for example, Shah et al. (2017) documented that firms in several industries herd toward their industry portfolios for Pakistani data. Future research can be done using a primary data collection method from investors about their opinion on herding behaviour.

Decomposition of the dividend forecast model: Firm characteristics or market discrimination? Evidence from the Korean market,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083003835&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.106265&partnerID=40&md5=9c6a5aaa244126eb917c2cb8c093d04f,"Historically, KOSPI firms have shown consistently higher chances of dividend payment compared to KOSDAQ firms. The counterfactual decomposition technique popularised by Oaxaca and Blinder is adapted to explain the dividend differentials between the two markets. Our results suggest that there exists market discrimination that cannot be explained by the traditional dividend forecast model of Fama and French (2001). After controlling for the group differences in firm characteristics such as size and profitability, KOSPI firms still have a higher probability of paying dividends, and, especially during the crisis period, they deal with risks better and are less affected by macroeconomic shocks. We observe the level difference after controlling for firm characteristics as well as the difference in the sensitivity of dividends with respect to the dividend predictors between two markets. For the crisis period, the explanatory power of firm characteristics drops, and the market effect plays a dominant role in explaining dividend behaviours.

An empirical examination of correlation dynamics between commodity and equity derivative indices: Evidence from India using DCC-GARCH models,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083013497&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.106259&partnerID=40&md5=8c3fa1bbbe94d6f8b2a513503e82eb7b,"This empirical study investigates the time-varying co-movements and volatility linkages between equity-commodity indices and inter-commodity indices. This paper deploys DCC-GARCH framework. Three versions of GARCH namely standard, threshold and exponential with both symmetric and asymmetric versions of dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) have been used. This study considers equity index Nifty 50, non-agricultural commodity indices MCX Energy and MCX Metal along with agricultural commodity indices Dhaanya and MCX Agri. Our results revealed that the combined portfolio of commodities-equity has low or negative correlations, which provide better diversification property rather than a portfolio without commodities. However, we notice a steep decline in time-varying correlations of equity with non-agricultural commodity portfolio since 2013. The mixed portfolio of the agricultural commodity with non-agricultural commodity can also offer diversifying benefits. We found high volatility shifts in time-varying co-movements of Nifty 50-MCX Agri pair. On the other hand, we observed an increasing trend in the co-movements of Nifty 50-Dhaanya, it indicates the interdependency of these two markets. Non-agricultural commodity pair (MCX Energy-MCX Metal) and agricultural commodity pair (MCX Agri-Dhaanya) fail to offer better-diversifying properties. This study provides an essential insight to policymakers, portfolio managers, domestic and international investors, risk analysts and financial researchers in an emerging market.

Operating performance and earnings management in Egypt,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094576790&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.110512&partnerID=40&md5=90c7a6e4736218de08136a868a640a8c,"This research contributes to the literature addressing the phenomenon of earnings management in global markets. The research setting is Egypt, and due to data limitations in this setting, this research examines earnings management based on firm operating performance. In particular, the question of whether ineffectively performing firms engage more in earnings management strategies compared to their effectively performing counterparts is investigated. Sign change ratio analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis were employed to determine the extent to which the strength of the relationship between earnings and cash flows differs between ineffectively and effectively performing firms. The results show that considered against effectively performing firms, ineffectively performing firms in the emerging market of Egypt are associated with a greater level of earnings management. Overall, this finding suggests that for listed Egyptian firms, company operating performance is a significant incentive of earnings management. Furthermore, this finding encourages the argument in favour of Egyptian corporate governance reform. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Economic growth, the share of public investment in infrastructure and the share of public investment in education also have a positive impact on return on total assets by industry. However, total state sector investment has the negative effect on the return on total assets by industry. In addition, when observing after tax profit by industry, there appears that the share of total investment in GDP is positively affected by the share of manufacturing industry in GDP and labour productivity by industry.

Should Indonesia adopt a basket currency regime?,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094627678&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2020.110490&partnerID=40&md5=2b3ab7fa2699768e2bcb448b6a1c7ca2,"Exchange rate regime is a system in which a country manages its currency about other currencies and the foreign exchange market. Currently, there are two major types of exchange rate regimes, i.e., free-float system and pegged system. Many countries, including Indonesia, adopted the free-float system since it is believed as the best regime for absorbing external economic shocks. However, some economists argued that a moderate exchange rate regime, such as currency basket system, is a better approach for achieving the government's goals. The research aims to provide an arrangement for optimal basket weights of Indonesian currency basket to minimise GDP volatility as well as exchange rate volatility. We develop an optimisation model in the extension of Yoshino et al. (2017) by adding five currencies in the basket. We found that the weight currencies in the free-float regime would reflect the trade intensities of the respective countries. Further, the government should monitor the change of exchange rates of currencies in the foreign reserves and change the weight accordingly. In addition, we also found that, whether the government implementing basket currency regime or free-float regime, it will make no significant differential effect on GDP gap volatility. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Previous studies for sample periods prior to 2013 find that foreigners invested relatively more in low liquidity shares. In contrast, this paper shows that foreigners now invest relatively more in high liquidity stocks. This study also investigates the investment determinants of foreign blockholders who own at least 5% of shares outstanding separately from those of the other foreign investors. The results show that foreign blockholders are more available to assume certain types of risk than the other foreign investors. Further, the investment preferences are similar between foreign blockholders and local blockholders. The results of the paper suggest that the availability of investors to assume risk, which is dependent on their wealth levels, is a possible explanation of equity home bias.

The stability of money demand in India in the post reform period: An empirical analysis,2020,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088018897&doi=10.1504%2faajfa.2020.10029357&partnerID=40&md5=4538f6c621453c4714abe3c48958bd8a,"This paper provides an empirical analysis of the stability of demand for money in India using ARDL cointegration framework. The study of stability of money demand plays an important role in deciding the appropriate instruments of monetary policy. The present study examines the demand for money by using annual data over the period 1991-2015. The ARDL model bound test procedure has confirmed that a stable, long relationship exists between M1 and its determinants such as income, interest rates, exchange rates and inflation. Through results we conclude that income elasticity coefficient is positive and significant while the coefficient of inflation and interest rate is negative. Based on the Bahmoni-Oskooee and Pourhedrian (1990) argument, exchange rates negatively affect the demand for money. This study also examines the cointegration in the presence of structural break by using Gregory-Hansen single structural break approach. The study does not find any cointegration in presence of single structural break. Our result also reveals that M1 is stable between the sample period when we incorporated the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests.

Additionally, the study aims to deepen our understanding of the main behavioural driver of corporate financial performances in Indonesia, one of the fast developing countries within South East Asia. Data from 227 public companies listed in Indonesian stock exchange (IDX) are extracted from their 2015 annual reports and corporate websites. Tobin's Q is employed as the dependent variable, along with R&D investment and WDB as main testing variables. Using regression, the study finds that firms' with higher number of women directors on board and more focus on their R&D investment activities, will be able to generate higher financial performance than those firms with lower gender diversity and R&D investments. This paper contributes to literature on R&D investment in Indonesia, which is still limited, to the best of the authors' knowledge. The reported findings also uncover the main important finding of leveraging effect of number of WDB to the relationship between R&D investment and firms' financial performance in Indonesia. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

The sample included 59 banks from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates during the period of 2012-2016. To achieve this goal, the study measures earnings conservatism using market-to-book approach. By using panel fixed-effect regression, our analysis reveals that bigger audit committees with more independence and members with financial experience are more likely to be associated with earnings conservatism in GCC banks. We also find that the audit committee diligence has no impact on earnings conservatism.

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of trading characteristics (price, trading volume, variability, return volatility, absolute stock return, and Beedles thin trading measure) on liquidity measures (Amihud illiquidity ratio, return reversal measure, stock turnover, zero return, turnover-volatility ratio and proportional bid-ask spread) in Tehran Stock Exchange. We extend previous studies by combining different liquidity measures using TOPSIS technique and by employing a multidimensional variable, namely TOPSIS output. Results reveal both of the liquidity measures are strongly related to trading characteristics including stock turnover and zero return. Also, stock price, trading volume, and Beedles thin trading measures are the most significant factors in estimating liquidity. Different effects of different liquidity measures indicate that liquidity is a multidimensional and complex concept, and each measure reflects only one aspect of liquidity. The results of examining the influence of trading characteristics on the combined (multidimensional) liquidity measure indicate that trading characteristics are the main determinants of liquidity.

Using Malaysian listed companies and a sample span from 1998 to 2014, this study found that, for the hazard model, all variables were significant while for the logit model only five variables were significant. The results also show that the logistic and hazard models both had predictive accuracies of more than 90%. However, the hazard model had a predictive accuracy of 99.4% while logit model had a predictive accuracy of 91.8%. The hazard model was more stable than logit model as the predictive accuracy of the hazard only changed a little when a smaller sample was chosen. Lastly, the study showed that, even though both models were good in predicting distress, the hazard model is better than logit model. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

This paper examines the impact of RR-LFR on financing behaviour in a dual banking system (Islamic and conventional banks) using generalised method of moment estimation (GMM) technique to address the endogeneity of explanatory variables and reduce the possible biases from residual correlation. Using bank-level data for both Islamic and conventional banks covering the period 2001 2015, we analyse the reaction of bank financing behaviour toward RR-LFR policy. The findings indicate that RR-LFR is effective in curtailing financing behaviour of banking institutions. Further, we show that RR-LFR exerts more impacts on managing credit expansion of conventional banks than of Islamic banks. The study suggests that a specific macroprudential framework should be put in place to address systemic concerns for each type of banks. Hence, the supervisory authorities will be able to identify the channel of macroprudential transmission and to devise an optimum policy mix for their banking system. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Generally, this gap between financial and taxable income suggests that firms are taking advantage of book-tax differences for avoiding tax payments. However, such tax manipulations can often affect firms' financial performances. This study therefore aims to analyse the empirical relationships between book-tax differences and tax manipulations, and their overall impact upon firms' financial performances. A sample of 111 companies listed on Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is analysed to conduct this study using linear panel regressions. Findings indicate that firms disclose different tax information for taxation authorities compared to stakeholders in order to manage earnings and avoid taxes in Bangladesh. Moreover, firms use tax shelters to escape from tax payments and report a good financial picture, thereby confirming that tax manipulations influence firms' financial performances.

Examining bank-specific determinants of the dividend payout ratio of Sub-Saharan Africa banks: The panel GMM approach,2019,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058821581&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2019.096912&partnerID=40&md5=c6d5e586168e47d04da014e9f800f182,"Dividend payout policy of banks has been the commonest dividend policy in commercial banks world-wide owing to the assumption that it will minimise agency costs in the banks. Hence, this study adopts the dynamic panel two-step system and differenced GMM in analysing the data of 250 commercial banks from 30 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for the period 2006 to 2015 to examine the determinants of the dividend payout ratio of these banks. The empirical results reveal that past year dividend is the most significant determinant of current year dividend. Taxation and capital adequacy ratio, which are the legal and regulatory factors considered, are found to be insignificant. Our findings reveal earnings-after-tax and leverage as being significant determinants of payout ratio in SSA banks. Hence, Lintner's model holds in SSA banks as a region and it is, therefore, recommended that it must be strictly followed in setting the dividend process of commercial banks in SSA.

The determinants of capital structure: The Levant versus Gulf Cooperation Council firms,2019,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065556948&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2019.099486&partnerID=40&md5=493385159e717a72ca2c1b09d255c169,"The paper investigates how firms operating in the Levant economies (Jordan) and the Gulf Cooperation Council economies (Bahrain) determine their capital structure. Using unbalanced panel data and multiple regressions, the paper finds that the leverage ratio is positively affected by the size of the firm, but declines with an increase in the firm’s profitability, the tangibility of assets and the firm’s liquidity in both types of economy. The leverage ratio is also affected by the market conditions in which the firm operates. The degree and effectiveness of these determinants are dependent on the country’s legal and financial traditions. Overall, the capital structure of a firm is heavily influenced by the economic environment and its institutions, corporate governance practices, tax systems, the borrower-lender relation, exposure to capital markets and level of investor protection in the country in which the firm operates. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Capital structure; Emerging markets; Gulf cooperation council economies; Levant economies; Middle east countries,
The quantile dependence between global crude oil price and stock markets in emerging Asia: Evidence from major oil consuming nations,2019,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069760223&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2019.100980&partnerID=40&md5=1ffcfdfb1acf1660ae1bb9e47fe88490,"The paper examines the dependence between global crude oil price and stock indices in economies of fast emerging Asian nations, which are also termed to be major oil consumers. The paper employs quantile regression method (QRM) to analyse the relationship by using monthly data from April 2004 to April 2017. Since ordinary least squares (OLS) method estimates from data suffering from structural breaks, non-normality conditions and heterogeneous distribution may be biased and not much favourable, quantile regression method termed to a robust method is adopted to analyse the same. The analysis revealed the asymmetric effects of dependence between crude oil price and stock index returns. The observed positive relation between the given variables was quite contrary to the usual presumption of inverse relation relationship existing for the oil importing nations. The degree of significance for the positive dependence between the crude oil price and stock index returns also varied across the quantiles for economies under study.

Stock market behaviour: Efficient or adaptive?

Daily data of returns (KSE-100) is divided into eight sub-samples of equal length of three years each and into different market conditions and are subjected to linear/nonlinear tests to elucidate how market-efficiency has behaved over time and whether a relationship exists between market conditions and levels of return predictability. The tests reveal that returns have gone through periods of dependence and independence over eight sub-samples thus Pakistan Stock Exchange is an adaptive market and consistent with the AMH. Furthermore, certain market conditions are more conducive to the predictability of returns as market conditions have also gone through episodes of significant dependence and independence of return predictability, which is also consistent with the AMH. Therefore, overall results of the study suggest that the AMH better elucidates the behaviour of stock returns than conventional efficient market hypothesis (EMH). © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Adaptive market hypothesis; AMH; Efficient market hypothesis; EMH; Linear dependence; Market conditions; Nonlinear dependence,

Board size, the percentage of independent directors on the board and percentage of ownership concentration in firms have a significant negative relationship with ROA. ROE shows a significant negative association with board size, AC independence and ownership concentration. Tobin's Q only shows a significant negative relationship with board size.

We apply the generalised method of moments (GMM) technique for dynamic panels using bank-level data from 85 banks for the 2003-2011 period. We first found that highly capitalised Islamic banks generate low profitability, while in contrast, highly capitalised conventional banks generate high profitability. Secondly, we found highly capitalised GCC banks (both Islamic and conventional) to be characterised by greater risk. Additionally, all profitability and risk variables demonstrate persistence. We then ultimately arrive at the same conclusions about capital, profitability, and risk relationship with the introduction of regulatory variables.

This study examines the impact of the revision in the IPO lock-up provision that took effect on February 2008 on the initial returns of 373 IPOs listed between January 2000 and December 2012, using cross-sectional multiple regressions. The findings indicate that the dummy of the lock-up period is positive and significant, validating that the dramatic drop in initial performance of Malaysian IPOs is an attribute of the shorter lock-up period regime. The new shorter lock-up period regime leaves fewer opportunities for speculation activities through IPOs. Investors may strategise to participate in firms that report higher lock-up ratio as it is likely to increase the initial returns.

The sample comprised 336 industrial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2016. The results documented that the positive relationship between surpluses free cash flow and earnings management. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence that investors realise that NAS harms the independence of the auditor by creating an economic bond between the auditor and client that could negatively affect audit quality and hence earnings credibility.

In the long term, after accounting for structural breaks, returns do not show persistence in Indian, Chinese and Indonesian exchanges. We conclude that for these exchanges, in the long term, returns may move randomly, thus removing any price prediction possibility. In addition, Japanese stock markets are anti-persistent in both the short term and the long term while Hong Kong showed anti-persistence in long term. Hence, these markets are expected to reward contrarian-trading strategies like short-interest ratio, put-call ratio, open interest, and mutual funds cash position. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",ARFIMA; Asian exchanges; G10; GPH; Long memory; Persistence; Structural break JEL classification E44,

Controlling shareholders rely more on debt at low levels of ownership to maintain control. However, they rely less on debt, which is found in this study to be 53%, to avoid financial distress. These results provide support for the trade-off theory. Our findings also reveal that family firms have higher leverage ratios than non-family firms. Further, institutional shareholders negatively affect financial leverage, thus assuming a substitution role. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Capital structure; Controlling shareholders; Corporate governance; Dynamic estimator; Family firms; Financial leverage; Jordan; Nonlinear; Ownership; Ownership structure,

Prior studies have focused on how intangible assets affect firms' profitability and valuation decisions with almost no focus on the role of loan loss provisions. We investigate whether banks increase (decrease) loan loss provisions in response to risks associated with investment in intangible assets. We find that discretionary loan loss provisions are inversely associated with bank intangible assets and change in intangible assets, but the inverse association is weakened in environments with strong investor protection. We observe that income smoothing is reduced among banks that have large intangible asset investment. Moreover, income smoothing is pronounced among banks that have few intangible asset investments but this behaviour is reduced for banks in environments with strong minority shareholders right protection.

We then regress this measure and other explanatory variables on the bank risk focusing on the role of earnings and diversification strategies. The results show that competition increases earnings management as the level of market power increases when banks diversify into non-interest income generating activities. The results also suggest that the relatively low insolvency risk among banks in Africa is attributed to the high degree of market power and the diversification strategy employed over the period. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Bank earnings; Banks; Developing countries; Imperfect market,

In addition, the evidence indicates that board size has a negative impact on cash holdings, while board independence does not play a significant role. Furthermore, it is found that profitability, firm size, growth opportunities and cash flow have positive effects on cash holdings, whereas leverage has a nonlinear impact on cash reserves.

On the other hand, the UAE trades at an average discount of $0.06. In addition, deviations (premiums or discounts) persist for as long as four days in Kuwait, while they disappear after one day in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These empirical findings show that ETFs do not fully replicate the performance of their respective underlying benchmarks. Pricing inefficiencies exist in ETFs with significant tracking errors. Moreover, there is a positive and significant relationship between returns and contemporaneous premiums, while returns and lagged premiums are negatively related. This casts doubt on the efficient market hypothesis. Using vector error correction model (VECM), we find evidence of significant price discovery in ETFs.

The results indicate that firms with superior performance attributes and good corporate governance have higher levels of anti-corruption progress. Earnings management is greater for firms with low levels of anti-corruption progress. We also find evidence that anti-corruption announcements are associated with significant market reactions.

Random walk model and asymmetric effect in Korean composite stock price index,2018,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040572178&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2018.089210&partnerID=40&md5=1793528334126046719996c7dde644da,"This paper empirically examines the market efficiency and the volatility persistence of weekly stock returns of the Korean composite stock price index (KOSPI) since July 1997 till September 2016. It studies the market efficiency in presence of both linear and nonlinear dependence in the stock price series along with testing for structural breaks. By employing various econometric tests, evidence of weekly series not following a random walk model along with asymmetric volatility effects was found. The results have significant implications for investors and traders as market inefficiency can impact both domestic and foreign flows in an economy. This study is unique as it employs multiple tests for market efficiency along with examining volatility persistence over a wide time frame of almost two decades. Since the results on market efficiency are mixed for the Korean stock market this study aims to offer a more comprehensive picture. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",asymmetric; auto regressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Korean composite stock price index; KOSPI; random walk model; RWM; volatility,
An analysis of diversification benefits of commodity futures using Markov regime-switching approach,2018,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040535548&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2018.089193&partnerID=40&md5=4ee05e056ee31fa2c42165a9627019a2,"This study investigates the hedge and safe haven properties of individual commodity futures against stock market movements using a nonlinear regime-switching framework. Based on the results of Brock, Dechert and Scheinkman (BDS) test and information selection criterion, Markov-switching vector auto-regression (MS-VAR) model is applied with three regimes for gold and silver futures and with two regimes for crude oil, copper and zinc futures. The results demonstrate strong hedge and weak safe haven property of gold and silver futures, while it shows a weak hedge and weak safe haven potential of copper and zinc futures. Conversely, crude oil futures cannot be used as a safe haven against extreme stock market movements. In addition, portfolio analysis confirms that these findings provide significant information to investors for the construction of better risk-adjusted return portfolio. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",commodity futures; diversification; hedge; Markov-switching; Markov-switching vector auto-regression; MS-VAR; nonlinear; regime-switching; safe haven,
Board characteristics and firm performance - A study of S&P BSE Sensex in India,2018,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050693557&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2018.093482&partnerID=40&md5=61167b24dad2f48836d280d4134870f5,"The study empirically examines the influence of board characteristics variables on firms' financial performance of S&P BSE Sensex (an index comprising 30 companies drawn from different sectors) companies during the period 2004-2014. For measuring firms' performance, two variables, namely - return on assets (RoA) which is an accounting-based measure, and Tobin's Q which is a market-based measure, were considered as separate independent variables. Four independent variables viz., board composition (BC), board ownership (BO), board size (BS) and CEO duality (CEOD) were selected for the study. Using the accounting-based measure, the study finds that there is significant negative association between BS and BO with regard to the firms' performance, thereby concluding that a smaller board size and a small ownership of executive and non-executive directors in the equity leads to improved financial performance. The study also finds no evidence of association between the independent variables and the market-based measure, Tobin's Q.

Influence of financial distress on exchange rate exposure: Evidence from India,2018,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054472921&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2018.095239&partnerID=40&md5=146288b0ec0ab9484ba720eb1e93d4e6,"This paper investigates the relationship between exchange rate exposure and level of financial distress. We argue that the exchange rate movements have a higher effect on the value of the firms with higher level of financial distress. The effect of other firm level variables such as profitability, size of the firm, foreign sales and expenses and liquidity on exchange rate exposure were also studied. We use Merton's (1974) structural default model to estimate firms' distance to default as a proxy for their probability of financial distress. A sample 387 firms listed in National Stock Exchange (NSE) is studied for a period of 2012-2016. We find that the level of firms' exchange rate exposure is significantly positively related to distance to default, indicating that firms that have a greater probability of financial distress are more affected by exchange rate movements.

The problem is more critical when banks are taken into consideration because of their important role in the economy. In this study the corporate governance index (CGI) has been constructed to measure the level of implementation of good governance practices and to verify whether the banks performed better with regard to that. The scores of overall CG indices and sub index are analysed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and OLS regression method. The level of compliance is analysed among public and private listed banks in India. The results show that CGI is significantly and positively associated with financial performance of banks measured by return on assets, Tobin's Q and economic value added. Moreover, banks indeed would have a good incentive to voluntarily improve their governance standards as it benefits them in terms of performance.

Evidence of seasonality of returns in any form, whether based on time period such as over specific days, weeks and months, or over size, such as large, medium or small or over different classifications such style (growth/value/momentum), or across various sectors or triggered by material announcements such as earnings, dividend, etc., are all contradictory to any of the three forms of efficient market hypothesis (EMH). In this paper we have made an attempt to find out calendar seasonality of returns in the Indian stock markets. We find that return seasonality exists in the Indian markets across sectors, sizes and styles during a 'month of the year' and during a 'day of the week'. These findings can be attributed to many behavioural aspects of investors and can be used by them in predicting the future returns, or in defining investment strategies in order to benefit from abnormal returns.

The level of carbon disclosure is scored through the content analysis of the annual reports. The findings support that carbon disclosure is negatively related to information asymmetry measures: the bid-ask spread and stock return volatility, in the year following disclosure. Overall, the research results are consistent with predictions of the agency theory and indicate that companies bear the extra voluntary reporting costs to achieve the perceived benefits of disclosure. The findings should be useful for corporate and stakeholders who are concerned about the value relevance of carbon disclosure in financial markets. For accounting standard setters, it highlights the urgency of carbon reporting guidelines.

The empirical results of this study provide evidence of the positive impact of CSR on FP. It is further concluded that firms investing in CSR have better financial performance. This study is a pioneer in Pakistan regarding CSR as investment and disclosure simultaneously and therefore an addition to existing literature on CSR.

In this study Granger causality test, cross correlation function and Pearson correlation test are applied. Also, augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used to find out the stationarity of time series data. Using bank level data of 322 observations from 23 banks during 2000-2013, the study found that bank capital buffer and tier-1 capital has a tendency to induce procyclicality in bank credit. Further, the study found that there are bi-directional causality and positive correlation between bank credit and economic growth. The result confirms the presence of causal relationship and provides strong evidence to the presence of procyclicality and its associated risk in the economy. The study suggests that banks should maintain adequate bank capital buffer to mitigate the risk associated with the procyclicality. It provides support to the implementation of RBI guidelines on the countercyclical buffer by all banks in India.

This paper examines the impact of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the development of the Nigerian primary capital market, using Granger-vector autoregression (VAR) framework for data from 1980 to 2013. The variables considered are market capitalisation, liquidity, financial literacy and regulatory quality. The short-run findings indicate that regulatory quality Granger-causes market capitalisation. Transaction cost also predicts market capitalisation and liquidity. Financial literacy predicts capitalisation and liquidity. Market capitalisation responds negatively to regulatory quality long run impulses, implying that an 'indifferent' regulation could be catastrophic for future primary market development. However, capital issuing responds positively to regulatory quality ten period innovations. Liquidity responds positively to financial literacy's innovation. A priori significant finding is that market capitalisation and liquidity do not drive capital issuing in the long-term. For policies, the paper recommends regulators to increase campaigns to deepen the understanding of issuers through financial literacy of potential issuers, promote the registration of more rating agencies and reduce transaction costs. Regulators should apply 'soft' listing requirements to encourage more firms to seek funds from primary capital market. Government should evolve strong market economy.

We use data from the companies listed on the Oman capital market between 2006-2013. Using a panel data approach and two measures of audit quality for the purpose of this study, we find that the audit quality of big-4 audit firms and industry specialist auditors is low because they do not enhance the quality of discretionary accruals and do not have a propensity to issue going-concern audit opinion. We also document that big-4 audit firms and industry specialist auditors consider that religion and risk factors provide the means for achieving high-quality audit. This paper is different from prior studies because it is the first to comprehensively examine audit quality in a unique setting - the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Furthermore, it extends our understanding of the role of religiosity in audit quality.

The study finds that there is high volatility of real effective exchange rate. It also reveals that real effective exchange rate is negatively and significantly related to economic growth. This finding suggests that exchange rate volatility is harmful to the growth of the Nigerian economy. This study recommends that government should constantly seek to maintain a stable exchange rate, increase its expenditure, particularly capital expenditure and implement sustainable reforms to increase the depth of the financial sector.

The empirical results show that Indian firms have target payout ratios, adjust to their targets relatively slowly but not as slowly as the firms in the developed markets such as the USA, Germany and France and thus, tend to smooth and stable their dividends and rely on long-term target payout ratios while making the dividend payment decisions. The firms having high investment opportunities, low leveraged, riskier and smaller firms tend to smooth their dividend more. As for the macroeconomic factors, the high dividend distribution taxes imposed by the government tend the firms to smooth their dividends more. Overall, the results support the information asymmetry and agency-based explanations of dividend smoothing.

Implied volatility implies the future underlying stock volatility, and whilst it cannot predict market direction, it can forecast the stock's potential for large fluctuations in the future. Once the implied volatility has been calculated, the traders can estimate how high or low the stock might swing by the option's expiration, and this estimation helps traders to make informed trading decisions. In this paper, we examine the information content of the implied volatility of individual stocks call options in the Malaysian stock market. We use a daily dataset for 100 trading days for a period between November 2013 and February 2014. Our findings suggest that, for the Malaysian market, although implied volatility does contain some relevant information about future volatility, it is a less accurate predictor than historical volatility.

An un-weighted disclosure index is used to examine the extent of FI disclosure. In addition, the study employs a number of multiple regression models to examine the determinants of FI disclosure. The findings indicate that the level of FI disclosure provided by the sample firms is relatively low with only 52% of FI-related items being supplied. In addition, the results illustrate that the level of FI-related disclosure has a statistically positive association with firm size, the audit firm employed and corporate governance attributes. However, the current study fails to document significant associations between FI disclosure and firm industry or ownership structure variables.

Long-run impact of financial restructuring on capital structure,2017,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019668582&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2017.084221&partnerID=40&md5=34abf99906b361e22672b4755b25a0fb,"This paper empirically investigates the impact of financial restructuring on capital structure of a firm in India. Pre- and post-admission data of firms subjected to financial restructuring are compared using paired sample t-test. Fixed effect panel regression model is used to analyse 15-year (2000-2014) data of 91 firms subjected to financial restructuring to find the relation between leverage and its determinants - profitability, firm size, tangibility and growth opportunity. The empirical results suggest that financial restructuring by itself is not a reason enough for leverage to increase over a period of 15 years. Other factors like profitability, tangibility, growth opportunity and firm size play important roles as well. The model corroborates the explanation provided by the asymmetric information theory and the signalling hypothesis to explain capital structure of a firm. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Asymmetric information theory; Capital structure; CDR; Corporate debt restructuring; India; Leverage; Signalling hypothesis,
Testing dynamic trade-off theory of capital structure: An empirical study for the textiles industry in India and China,2017,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031746311&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2017.087516&partnerID=40&md5=6d9693d8ddca447d1ba8b1b55503f295,"The prime objective of the current study is to compare the dynamic behaviour of capital structure across firms operating in the textile industry in India and China. The study has been conducted by analysing 92 publicly listed textiles firms in India and 33 publicly listed textiles firms in China. The time period from 2005 to 2016 for Indian firms and from 2004 to 2015 for the Chinese firms has been considered. The Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (1998) based dynamic panel estimation techniques have been deployed to generate the results. The empirical results confirm the applicability of the dynamic trade-off theory for the textile industry in India and China. Further, the results show that the speed of adjustment towards the targeted debt level is very low for the Indian textile companies as compared to that of the Chinese textile companies. The results strongly convey that Indian firms bear significant costs while moving from their observed leverage to their target leverage. The overall results support partial applicability of dynamic trade-off theory for the Indian firms and strong applicability of the theory for the Chinese firms. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",capital structure; China; dynamic panel regression; dynamic trade-off theory; emerging economies; India; textiles industry,

In addition, these techniques cannot help investors compare business on ambiguity multi-criteria and desire accumulation of data about the market. Therefore, portfolio selection with two significant financial ratios using the ELECTRE III method is proposed for small investors to make trading decisions. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this research, it is compared to the situation where a fix-percentage allocation existed and data was collected from the stock exchange of Thailand (SET).

In this paper, we discuss the major drawbacks of using this method, and strongly argue in favour of the risk-adjusted discount rate method. The calculation of certainty equivalent factors, the use of risk-free rate as the discount rate, the reinvestment rate assumption and the practical problems for multinational corporations for using the certainty equivalent method are discussed. We also discuss the concept of cost of capital and its role in relation to the use of the two methods of risk analysis. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Capital budgeting; Certainty equivalent method; Risk analysis; Risk-adjusted discount rate method,

In order to test the stability of the proposed money demand function specifications, we apply the cointegration approach with structural breaks. The empirical results provide strong evidence for the existence of a stable long run relationship with shift in the cointegration vector. In particular, we found that 28% of the money demand adjustment, following a short-run shock, occurs in the following period. Moreover, the results show that the two additional variables, black market exchange rate and the oil price, play a vital role in determining the money demand in Syria. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Black market exchange rate; Cointegration test with structural break; Money demand,

This study uses 'divergence' between cash flow and control rights as a new factor that could intensify the negative effect of RPTs. Findings of this study document that board size, CEO duality and divergence between cash flow and control rights can intensify the negative relationship between RPTs and firm value.

The impacts of institutional characteristics on capital structure: Evidence from listed commercial banks in China,2017,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031724797&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2017.087504&partnerID=40&md5=98a7dcceaf89101a8a180295c24111ac,"In China, bank capital structure is subject to the minimum capital requirements regulated by the Basel Accords. Nonetheless, with the rapid development of the Chinese banking sector, institutional characteristics have an impact on how banks finance their operations and growth. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the institutional factors that influence the capital structure of listed commercial banks in China. Using unbalanced panel data of 25 listed Chinese commercial banks during the period of 2003 to 2015, the results indicate that Chinese listed commercial banks with more profitability or those having a low percentage of shares owned by the largest shareholders are less likely to employ debt financing. Moreover, this study shows that the size of Chinese listed commercial banks increases with debts. The results of this study will assist managers of listed commercial banks to create adequate capital structure decision-making to further maximise bank value. In addition, both investors and depositors will be able to judge how safe the bank capital is, after understanding the determinants of capital structure, which will help in reducing their risk exposure. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",accounting; Asian; capital structure; China; commercial bank; debts; financing; panel data; profitability,

This research is made in connection between accounting and taxation context and tax system feature. To answer to our question we use the vector auto regression (VAR) method, which will enable us to analyse the response functions that determine the time at which the profitability of the investment duties to pay will become higher than the penalties. We use a sample of 37 firms listed over 11 years (2000 to 2010). The result shows that managers are not interested to make tax payments within two years because the return of reinvestments will be negative because of the impact of penalties incurred by the legal system and the importance of tax revenues in the economy and the short-term exploitation. This study can also be the object of replications in other contexts. The findings of this paper contribute to the sparse literature on tax management and could be improved by tax optimisation considerations. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Penalty; Reinvestment tax; Tax planning; Tax timing,
Dynamic relation between Islamic & conventional lending rates in Malaysia,2017,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015939373&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2017.082929&partnerID=40&md5=3ff4de4e6658b19f3eba3420233c42dc,"Conceptually, the Islamic and conventional banking rates are supposedly determined based on different premises, and empirical evidence appears to suggest that they are closely related. However, the findings are not unanimous. This paper offers Malaysian evidence of the extent of relatedness between Islamic and conventional lending rates in a dual-banking system. Our data consists of two pairs of Islamic and conventional lending rates: The base lending rates and the average lending rates. To test the relation, we use the standard methodologies of the Johansen cointegration, Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function. Our results indicate that there is no long-run relation between the Islamic and conventional lending rates for base lending rates; however, the average lending rates do indicate a cointegration between them. In the short-run the averages are independent. In general it may be concluded that Islamic borrowing may be considered a viable alternative to conventional bank borrowing. ©2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Conventional lending rate; Dual banking system; Islamic banking; Islamic financing rate; Malaysia,

Panel data sets are formed and panel data techniques are used. We develop two models using interaction terms to incorporate the sector's effect. We use Driscoll-Kraay approach to resolve the heteroskedasticity problem of the fixed effect method. The empirical results suggest a significant negative relationship between foreign ownership and all three measurements of capital structure; although foreign ownership has the largest effect on the short term market leverage relative to both long term and total market leverage. The sector of the firms matters and especially when it comes to the impact of the services sector, it is found that the foreign ownership impact is always statistically significant, although it has a lower impact for the industrial firms. A strong significant positive relationship between foreign ownership and firms' value is also found, and the sector of the firms is found to be an important variable in the firm's value determination. ©2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Amman stock exchange; ASE; Capital structure; Driscoll-kraay heteroscedasticity modified standard error; Firm value; Foreign ownership; Leverage; Tobin's Q,

Symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models that capture the most common stylised facts about index returns such as volatility clustering and leverage effect are fitted to these time periods and in-sample and out-of-sample estimates of VaR are obtained. Our results show that M-estimators provide accurate and reliable estimates of VaR in low and high volatile time. Our findings also show that the asymmetric model provides better fit than the symmetric model for the KSE. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",GARCH; Generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic; M-estimator; Value-at-risk; VaR; Volatility,

The estimate of persistence provides a quantitative measure of the impact of a sudden significant change in the asset return on its future volatility. This study attempts to analyse the magnitude and time-evolving pattern in the persistence of conditional volatility using data on S&P CNX NIFTY 50 (henceforth, Nifty) benchmark index. The GARCH (1, 1) model is fitted on daily returns and a simple iterative scheme is used to re-estimate GARCH parameters on samples of different sizes and different time periods. The GARCH estimates obtained through repeated estimations furnish empirical evidence on the nature and consistency of the persistence parameter.

For this purpose, an extensive dataset of 760 firms, over a period of 12 years (2001 to 2012) is taken for analysis. For robustness's purpose, four models are used to estimate the parameters. The study finds that bigger sized, highly levered and tangible firms invest less in their working capital. Firms with immediate sales growth and asymmetric information invest more in working capital. Board size and board independence are found to have a monitoring role in curtailing working capital investment.

We found significant relationships among inflation and three variables, past inflation, real income and exchange rate, moreover, the past inflation variable plays the most important role in explaining the current inflation in Vietnam. The exchange rate pass-through is found to have a remarkable influence on inflation in the short run, in particular, a reduction in exchange rate will lead to higher prices. Real income has a negative and small impact relationship with inflation, while the other explanatory variables have insignificant impact on inflation.

Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage.

An un-weighted disclosure index and multiple regression analysis were employed to conduct this study; a sample from 2007 (the first year of IFRS 7's implementation) to 2012. The banks' characteristics employed are bank size, the existence of a risk management committee (RMC), net assets value (NAV), the cost to income (CTI) ratio, earnings per share (EPS) and the price earnings (PE) ratio. The level of financial instruments (FIs) disclosure was 52% in 2007 and by the end of 2012 it had reached 71%.

The study applies the model of transfer pricing incentive of Swenson (2001) by employing generalised method of moments (GMMs) to examine the effect of income tax rate and tariff rates on the setting of transfer prices in ten commodity groups of multinationals operating in Vietnam during the period of 2008-2013. The study concludes a positive correlation between changes of transfer pricing incentives and changes of reported transfer prices. Furthermore, the findings also show that increases in Vietnamese income tax rate lead to decreases in income tax rate in the headquartered country of parent firms, or Vietnamese tariff rate.

The sample includes daily price indices for the period starting from January 2007 to June 2008 for the pre-crisis and from June 2008 to December 2010 for the postcrisis. The results of parametric test [autocorrelation test using Ljung and Box (1978) Q-statistics test] show that the markets are inefficient during the post crisis and efficient during the pre-crisis except for Saudi Stock Exchange, and the opposite has been found for most lags.

Moreover, we document that these impacts are affected by the Vietnamese firm's characteristics including firm size, market-to-book ratio and financial leverage. The estimation results also confirm the impacts of firm size and market-to-book equity on stock returns as suggested by the Fama-French model.

By utilising corporate governance index data for the period of 2006 through 2010 published by the Korea Corporate Governance Service, we got the following results. First, firms with relatively good corporate governance yield better firm performance, which in turn results in greater firm values. Specifically, we found through regression analyses that the corporate governance index has a significant positive relation with EBIT/SALES, Tobin's Q, and the market-to-book value ratio (MB). Second, the corporate governance index has a significantly positive impact on the ownership of foreign investors. Third, foreign investor share holdings positively affect the firm performance measured by MB, Tobin's Q, and abnormal returns. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Corporate governance structure; Firm performance; Firm value; Foreign investors' share holdings; Korea,

We found significant relationships among inflation and three variables, past inflation, real income and exchange rate, moreover, the past inflation variable plays the most important role in explaining the current inflation in Vietnam. The exchange rate pass-through is found to have a remarkable influence on inflation in the short run, in particular, a reduction in exchange rate will lead to higher prices. Real income has a negative and small impact relationship with inflation, while the other explanatory variables have insignificant impact on inflation.

Cash holdings and corporate governance: An empirical study on Malaysian public listed companies,2016,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999885209&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2016.080520&partnerID=40&md5=769f27d1effc0e9fff377eedd34b06f3,"The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and cash holding. Cash holding has drawn researchers' attention recently due to the fact that many companies all around the world have doubled their cash reserves. However, increasing cash holdings can bring about agency issues and that is why it is critical to have a strong corporate governance in order to compensate for the agency costs. This will provide managers with more cash reserves which lead to more flexibility to take advantage of the investment opportunities. The sample of this study is taken from Malaysian publicly listed companies for a ten-year period starting from 2003 to 2012. The outcome of this study suggests that corporate governance can significantly affect cash holdings and eventually corporate value. Therefore, companies with stronger corporate governance tend to keep higher cash holdings ratio. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Audit committee; Board of directors; Cash holdings; Corporate governance; Expertise; Independence; Meeting; Size,

We employ linear quantile regression analysis to investigate the impact of financial market conditions (stock market returns and volatility), key monetary policy, and macroeconomic variables (including short term interest rates, inflation rates, and crude oil prices) on the residential real estate price dynamics. The secondary objective of this paper is to investigate the nonlinear relationships among variables through the use of two different Archimedean copulas with upper and lower tail dependence. The empirical results consistently demonstrate that only the residential real estate index-inflation rate relationship is statistically significant for all quantiles. We also find a nonlinear relationship among stock market returns, crude oil prices, and the residential real estate index, where the dependence structure is asymmetric and orients toward the upper side of the distribution.

That reality requires the government to implement solutions relating to strengthening the control of FDI inflows into real estate, monitoring real estate credit risks as well as directing FDI inflow into relevant business areas, both to use the capital effectively and to avoid causing macroeconomic instability.

Price response patterns are even opposite, which are negative (positive) for some additions (deletions), and they seem to reject the prediction of information-based hypotheses. The positive (negative) price response to (added) deleted stocks is associated with (low) high liquidity, (low) high leverage, and (high) low growth opportunity.

The results of an unconditional test with a structural breakpoint show that the relationship is not stable, owing to the effect of the recent global financial crisis (GFC). The conditional test proposed by Pettengill et al. (1995) shows that after the GFC, lower risk is compensated for by a lower return. This indicates that there are more risk-averse investors than risk-takers, which does not help to boost the overall market performance. The implications for diversification strategies suggest that, unless higher risk is rewarded by higher return, regional and international investors will not be encouraged to divert their channels of capital to the ASE. The results also carry signs warning policymakers after the recent market improvements, which were intended to attracting FDI inflows. More incentives are required to encourage risk-takers to incline their capital to flow toward the ASE market.

The findings are not consistent with the study proposed in the developed countries. It suggests that most of the large Indonesian companies are conglomerates with controlling shareholders who have the authority for hedging and making financing decisions. The finding also suggests that the hedging market in Indonesia is not yet mature.

Using a dataset of 116 IPOs issued during 2007-2011, we find higher graded IPOs are less underpriced, and invite more subscription across different investor group. However, grading has little impact on post listing price volatility. Hence, the role of IPO grading in providing an objective assessment of the quality of the issue from the viewpoint of controlling after market volatility is doubtful. Further, distribution of penultimate subscription rate of different investor groups across grades suggests that non-institutional retail investors are poor in reading different grade values. This study contributes to the growing body of certification hypothesis for IPOs.

Additionally, the study aims to deepen our understanding of the main drivers of corporate governance reporting in one of the fast developing countries in Asia. Data for 84 top companies listed with Bursa Malaysia are extracted from their 2013 annual reports. Sixty-four corporate governance disclosure items are utilised to develop a disclosure index which is taken as the dependent variable. The overall voluntary compliance and disclosure in Malaysia's top listed companies is good with an average of 77.1%, with minimum compliance level being 50% and maximum being 90%. Firm characteristics and corporate governance mechanisms are taken as the independent variables. Using OLS regression, the study finds that board size, institutional ownership, foreign ownership, profitability, and auditor size are the main determinants of corporate governance disclosure in Malaysia under MCCG 2012. The paper contributes to literature on disclosure and the reported findings are broadly consistent with the notion that good corporate governance generally leads to better corporate disclosure and transparency in developing capital markets.

We compute the VaR for two ARCH/GARCH-type models including FIGARCH and FIAPARCH under two density functions: student and skewed student. The obtained results point out that that accounting for long dependence in return and volatility, fat-tails and asymmetry provides better one-day-ahead VaR forecasts. Furthermore, the FIAPARCH model out-performs the other models in the VaR forecasts. Finally, the FIAPARCH model provides for all the stock market indexes the lowest number of violations under the Basel II rules, given a risk exposure at the 99% confidence level. Our results offer potential implications for MENA stock markets risk quantifications, policy regulations and hedging strategies.

Assessing the efficiency of Malaysian banks: A data envelopment analysis approach,2015,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924403899&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2015.067827&partnerID=40&md5=04cf84477e95bf1071614f77e17dd752,"The purposes of this study are two-fold: firstly, to evaluate the efficiency of the Malaysian banks and secondly to examine the factors that influence the efficiency levels of those banks. Accordingly, 23 Malaysian banks covering the period between 2006 and 2010 are considered in this study. The findings of the DEA approach indicate that in general the Malaysian banks are efficient over the studied period. Furthermore, exchange rate, GDP, and inflation rate are found to be significant determinants of Malaysian banks' efficiency. As such, the present study contributes to the existing literatures on banks efficiency. The finding might be useful to the regulators as well as the practitioners.

Earnings attributes and the cost of equity capital: The case of Tunisian companies,2015,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84936751493&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2015.070287&partnerID=40&md5=36199e14b608093139c2a978f42a9f00,"This paper explores the relationship between the cost of equity capital and the earnings attributes in the Tunisian context. Actually, we measured the cost of equity using the CAPM then we studied the relationship between the cost of equity and earning attributes (which are accrual quality, smoothness, conservatism, value relevance, timeliness and persistence). For this reason, we used 26 non-financial companies listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2012. Tunisian companies are characterised by high levels of earnings management and conservatism. In fact firms are more likely to rely on bank financing rather than on capital market and are mostly family-run businesses. This could explain our results, which shows that information quality affects negatively the cost of equity capital. Analysis also reveals that accrual quality and conservatism are the attributes that have the most significant effect on the cost of equity capital. We contribute to the accounting literature by being the first study to examine the relationship between the cost of equity capital and earnings attributes in Tunisia for different stakeholders Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Cost of equity capital; Earnings attributes; Information quality,

Bank profitability was assessed by both ROE and ROA while liquidity was rated by the share of liquid assets in total assets. Our findings revealed a concave parabolic functional form regarding the relationship between profitability and liquidity by confirming the nonlinear relationship and the assumption that both excess and lack of liquidity may be harmful to banks' profitability. The robustness was tested by resorting to control variables such as size, age and gearing. This led to the revelation of the adverse effects leverage can have on profitability as opposed to how favourable size could impact it. However, age does not influence bank profitability in WAEMU area. The estimated results also showed that the recent financial crisis has not fundamentally impacted the relationship between profitability and liquidity in the WAEMU.

Using information provided in the annual reports of 87 Egyptian listed companies in the year 2009, the results indicate that Egyptian accountants do not require a higher degree of verification to recognise good news than bad news in financial statements. Therefore, it can be argued that Egyptian accounting practices have departed from the accounting value of conservatism and moved towards its opposite value, optimism. In addition, the results demonstrate that there has been a noticeable improvement in the level of transparency in the Egyptian accounting environment and this level is much better than that reported in many other emerging economies. Unexpectedly, however, the documented level of transparency was found to have a negative impact on the shareholders' wealth. Finally, our results illustrate that there has been a statistically significant improvement in the level of professionalism in recent years and this level is significantly positively associated with the companies' share returns performance.

The paper also examines whether the relationship differs by bank size particularly at the time of financial crisis. We apply three different approaches including: 1) ordinary least squares; 2) fixed-effect regression; 3) system generalised method of moments to examine the research questions. The results exhibit that increasing equity capital improves bank profitability in the UAE, and thus high equity capital is a critical value-driver for UAE banks. The evidence also shows that the Dubai debt crisis had an insignificant effect on bank performance. We however do not find significant evidence that high equity capital of domestic banks is used as a buffer to absorb financial shock. This finding holds regardless of individual bank sizes.

Islamic finance surely forbids debt-based funding but it is an open question whether Islamic banks prefer internal funds or external resources. The study provides empirical support for the fact that Islamic banks, in contrast to their conventional peers, rely more on their own equity rather than on external finance including loss-profit-sharing deposits. The analysis also puts in evidence that Islamic and conventional banks can be differentiated on the basis of assets tangibility and dividend payout and not in terms of profitability, asset liquidity and credit default. Among these factors, only profitability and size influence the equity-to-asset ratio in both kinds of banks.

The analysis of moral hazard in this paper is based on two types of risks, credit risk, and technical efficiency risk (managerial efficiency). The findings of the paper indicate credit risk is positively associated with deposit insurance coverage, and technical efficiency performance is negatively associated with deposit insurance coverage. Also indicated is that risk-based insurance premium is less than the fixed rate insurance premium (over-priced) for banks with pure technical efficiency performance. These results imply that when banks are characterised with managerial inefficiency the deposit insurance system can incite moral hazard behaviour. An additional finding of the paper indicates that, when banking sector is classified into national, foreign, and mixed ownership classifications, risk-based average deposit insurance premium is close to the average credit risk in each group. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Deposit; Insurance; Moral hazard; Risk; Sudan,

Although the surveys measure the general outlook of households in regards to the economy, the present paper provides distinct evidence that the consumer sentiment index is relevant to the Malaysian stock market behaviour. Results show that volatility of consumer sentiment index holds significant predictive power in explaining the behaviour of stock market volatility measured by GARCH (1,1).

Audit quality is measured by proxies, including audit fees, non-audit fees, industry specialist auditors and earnings management.

The research does not find a relationship between the other three audit quality proxies. The results suggest that among larger firms, earnings management is a major issue. Auditors are mainly expected to deal with earnings management. It is more likely that investors perceive auditing as an important mechanism to detect earnings management in large firms, enhancing the value of financial information. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Audit fees; Audit quality; Cost of equity capital; Earnings management; Industry specialist auditor; Non-audit fees,
The financial crisis of 2008 and stock market volatility - Analysis and impact on emerging economies pre and post crisis,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921767744&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.067017&partnerID=40&md5=e2477ca43dcd31fd6a45396a1fb4aa6f,"Stock market volatility plays a very important role in making or marring the fortunes of investors. The study of volatility becomes more important during extreme conditions such as financial crisis. This paper through GARCH, TGARCH and EGARCH models analyses and compares the volatility before and after the financial crisis of 2008. The study has been conducted on the emerging economies and comes out with quite interesting results. It concludes that the impact of the crisis on the volatility and leverage effect has been significant on the stock markets of different nations but the direction of the impact has been mixed.

Excessive CEO compensation and performance in French family firms,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921709975&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.067013&partnerID=40&md5=9ad6731d40484bdd98b0ffc559ee5295,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of CEO compensation on firm performance of French family firms. To investigate the link between executive pay and firm performance, we used multiple regression method over a period of four years (2007 to 2010). Our results show that French family companies provide excessive compensation compared to their non-family counterparts, suggesting that families are likely to extract private benefits at the expense of minority shareholders. The findings also show that excess remuneration paid to executives has a negative impact on financial performance. This result confirms the preceding one and suggests that CEO compensation is used by families as a tunnelling mechanism that exacerbates agency costs.

Profitable trading strategies based on price multiple information: Evidence from India,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921774155&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.067015&partnerID=40&md5=0e3db0cc739b8778a68ce245ecae0f05,"In this paper we examine if price multiples information can be used to develop profitable trading strategies. Data is employed for BSE 500 companies in India from July 2001 to April 2013. We find that, in general, low P/E, P/B and P/S stocks outperform high P/E, P/B and P/S stocks. Based on standalone price multiples, low P/B stock portfolio provide the highest return of 2.4% per month on risk adjusted basis. We observe that a combination of price multiples and their key value drivers does not provide trading strategies that outperform those based on standalone price multiples. Standard risk models like capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and Fama-French model are not able to explain cross-section of returns for price multiple sorted portfolios. Our findings are pertinent for market regulators', investment analysis as well as for academia. The study contributes to the equity valuation and asset pricing literature for emerging markets.

How do investors' subscription rate and pattern affect underpricing: An empirical investigation for Indian IPOs,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905983883&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.064177&partnerID=40&md5=341f93d6efbc9351d3266fbf1661550a,"This study investigates subscription rates across institutional and non-institutional retail investors for 149 initial public offerings listed in Indian stock market. We document a positive relationship between underpricing and subscription rate of all investor groups. We also find a significant shift in response pattern across institutional and non-institutional retail investors towards underpriced and overpriced IPOs. Our result supports the information asymmetry argument, suggesting that informed investors (institutional investors) are heavily subscribing for underpriced IPOs and shy away from overpriced issues. Cross-sectional regression results indicate that institutional investors' subscription rate is statistically significant (and positive) while evaluating retail investors' response rate. This evidence strongly suggests that retail investors sequentially learn from more sophisticated and informed (institutional) investors while applying for IPOs. Further, it is found that non-institutional retail investors heavily subscribe for IPOs from mature firms having long operational history. Empirical results confirm that larger offers and IPOs having more post issue promoter group retention are more underpriced. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Age; Ex-ante; Initial return; Institutional investor; Non-institutional investor; Offer size; Post issue promoter group holding; Retail investor; Underpricing,
The association between disclosure level and cost of capital in an emerging market: Evidence from Egypt,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905968824&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.064173&partnerID=40&md5=81d4f2b82d17c70f62f82aeaac3b0e62,"This paper aims to empirically investigate whether the cost of equity and debt capital is related to the extent of voluntary disclosure in the Egyptian stock market. Following the previous research, a disclosure index relevant to the Egyptian environment was developed and applied in OLS regressions, using information provided in the annual reports of 73 Egyptian listed companies. The results, however, indicate that there is no significant association between the level of voluntary disclosure, on the one hand, and the cost of equity capital and debt capital, on the other. This implies that Egyptian companies do not benefit from extensive voluntary disclosure in reducing the cost of equity or debt capital. Hence, the findings of this paper may be of interest to those academic researchers, practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering the implications of extensive voluntary disclosure in the annual reports of an emerging market such as Egypt. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Cost of capital; Egypt; Emerging markets; Voluntary disclosure,
Does lack of timeliness explain low contemporaneous returns-earnings association,2014,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905969049&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2014.064174&partnerID=40&md5=b10810361387aaf97d31290a17eee249,"This paper empirically tests whether the low contemporaneous returns-earnings association set by previous empirical researches may be explained by lack of timeliness of accounting numbers. It hypothesises that if the criteria for accounting recognition yield a multi-period lag in earnings recognitions of economic events, and if these events affect an informed market immediately when they occur, then future periods' earnings would have explanatory power for current returns as well as current earnings. To assess the significance of future earnings as an explanatory variable for stock returns we regress at first step annual returns on current earnings and at second step, annual returns on current earnings and successively next period and next two periods' earnings. Results show that future earnings continue to explain current returns. The evidence is characteristic of a substantial recognition lag in earnings that extends to the immediate next period. However, over one year, earnings do not seem to reflect any relevant economic event impounded in security prices at previous period. The earnings recognition lag seems to decrease after one year. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Accounting earnings; Lack of timeliness; Value-relevance,

The findings suggest that the regulation for Islamic banking institutions in most countries is formulated in the image of conventional banking. Some countries lack a proper legal framework with some notable issues including the lack of a dedicated Islamic banking law with few laws relating to corporate governance. However, most countries follow accounting standards of their domicile, International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Islamic accounting standards. The paper also suggests that due to various constraints facing Islamic banking practices, facilitating cluster or regional rules and practices may be the first step towards greater harmonisation. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Islamic banking; Regulation; Shari'ah; Supervision,

However, the empirical evidence on the relationship between financial reforms and growth is still mixed. This study therefore assessed the extent to which economic growth has been influenced by policies of financial reforms in West Africa using panel data. In terms of relative effects, the results from this study indicate that implementing policies that raise financial reforms by 10% induce economic growth by margins of 0.5% and 0.9% in WAEMU and WAMZ countries respectively. For the overall sample of West African countries, the study shows that raising policies of financial reforms by a margin of 10% induce economic growth by approximately 0.6%. Thus, the study found that policies of financial reforms were not uniformly growth-inducing across West African countries. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Economic growth; Financial sector; Panel; Policies; Reforms; West Africa,

The empirical approach is based on the modified Shannon entropy (SE) and the symbolic time series analysis for a dataset covering 15 sectors for the period (January 2007 to April 2012). Our results reveal significant departure from efficiency but the efficiency degree evolves over time. Also, we show the existence of structural breaks in the time-varying measure of efficiency indicating that the occurrence of extreme events strongly impacts the efficiency behaviour. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Shariah-compliant stocks behave differently from other firms in terms of the degree of WFE and its path over time. Overall, our findings provide several implications for portfolio managers and Saudi policy makers. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Shannon entropy; Shariah-compliant stocks; Stock markets informational efficiency; Structural breaks,

The results indicate that both real dividends and stock market prices have one order of integration and are not cointegrated. The results from the MS-VAR reveal that causality runs from real stock prices to real dividends but not vice versa. The finding that real dividends are not informational in predicating future movements in stock market prices is consistent with the 'dividend irrelevance theory' which posits that dividends do not have predictive power over future earnings. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,Dividends; MS-VAR; Regime switching; Stock market prices,

Jensen (1968) methodology is employed in the study. While there is a reasonable amount of empirical studies on the performance of the CAPM in Africa, the validity of the model has not previously been addressed in this manner in Morocco and South Africa. The CAPM posits that the performance of assets is solely explained by the market beta. The results of this study do not support this assertion. Although it was found that beta contributes to the variation of security returns in Morocco and South Africa, that contribution is insufficient to fully explain security performance. Instead, we found positive and significant alpha values, representing factors unexplained by market beta, and hence deviations from the CAPM. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Capital asset pricing model; CAPM; Casablanca; Johannesburg; Security performance; Stock exchange,

The average underpricing for Indian IPOs is 37%. Uncertainty, information asymmetry and investor optimism are the factors which explain underpricing. The IPOs which take more time in getting listed on stock exchange after the close of the issue have higher underpricing. In the case of big IPOs, mature firms have less underpricing and the IPOs which have more lead managers have more underpricing. Calendar-time factor regression results show that IPOs underperform in the long-run. However, underperformance is more for big and more oversubscribed IPOs than that of small and less oversubscribed IPOs respectively. IPOs which are more underpriced in the primary market are more liquid in the secondary market and this relation holds for all the measures of liquidity used in the study. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Asian; Calendar-time; IPOs; Liquidity; Long-run performance; Oversubscription; Underpricing,

The findings suggest that regulatory reforms over the 1996 to 2006 period resulted in enhanced corporate transparency and accountability as reflected in more extensive voluntary disclosures. We provide empirical evidence that the extent of voluntary disclosures is significantly associated with the strength of corporate governance structure in 2001 and 2006 and with ownership structure in 1996, 2001 and 1996.

With a different focus to that of Henri's (2006) concept of dominant culture, we argue that in control dominant firms, flexibility and diverse performance measures (PM) can lead to improved performance. Testing of the two competing values based on dominant culture excludes the chance to test this possibility. Also, we propose that through the use of diverse PM, the flexibility value of the firms will have stronger influence on firms' performance than the control values. As the most developed sector in Malaysian economy, manufacturing companies need to adopt the right mix of PMs to be competitive in facing globalised market, thus, they were selected for the study. The study found that with stronger presence of cogent leadership, use of diverse performance measures can translate flexibility values into firms' improved performance.

Sukuk (commonly referred to Islamic bonds) represent a proportional ownership of tangible assets or a pool of assets. However, the key to understanding these instruments as a financial innovation is to focus on their pricing and risk characteristics. The challenge for sukuk issuing entities becomes to provide an efficient pricing model, which is compliant with Islamic law principles. The aims of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we explore empirically the determinants of sukuk yield spreads and we describe within a coherent empirical framework the economic implications of the links between sukuk yield spreads, stock market conditions and macroeconomic variables; Secondly, we provide a methodology for estimating the fair price of sukuk in the presence of default risk. This paper presents the first empirical study for the determinants of sukuk spreads using available data and it has several practical implications that are of value for investors, risk managers and the development of Islamic financial markets.

Using a sample of Sudanese banks, the paper found that only the internal factors to these banks have a significant impact on banks' profitability, as measured by return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and net financing margin (MARG). More specifically, cost, liquidity and size of the bank are found to have positive and significant effects on profitability. However, external macroeconomic factors are classified as redundant and have no significant effects on profitability. These results have precedence in the literature as some country-specific studies found no or very weak effects of macroeconomic variables on performance of commercial banks. Furthermore, the study found that the data are best represented with a random effects model vis-à-vis fixed effects or pooling estimation models. Finally, the study has many implications for banks, regulators and depositors with respect to liquidity, cost and bank structure in Sudan.

Single and multiple risk factors in the Egyptian stock market,2013,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879304713&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2013.054422&partnerID=40&md5=304311168d34faed602110393db5e3e7,"The return-risk trade-off of the 100 stocks contained in the Egyptian EGX100 index is examined. The Egyptian stock market has an average free float of only 45%. It is estimated that 50% of trading in the free float stocks is dominated by large investors, and local and international fund managers. The market suffers from low turnovers and more recently long periods of trade suspension after the political unrest of January 25th, 2011. The study finds that a serial correlated returns model is more suitable to estimate returns for low free float stocks in Egypt. However, it is unlikely that this serial correlation could lead to above average trading profits since it is a reflection of ownership concentration in a small illiquid market. The market offers diversification benefits due to its low correlation with major world indices. However, trade suspension due to political instability is an extra risk that could negate diversification benefits.

Does one size fit all? An empirical investigation of board structure on family firms' financial performance,2012,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864573237&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2012.048248&partnerID=40&md5=52dd670be13b06d40ca1973d43235fd0,"The current study investigates the relationship between family firm board structure and financial performance in Sri Lanka. This study uses five years (2006-2010) of data from 65 family firms listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). In order to investigate the impact of board structure on family firm financial performance, a dynamic panel generalised method of moment estimation is applied. The results show that board openness to non-family members, board diversity and insider ownership decrease family firms' financial performance. Consequently, this study suggests the corporate governance framework needs to be tailored to a family business structure as 'one size does not fit all'.

IPO underpricing and their determinants: Penny stocks versus non-penny stocks,2012,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859582364&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2012.046333&partnerID=40&md5=54ce3db5d7273ad783add143035658f2,"Abstract: We consider the initial public offering (IPO) returns of penny stocks before and after Penny Stock Reform Act (PSRA) implementation. We extend the work of Bradley et al. (2006) by looking not only at NASDAQ small capitalisation issues, but also those issued on the bulletin boards and pink sheets. These stocks exhibit average first-day excess returns of 128% relative to the NASDAQ Decile 1 index. Higher-priced offerings in the same markets as the penny stocks return only 7.6% more than a comparison benchmark. Cross-sectional analyses show that lower-priced stocks and stocks of smaller firms are underpriced to a greater degree. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis, pink sheet issues have higher first-day returns than equities issued in the more exposed and more regulated environments of the NASDAQ small capitalisation markets and the OTC markets. Post-PSRA abnormal returns are significantly less than pre-PSRA returns, and there is a marked shift toward private issues.

Recognising this importance, the International Accounting Standards Board has prescribed IAS 7 (cash flow statement). Many studies have been carried out to assess the usefulness of cash flows in the prediction of future cash flows or more specifically profitability. This paper focuses on some other determinants of future profitability apart from the components of net income. It finds that the debt-equity ratio of a firm is also a deciding factor among the accrual components and past earnings.

The results of the univariate and multivariate analyses show that income, age, marital status, number of children and educational level have a positive influence on the individuals' average saving. The study indicates that those individuals who do not save and are not willing to save have a more indifferent attitude towards the factors of willingness to save than the individuals who save or are willing to save. The logit regression results also show that the odds of saving willingness are positively influenced by gender, other financial dependents and household income. The proposed model of influence on saving suggests that an individual will take a series of actions on saving if he/she has a surplus portion of income, a concern for future spending and a trusted saving product.

Results showed that most Tanzanian CPAs are satisfied with their jobs but are unhappy with pay and promotion. Results also showed that co-workers, pay, promotion, supervision, and work itself have significant influence on the job satisfaction of Tanzanian CPAs, while their age and gender have not. The implication of these results is that co-workers, pay, promotion, supervision, and the work itself are predictors of job satisfaction of Tanzanian CPAs. Therefore, Tanzanian managers must actively promote those factors in the workplace in order to foster better job performance. For future studies, the use of broader sociological and cross-cultural variables is recommended in order to identify additional variables that are vital in creating an appealing workplace for Tanzanian CPAs.

Drawing from the Islamic principle of full disclosure, stakeholder and signalling theories, this research examines whether there is a relationship between risk, profitability measures and the level of risk disclosure. Using a sample of Islamic banks in Asia, the Middle East and Europe for the period between 2006 and 2009, the results from a panel data analysis confirm a positive association between return on equity and risk disclosure. There is modest evidence of a negative association between risk (as measured by leverage and proportion of loan to total asset) and risk disclosure. The results generally support the signalling theory rather than thestakeholder theory. A major policy implication is that risk disclosure should be mandatory as voluntary disclosure cannot be expected.

Using a sample of 69 Australian listed companies, a weighted disclosure index for perceived 'proprietariness' of the information contained in each disclosure item was computed in the pre- and post-regulation periods, of the Australian Accounting Standard, AASB 1033 'Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure'. On the basis of this computed index, the results reveal significant increase in voluntary disclosure of proprietary information between the pre- and post-regulation periods. Findings from the study also suggest that firms' growth opportunities have some influence in limiting voluntary disclosure of proprietary information in the unregulated period. Implications of the findings for standards-setters and financial statement users are also discussed in this paper.

We find little evidence on the existence of intermediate stocks return momentum. Specifically, the unrestricted momentum trading strategies appear profitable only in major developed countries but not in the emerging countries in our samples. We further investigate momentum effects through two behavioural theories: Hong and Stein's (1999) gradual-information-diffusion model and Barberis et al.'s (1998) investor conservatism bias model. Our results support Barberis et al. (1998) model but reject the Hong and Stein's information diffusion hypothesis. It shows the profitability of momentum strategies is positively related to analyst coverage but negatively related to analysts' forecast dispersion. We argue that investors' psychological conservatism biases reflect slow updating of their beliefs and underrate the importance of new information. Interestingly, we also find that book-to-market is more important than dispersion and dispersion is more important than size in explaining momentum returns.

Regulation and risk taking in the banking industry: Evidence from Tunisia,2012,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859620029&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2012.046334&partnerID=40&md5=231c12c47b9b6fbb0f94f75184a0b72d,"This research highlights the impact of capital regulation and franchise value on bank risk taking in the Tunisian context. Using a panel set of Tunisian commercial banks during the period spanning from 1997 to 2007, our study puts in evidence that stringent capital requirements help deterring the bank risk taking. Similarly, banks with high franchise value may have an incentive to avoid risky business strategies. However, empirical findings clearly bring forth that the intensity of such decrease varies with the risk taking measurement. Capital regulation allows reducing both the market risk and the insolvency risk but has no effect on the specific risk of the bank; while the franchise value has a negative effect on only the market risk of the bank. Overall, our study indicates that capital allocation should be more risk sensitive and that the whole bank risk taking ought to be deeply investigated and quantified.

In specific terms, the paper examines CGVs that affect CP, proxied by return on assets (ROA), profit margin (PM) as used in literature but extended to include return on equity (ROE). We used 50 listed companies that cut across the Nigerian Stock Exchange market. We obtained the CGVs of board size (BOS), board composition (BOC), board ownership (BOO) chief executive status (CES) and audit committee independence (ACI) with corporate governance disclosure (CGD) and enterprise risk management disclosure (RMD) added to our model. Using the ordinary least square (OLS) regression, findings revealed that CGD and RMD are positively and significantly related to ROA and PM. It is suggested, on account of these findings, that there should be sustenance of the current corporate policies profile on CGD and RMD as they positively affect CP; while corporate boards, as strategic policy makers should note with caution the CGVs with negative relationships with CP. Such caution is required in order to redirect and refocus policies which could minimise the negative impact of such CGVs on CP. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Companies; Corporate governance; Corporate performance proxies; Nigeria; RMD,

The difficulties in measuring attributes of interest are addressed on two fronts: conceptual and methodological. A broader conceptual framework is developed by introducing several new proxies for firm-specific and industry attributes. We employ a range of measures of leverage that allow us to examine definitional sensitivity of the explanatory power of capital structure theories. A two-step procedure consisting of exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression is employed. Analysis of data obtained from a sample of 152 firms, across a period of eight years (i.e., 2002 to 2008) indicates that the explanatory power of antecedents of capital structure of JSE listed firms is sensitive to how leverage is defined. We also find that capital structure is negatively influenced by such factors as profitability, liquidity, intangible-unique-growth opportunities, and business risk; it is positively affected by industry factors. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Antecedents; Capital structure; Exploratory factor analysis; South Africa,

Using a multivariate analysis of variance for a sample of 22 firms listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange, we find that the accounting quality affects the implementation of the governance mechanisms in the Tunisian firms. Particularly, the irrelevance of the financial reporting increases the control by the foreigners, the families and the blockholders and reduces the presence of the State and the financial institutions in the Tunisian firms.

By adopting the co-integration and vector autoregressions (VAR) methods, the study documents that the nature of integration of the three markets changes due to the crisis. While there are diversification benefits in these markets at the initial stage of the crisis, there seems to be no diversification benefits in the stock markets in a prolonged 'down market'. In a short time horizon, 'market panic' results in investors to withdraw funds in the crisis country and invest in other countries with calmer markets. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2007 global financial crisis; Diversification benefits; Japan; Malaysia; Sectoral indices; Stock market integration; USA,

First, we measured scores for environmental disclosure and environmental performance through the annual reports and the websites of 31 Tunisian companies. Second, we tested the relationship between these scores and the financial performance usinga multiple regression analysis. The results showed that the financial performance of Tunisian companies has a negative influence on environmental performance and on environmentaldisclosure. Thus, the more profitable firms have low levels of environmental performanceand disclose less environmental information. In contrast, Tunisian firms with poor financial performance will undertake environmental activities in order to improve their image towards their stakeholders. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Environmental disclosure; Environmental performance; Financial performance; Legitimacy; Tunisia; Tunisian firms,

We document that the Dow Jones futures market has considerable influence on KOSPI200 and Nikkei225 futures markets during the normal growth period but has relatively little influence on the two markets during the crisis period. Although a number of previous studies have indicated that the market interdependence tended to become more severe after the historical financial crises, we find such a linkage during the normal growth period (i.e., before the recent US subprime crisis), not after the crisis. This discrepancy results in differential opportunities for risk diversification, which is also supported by the evidences from the impulse response analysis. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Dow Jones futures; Financial crisis; Japan; Korea; KOSPI200 futures; Market interdependence; Nikkei225 futures; USA; VECM; Vector autoregression; Vector error correction model,

There is a change in the importance of public sector banks because of the entry of foreign and private sector banks. In the recent past, the banking industry has succeeded to draw attention of investors by its steady performance and tremendous prospects to grow and to meet broad challenges like threats of risks from globalisation; implementation of Basel II; improvement of risk management systems; implementation of new ccounting standards; enhancement of transparency and disclosures etc. The competitive pressures force banks to improve their efficiency scores, and mapping the progressive pathway is an education tool for investors.

A quantitative assessment of the efficiency of banks in an economy proves to be crucial for formulating strategies for efficiency enhancements. The alternative techniques of efficiency measurement in banks are distinct in terms of construct and approach and thus may offer different results. The difference in the results may be considerable in the case of banking systems in emerging economies. This paper examines the efficiency in the Indian banking sector during the post reforms period 1991-1992 to 2006-2007 using two popular frontier analysis techniques, namely data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), as alternative techniques of efficiency measurement. The paper offers evidence in support of conflicting results provided by the two techniques, though both indicate efficiency gains in the period of study.

The results provide evidence based on auditors' opinions that the benefits associated with Section 404 applications are expected to outweigh its costs, with possible reduction of Section 404 costs in the future period. Moreover, theresults indicate that both the additional audit procedures required in the audit of internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR) and the increased legal liability that will be imposed on auditors through compliance with Section 404 requirements are expected to improve the quality of the audit process.

Among the dividend-paying firms, some dividend payers collected the distributed dividends back through rightsissues. In some cases, the amount of rights issues exceeded the distributed dividends. Hence, this resulted in negative dividend payments. This paper provides a solid empirical basis to examine dividend-collecting firms and negative dividends. The findings of this paper show that dividend collectors, in particular negative-dividend- paying firms, started to decrease after the suspension of mandatory cash dividend payment policy in 1995. The results suggest that large firms with low earnings are likely to become negative dividend payers. Further, firms with high investment potential and higher short-term debt constraints tend to collect more dividends back. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Dividend collectors; Mandatory cash dividends; Negative dividend payers,
The perceived importance of electronic sources of financial information to individual investors in Egypt: An empirical investigation,2010,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956702363&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2010.035195&partnerID=40&md5=451ba9a598955ba078983f8e1673ea59,"This research aims to investigate empirically the perceived importance of various sources of financial information in relation to various investment decisions in the market, and to explore how the new source, electronic sources of financial information (ESFI), stands in relation to them. This study examines the issues from the perspective of individual investors, as a main group of users. Despite the extensive use of ESFI and their websites, especially by individual investors, there has been no research regarding the usefulness of this new source in Egypt. It has been observed that most previous studies focused predominantly on corporate reports (CR) and other traditional sources. In order to gather the data needed for testing related hypotheses, two methods were employed: structured interviews using a questionnaire that was delivered to 120 individual investors, and content analysis of ESFI websites. There was a clear finding that individual investors ranked ESFI as the most important source of information, followed by specialised newspapers and magazines as second, with CR third in importance.

Loan loss reserves of weakly provisioned banks: Evidence from major Tunisian banks,2010,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956690572&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2010.035192&partnerID=40&md5=89bf918a6dea1afbb1095ca03cd6afa6,"The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants of loan loss reserves of weakly provisioned banks. We use data on major Tunisian banks over the period 1998-2006. The results show that loan loss allowances are significantly driven by earnings management objectives and the general attitude toward risk. However, it appears that the quality of assets does not explain banks' provisioning policy. It seems also that weakly provisioned banks are less stringent in the control of their risks and are not fully in line with the banking regulation. Finally, our findings show a significant link between the provisioning for loan losses, economic conditions and fiscal reforms.

Data were obtained from the Jordanian shareholding companies as of the end of 2009. Regression analysis is used to test the association between the awareness level of using ABC and the level of adoptingABC. It is also used to identify the improvement in ROA as a mean of financial performance which associated with ABC initiatives. Results show that the awareness level of using ABC is high among the financial managers, but ABC implementation is not high; also it is found that there is a positive association between ABC and improvement in ROA. © 2010Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",ABC; ABC success; Activity-based costing; Improvement in financial performance; Jordan; Structural equation models,

The study also analyses the performance of the merged banks in relation to a control group based on financial ratios. The results of cumulative abnormal returns analysis signify that merger announcements are value-creating activities for the acquirer banks. At the same time, merger announcements erode shareholder wealth for the target banks. The framework of pre-merger and post-merger comparison of the operating performance of the acquirer banks was based on three models whereby the cash flow was deflated by market value of assets, book value of assets, and income. The result does not provide evidence to support the view that corporate performance improves after mergers. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Lt.d.",Acquirer; CAR; Cash flow model; Cumulative abnormal return; Mergers; Target,

Moreover, while director shareholding is found to be an insignificant factor affecting firm performance, the results show expatriate CEOs performing better than their local counterparts. We need to err on the side of caution as sampling selection was based on data availability rather than any probability criterion.

Seven variables are considered: the consumer price index, oil price, exchange rate, tourist arrival rate, electricity consumption, Lombard rate and aggregate money supply. The sample data are monthly observations from January 2002 to December 2006. Four variables that are statistically significant at the 10% level or better in explaining variation in the equity premium on the SEM are: the level of the price index, the oil price (given that Mauritius is heavily dependent on oil imports), the exchange rate and the level of economic activity as proxied by electricity consumption. The most important variable is the exchange rate. The reliability of the model is tested and found to be adequate.

The main finding of this paper is that the risk premium depends only on the hard information proxies. However, the availability of credit seems related to the interaction between the loan officer and the customer through the collection of'soft' information.

We applied a battery of unit root tests and variance ratio tests (individual and multiple) to see whether the return series (and also the raw data) follow a random walk process. Our results suggest that the increments of the return series are not serially correlated. Therefore, we conclude that foreign exchange markets in SAARC countries are weak form efficient.

More precisely, we test the incentive effect hypothesis. Using data for 1,740 publicly listed non-financial firms from eight Asian countries for 1996, we find that firm value increases with cash-flow rights of the ultimate shareholder. This result is consistent with previous empirical studies. Also, we show that common law environment offers better protection for minority shareholders. Moreover, the positive effect of ultimate shareholder cash-flow rights is stronger in civil law countries.

An investigation of long-run dynamic relationship of Korean and Indian futures indexes,2009,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350150822&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2009.028911&partnerID=40&md5=264646c38edd83f4e5ffb3ecb21e9763,"We investigate the nature of the long-term dynamic relationship between the futures indexes of Korea and India. Both the Kospi 200 futures index and Nifty futures index are found to be non-stationary and cointegrated, meaning thereby that a long-term dynamic equilibrium relationship exists between them along with a Granger cause bidirectional relationship. The VECM results indicate that a lagged relationship exists between the two indexes. While lag 1 and lag 3 are statistically significant for Kospi 200 futures - Nifty futures, lag 4 and lag 6 are significant for Nifty futures - Kospi 200 futures. It is suggested that while information on Kospi 200 futures is more instantaneously discounted by the Nifty futures, the information on Nifty futures is relatively slowly discounted by the Kospi 200 futures index. The impulse response analysis suggests that the price discovery process is more efficient for Kospi 200 futures index than for Nifty futures index.

Additionally, the problems encountered by the auditors in using these techniques in the field are also catalogued. This study used a survey method and collected information from the Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms in Bahrain. The results indicate that the auditors primarily use documentation, analytical procedures and confirmations in collecting evidence. The auditors rank confirmation, physical and documentary evidence as the most reliable forms of evidence. The auditors also spend most of their time on these techniques. However, the sufficiency and competency of the audit evidence is rated as merely satisfactory. The Bahrain business environment is conservative and secretive, which affects the audit process and partly explains our results. The common problems faced by both the Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms are difficulties in collecting external evidence and uncooperative clients. The study also analyses the differences in the perceptions of the Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors and experienced versus non-experienced auditors. The results of this study shed light on the problems and perception of the auditors in the non-Western countries in using standard evidence collection techniques.

The paper also studies whether firms in these markets correct their share prices to the optimal trading range using stock splits. The results vary across countries, across firms and across periods. Although some anomalies in some markets are found, most results are consistent with Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis in an incomplete information market. Small firms as less-recognised firms choose low prices to attract small shareholders, thus increasing their shareholder base and the firm's value. Ownership concentration and corporate governance are found to be very important in explaining cross-sectional stock price variation. Specifically, small firms in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand made stock splits to maintain their preferred share prices.

Accounting education in developing countries: Can accounting expert systems be an alternative/support solution to instructor-based teaching?,2009,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350041566&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2009.028914&partnerID=40&md5=617775440dc67f6592be4d6aba24a5ff,"Accounting teaching in developing countries is facing serious challenges due to the increasing number of students. Accounting expert systems as a teaching method can help manage this flow. The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of expert systems as a teaching method compared to regular professor-based teaching. Knowledge acquisition was tested over two dimensions: a declarative knowledge b procedural knowledge. Findings show that the expert system teaching method was as effective as the professor-based teaching method in reference to declarative knowledge, but it gave better results for procedural knowledge. We conclude that accounting expert systems can be considered an effective support in making knowledge available to students in developing countries, especially in poor ones.

Firm-specific determinants of the extent of compliance with international accounting standards in the corporate annual reports of companies listed on the Egyptian stock exchange: A positive accounting approach,2009,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64149115274&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2009.024302&partnerID=40&md5=15b798a770e15d5ee3dbd07911c45803,"This paper examines the firm specific characteristics - as a proxy for positive accounting research - that are associated with the propensity of companies listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE) to comply with the newly harmonised Egyptian Accounting Standards (EASs) issued in 1997 and that are close to the international accounting standards (IASs). Although having an international audit firm is the dominant factor associated with disclosure and measurement/presentation compliance, ownership concentration, share trading, size as measured by market capitalisation and internationality are also associated with compliance. However, the results show that profitability, liquidity and leverage do not seem to affect the extent of compliance with EASs and the performance of manufacturing are at par with non-manufacturing firms. Also the performance of private sector firms is at par with public sector firms. This may indirectly imply that the positive accounting perspective may not be entirely applicable for de facto compliance in Egypt. Hence, it cannot be entirely inferred that listed Egyptian companies may use de facto compliance with EASs as a means of reducing agency costs, raising capital, reducing political costs or signalling to the market that they are high quality firms.

We propose that different levels of ambiguity tolerance lead to different judgements being made in the face of similar circumstances. We further propose, contrary to what might be expected, that the provision of guidance in accounting standards will exacerbate the differences in judgement rather than reduce them. While we find only weak support for the belief that different levels of ambiguity tolerance will lead to different judgements, the provision of guidance differentially affected the judgements made by those exhibiting high versus low levels of ambiguity tolerance. Our results suggest that comparability may be best served by not providing guidance relating to ambiguous accounting standard requirements. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",accounting judgement; accounting standard guidance; accounting standard interpretation; accounting standards; ambiguity; ambiguity tolerance; Australia; comparable financial reporting; harmonisation; People’s Republic of China; significant influence,

The evidence suggests that the payers are more profitable than non-payers. Likewise, investment opportunity, which is measured by (∂At IAt舒j) and (Vt/At), differed for both payers and non-payers. The regression estimates from Logit model suggest that the average coefficient for EATA is a significant determinant for firm’s dividend policy choice in Malaysia. This is consistent with the supposition that profitable firms are more likely to pay dividends than less profitable firms.

Our results also reveal that companies follow different financial strategies during different business cycle stages and that companies which follow the matching principle and adjust faster to changing market conditions outperform other companies. The last finding implies that a company’s ‘speed of adjustment’ is an important factor that separates more from less successful companies. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",business cycle; corporate finance; transmission channels,
FII share and bank performance: an empirical analysis of Indian banks,2008,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969447101&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2008.016889&partnerID=40&md5=a7fcee84251542c22fdd768b9117a9d8,"This paper investigates the relationship between the Foreign Institutional Investment presence and firm performance of 25 listed banks of the Indian banking industry. The results indicate that the FII share plays a significant and positive role in determining the performance of public sector but not necessarily private sector banks. This is explained by the critical role that FII plays in public sector banks in improving managerial efficiency by avoiding issues relating to moral hazard. Private banks suffer less from problems of moral hazard, and therefore, the role of FII in such banks is not as critical as in the case of public sector banks. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",banking; foreign investment and performance; Indian banks,
What drives short-term GCC stock market returns? Empirical evidence from fat-tailed distribution,2008,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969447076&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2008.016888&partnerID=40&md5=44766ccbf59f4ffc5e42dc1d4fa667e4,"Given that changes in oil prices influence the observable factors in GCC economies, this paper shows unobservable speculative factors that drive short-term stock market returns in Saudi and Bahrain markets.1 For other GCC markets, such as Dubai, Abu-Dhabi, and Muscat, oil price uncertainty and unobservable speculative factors work together, though in opposite directions, to influence stock prices. However, in the long term, only oil price changes prevail as a determinant of GCC stock prices. Long term is defined as the period of time required for the effect of oil price changes to transmit its influence to major macroeconomic indicators that influence the profitability of firms traded in GCC stock markets. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",fat-tailed distribution; GCC stock markets; short-term returns; stock market returns,
Firm leverage and the private benefits of control in Chinese firms,2008,Afro-Asian Journal of Finance and Accounting,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969447078&doi=10.1504%2fAAJFA.2008.016887&partnerID=40&md5=4e934fbdac8c946693f04424dbefe4f7,"This study investigates the relationship between capital structure and the private benefits of control of listed Chinese firms. A sample of firms listed on the Chinese stock markets is used to estimate the private benefits of control. The private benefits of control are approximately 18% (on average) in China. There is a statistically significant negative relationship between Short-Term Debt (STD) and the private benefits of control. In addition, a positive relationship exists between Long-Term Debt (LTD) and the private benefits of control. Finally, a statistically significant negative relationship exists between total debt and the private benefits of control. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",capital structure; Chinese firms; minority stockholder protection; private benefits of control,

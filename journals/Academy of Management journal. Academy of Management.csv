Neither followers' locus of control nor growth need strength was found to be significantly correlated with the quality of the exchange between leaders and followers.,,"Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Leadership; Male; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Nursing, Supervisory; Regression Analysis; United States; adult; article; female; health personnel attitude; human; human relation; information processing; leadership; male; nursing; nursing staff; organization and management; psychological aspect; regression analysis; statistics; United States"

However, although numerous scholars have recognized its importance, very few have attempted to measure the phenomenon. In this article, I present a set of dimensions measuring top managers' power and suggest a measurement methodology to facilitate empirical inquiry. Data from a group of 1,763 top managers in three industries were used to assess the validity and reliability of the power dimensions in three studies. Results demonstrate strong support for the proposed power dimensions.",,"Administrative Personnel; Commerce; Data Collection; Decision Making, Organizational; Humans; Institutional Management Teams; Leadership; Power (Psychology); United States; administrative personnel; article; behavior; commercial phenomena; human; information processing; leadership; management; manpower; organization; organization and management; statistics; United States"

Clusters of managers having similar work content in their jobs were often associated with one or two clusters of work process characteristics. However, the differences between the two clusters of process characteristics associated with one content cluster were often very great.

Tests using both accounting- and stock-market-based measures of performance revealed that information asymmetry improved performance more than economies of scope.

The result is a four-cell model that distinguishes adaptive strategies in terms of their functional orientations and how firms pursue them--whether alone or in collaboration with other firms. Data analyses supported the propositions that adaptation in small firms is a multicomponent construct and that regulatory and competitive uncertainty differentially influence the adaptation process.

We predicted that both organizational and social support would moderate the relationship between extent of exposure and negative mood, with the relationship being strongest when support is low and weakest when support is high.

In addition, we examined the role of organizational pay leadership position and external or internal orientation in decisions about job pay, controlling for differences in organizational demographic characteristics. Results suggest that pay strategies affect assigned pay levels, with managers from market-leading and internally oriented firms assigning higher pay. In addition, pay strategies appear to influence the relative weights attached to market survey versus job evaluation information.

In addition, objectively assessed job demands were significantly associated with blood pressure and cortisol levels. The model also predicted elevations in physiological responses after individuals left work, suggesting that potentially health-impairing reactions to jobs that have high demands and low controllability might carry over to home settings and thus pose a high risk of long-term health impairment.

Also as expected, some events that were not especially relevant for the nurses as a whole, like having a sick family member or friend and concerns about previous poor attendance, nonetheless emerged as being relevant to the absence behavior of certain individuals. Finally, some events were consistently related to the nurses' expressed desire to be absent but not to actual absences.

When the school opened in 1971, the existing 86 medical schools all offered similar programs: two years of basic science training in lecture halls and laboratories, followed by two years of direct contact with patients in clinical settings. In the new school, students were taught didactically only during the first year. During the second year, each student was assigned to a community physician who acted as an advisor and who discussed with students those patients afflicted with the diseases the student was currently studying. Available evidence indicated that the school's innovative curriculum was favorably received by the students and that they performed as well as their peers on standardized year-end exams. The author found the case of this medical school to be of particular interest from an organizational viewpoint in that: (1) the early development of the school was shaped by the first dean's entrepreneurial activity, ambitions, visions, strengths, and weaknesses; (2) the uncertainty resulting from the school's novelty forced individuals to assume new roles and face unclear performance criteria; and (3) the transition of an innovative school to an institutionalized one was problematic because it modified the decision-making process. The author suggests that those things which lead to an organization's success during its early years are not the same as those that lead to longer-run success. He says that a new organization creates new norms, values, and procedures whereas the elements of an existing organization interact within an established culture. He concludes that organizational birth is a phenomenon about which relatively little is known, but which may be an important constraint on later development. A comparative analysis of the birth, life, and death of organization is advocated.",,"Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Schools, Medical; article; curriculum; education; medical school; organization and management"

This study investigates how expectations about self-checkout affects perceptions of waiting in terms of social injustice, unattractiveness, and undistraction as well as customer satisfaction when retailers change checkout operations through installing self-service technologies. The results from an online survey in Japan revealed that social injustice has a stronger negative impact on satisfaction when customers have low expectations for self-checkout.

Classifying practices into respective taxa can advance theory building and stimulate the testing of substantive hypotheses. Toward this end, we develop a taxonomy which conceptually rests on the human immune system and its attempts to protect the human body from pathogens. We deploy a metaphorical transfer process and postulate that SCS practices can be classified into four classes based on their intent: prevention, detection, reaction, and restoration. We then discuss the implications of the taxonomy and assert that our taxonomy can be exploited to a variety of domains in the realm of risk management. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","classification; food safety; food supply chain; practices; risk; risk management; supply chain security; taxonomy",""

Our findings confirm that the smaller the cultural distance between a host market and the United States the stronger the brand perceptions of the two iconic United States brands. In particular, South African and Indian consumers, where the cultural distance indexes are smaller compared with the United States, perceived McDonald's more positively compared with consumers in Brazil, Russia, and China.

It consists of four main functions—product, information, logistics, and transaction—and ten subfunctions. Applying this framework reveals that business-to-consumer e-marketplaces are infomediaries, completely fulfilling only information functions. All other functions must be managed by the sellers themselves or outsourced to other intermediaries such as logistics companies or banks. A case study of Amazon and Walmart Marketplace is presented to further illustrate the PILT framework.

Second, analyses of data of 193 sales departments indicated that customer orientation in sales departments promotes innovation by facilitating task conflict and preventing process conflict. Third, analyses of survey research of 199 sales departments indicated that behavior-based and knowledge-based management control systems are effective at promoting learning and innovation. Finally, a case study of Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim (NBI) revealed several ways to facilitate learning using a behavior-based sales management control system.

This article presents research into Australian franchisor firms that went into a form of bankruptcy protection known in Australia as “voluntary administration.” The research was driven by the commonality and divergence of the interests of franchisors and franchisees. The article provides an insight into franchisor failure and its effect on franchisees. It presents the substantial literature survey that was used to frame questions for franchisor administrators to understand issues associated with franchisors in administration. The limited data demonstrate diversity in the treatment of franchisees during the franchisor's administration. In Australia, franchisees remain a captive, financially committed counterparty during insolvency and potentially deliver a great financial benefit to the franchisor's creditors. The article concludes that administration of franchisors does not take into account the distinct relationship between franchisors and their franchisees and provides policy recommendations to address this matter. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","Australia; bankruptcy; business format franchising; franchise business processes; franchisee insolvency; franchisor failure; franchisor insolvency",""

Accordingly, this manuscript makes a unique contribution by partially addressing this gap in the literature by tracing the transition of personal selling through sales management to a prominent role in strategic marketing channel management. From a historical vantage point this article discusses the genesis and evolution of personal selling and sales management, which include the Pioneer Era (1750–1780), Era of Scarcity (1780–1820), Era of Production (1820–1870), Era of Innovation and Growth (1870–1914), Era of Scientific Management (1880–1920), Era of the Roaring Twenties (1920–1929), Era of World Turmoil (1929–1945), Era of Postwar Recovery and Prosperity (1945–1977), Era of Personal Computers, Empowerment of Salespeople, Changing Roles of Sales Managers (1977–2000), and the Era of Customer Relationships and Top-Level Sales Managers As Strategic Channel Managers (2000–Present). With reference to the current era, the article discusses the role salespeople in general and senior- to top-level sales managers in particular play in fostering long-term relationships with a firm’s marketing channel members by moving from transactional selling and relationship selling to the current greater emphasis on forging symbiotic and synergistic strategic partnerships/alliances with reseller intermediaries. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Personal selling and sales management history; relationship selling; strategic alliances/partnerships; strategic marketing channel management; transactional selling",""

We investigate how these effects vary across highly complex utilitarian and hedonic products.

Using disparate and archaic sources, this article synthesizes historical accounts and archival information to show that entrepreneurs have always practiced relational marketing from prehistoric eras and continued to do so throughout pre-industrial and post-industrial eras when the bulk of the literature claims that the scale of modern production rendered relational marketing ineffective and nearly obsolete. In doing so, we add to the virtually non-existent literature documenting entrepreneurial marketing in the early, pre-industrial history of commerce. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Business ethics; business history; economic anthropology; Industrial Revolution; marketing channels; relational marketing; relationship marketing era; sales era",""

This article extends the channel literature to a broader domain and develops a consumer-based theoretical framework reflecting factors that influence consumer perception of and reaction to channel strategies and decisions. The authors conceptualize that consumers’ perceived channel value is a critical factor in determining their loyalty behavior. Seven important channel features are identified that would positively influence the perceived channel value.

Retailers, given their low margins of operations, are motivated to seek every opportunity to obtain extra incentives from suppliers to boost their profits. They often hire third-party post-auditors to scrub through all their transactions and “deal sheets” or supplier agreements to search for potential unclaimed trade promotion dollars promised by suppliers in prior years. Third party auditors have an incentive to also make dubious claims as they are compensated on contingency fees of a percent of claims recovered. Such practices lead to acrimony between retailers and suppliers. They often have differing viewpoints and opinions about the contextual terms of the trade promotion deals itself leading to an opinion “chasm” that is sometimes difficult to bridge. The resulting tension among retailers and suppliers, along with regulatory compliance under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, and prevailing questions on the role and practices of post-auditors, motivated this study. Conducted over a 24-month period with extensive collaboration and research discussions between the study team and responsible managers from leading US retail and manufacturing companies. The distinctive mix of academic rigor and practitioner relevance was the hallmark of this study that involved three retail summits conducted with industry participants to discuss the research method and its resultant findings. Evidence suggests that transactional discrepancies will continue to happen, despite technological advances, because of large volume of transactions and multiplicity of complex trade promotion methods in vogue in the retail world. So, as long as there are claim opportunities, post-audit recovery practices will continue, confounding the darker side of the retailer–supplier relationship. Through a multi-stage and multi-level study, and data from a variety of sources, we identify best practices in post-audit recovery and suggest ways to reduce associated conflict and improve relationship satisfaction. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Buyer-seller relationship; channel conflict; deductions management; post-audit recovery; recovery audit; relationship satisfaction; relationship trust; trade promotions",""

These bilateral idiosyncratic investments serve as mutual hostages and signal commitment to the relationship, yet they are susceptible to expropriation. Drawing on research in social psychology and transaction cost economics, we argue that the nature of the bilateral idiosyncratic investments influences perceptions of a supplier's opportunism that in turn influences retailer opportunism and relationship outcomes. Data collected from 120 Norwegian managers of consumer electronics retail stores provide an assessment of the proposed model. The results indicate that the total and asymmetrical nature of the bilateral idiosyncratic investments influence perceptions of supplier opportunism and these perceptions, in turn, influence the retailer's opportunism and commitment to the relationship.

Retailers understand that consumers may seek information in one channel and complete their purchases in another channel. Researchers have labeled this retailing concept as “showrooming.” Showrooming suggests that retail salespeople may provide information, services, and suggestions that generate retail sales revenues at another time in another place. While they likely mediate exchange value, retail salespersons’ contributions to building sales revenues and customer relationships may be difficult to measure. The degree of value engendered in the retail sales role set is associated with product and transaction complexity. As such, retail sales functions may range from highly transactional (i.e., facilitating a transaction) to highly relational (i.e., building retail patronage).

The model was empirically tested by structural equation modeling with a dataset from Japanese automobile dealers, who have employed highly advanced mass customization systems and are world leaders in this practice. The results show that two environmental factors, uncertainty and innovation, affect firms’ expectations of their customers’ intentions to purchase mass-customized products and, in turn, firms’ decisions regarding postponing product differentiation in favor of mass customization.

Our analysis suggests that asymmetrical cost effects are likely for franchisors and franchisees. For franchisors, relative to single-unit franchising (SUF), multi-unit franchising (MUF) should yield lower costs from scale economies and monitoring, higher costs from bargaining power, and similar costs from learning economies and standardization. For franchisees, lower costs for MUF are indicated from scale economies and standardization but not for monitoring.

This paper addresses franchising development in Vietnam, a developing country. It considers strategies to bridge the gap between Vietnamese franchise practice and franchising best practice. It proposes that in Vietnam's current state of development, the product and trade name model may be the appropriate starting point with a move to the business format model only when, and in places where, the socio-cultural, commercial, and economic factors and the legal environment can accommodate more sophisticated business format franchise arrangements. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","developing countries; environmental factors; franchise development; franchise models; Vietnam",""

The earliest writings in marketing charted the physical movement of goods through the distribution system. There existed misconceptions of channel members, compelling justification of their role sets in creating efficiencies and utilities that delivered value to customers. Bartels (1988) noted that attributions of intermediaries as ""parasitic"" and vendors as ""ruthless"" coincided with widespread fallacies about marketing (p. 29). Cast against this societal mistrust, the Journal of Marketing Channels debuted. The first issue departed from the purely economic functionality that subjugated a broadened theoretical foundation for understanding distribution, embracing Alderson's call for inter-disciplinary approaches. The present effort discusses Habermas' critical social theory (CST).

In contrast to previous studies, this investigation examines a period of 21 years, including three distinct periods of economic expansion and two periods of economic contraction. The most significant finding of this exploratory study is that generalist-type franchise systems (i.e., those that offer a broad range of automotive services) tend to have greater longevity than specialists during periods of economic recession.

However, satisfaction levels can vary significantly across cultures when customers experience mixed quality services, that is, services with a mixture of high and low quality service attributes. Based on two studies, we find that Westerners (e.g., European Americans) react more negatively than East Asians (e.g., Chinese) toward mixed quality online services. Our findings show that due to differences in thinking style, Westerners (analytic thinkers) are more likely to focus on negative service attributes than East Asians (holistic thinkers), who tend to consider the amalgam of high and low quality service attributes as an integrated whole when forming their overall perceptions and levels of satisfaction. Moreover, the results suggest that for online retailers marketing across cultures, providing superior quality on each individual service attribute may be more important to achieving satisfaction for customers from Western rather than Eastern cultures. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","China; e-commerce; service quality; thinking style; United States",""

They represent a profit center for large retailers who exercise market power and represent a cost center for large manufacturers. Many manufacturers have alleged that they are “held captive” to procure prime retail space. Despite the influx of retailers and manufacturers based in the United States, the deployment of slotting allowances in China is less prevalent but does pervade the grocery sector. The purpose of this study is therefore to explore the attitudes of large Western manufacturers and retailers toward the issue of slotting allowances in the China grocery market through a qualitative study. In-depth interviews were conducted with key decision-makers from Coca-Cola (manufacturer) and Carrefour (retail hypermarket) to critically explore their attitudes toward slotting allowances. The interviews reveal principal differences grounded in cultural norms. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carrefour; China; Coca-Cola; cultural dimensions; guanxi; retailing; slotting allowances",""

As the debate over this practice continues, little attention is being paid to the role of salespeople in slotting allowance negotiations. The current study addresses this shortcoming in the literature by investigating the delegation of slotting allowance authority to salespeople in the context of manufacturer-retailer negotiations. A structural model is tested using data collected from retail managers. The analysis indicates that delegating slotting allowance authority to salespeople positively impacts the salesperson’s influence over customer decisions and enhances selling performance. The results also suggest that a salesperson’s trustworthiness increases his or her influence and performance with the customer. Overall, the findings suggest that manufacturers are likely to benefit from delegating slotting allowance authority to the sales force and training salespeople to convey this authority during retail negotiations. The study concludes with a discussion of implications for theory and practice. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Channel negotiations; Delegating salesperson authority; Salesperson influence; Salesperson performance; Salesperson trustworthiness; Slotting allowances; United States",""

Its meaning is interpreted differently depending on discipline, jurisdiction, and the particular application or structure of the franchise arrangement in any given context. This article surveys the elements of statutory definitions of franchising in the law of jurisdictions that have enacted franchise-specific legislation, and it interprets these elements with a focus on the ways in which they reflect the quality of franchisee reliance upon and vulnerability to the franchisor's business, system, management, policies, and operations. This dependency of a franchisee's business upon that of its franchisor is idiosyncratic to franchising, and, along with related issues of alignment of interests, is well documented in the academic literature. Existing statutory definitions, however, may fail to adequately capture this essential element, with the risk that legislation may fall short of accurately and fully addressing this aspect of the relationship. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","contractual relationship; dependency; franchising; meaning; power; statutory definition",""

We explore effects of three system characteristics-relationalism, dependence, and tenure on initiator assistance. System characteristics and assistance are hypothesized to affect outcomes-project performance, satisfaction, and commitment to the relationship. We consider the target's task readiness an additional determinant of initiator assistance and performance. Using sample survey data from firms in the housewares industry, we find that initiator assistance stems from relationalism, not tenure. From the target's perspective, project performance derives from relationalism and tenure. Satisfaction is driven by relationalism, tenure, assistance, and performance.

However, much of the research in marketing focuses on the bright side of relationships and neglects its dark side. In this article we focus on one aspect of the dark side-the effects of the intent of a party to exit from a relationship. Research on dissolution has primarily examined it as an outcome variable. Thus, the question of how dissolution intent, once formed, affects subsequent behavior has not been given much attention. We investigate the consequences of dissolution intention, such as increasing opportunism and decreasing cooperation and the mediating effects of transaction-specific investments. The model is tested using a sample survey of newspaper agents in Korea. Results indicate that dissolution intention increases opportunism and negatively affects cooperation. Transaction-specific investments diminish the effect of dissolution intention on opportunism and cooperation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","channels; dissolution; opportunism; relationships",""

The theoretical model suggests that trust relationships and the centralization of merchandising authority promote the activeness of customized merchandising proposals.

Arguably, one of the more important changes that can take place in a franchise is a change in ownership. Although franchise agreements typically cover a 10- to 20-year period, not all franchisees maintain their ownership throughout the term of their agreement. Some franchisees sell their businesses, while a number of franchisees acquire additional outlets. The impact of ownership change in franchise systems is not well understood, and the question of what happens when franchises change ownership remains largely unanswered. This study examines change of ownership in franchise systems. Case studies of two franchisees are presented: One franchisee who acquired a second franchise, and another who sold her business two and one-half years after purchasing it. In both cases, positive outcomes were realized for both the current and the former franchisees. Increased sales under the new owners suggest that these changes in ownership also provided benefits to the franchisor.","Case study; Franchisees; Growth; Ownership change",""

Whereas both of these are critical and must have an interactive, synergistic effect, the in-store logistics force the retailer to control the total supply chain and the out-store logistics creates temptation for the suppliers and/or logistics firms to control the total supply chain. While the out-store logistics appear to play a major role in large scale retailing, in-store logistics are more critical for small scale retailers.

This study examines the relationship between the feeling of uncertainty attributed to competitive environment and opportunism in marketing channels. Using the data collected from managers responsible for distribution channel management, this study finds that while unfairness in competitive environment results in opportunism, severity of competitive environment does not. In fact, competitive severity results in a stronger sense of trust in channel members.

Originally developed and initiated in 1993, in response to the common need business organizations have for product liquidation outlets, this nontraditional form of distribution targets audiences contemplating the distribution of products, including manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and other entrepreneurs. The topic of distribution is considered to be one of four primary “marketing tools” referred to as the “marketing mix.” In addition to distribution, the other three components of the marketing mix are product, price, and promotion. The mass distribution of products via consignment auction liquidation outlets may be viewed as an additional channel of distribution. However, mass consignment auction liquidation on a national basis has not been adequately assessed or evaluated. There is little published about this type of product distribution. The effectiveness of the CALM Method utilized on a national basis and covering a 10-year time span is presented. Effectiveness was largely assessed through statistical observations of the effect of various independent variables on the dependent variable, “auction outlet profitability.” Independent variables include geographic location/region of each consignment auction outlet; population size of each consignment auction outlet’s community; merchandise type; consignment term, etc. The CALM Method yields the opportunity for profitable liquidation of mass quantities of merchandise on a national basis. This assessment/summative evaluation yields the opportunity for insight regarding the method’s actual effectiveness and adds to the limited amount of research found in this area of mass distribution. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

From time to time, frequent as well as rare catastrophes also disrupt supply chain operations. We collect and compile data from many sources and show that there has been a marked increase in both the frequency and economic losses from natural and man-made catastrophes. We find that business losses constitute a major percentage of the total losses caused by these catastrophes. The statistics suggest that for terrorist attacks, the vulnerability of U.S. business interests is much higher than others. Examination of the geographical and chronological distributions of catastrophes provides useful information for managers concerned about such disruptions. We develop a catastrophe classification framework that matches different types of catastrophes to a variety of infrastructural components of supply chains. The framework also connects a variety of mitigating strategies to appropriate catastrophe types. We identify factors that can be used to assess the vulnerability of a supply chain. They can also be useful to compare possible alternative decisions based on the vulnerability they may cause in the supply chain. To manage vulnerability in supply chains, we propose strategies that can be implemented by a company to decrease the possibility of occurrence, provide advance warning, and cope after a disturbance. We reveal potential benefits from mitigating strategies during normal times, which indicate that well-developed strategies can also result in better efficiency.

While the Europe-based network approach offers insights into network competition, it presents a rather broad concept that includes almost any kind of strategic action. The main obstacles are associated with the conceptualization of network context as borderless entities, and the absence of a dynamic integration between causal mechanism of business relationships and network context.

On the average, the charities in the sample had not used systematic processes when introducing Internet donation facilities. However, the organisations that had in fact employed systematic approaches reported that their systems achieved better performance than the remainder of the sample. A majority of the respondents stated that their charities had experienced beneficial spill-over effects between the implementation of online fundraising and the operations of alternative fundraising methods (direct mail for instance). However, fifteen per cent of the sample claimed that detrimental channel cannibalisation had occurred following the introduction of Internet fundraising, in that the new online system had taken revenues away from conventional donation channels. The incidence of cannibalisation did not appear to have been influenced by website design considerations. Levels of overall satisfaction with the performances of the sample charities' Internet fundraising facilities were mixed. Only a quarter of the respondents agreed strongly or very strongly that they were highly satisfied with their system. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A surprising finding, however, is that international systems exhibit lower levels of opportunism, in spite of greater geographic and cultural proximity. Interestingly, a number of firm characteristics (number of domestic units, number of franchised versus company-owned units, firm age, and experience with franchising) and relationship characteristics (flexibility, trust, behavioral transparency, and effectiveness) were not significant discriminators between domestic and international franchisors.

Phase II (1991-2000) witnessed diversification in terms of ownership structure and format of operation. Market mechanism gained the central position in attracting investments from various sources and opening chain stores was the most popular practice in business expansion. Phase III (2001-2005) featured the profound momentum for globalization.

In this paper, we test the benefit of using Kaufmann, Donthu and Brooks' (2000) multi-unit site selection model that incorporates the reality of delays in the opening of new stores as well as the recognition that local retail chains can face competition from many hard to identify sources. We use data from the actual introduction of a small set of stores in a major United States metropolitan market to estimate the potential for improvement over a pure sequential expansion strategy. When compared to the sequential strategy actually used by the retailer, we estimate that performance could have been improved by 15.5% if a model that anticipated the delays in opening the stores and competition from secondary sources would have been used. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The analysis of survey responses of 185 Taiwanese franchisees strongly confirms the validity of the four-cell matrix indicating significant differences between them. The results also yield a highly significant comparison between system quality permutations with franchisee performance variables and behavioral perceptions.

This measure was used as the dependent variable in a multinomial logit model with the independent variables being shopper dispositions, the contextual shopping situations, age, and household size. This study identified distinctive customer orientations that foreshadowed shoppers' buying a brand variant, buying another brand, and forgoing or postponing their purchase. A binary logit model then estimated the shoppers' orientations that motivated them to seek their preferred item from another store. It emerged that for most shoppers, their household size appeared to be a pressing variable that influenced the way they tackled the non-availability of their normal choice. Marketing literature postulates that large families invariably gravitate to larger pack sizes. Previous research also observes that brand loyalty is negatively correlated to household size. If their regular choice is not available, shoppers could, therefore, easily be driven to seek alternative brands. This study has identified that it would be useful for brand variants to offer shoppers sufficient consumption time till the products' use-by dates to encourage their purchase and prevent shoppers fromcrossing over to another brand or store. Central to the ample availability of consumption time is the capacity of channel members to support frequent deliveries of larger pack sizes in small lot quantities to the retail store. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

This paper presents a more expansive view of strategic choice for franchisors by presenting first-mover, platform, and conversion strategies as additional strategic approaches that may be utilized to meet the challenge of expanding into international markets. Propositions are advanced to first suggest which strategic approaches are most appropriate under varied foreign market conditions and then how these approaches should be linked to the three generic licensing options to create combination strategies based on franchisor experience/capabilities and similar/dissimilar markets. A contingency model of global franchising is presented, which depicts the above relationships and provides an overall framework that can assist franchisors in solving the foreign expansion and distribution question.

The exogenous market perspective holds that evaluating market conditions is central to defining promising outlet locations as there are direct economic effects on performance. The endogenous firm perspective and the social network approach together provide an inner strength perspective on interconnected firms; this perspective holds that access to resources offered at a certain spot determines site attractiveness, rather than location-specific market factors. Using a sample of 201 German franchisees, this study tests hypotheses that explore which perspective dominates location decisions in practice and clarify the relevance of the decisive criteria for outlet performance. Results show that location decisions rely on both perspectives, yet franchisee performance depends more on inner strength factors.

In this article, we assess the interaction of marketing channel members through the use of contracts and its impact on incentives, coordination costs, risk aversion, risk allocation, and risk management strategies. For this purpose we specify a 3-stage principal-agent supply chain model involving producers, wholesalers, retailers, and a futures market. We compare the situation with and without a futures market. The empirical results regarding the Dutch ware potato marketing channel during 1971 to 2003 reveal that as a result of increases in incentives to producers and wholesalers, the coordination costs of the marketing channel decreased significantly, both with and without futures trade. The coordination costs of the marketing channel in the case with a futures market appear to be lower than without futures, demonstrating the informational (i.e., price discovery) role of futures markets.","Agency theory; Coordination costs; Food marketing channels; Hedge ratio; Risk",""

The typology of intelligence includes the dimensions of cognitive, social, political, emotional, structural, intuition, experiential, creative, and network. We build our model by using intelligence dimensions from management, industrial organizational psychology, marketing and organizational behavior, and perspectives that include relational contracting norms, relationship marketing, networking, and communications. We propose that global supply chain managers need all nine bases to perform well in the global business arena. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Decision-making; Global supply chain management; Multiple IQs; Relational contracting; Relationship marketing; Supply chain managers",""

However, low prices offered by the processing plants since December of 2001 have fallen short of the breakeven costs for some farmers. Developing alternative marketing channels that offer higher prices to catfish producers have been suggested to help improve farmers' revenue by spreading price risks. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of alternative marketing channels and average size on the average price of farm-raised catfish. The results of this analysis suggest that catfish farmers can increase the average price received for live food-sized catfish by decreasing the percentage of fish marketed to processing plants and live haulers, while increasing the percentage of fish marketed to retail outlets in an average size range of 0.57 kg to 0.90 kg. This can be achieved with on-farm value-added processing. However, retail outlets are relatively limited and may not provide a solution to large-scale producers of the catfish farming industry. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Yet, in fact, wholesalers as an institutional type have for thousands of years been involved in what today we refer to as global marketing. Wholesalers of many types have performed numerous activities or functions that have always been necessary for connecting distant buyers and sellers so that transactions can be consummated across international boundaries. In fact, by performing many distribution tasks or functions, wholesaling intermediaries of all types create the channel flows that link buyers and sellers together on a global scale. These flows, of which there are eight (product, ownership, promotion, negotiation, financing, risking, ordering, and payment), do not automatically appear out of thin air. Rather, the eight flows are created and sustained by many types of organizations that perform all of the myriad distribution tasks needed to connect sellers and buyers. Wholesale distributive institutions of all kinds, from the traditional so-called full-function merchant wholesaler to the more narrowly focused wholesaling intermediaries such as freight forwarders and export desk jobbers, all make a contribution by creating and sustaining channel flows. In recent years, as these flows increasingly extend to an international or global level, wholesaling intermediaries will likely play an even larger role in global marketing.","Channel flows; Distribution tasks; Global marketing; Wholesalers",""

This paper seeks to provide an insight into the challenges franchised firms are likely to face and considers the implications of franchising for small businesses' growth. Given the relative paucity of research in the area, this study has utilised a case study approach in order to provide a rich description and insight into the experiences of six businesses which have tried to expand using franchising, three of which have successfully grown, and three of which have subsequently withdrawn from franchising. It appeared that many of the failed companies were not prepared for the differing nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. In addition, the findings suggest that for businesses to franchise successfully, recruitment of suitable franchisees is vital. However, in the early days of system development the ability to recruit may be impeded by the system's lack of perceived legitimacy. This is likely to be exacerbated in periods of relative economic prosperity, when all franchise systems appear to find it more difficult to recruit.

Researchers have suggested different ways to counter the bullwhip effect in the supply chain through factoring for safety stock, countering behavioral forecasting inefficiencies through coordination stock, and setting up a single view of the global supply chain with the aid of technology, to name a few. However, the lack of a well-defined and organized, process-driven approach in managing the demand and supply planning process leads to demand-supply imbalance. In this article we discuss the practices followed by the best-in-class organizations in managing the critical link between the marketing and operations departments in reducing demand risk. We conclude that through a process-driven approach, organizations could enhance efficiency of the outbound supply chain by interlinking the marketing and operations departments and at the same time meet the long-term strategic goals and maximize customer value. The scope of this article has been restricted to the outbound supply chain only.","Bullwhip effect; Consensus forecasting; Demand and supply planning; Supply chain management; Supply chain risks",""

Franchising as a method of business operation was introduced to China by the United States' fast food pioneers KFC and McDonald's in the late 1980s in an environment which was by then increasingly receptive to foreign investment and western concepts under Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms and open-door policies. A decade later, China's first rudimentary franchise law signaled the government's imprimatur on franchised distribution and led to its wide adoption by both public and private sector enterprises. Regulatory reforms pursuant to China's World Trade Organization accession in 2001 have liberated franchise sector entry for foreign franchisors and facilitated cross-border franchising.

The challenge then is to persuade consumers that there is an advantage to using e-commerce over the traditional telephone ordering system.

The difference between the groups lies in the role that different distributors' business characteristics play in the selection of overseas business partners. Our results suggest that firms, which are both strongly market oriented and long-term oriented are more likely to select overseas distributors who (1) have an important sales force, (2) have good knowledge about the Australian wine industry, arid (3) have a management culture and capabilities similar to the producer firm.

Stage one involved a mail survey of the population of Australian franchisors and results were compared with an earlier survey of the sector. The findings indicate that following the introduction of the Code there were fewer substantial disputes, greater resolution of disputes through mediation than litigation, fewer franchise agreement terminations, fewer transfers of existing agreements, and both the rate of growth of franchisors and franchise units had slowed. The second stage of the research used a multiple case study approach to determine the effect of the Code on franchising relationships.

A model is proposed that hypothesizes a central, mediating effect for trust between power constructs (power asymmetry, coercive and non-coercive application of power) and key behavioral and attitudi- nal relationship outcomes (conflict, cooperation and satisfaction). The model is tested on a large sample (N = 887) in a single channel where there is a variable, but generally asymmetric, power relationship between principal and agent, as exists in many franchise and agency channels. Trust was not affected directly by the level of power asymmetry, but rather the way power was used, either coercively or non-coercively raised or lowered trust. Trust was found to mediate the impact of the way power is used on the agent’s perception of cooperation, satisfaction, and conflict, emphasizing the pivotal role of trust in understanding the behavioral aspects of channel behavior. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Viewing the environment as a stock of resources diverts attention to environmental munificence and the channel member’s responses to pressure generated for the lack or availability of such critical resources. Applying the resource dependence perspective to the political economy framework, this study argues that in the Saudi Arabian food channel system that is characterized by unbalanced distribution of power skewed in favor of the supplier, the retailer access to a relatively munificent output market will mitigate the supplier’s power advantage that otherwise would be used to bureaucratize the channel, endanger the quality of the exchange relationship, and consequently the efficiency of the channel.

This paper reports the results of an empirical study on the effects of lateral electronic communications-i.e., the formation of virtual community among franchisees-on a strategic outcome that is important to franchisors, namely, franchisee compliance. The survey results indicate that communication frequency among franchisees increases with the existence of a lateral communication channel. Previous research suggests that electronic communication facilitates lateral communication by providing an asynchronous media choice, making communication on such channels more frequent because they are more convenient. Franchisee compliance, though expected to be higher among franchisees that had electronic communication channels available to them, was actually found to be lower. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Because they represent steps on the evolutionary path towards the “complete” supermarket they offer an alternative to the dominant food retail modernization route involving the transplantation of the supermarket model. The paper reports the findings of a study of these intermediate formats in Shanghai. We discuss the origins, structure and operation of these stores and evaluate their contribution to the food retail modernization process. Surprisingly, few of the operators of these stores were traditional food retailers. Most were state-owned companies and private entrepreneurs from outside the retail sector. Lack of managerial and financial resources and inexperience led many to open these formats rather than the “complete” supermarket. The weakness of this subsector means that the main vehicle for food retail modernization in Shanghai will continue to be the supermarket chains. But because of limitations on the chain's expansion, they may enter into franchising arrangements with the best among these intermediate supermarkets.

This process includes the activities from the time before a firm first considers using the Internet as a marketing channel until it is fully implemented. Based on data from a survey among 353 Danish manufacturers it is found that different factors are important in the implementation of different dimensions of Internet- based marketing channels. For instance top management support and knowledge of IT are the most important factors driving the implementation of the Internet for presentation of the firm, opening hours, and product information, whereas willingness to cannibalize and Internet market maturity are the most important factors driving the adoption of home pages for receiving orders. The data also indicates that the importance of the factors affecting the implementation of new channels may differ between the stages of implementation. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A firm may either supply the services itself, or it can supply them through an independent distribution network. Because of the importance of after-sales services both in establishing a firm’s competitive advantage and in sustaining profitability, the choice of organizational design would appear to be of significant strategic importance. In order to explore this association, a comparative empirical study was made of the after-sales networks of two firms supplying international markets- one directly and the other through a network. Although there were trade-offs in the two organizations, there was equal success in providing customer service, which would suggest that a structure for this purpose does not exist. Instead, it was observed that contact near customer usage and devolved decision making were important in servicesuccess. Integrative devices, concerning both culture and knowledge, seemed to play a further role in maintaining these firms’ competitive edge. In interpreting these results, network and temporary concepts were useful in describing processes of each organization. It was noted that the distribution channels for services were different from product distribution in both cases, which undoubtedly is of strategic importance in managing these operations. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This places a premium on the identification and use of effective channel strategies for motivating channel partners as well as the capacity of the channel captain to provide leadership as a means of attaining a differential advantage. Thus, channel leadership style has become a critical issue in the administration of distribution channels. Despite the importance of motivating channel partners, there is a paucity of research on this construct. To augment the existing knowledge on channel partner motivation-a fundamental area of interorganizational man-agement-this study empirically examined the influence of participative, supportive, and directive leadership styles on channel partner motivation. Moreover, the relationship between channel partner motivation and channel partner performance is also investigated. The linkages among the constructs were empirically tested on data drawn from a sample of distributive institutions for new automobiles.

Job satisfaction, its antecedents and outcomes have been a popular topic in organizational studies whereas very few investigations have focused on entrepreneurial satisfaction. This is rather surprising since satisfaction has been emphasized as a fundamental measure for individual entrepreneurs (Cooper & Artz 1993). Especially in franchising, satisfaction is a key concept in understanding channel member behavior (Robicheaux & El-Ansary 1975-1976). A six-page questionnaire was mailed to 815 franchisees representing thirty-six retail, service, restaurant, café and fast food franchises. This nationwide sample represented more than forty percent of the total amount of franchisors and over half of all franchisees in Finland. A response rate of forty-two percent (n = 339) was obtained after two mailings and a reminder post card. Subsequently, the data were enlarged and non-response bias was investigated by conducting 143 phone interviews. After a careful examination of the data sets, no significant bias was discovered. Consequently, data sets were combined (n = 482). The final response rate was nearly sixty percent. On the basis of past literature, two single item measures and a set of multiple item measures for quantifying satisfaction were developed. Single item variables measured franchisees’ overall satisfaction. Four multiple item scales pertaining to franchise owners’ business domains and one multiple measure tapping to franchisees’ business environment were created by employing a principal component analysis. Both reliability and validity of the measures were evaluated. Eight hypotheses were tested, of which seven hypotheses were empirically supported. The statistical methods included t-tests and a multiple regression analysis and a discriminant analysis. Franchisees were found to be fairly satisfied with their businesses. This conclusion was supported by the scores of the particular satisfaction. Moreover, franchisees were committed to their franchises. Particular satisfaction components and post-engagement intention explained nearly forty-five percent of the total variance of franchisees’ overall satisfaction. Satisfaction and post-engagement intention predicted franchisees’ inclination to continue the operation. Finally, the study presents implications for both franchisors and franchisees as well as propositions for future research. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For companies challenged by a more and more dynamic business environment with heavier market segmentation, additional marketing channels, increasing globalisation on supplier and customer side, and high pressure on profit margins, the result from this is competitive weakness. The purpose of this article is to switch focus from operational effectiveness and strategic positioning as static success concepts on how to improve industrial distribution, to dynamic challenges of how to continuously manage the interaction between marketing strategies and operations (e.g., logistics) under the influence of a dynamic business environment. From theories in market strategies, logistics, flexibility, and marketing channels together with empirical experience from a best practice case study, we are introducing a model for dynamic effectiveness, describing the different characteristics of a company and what to focus on in order to become more dynamic. In order to constantly move to new market positions, and at the same time, restructure logistics and improve operational effectiveness, we have identified the dynamic capabilities of an organisation to be the key to success in industrial distribution. We define dynamic effectiveness as ""how fast-and-well a company can go from one strategic positioning and productivity frontier to another."" It tells that a frequent interaction between new strategic moves and actions for higher operational effectiveness is required to be in pace with the dynamic and changing business environment and to stay ahead of competition. As a part, of this, best, practice logistics performance makes it possible not only to be more agile to new strategic moves, but also to drive strategic development from a high operational level. This is achieved by designing logistics to be a resource base to support and be an enabler for new strategic moves on the market. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A model of the antecedents and performance consequences of channel incentives is conceptualized and tested on 314 marketing channel relationships using a structural equation modeling methodology. The findings support the conceptual model and suggest that unique facets of the channel relationship explain the type of incentive mechanism in use. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper investigates the difference between reseller satisfaction as expressed by the reseller and presumed reseller satisfaction as interpreted by the supplier. The authors formulate and empirically test six hypotheses to determine the influence of certain environmental variables on the difference in perceived satisfaction in a channel context. They find differences in perceived satisfaction levels across matched dyads composed of one reseller and the supplier’s representative responsible for that account. All of the environmental conditions tested were significant drivers of a difference in satisfaction. Specifically, sales representatives tend to underestimate reseller satisfaction when product line growth is increasing, when pricing policy is excellent, and when the channel configuration is indirect. Sales representatives overestimate reseller satisfaction when the reseller is larger, when there is more rivalry, and when the reseller perceives itself as more powerful. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

First, the article examines the proportions of expenditures recorded in Ad $ Summary, showing that the amounts expressed as percentage of sales, are quite variable both within and across franchise systems, in contrast to how the advertising budgets are established. Second, an analysis shows a substantial amount of variance in these expenditures can be attributed to the size, ownership, and contractual nature of the franchise system. Last, a within-system analysis of advertising expenditures and store performance indicates the majority of franchises systems are at a stage with few returns to advertising. While the proportion of franchisee ownership in franchised systems is associated with lower advertising expenditures, the results show that advertising within franchised chains are at a level of competitive parity with corporate restaurant chains and finds no evidence to support gains from increasing expenditures. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

But the organizational design of franchised chains has received less attention and dual distribution is still a misunderstood phenomenon in economic theory. What determines the proportion of company-owned units or franchised units within a chain? How does the level of the royalty rate interplay with the extent of company ownership? This paper supports the idea that dual distribution enables to mitigate contractual hazards due to information asymmetry and incomplete contracting. Thus a chain’s efficiency should strongly depend on the correct balance between royalty rates and the extent of company ownership. The interdependence between these two strategic decisions is analyzed by using a panel data set of 745 French franchisors. Econometric tests show that brand name value has a positive impact both on royalty rates and the proportion of company-owned units.

Closeness is put forward as a genuine variable in channel relationships, as part of the processes that take place in marketing channel dyad interactions. Advances in theory of channel relationships are proposed by a deeper theoretical development of the concept “closeness of relationship” from a multidisciplinary approach by stressing its relevance and by proposing a definition of closeness of relationship. Several features and ideas about closeness are proposed, such as the link between closeness of relationship and type of marketing relationship. Content validity is assessed to distinguish closeness from related constructs before exploring and operationalizing such a concept.The relationship between closeness and trust is explored by proposing actions to increase trust and assessing it empirically. An exploratory research is performed in the Spanish computer sector, testing relationships between a set of closeness components and trust between channel members. Results show that there are two factors underlying the construct closeness: interdependence and communication. However, only communication variables are significantly related to trust.

The author presents a model of commitment in cross-national manufacturer-distributor relationships that extends the commitment-trust theory of relationship marketing by incorporating four constructs conceptualized to represent the influence of a firm’s current and prospective partners on the focal relationship: resource transferability-to partner; resource transferabil- ity-from partner; resource particularity-adaptation and resource particularity-consumption. Data collected from 143 U.S. manufacturers, 106 Mexican manufacturers, and 97 Mexican distributors show that the model generalizes across this national boundary. In particular, a similar influence of mutuality on trust and trust on commitment was observed for both manufacturers and distributors. The influence of resource transferability, particularity on the relationship, was also observed. The findings provide strong support for extending the commitment-trust theory to aid the study and management of cross-national channel relationships. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Consideration has been given to both academic and trade literature in developing a set of propositions that predict the likely adoption of multiple unit franchising strategies within the Australian context. These propositions explain multiple unit franchising in terms of the franchisor (growth, firm characteristics, contiguity, strategy, agency cost effects and corporate structure), the franchisee (experience and involvement at the store level), and the franchisor/fran-chisee relationship (intra-firm conflict). Both the model and propositions will be empirically tested in the near future. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The transaction cost perspective has focused on the transaction cost aspects of the vertical integration decision. This perspective recommends that firms should integrate when integration is the least cost option. The strategic perspective, however, claims to take a more comprehensive approach to the problem by considering the strategic objective of the firm, its bargaining power over the distributors, competitive pressures, and the life cycle phase of the industry. This paper attempts to incorporate the transaction cost and the strategic perspectives into a unified framework developed toward a more complete explanation of the underlying phenomenon. The framework was tested by examining the distribution channel choices of electronic component manufacturing firms. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that the strategic perspective does a better job of explaining vertical integration than the transaction cost perspective. The strategic objectives of the firm, its bargaining power over the distribution channel, competitive pressure, and certain aspects of the environment, emerged as the key factors affecting the vertical integration decisions. © 1998 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Specifically, this research investigates the relationship between the critical source of perceived environmental uncertainty (vertical vs. lateral) and the political processes of channel dyads. Political processes are defined as the dominant sentiments or relations of conflict and cooperation which characterize the negotiation process. It was found that uncertainty as perceived in the lateral environment (competitive sector) affected dyadic sentiments as hypothesized. Uncertainty as perceived in the vertical environment (input-output sectors) had no affect on the dominant sentiments of bargainers.

In January 1983, the Provision Suppliers Corporation (PSC), a wholessaling organization which supplies a wide range of products to provision shops in Singapore, announced the opening of a chain of 49 retail outlets under the common name of Econ Minimarts. By the end of 1987, the chain had grown to 129 outlets. The turnover of its members had, on an average, increased three-fold, with significant improvements in profitability and productivity. The concept had not only succeeded in improving the performance of its members but had also contributed a great deal to the rapid growth of the PSC. The paper examines the Econ Minimart concept and the marketing strategy underlying the phenomenal success of this innovation to upgrade conventional retailing. Problems and applicability to other developing coutries are also analysed. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

After raising several related research questions about network structure and product matching, this paper reviews some conceptual foundations of the network approach. In particular, the paper reviews and develops the distinction between network positions and distribution functions. It then assesses the functions performed within channel network structures in several published case studies. Some of these network structures exhibit low densities and closely resemble rather conventional vertical supply systems. It appears, though, that such more vertical networks perform a speculative matching function for product assortments when supply and demand are heterogeneous and volatile. Under more rigid and stable conditions, vertical networks may engage in product customisation to postpone product form. Horizontal networks (when they exist), may facilitate product standardisation and thus may contribute to beneficial diversities in supply. © 1997 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It is estimated that the retail turnover currently is costing the industry $7.7 billion. If the current trends continue in constant dollars, this figure will be $9.2 billion in the year 2010. In current dollars this estimate will go up to $16.02 billion. Good human resource management can reduce this amount significantly. Despite its importance, retail human resource management remains a largely neglected area. Building on a basic model of the human resource management process, this paper provides a brief review of key personnel issues, followed by a suggested research agenda. It is maintained that human resource management in the retailing sector has many major gaps. Eliminating these gaps by improving the overall human resource management activity in retailing will yield total quality management (TQM) in retailing and will enhance the retail competitive advantage.

The study takes the theories and findings about the relationship in advanced country domestic situations to see if they apply to a cross-country situation involving manufacturers from advanced countries and agents in a developing country. The study examines the extent of the manufacturer control over the dealer, the sources of that control and how each of these affect the level of conflict between the manufacturer and the dealer, and the dealer satisfaction, all from the dealer’s perspective. Based on the literature, hypotheses were formulated and constructs developed using a questionnaire to which a relatively large sample of the dealers responded. Appropriate statistical tests of reliability and validity were conducted and thereafter simple Pearson correlations were calculated to test the hypotheses. Unlike in most advanced country studies, manufacturers were found to practice little control over their agents, nor was control found to be associated with the use of coercive and non-coercive measures by the manufacturers. But other facets of the relationship were found to be generally similar to other studies. Conflict was found to relate positively to the use of coercive measures by the manufacturer. Dealer satisfaction was found to relate positively to the use of non-coercive measures and negatively to the level of conflict and the use of coercive measures. The study concludes that the stick and carrot philosophy that may work in the West, does not work in the Middle East, just as others have surmised. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, the pace of cross-border investments by retail companies has been increasing in recent years. This trend has been particularly visible in Europe, as a consequence of the completion of the common market (project 1992). The author considers the case of direct foreign investment (DFI) by retail companies, focusing on their motives and means, and reviews the evidence available with respect to Europe. While there are a number of recent articles which investigate the existing patterns of DFI by retail companies, not much has been done in trying to analyse this evidence using the well established concepts developed by industrial organization literature. The first aim of the article is to review these concepts and see if, and to what extent, they can be useful to understand the patterns of DFI in retailing. Since the main reason for investing abroad lies in some form of innovation advantage, the nature of retail innovation, both process and product innovation, is considered, stressing its organizational nature. On this basis, a typology of motives for DFI by retail companies is obtained. DFI by retailers within the European Community is then considered and an attempt is made to use the descriptive model developed in the previous sections to interpret this evidence. © 1992 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A methodological response is proposed that draws on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to form the basis of a more nuanced conception of the entrepreneur.,,Contextualization; Conversation analysis; Entrepreneurial process; Ethnomethodology; Small firm

The categories that structure the market provide potential entrants with a neat map to interpret the target environment. However, the incumbents who recombine categories to hedge and innovate incessantly alter this ideal map of the market. The greater the alteration and the more complex the interpretation of the environment becomes, the less committed to action potential entrants will be. We introduce the extent and the mode of category recombination as two mechanisms that elicit the market uncertainty conducive to entrepreneurial inertia, here captured by a decrease in the observed number of entries into a market category. We further show how entrepreneurial inertia is moderated by the status of that category. Preliminary evidence from the market for electronic music analyzed along three decades supports our arguments.",,Computer music; Signaling; Action potentials; Electronic music; Market uncertainty; Commerce

Specifically, we conceptualize that temporal ambidexterity, a firm's mega-capability to deliberately and dynamically orchestrate its short-term and long-term pursuits, serves as a key enabler for the firm to thrive in emerging markets. We explain that emerging markets serve as a unique context that provides firms with a large array of opportunities, with some more future oriented, because much needed institutional and industry support to materialize these opportunities is lacking. Thus firms that are temporally ambidextrous will prosper over time and enjoy greater performance improvement. We operationalize temporal ambidexterity as a multidimensional construct, specified by the simultaneity, intensity, and symmetry (or the S-I-S criteria) of firms' pursuits of short-term stability and long-term growth. We hypothesize that firms cultivate temporal ambidexterity through developing appropriate organizational mechanisms (i.e., orientation, governance, and capabilities). Specifically, firms equipped with stronger orientation in analysis and adaptation, with stronger outcome-based top management governance and frontline employee autonomy delegation, and featured with stronger combinative capabilities and harmonious culture will be more temporally ambidextrous.",,Stability criteria; Combinative capabilities; Emerging market firms; Emerging markets; Large arrays; Long-term growths; Organizational mechanisms; Short term stability; Top management; Commerce

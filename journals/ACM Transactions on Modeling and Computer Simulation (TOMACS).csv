Fast Simulation of Packet Loss Rates in a Shared Buffer Communications Switch,1995,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029389492&doi=10.1145%2f226275.226277&partnerID=40&md5=399e76b9050b0b63ee5813d63bcb008a,"This article describes an efficient technique for estimating, via simulation, the probability of buffer overflows in a queueing model that arises in the analysis of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) commumcation switches. There are multiple streams of (autocorrelated) traffic feeding the switch that has a buffer of finite capacity. Each stream is designated as being of either high or low priority. When the queue length reaches a certain threshold, only high priority packets are admitted to the switch's buffer. The problem is to estimate the loss rate of high priority packets. An asymptotically optimal importance samphng approach is developed for this rare event simulation problem. In this approach, the importance sampling is done in two distinct phases. In the first phase, an importance sampling change of measure is used to bring the queue length up to the threshold at which low priority packets get rejected, In the second phase a different importance sampling change of measure is used to move the queue length from the threshold to the buffer capacity. © 1995, ACM.

This family of distributions has a natural, extensible parameterization so that all parameters have a meaningful interpretation; and the complete family is capable of accurately representing an unlimited variety of shapes for marginal distributions together with many common types of blvariate stochastic dependence. This approach to simulation input modeling is implemented in a Windows-based software system called Pmw-probabilistic Input Modeling Environment. Several examples illustrate the application of PRIME to subjective and data-driven estimation of bivariate distributions representing simulation inputs. © 1995, ACM.

Time-Segmentation Parallel Simulation of Networks of Queues with Loss or Communication Blocking,1995,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029387806&doi=10.1145%2f226275.226276&partnerID=40&md5=accbeed8b769b5dca59ac8076532b4f0,"This article is concerned with the efficient simulation of communication systems on parallel processors. In most of the article, we assume that the communication system under study can be modeled as a system of finite exponential queues with a general topology (in particular, the system need not be acyclic) and with either loss or communication blocking. We also assume that to estimate the performance measures of interest, it is necessary to generate long sample paths of the system. This is the case in both steady-state simulations and in long transient simulations. The approach involves applying each processor to simulate the entire system for a part of the time horizon of interest. We present theory guaranteeing the validity of the proposed approach, and numerical results proving the viability of the approach. The proof of the validity of the approach uses the fact that the queueing systems considered are continuous time Markov chains. An essential part of the argument is a proof that sample paths starting from different initial states eventually will couple (i.e., become identical), and a simple method for recognizing the time when a sample path has become independent of the original starting state (i.e., when all sample paths have coupled, regardless of the initial state). Finally, we discuss how our approach can be used for parallel trace-driven simulations of certain non-Markovian systems, and state the implications of this research for the initialization bias problem in steady-state simulation. © 1995, ACM.

Fast Simulation of Rare Events in Queueing and Reliability Models,1995,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976842451&doi=10.1145%2f203091.203094&partnerID=40&md5=ff47c3fb844592745481303cdf5c9bcd,"This paper surveys efficient techniques for estimating, via simulation, the probabilities of certain rare events in queueing and reliability models. The rare events of interest are long waiting times or buffer overflows in queueing systems, and system failure events in reliability models of highly dependable computing systems. The general approach to speeding up such simulations is to accelerate the occurrence of the rare events by using importance sampling. In importance sampling, the system is simulated using a new set of input probability distributions, and unbiased estimates are recovered by multiplying the simulation output by a likelihood ratio. Our focus is on describing asymptotically optimal importance sampling techniques. Using asymptotically optimal importance sampling, the number of samples required to get accurate estimates grows slowly compared to the rate at which the probability of the rare event approaches zero. In practice, this means that run lengths can be reduced by many orders of magnitude, compared to standard simulation. In certain cases, asymptotically optimal importance sampling results in estimates having bounded relative error. With bounded relative error, only a fixed number of samples are required to get accurate estimates, no matter how rare the event of interest is. The queueing systems studied include simple queues 1995, Jackson networks, discrete time queues with multiple autocorrelated arrival processes that arise in the analysis of Asynchronous Transfer Mode communications switches, and tree structured networks of such switches. Both Markovian and non-Markovian reliability models are treated. © 1995, ACM. All rights reserved.",importance sampling; queueing models; rare event; reliability models; variance reduction,

The rare event we consider corresponds to the network population reaching K before returning to ø, starting from ø, with K large. The estimator we study is based on interchanging the arrival rate and the smallest service rate and is therefore a generalization of the asymptotically optimal estimator for an M/M/1 queue. We examine its asymptotic performance for large K, showing that in certain parameter regions the estimator has an asymptotic efficiency property, but that in other regions it does not. The setting we consider is perhaps the simplest case of a rare-event simulation problem in which boundaries on the state space play a significant role. © 1995, ACM.

Efficient Monte-Carlo Simulation of a Product-Form Model for a Cellular System with Dynamic Resource Sharing,1995,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029227247&doi=10.1145%2f203091.203092&partnerID=40&md5=5ed745bca590d522ad8afd5adb3cb9e4,"There are many ways for users to share the radio spectrum allocated to a cell in a cellular phone system. We analyze a commonly proposed scheme wh ere the cell is divided into s sectors. Each sector has exclusive access to a certain number of channels. The remaining channels reside in a “common pool” and are shared among the sectors. The smallest unit of bandwidth that can be borrowed from the common pool is a “carrier,” which consists of c channels. When viewed as a multidimensional birth-death process, the steady-state distribution of the number of active channels in each sector has a “product form,” but because the state space is large and has a nonlinear boundary, direct calculation of quantities of interest is usually impractical. Ross and Wang have developed a Monte-Carlo technique that applies to our problem. We significantly improve the efficiency of their technique when applied to our problem by including certain 1995 control variates. The kinds of control variates we use can be applied to other loss systems as well. We also explore the effect of importance sampling for our system. In many cases the variance reduction achieved from the combination of importance sampling and control variates is far greater than from either method alone. For systems with blocking probabilities in the range 0.001 to 0.1, the variance of the system-blocking probability estimator can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. © 1995, ACM.

Effects of the Checkpoint Interval on Time and Space in Time Warp,1994,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028479130&doi=10.1145%2f189443.189444&partnerID=40&md5=1a2aad3ba0938318d1948d2ae6f49c58,"Optimistically synchronized parallel discrete-event simulation is based on the use of communicating sequential processes. Optimistic synchronization means that the processes proceed under the assumption that a synchronized execution schedule is fortuitous. Periodic checkpointing of the state of a process allows the process to roll back to an earlier state when synchronization errors are detected. This article examines the effects of varying the checkpoint interval on the execution time and memory space needed to perform a parallel simulation. The empirical results presented in this article were obtained from the simulation of closed stochastic queuing networks with several different topologies. Various intraprocessor process-scheduling algorithms and both lazy and aggressive cancellation strategies are considered. The empirical results are compared with analytical formulae predicting time-optimal checkpoint intervals. Two modes of operation, throttling and thrashing, have been noted and their effect examined. As the checkpoint interval is increased from one, there is a throttling effect among processes on the same processor, which improves performance. When the checkpoint interval is made too large, there is a thrashing effect caused by interaction between processes on different processors. It is shown that the time-optimal and space-optimal checkpoint intervals are not the same. Furthermore, a checkpoint interval that is too small affects space adversely more than time, whereas, a checkpoint interval that is too large affects time adversely more than space. © 1994, ACM.

Sequences of multiprecision pseudorandom numbers with very large period lengths are easily obtained by this new method. Digital inversive pseudorandom numbers satisfy statistical independence properties that are close to those of truly random numbers in the sense of asymptotic discrepancy.

The technique produces correctly interleaved address traces at run-time without disk access overhead or hardware support, allowing accurate simulation of the effects of a variety of architectural alternatives on programs. We have implemented a simulator based on this technique that offers substantial advantages in terms of reduced time and space overheads when compared to instruction-driven or trace-driven simulation techniques, without significant loss of accuracy. The article presents the results of several validation experiments used to quantify the accuracy and efficiency of the simulator for sequential, distributed, and shared-memory multiprocessors, and several parallel programs. These experiments show that prediction errors of less than 5 percent as compared to actual execution times, and overheads 6 to 30 times lower than those incurred by cycle-level simulation can be achieved. Predictions of relative performance metrics such as speedup tend to be even more accurate, making this technique especially attractive as an efficient method for comparative investigations of parallel system designs. © 1994, ACM.

We consider the feasibility of characterizing the overheads in conservative asynchronous simulations for such models, and we focus on a single communication structure 1994 and use both multicomputer programs and a queueing network as example applications. We find that the two most important issues for modeling are to understand how to estimate the time spent in sending null messages and how to account for the resulting overhead due to the input waiting rule. For null messages, we estimate both the number of messages sent as well as the cost per null message. The number of messages sent can often be estimated by the application, although irregularities in communication structure and edge effects in communication can affect these estimates. A constant is valid as a first-order approximation for the time per null message, but there are secondary factors that one may wish to model, such as load balancing and communication irregularities. The overhead attributable to the input waiting rule depends on several factors: communication structure, communication frequency, and processor load balancing. Irregularity in any of these dimensions can adversely affect the performance of the conservative strategy. It appears feasible to use the factors contributing to the overheads (i.e. context switch costs; null-message costs; percentage of looping due to the conservative synchronization) in a formal model to estimate the cost of the conservative overheads. © 1994, ACM.

We present two new techniques, one of which is based on the uniformization approach to simulation, and the other is a natural extension of the uniformization approach which we call exponential transformation. We show that under certain assumptions, these techniques have the bounded relative error property, i.e., the relative error of the simulation estimate remains bounded as components become more and more reliable, unlike standard simulation in which it tends to infinity. This implies that only a fixed number of observations are required to achieve a given relative error, no matter how rare the failure events are. © 1994, ACM.

On the other hand, if the simulation is to be completed within a reasonable time on the available computing resources, the number of cells in the simulation cannot be too large. To avoid the inaccuracy caused by the boundary effect for a PCS network simulation with limited computing resources, we propose wrapping the hexagonal mesh into a homogeneous graph (i.e., all nodes in the graph are topologically identical). We show that by using the wrapped hexagonal mesh, the inaccuracy of the output measures can be limited even though the number of cells in the simulation is small. We can thus obtain the same statistical accuracy while using significantly less computation power than required for a simulation without cell wrapping. © 1994, ACM.

We show that these sequences are essentially equivalent to linear congruential sequences with very large prime moduli. So, the AWC/SWB generators can be viewed as efficient ways of implementing such large linear congruential generators. As a consequence, the theoretical properties of such generators can be studied in the same way as for linear congruential generators, namely, via the spectral and lattice tests. We also show how the equivalence can be exploited to implement efficient jumping-ahead facilities for the AWC and SWB sequences. Our numerical examples illustrate the fact that AWC/SWB generators have extremely bad lattice structure in high dimensions. © 1993, ACM.

The ways of expressing models using LDE are discussed and compared with the ways of expressing models in simulation languages that support the event scheduling world view. The logic-based foundation provides fundamentally new insights. It asserts that events are logical propositions and the use of temporal operators is implicit in discrete event modeling and simulation languages. However, existing languages utilize only a few temporal operators in a restricted manner. The logic-based foundation enhances the ways of expressing models by using the operators implicit in existing languages in more general ways, new operators, and a parallel connective ||. The logic LDE and notions implicit in it form a new framework for understanding, defining, and studying logical combinations of events, variables, and time, and expressions containing a wide range of temporal operators including next, if, when, whenever, until, while, unless, and at. © 1994, ACM.

The goal of this research is to explore the size and accuracy of synthetic models of program allocation behavior. These models, if accurate enough, proved an attractive alternative to algorithm evaluation based on trace-driven simulation using actual traces. Based on our analysis, we conclude that even relatively simple synthetic models can effectively emulate the allocation behavior of well-behaved programs. However, even the most complex models we investigate can only roughly approximate the behavior of more complex programs and/or allocation policies. While synthetic models have been used to evaluate the performance of dynamic memory management algorithms, our results show that these models can be inaccurate and must be used with care. Given current trends toward more complex applications and allocation algorithms, the synthetic models we investigate are likely to be even less accurate in the future. © 1994, ACM.

The simplest form of this operation can be stated as follows: Generate a random variable X that is distributed over the integers 1,2,…,n such that P1993 = ai/(a1 +…+an), where ai's are fixed nonnegative numbers. The well-known “alias algorithm” is available to accomplish this task in O(1) time. A more difficult problem is to generate variates for X when the ai's are changing with time. We present three rejection-based algorithms for this task, and for each algorithm we characterize the performance in terms of acceptance probability and the expected effort to generate a variate. We show that, under fairly unrestrictive conditions, the long-run expected effort is O(1). Applications to Markovian queuing networks are discussed. We also compare the three algorithms with competing schemes appearing in the literature. © 1993, ACM.

A Characterization of the Simple Failure-Biasing Method for Simulations of Highly Reliable Markovian Systems,1994,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028344459&doi=10.1145%2f174619.174621&partnerID=40&md5=cf857c1f3d0501a43c3748d53ba3d824,"Simple failure biasing is an importance-sampling technique used to reduce the variance of estimates of performance measures and their gradients in simulations of highly reliable Markovian systems. Although simple failure biasing yields bounded relative error for the performance measure estimate when the system is balanced, it may not provide bounded relative error when the system is unbalanced. In this article, we provide a characterization of when the simple failure-biasing method produces estimators of a performance measure and its derivatives with bounded relative error. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the structure of the system for when the performance measure can be estimated with bounded relative error when using simple failure biasing. Furthermore, a similar condition for the derivative estimators is established. One interesting aspect of the conditions is that it shows that to obtain bounded relative error, not only the most likely paths to system failure must be examined but also some secondary paths leading to failure as well. We also show by example that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a derivative estimator do not imply those for the performance measure estimator; i.e., it is possible to estimate a derivative more efficiently than the performance measure when using simple failure biasing. © 1994, ACM.

Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in using parallel computers to speed up the simulation process. Before the parallel simulation approach is applied, it is important to understand the inherent parallelism of simulation applications. A simple technique called critical path analysis was proposed to study paralllelism of simulation applications. This paper describes three critical path analysis algorithms based on different event-scheduling 1992 policies. These algorithms are much simpler than a previous approach, where the events must be recorded in a trace and an extra pass is required to process the event trace. In our approach, the critical path analysis algorithms are integrated with the sequential simulation. At the end of the sequential simulation, the optimal parallel execution time is also computed. Livny proposed an algorithm similar to our approach (His, however, was designed for a specific language). Our algorithms can be integrated with sequential simulation programs written by users or be integrated with simulation languages. Another advantage of our algorithms over previous approaches is that ours can be used to study load balancing under different event-scheduling policies. Since our algorithms can be easily inserted in sequential simulation programs, critical path analysis can be applied to existing sequential programs without difficulty. The results can then be used to predict the performance of parallel simulation on similar applications. An example is given to show how useful information can be obtained from our algorithms. © 1992, ACM.

Massively Parallel and Distributed Simulation of a Class of Discrete Event Systems: A Different Perspective,1992,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976686613&doi=10.1145%2f146382.146389&partnerID=40&md5=94b67ec27604c1dcf8a75d2afbdde5eb,"In this paper we propose a new approach to parallel and distributed simulation of discrete event systems. Most parallel and distributed discrete event simulation algorithms are concerned with the simulation of one “large” discrete event system. In this case the computational intensity is due to the size and complexity of the simulated system. In contrast, we are interested in simulating a “large” number of “medium sized” systems. These are variants of a “nominal system” with different system parameter values or operation policies. The computational intensity in our case is due to the “large” number of simulated variants. Many simulation projects such as factor screening, performance modeling, and optimization require system performance evaluations at many parameter values; and others, we believe, could significantly benefit from them. There is considerable work in the literature on stochastic coupling of trajectories of parametric families of stochastic processes. Our approach can be viewed as the simulation of the coupled trajectories. We use a single clock mechanism that drives all trajectories simultaneously, hence the approach is called Single Clock Multiple System 1992 simulation. The single clock synchronizes all trajectories such that the “same” event occurs at the “same” time at all systems. This synchronization is the basis of our parallel and distributed algorithms. We focus on a particular implementation of the SCMS simulation using the so-called Standard Clock (SC) technique and also on the massively parallel implementation of the SC algorithms on the SIMD Connection Machine. Orders of magnitude of speedup is possible. Furthermore, the possibility of concurrent performance evaluation and comparison at many system parameter values offers new and significant opportunities for performance optimization. © 1992, ACM.

We confine our study to the Time Warp strategy and to systems where the durations of activities differ by several orders of magnitude 1992. We show that, for such systems, a large overhead due to rollbacks is encountered when spatial decomposition is used. Moreover, performance degrades as the difference increases between the rates of fast and slow events. Several initial experiments using queueing-network models were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of time scale decomposition in increasing the parallelism and reducing the overhead. These experiments were conducted on a distributed simulation testbed that was implemented on an 18-processor Multimax 320.

There is a need to unify terminology among these disciplines so that system modeling is formalized in a common framework. We present a perspective that serves to characterize simulation models in terms of their procedural versus declarative orientations since these two orientations are prevalent throughout most modeling disciplines that we have encountered. We used a sample dynamic system (e.g., two jug nroblem) found in artificial intelligence to highlight the connecting threads in system modeling within each discipline.

Our goal is to design an efficient memory management protocol which guarantees that the memory consumption of parallel simulation is of the same order as sequential simulation. 1991 First, we derive the relationships among the space complexities of sequential simulation, Chandy-Misra simulation [2], and Time Warp simulation [7]. We show that Chandy-Misra may consume more storage than sequential simulation, or vice versa. Then we show that Time Warp never consumes less memory than sequential simulation.

Although cancelback is considered to be complete solution for the storage management problem in Time Warp, some efficiency issues in implementing this algorithm must be considered.

Our evaluation is based on results for six realistic benchmark circuits, one of them being the R6000 microprocessor form MIPS. A quantitative evaluation of the concurrency exhibited by the CMB algorithm shows that an average of 42-196 element activations can be evaluated in parallel if arbitrarily many processors are available. One major factor limiting the parallel performance is the large number of deadlocks that occur. We present a classification of the types of deadlocks and describe them in terms of circuit structure. Using domain-specific knowledge, we propose and evaluate several methods for both reducing the number of deadlock occurences and for reducing the time spent on each occurence. Running on a 16-processor Encore Multimax we observe speedups of 6-9. While these self-relative speedups are larger than a parallel version of the traditional centralized-time event-driven algorithm, they come at the price of large overheads: significantly more complex element evaluations, extra element evaluations, and deadlock resolution time. These overheads overwhelm the advantages of using distributed time and consistently make the parallel performance of the CMB algorithm about three times slower than that of the traditional parallel event-driven algorithm. Our experience leads us to conclude that the distributed-time CMB algorithm does not present a viable alternative to the centralized-time event-driven algorithm in the domain of parallel digital logic simulation. © 1991, ACM.

Our interest is in the effects of that communication on synchronization. Using a model that idealizes the communication topology of a simulation, we consider the performance of various synchronization protocols by deriving upper and lower bounds on optimal performance, upper bounds on Time Warp's performance, and lower bounds on the performance of a new consevative protocol. Our analysis of Time Warp includes some of the overhead costs of state saving and rollback; the effects of propogating rollbacks are ignored. The analysis points out sufficient conditions for the conservitive protocol to outperform Time Warp.

The Hierarchical Simulation Language HSL: A Versatile Tool for Process-Oriented Simulation,1991,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976835756&doi=10.1145%2f116890.116911&partnerID=40&md5=5b655ce66121947577255f0b03a57f78,"The Hierarchical Simulation Language (HSL) was designed and developed to serve process-oriented simulation of discrete systems. It is interpreter-based and hence offers certain advantages, such as portability (hexdware independence) and modifiability (during program execution). An HSL model consists of two major sections. The Environment contains the specifications of the model and model control statements. The Simulator is a set of functions and processes that carry out the run-time activities of the model. Processes can be hierarchically refined or compressed, to whatever level of model detail desired. This paper describes the design characteristics and programming constructs of HSL. Several issues relevant to simulation languages in general and HSL in particular are then discussed. This is followed by an example HSL program presented to illustrate many of its features. © 1991, ACM.

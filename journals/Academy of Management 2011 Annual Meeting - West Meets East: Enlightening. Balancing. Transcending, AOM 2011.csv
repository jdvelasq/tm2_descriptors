We conducted an inductive, qualitative study of the Personal Development Elective, an innovative offering within the curriculum of an international MBA, which gives participants the opportunity to work with a psychotherapist during the course. Our findings suggest that the interplay between student's work in the PDE and their overall MBA experience fosters a process of personalization of management learning. This process allows management education to provide a solid foundation for leader development by transforming potentially regressive MBA experiences into rich material for participants' personal learning, experimentation, and growth.",Leader development; Personal development; Qualitative research,Research and development management; Students; Building foundations; Leader development; Life narratives; Management education; Personal development; Personalizations; Qualitative research; Qualitative study; Self awareness; Self management; Curricula

However, this paper shows how their work pertains to organisational strategy in two significant ways; they can be seen to be acting in ways which reflect and reiterate the organisational strategy of audience engagement. Audience engagement is increasingly used as a criterion upon which museums are awarded funding and as such, guides deploy an organisation's strategic aims through their moment-by-moment actions as they try to engage such audiences. They must overcome significant obstacles and challenges which unfold over the course of the tour in order to engage the audience. In such light, in keeping with the 'workplace studies' turn in Strategy-as-Practice (Samra-Fredericks, 2010), we can see them as strategic actors. Because of the lack of understanding of the work of guides, as well as an ongoing tendency to see strategy as something that only happens at the most senior of organisational levels, this paper has contributions to make in showing the truly skilled nature of the work of the guide and demonstrating how these skilled workers present an example of those engaged in a form of strategising whether they know it or not.",Conversation analysis; Strategy in practice; Tour guides,Conversation analysis; Fundings; Organizational levels; Organizational strategy; Simple++; Skilled workers; Strategy as practices; Strategy in practice; Tour guide; Workplace studies

Further, our results from matched-pair sample logistic regression models suggest that likelihood of a firm going bankrupt significantly increases as its bureaucratic costs increase. These results suggest that strategy implementation is perhaps more important than the corporate strategy a firm chooses, i.e., if a firm incurs bureaucratic costs that are higher than the synergistic benefits it derives from its diversification profile, its performance is likely to be suboptimal and prone to failure.",Bankruptcy; Bureaucratic costs; Diversification,Regression analysis; Bankruptcy; Bureaucratic costs; Corporate diversification; Corporate strategies; Cost-increases; Diversification; Logistic Regression modeling; Performance; Strategy implementations; Costs

In this article, we develop a more nuanced view of cognitive diversity/sharedness that distinguishes between cognitions held at implicit and explicit levels. The central argument is that because individuals posses independent implicit and explicit beliefs relating to a task, group members can hold similar explicit mental models while simultaneously possessing dissimilar implicit representations. Drawing on a contemporary dual system view of cognition, we theorize the consequences for group process and performance when: (i) members hold similar explicit mental models but dissimilar implicit beliefs (illusory concordance), and (ii) when members hold similar implicit beliefs but divergent explicit mental models (surface discordance). The analysis yields various propositions concerning the effects of illusory concordance and surface discordance on group decision making (i.e. alternative generation, group consensus, and commitment to choices) and group coordination (i.e. cohesion and interdependence in task performance). We discuss the implications of our analysis for measuring shared cognition in organizations and developing cognitive heterogeneity/ homogeneity in work groups and teams and outline potential directions for future research on the interaction among implicit and explicit cognition.",Dual-system; Group; Shared mental model,Alternative generation; Cognitive diversity; Dual-system; Group; Group coordination; Group Decision Making; Group members; Group process; Implicit representation; Mental model; Shared cognition; Shared mental model; Task performance; Workgroups

However, other than potentially biased results from self-report surveys we have little information as to whether or not job seekers would actually tradeoff salary and other utilitarian aspects of a job contract to work at firms with supposed greater reputational standing. In the present study we use a structured experimental approach to determine the extent to which the facets of reputation - corporate, social and workplace - drive job contract choice. We discover that while some aspects of corporate and workplace reputation matter marginally, MBA job seekers appear to put little value on social reputation. Even in the specific cases where we can discern individuals who do value social reputation, this is unrelated to their stated preferences revealed using standard survey methods. The implication is that firms seeking to entice potential executives should focus on utilitarian aspects of the employment contract that may impact their reputation rather than attempting to manipulate that reputation directly.",Job choice; Reputation; Social responsibility,Wages; Corporates; Experimental approaches; Job choice; Job seekers; Prospectives; Reputation; Social responsibilities; Stated preferences; Utilitarian aspects; Workplace practices; Surveys

When does technology enable organizational change? Convergent feature use and collective affordances,2011,"Academy of Management 2011 Annual Meeting - West Meets East: Enlightening. Balancing.

I draw a distinction between technological artifacts, technologies-in-use, and technologiesin- practice to illustrate why convergence in the use of a technological artifact's features may be an important pre-condition for organizational change. I then turn to longitudinal data collected on the use of a new computer simulation technology in two engineering groups at a major U.S. automaker that show how the technological artifact was used by engineers for more than three months during which time they enacted various idiosyncratic technologies-in-use but brought no change to their work behaviors and consultation (advice-seeking) networks. Initially, divergent uses of the technological artifact's material features by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate their work in ways that allowed them to structure their consultation networks differently. Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups converged on the use of a common set of the technological artifact's material features to enact a shared technology-in-practice. This convergence was necessary to turn the technology into a resource that could collectively alter the group's work and, consequently, the structure of its consultation network. From these findings, I induct the concept of a ""collective affordance"" to explain when technology use is likely to bring changes to people's work and communication networks and why even a widely used technological artifact may not ever bring about organizational change. I discuss implications of these findings for the emerging sociomaterial approach to technology and organizing.",Networks; Organizational change; Technology,Information systems; Information use; Affordances; Computer simulation technology; Condition; Longitudinal data; Material features; Network; Organizational change; Technology; Technology in use; Work behavior; Engineers

Drawing upon the case of Tajikistan, a developing post-Soviet country in Central Asia, and the market for of small-scale renewable energy technologies, this analysis investigates why some actors in a nascent market escape the effects of institutional voids, while others fail. Adopting a field perspective of markets, in my analysis of qualitative data from interviews with organizations from the entire field, I find that institutional voids are a source of ambiguity in the creation of new markets in Tajikistan. The results suggest that organizations that employ strategies lying in the same domain as the institutional voids are less likely to succeed in overcoming institutional voids. Meanwhile, the incorporation of different institutional elements and utilization of existing networks in the organizational field contributes to successful new market creation. This analysis also has important implications for managers of organizations pursuing creation of new markets in developing countries by providing insights into the organizational strategies that can take advantage of situations where market supporting institutions are weak or absent.",Institutional voids; New markets; Tajikistan,Commerce; Renewable energy resources; Condition; Institutional void; Market creation; Market-based strategies; New market; Poverty alleviation; Renewables; Small scale; Supporting structure; Tajikistan; Developing countries

Drawing on emotion, ego depletion and social exchange theories we developed a model of workplace loneliness in which we predicted that the withdrawal responses that result from being lonely will lead to increased employee surface acting and reduced affective commitment, thereby adversely influencing performance. We conducted a field study design with a lagged multi-rater design to test our hypotheses. The sample consisted of 672 employees and 114 supervisors across 143 work units in two organizations - a not-for-profit (public) organization, and a for-profit private company. Employees' loneliness was measured using both self-report and co-worker ratings. Employees' task and relational performance was measured via supervisor and work unit team member ratings. Results supported the hypothesized model where greater employee loneliness led to poorer task, team role and relational performance as mediated by lowered affective commitment and to a lesser extent increased surface acting.

In this study we examine an alternative form of impression management that overcomes this crucial limitation - impression management support (IM support) by others on behalf of the beneficiary actor. We examine the determinants and consequences of IM support in communications between CEOs and journalists, where CEOs of other firms provide positive statements about a focal CEO's leadership and strategy and/or external attributions for low performance at the focal CEO's firm. Drawing from social exchange theory, our theoretical perspective suggests how IM support may result from norms of reciprocity among corporate leaders. Three distinct reciprocity mechanisms are explored: i) direct reciprocity in which CEOs who have received IM support from another CEO in the past tend to reciprocate by providing their benefactor with similar such support when given the opportunity; ii) generalized reciprocity in which CEOs who received IM support in the past pay the support forward to another third-party CEO; iii) fairness-based selective giving, wherein CEOs reciprocate IM support to fellow CEOs who they believe have given similar support to other CEOs in the past. Our theoretical perspective also draws from the social psychological literature on persuasion to suggest why IM support for another CEO may have a more positive influence on the tenor of journalist coverage about the firm¡-s leadership than impression management by the CEO about his/her own leadership and strategy. We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes original survey data from a large sample of CEOs and journalists.",Corporate governance and business strategy; Upper echelon theory,Corporate governance and business strategies; Corporate leaders; Impression management; Influence tactics; Management support; Performance; Social exchange theory; Social influence; Upper echela theory; Upper echelons; Statistical tests

Drawing on organizational theories of sensemaking processes, the paper makes a theoretical contribution by re-framing the development, implementation and assessment of codes of conduct by describing them in terms of narrative process. Specifically, it builds on recent research in adjacent fields to frame ethical decision making as a socially-embedded, dynamic process, to differentiate narrative from logico-scientific sensemaking processes, and finally to identify a series of narrative forms that could serve as units of analysis for future research. The paper closes by exploring the possible implications of this theoretical contribution for future research as well as for organizational practice.",Codes of conduct; Ethical decision making; Narrative,Philosophical aspects; Research; Codes of conduct; Conceptual model; Dynamic process; Ethical decision making; Narrative; Organizational practices; Organizational theory; Sensemaking; Decision making

We develop a model that highlights the role of complexity, design orientation and experience in explaining hidden costs of offshoring. Specifically, we propose that hidden costs can be explained by the combination of increasing structural, operational and social complexity of offshoring activities. In addition, we suggest that firm orientation towards organizational design as part of an offshoring strategy and offshoring experience moderate the relationship between complexity and hidden costs negatively i.e. reduces the cost generating impact of complexity. We develop three hypotheses and test them on comprehensive data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN). In general, we find support for our hypotheses. A key result of our study is to suggest how hidden costs of offshoring can be mitigated through an explicit orientation towards improving organizational processes and structures as well as experience with offshoring.",Hidden costs; Offshoring; Organizational design,Off-shoring; Organizational designs; Organizational process; Research networks; Costs

This premise has fuelled several studies that have helped conceptualise supply chain integration and have thus advanced the understanding of its contribution in the development and implementation of operations strategy. Yet, the exact mechanisms that lead to the optimum supply chain integration configuration and subsequently to improved performance remain ambiguous. In this paper we use qualitative data from 70 manufacturers collected as part of the UK's manufacturing excellence awards, to argue that the configuration of supply chain integration is determined by a product's newness and the manufacturer's main process structure. We define four key supply chain configurations based on these dimensions: bespoke integration; ramp up integration; recurring integration; and coordinated integration. We discuss the implications of our findings and argue that future studies on supply chain integration should be more fine-grained to control for the variation in the configuration we report. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and directions for future research in supply chain integration.",Configurations; Manufacturing; Supply Chain Integration,Manufacture; Planning; Production control; Supply chains; Configuration; Integration configurations; Management of qualities; Manufacturing; Operation strategy; Performance; Plant level; Process structures; Production plans; Supply-chain integration; Integration

These hypotheses were examined and supported across five studies that incorporated multiple methods (correlational and experimental), settings (laboratory and online), and samples (students, workers, supervisors).

We argue that unwelcome obligations arising from trust's presumed principle of reciprocal obligation provides the explanatory mechanism for trust's true 'dark side'. From this we derive a model of trust development that highlights its benign and malign possibilities. We then present five familiar scenarios from organisational life to illustrate our model. The implications of our analysis extend many of the debates in the trust literature, on whether trust is a decision or an action; trust and control, and which aspect of the process should dominate parties' thinking.",Dark side; Social exchange; Trust,Dark side; Organisational; Social exchange; Trust; Trust and controls

Such firms are seldom able to invest in expensive innovation processes, which suggests that they may rely on other pathways to innovation. In this paper, we test arguments that ""bricolage,"" defined as making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities, provides a pathway to innovation for new firms. Our results suggest that variations in bricolage behaviors can provide an explanation of innovation under resource constraints by new firms.",Bricolage; Entrepreneurship; Innovation,Bricolage; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Innovations process; Resource Constraint

Building on theories of entrepreneurship and institutional perspectives on gender inequality in the labor market, this paper develops and tests an institutional theory of gender inequality in entrepreneurship. It is proposed that in countries where social policies effectively integrate women into traditional employment, women are less likely to be ""pushed"" into entrepreneurship as a result of work/family conflict. As a result, contexts with such policies are likely to have larger gender gaps in the odds of being engaged in entrepreneurial activity, but smaller gender gaps among established business owners in their motivation for starting a business, orientation toward growth and propensity to innovate. Results from a multilevel analysis of survey data from 24 countries largely support this contention: generous public funding for childcare is associated with larger gender gaps in the odds of being an entrepreneur, but smaller gender gaps in labor market-driven entrepreneurship and the use of new technology. A moderate amount of state-funded leave for mothers is also associated with smaller gender gaps in business size and in the odds of introducing a new product/service to the market.",Entrepreneurship; Gender; Policy,Commerce; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Industrialized countries; Institutional perspective; Institutional theory; Labour market; Social entrepreneurship; Social policy; Work-family conflict; Employment

Using propensity scoring, we estimate an average productivity drop of 20% during the year of a new product launch, and we find that this reduction in productivity remains relatively unchanged over the 7-year horizon, i.e., the manufacturers do not seem to improve. We do not find statistically significant differences among manufacturers with respect to the decrease in productivity. After controlling for the endogenous choice of launch plants, we identify several possible ways to mitigate this productivity decrease. Product flexibility in the body shop is found to mitigate more than a third of the productivity loss. Furthermore, a plant's previous experience with product launches and a plant's experience with the product platform are found to mitigate productivity losses even further. But while the positive impact of platform experience persists over time, the experience with launching other products in the same plant fades quickly. Our results suggest that launching products in flexible plants with appropriate platform experience can each save approximately $40 million per year per launch plant.",Product launches; Productivity; Regression analysis,Automotive industry; Manufacture; Productivity; % reductions; Body Shop; New product introductions; North American; Plant level; Plant productivity; Product flexibility; Product launch; Productivity loss; Statistically significant difference; Regression analysis

Human Resource Management (HRM) is claimed to play an important role in enhancing the performance of NPOs. Research suggests that the effects of HRM do not stem from single HR practices alone but from the configuration of interrelated HR practices within the organization's HR architecture. The nonprofit literature, however, investigates mainly into the relationship between single HR practices and their effects. Therefore, this paper aims to conceptualize about how and why HR practices are configured into an HR architecture in NPOs and how and why such HR architectures affect HR outcomes and organizational performance. Drawing on the theoretical perspectives of the strategic and the resource based approaches, a typology of ideal HR architectures in NPOs is introduced that considers the specific characteristics of NPOs. We advance a conceptual model that captures the relationship between the types of HR architectures and performance in NPOs. According to this model, theoretical propositions are developed that explain how strategic and HR orientations shape the HR architectures in NPOs. Furthermore, we propose that the relationship between these HR architectures and organizational performance is mediated by HR outcomes. As a result, this paper contributes to the nonprofit literature by providing a better understanding of the configuration of HR practices into HR architectures in NPOs and their effects.",Human resource management; Nonprofit organizations; Organizational performance,Human resource management; Conceptual model; Non profit organizations; Organizational performance; Architecture

This paper aims to examine the critiques of experiential learning from various perspectives and propose an integrated perspective of the theory. The study extends the theoretical insights of experiential learning by drawing relevance from other classical theories such as Vygotsky's (1978) cultural-historical theory, Leont'ev's (1981) activity theory, and Bakhtin's (1981) philosophy of language to elucidate the interplay of human interaction in social context that characterises experience. It also unravels the conceptual and practical inconsistencies of experiential learning based on emerging perspectives of learning. Further, the paper sheds light on how experiential learning, when viewed from a social constructionist perspective, can create optimal learning opportunities for management development.",Experiential learning; Management development; Social constructionism,Activity Theory; Classical theory; Cultural-historical; Experiential learning; Experiential learning theories; Management development; Management education; Organizational context; Social constructionism; Vygotsky

Moreover, transformational leadership is shown to inversely relate with follower CAOC. Taken together, we therefore demonstrate a mediated moderation model in which leaders' change-related cynicism cascades toward followers (by diminishing transformational leadership behavior) - but this indirect relationship is contingent on a leader's level of optimism. These results offer new insights into a key boundary condition for the role of CAOC, explicating why some leaders can maintain productive leadership behavior even when experiencing such cynicism and, by consequence, prevent their CAOC from spreading toward followers.",Cynicism about organizational change; Optimism; Transformational leadership,Cynicism about organizational change; Leadership behaviors; Optimism; Optimistics; Organizational change; Transformational leadership

Survey and interview data from the wholesale units' employees, collected at two points in time over 3.5 years, showed neither culture change nor service improvement. Hypotheses containing agentic explanations for the failed culture change were largely confirmed. Despite the fact that local change agents were not the initiators or owners of the intended change, the degree of satisfaction with the local change agents was found to explain most of the variance in culture and service climate scores. The results show, furthermore, the importance of training employees in the required new behavior if one is seriously intending to upgrade one's service quality and/or change the culture. Longitudinal socialcapital studies are recommended that focus on better headquarter collaboration with those who have detailed local service knowledge or insights into what service employees see as barriers and opportunities for service enhancements.

Results show that profits first decrease at low levels of relatedness and then increase at an increasingly higher level as corporate parents focus stronger on related within-industry diversification. Moreover, I find suggestive evidence that unrelated within-industry diversification has a negative effect on profits. In contrast to profits, both related and unrelated within-industry diversification increase a parent firm's sales-based market share in the following year. Finally, the study indicates that especially related diversifiers who exceed a distinct (minimum) level of related within-industry diversification are able to develop capabilities over time that lead to superior firm performance. Specifically, the complementary effects of high degrees of related within-industry diversification in combination with longer experience with related diversification enable corporate parents to outperform competition.",Capability development; Synergy creation; Within-industry diversification,Competition; Profitability; Sales; Capability development; Cross industry; Data sets; Dynamic development; Firm Performance; Low level; Market share; Operating units; Resource-based view; Synergy creation; Test performance; Within-industry diversification; Industry

We further argue that women, in seeking social support from socially similar others, are more likely than men to break through these constraints. We test these arguments using a unique dataset of organizational communication, consisting of millions of e-mails exchanged among thousands of employees in a large information technology firm. Consistent with this theory, results show a significant interaction between the communication rates between same-sex dyads and within business unit or within office dyads.

Whilst extensive research has focused on the ""dark side"" of individual reactions to an injustice (such as retaliation, sabotage, theft), there has been a paucity of research examining reactions that do not culminate in negative implications for the individual or the organization. This paper seeks to fill this gap by introducing a model of talking as a victim-centered intervention, and asserting propositions that explain the chain of events leading from the perception of a workplace injustice through to the outcomes that this phenomenon affords victims, assisting them with recovery from the effects of an injustice. Nesting the talking phenomenon within a theoretical paradigm that draws on dissonance theory and attachment theory respectively, it is argued that a workplace injustice triggers a state of cognitive and emotional dissonance which in turn activates the search for an attachment figure (a significant, supportive other) with whom social contact is sought, followed by talking.

Drawing on cognitive perspectives on social networks, we develop a sociocognitive model of brokerage to generate predictions about the existence of brokerage structures and broker's performance based on the variation in actors' knowledge of social ties within a triad. We propose that brokers are able to occupy and profit from their position because of a knowledge asymmetry in a brokerage triad. Using organizational and classroom data on cognitive networks, we show that the probability that an actor occupies and profits from a brokerage position increases with his or her accurate knowledge of a non-tie between two alters. Conversely, brokerage structures are more likely to exist and generate higher returns when alters do not know about a tie between a broker and another alter. We further examine the mechanisms that underlie knowledge asymmetry and find that both brokers and alters rely on information derived from observation of and communication about social interactions to form their knowledge of ties. However, while broker's perceptions are reinforced by the general knowledge about an alter-alter tie held by other members of the network, alters' perceptions are less likely to lead to accurate knowledge when such general knowledge increases. We attribute these differences to a constraint on alter's interpretation of his or her perceptions and argue that such constraints arise as brokers act to control alter's knowledge of brokerage tie.",Brokerage; Cognition; Networks,Networks (circuits); Brokerage; Cognition; Cognitive network; General knowledge; Performance based; Social interactions; Social Networks; Social ties; Sociocognitive; Profitability

Agency theorists and financial economists often claim that such actions to pursue corporate social responsibility are frequently efforts by senior managers seeking perquisites that necessarily impose costs upon shareholders. Others scholars agree that managers have discretion and are diverting shareholder returns but interpret these initiatives as altruistic and motivated by managers' morality. A growing body of organizational economists, identify market conditions under which the diversion of shareholder returns to enhance social responsibility may, in fact, be optimal for a manager because they lead to a reduction in the cost of capital, improve employee productivity, increase consumer willingness to pay or reduce activists' efforts to impose financial losses on the company. While acknowledging the existence of these causal mechanisms as well as managerial agency, we wish to call attention to an alternative and more direct driver of efforts by managers to improve external stakeholder perceptions of responsibility. We argue and present evidence that there exist cases in which such efforts, rather than diverting shareholder rents or moving the firm into a market niche with an alternative higher cost product, can be inputs into a more efficient production process. We undertake this analysis using panel data on 26 gold mines over the period 1993-2008. We code over 50,000 stakeholder events from media reports to develop an index of the degree of stakeholder cooperation or conflict for these mines and demonstrate that this measure of political and social capital is an important component, together with characteristics of the mine and the price of gold, in calculating the financial market valuation of the 19 publicly traded parent firms.",Political risk; Stakeholder relations; Strategic corporate social responsibility,Costs; Economics; Gold; Losses; Managers; Shareholders; Textile industry; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Cost of capital; Economic returns; Efficient production; Employee productivity; Financial loss; Financial market; Financial returns; Market condition; Market niche; Multi-national corporations; Panel data; Political risks; Senior managers; Shareholder returns; Social capitals; Social responsibilities; Social support; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder perception; Stakeholder relations; Willingness to pay; Economic and social effects

I present an alternative sociopolitical approach to gaining stakeholder support. Drawing from network theory I outline three mechanisms of change in the relations between stakeholders and foreign firms. First, network ties serve as prisms that enable third parties to cognitively ascribe characteristics of known stakeholders to an unknown foreign firm with whom that known stakeholder associates, thus ""who"" the firm initially associates with, the substance of this association, and differential value of firm initiated and stakeholder initiated relations, impacts subsequent firm-stakeholder relations. Second, as ties are conduits for information about actors in the network, ties to stakeholders that maximize the volume, diversity and richness of information afforded the firm enable the firm to improve its relations. Third, the interrelationships and interdependencies among stakeholders that facilitate pretransitive (friendship) dynamics and influence dynamics improve firm-stakeholder relations. I test these hypotheses using a novel database of 38,000 stakeholder relations manually coded from 20,000 articles covering 16 foreign gold mining companies operating 21 mining projects in 16 largely emerging countries. I find support for the impact of characteristics of the stakeholder with whom the firm is tied, the firm's access to voluminous information, as well as pretransitive and influence relations on firm stakeholder relations.",Multinational management; Network; Stakeholder strategy,Dynamics; Networks (circuits); Foreign firms; Gold mining; Mining projects; Multinational firms; Network tie; Stakeholder strategy; Third parties; Uncertain environments; Industry

We examine both the independent and joint effects of the multiple patriarchal logics on the establishment of microfinance organizations (MFO) using a cross-national time-series dataset compiled between 1990 and 2006. We find that stronger patriarchy in the four sectors generally hinders the establishment of MFOs whose primary social mission is to empower women. Moreover, the results suggest that not every dimension of the patriarchal logics is equally potent in their effect. We also find that family and profession patriarchy respectively mediate the impact of religious fundamentalism and state patriarchy on MFO establishment. State religion also seems to moderate the relationship between family patriarchy and MFO establishment.

We use the evolutionary theory of the multinational company as our point of departure and confront it with the advantage paradox of such organizations. Evolutionary theory on the multinational corporation argues that the more innovations are developed, the more the subsidiary is transferring them internally within the organization. However, there are studies indicating that, due to the multiplicity of roles, a subsidiary increasingly engaged in development activities has difficulties engaging in transfer activities. This suggest that there is an advantage paradox connected to the evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation in that being competent at developing innovations does not necessarily lead to the fact that such innovations become transferred. In the paper we explore the effects of external embeddedness and subsidiary autonomy on subsidiary innovation development, and these three dimensions are subsequently linked to subsidiary innovation transfer intensity. Our analysis suggests that embeddedness and autonomy is enhancing subsidiary innovativeness but does not contribute to transfer intensity. However, we can confirm that the more a subsidiary is innovating, although being embedded and autonomous, the more it will engage in innovation transfer to sister subsidiaries. Consequently, this paper addresses core dimensions of evolutionary theory, finding support for its arguments, while we cannot find support for the advantage paradox of multinational corporations.",Advantage paradox; Autonomy; Evolutionary theory,Advantage paradox; Autonomy; Core dimension; Development activity; Embeddedness; Evolutionary theories; Innovativeness; Multi-national corporations; Multinational companies; Point of departures; Three dimensions; Transfer activities; Industry

Building on Cyert and March¡s (1963) behavioral theory of the firm, performance feedback is a mechanism that can help companies to adjust their strategies, and deal with problematic or slack searches. We extended this argument in the context of Taiwan to investigate how firms adjust their behavior in terms of explorative and exploitative innovation when facing different kinds of performance feedback. Ten years¡ panel data with 374 firms was collected from Taiwanese firms in the electronic industry which were publicly listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2000 to 2009. Our finding showed that firms do adjust their explorative and exploitative innovation activities in response to different kinds of performance feedback. In particular, when firms¡ performance is above their aspiration level, they prefer to maintain their exploitative innovation and reduce their explorative innovation. We also found the majority of Taiwanese firms are risk averse, and that when their performance falls below their aspiration level, they are likely to increase their exploitative innovation activities when the performance shortfall is small. In addition, we also found that financial slack not only has a direct effect on both explorative and exploitative activities, but also has a positive moderating effect on performance feedback when the level of performance exceeds the aspiration level. The evidence from Taiwanese electronic companies corroborates and extends the behavioral theory of the firm and not only allows us to test this theory in a new empirical setting, but also enables us to incorporate important factors not considered in previous research.",Aspiration level; Explorative and exploitative activities; Financial slack,Industry; Aspiration level; Behavioral theory; Electronic companies; Electronic industries; Exploration and exploitation; Explorative and exploitative activities; Financial slack; Innovation activity; Moderating effect; Panel data; Performance feedback; Risk averse; Stock exchange; Innovation

In doing so, we aim to contribute to the literature on newcomers and teams by answering a question that up to now has not been addressed; Can newcomers - who are generally seen as marginal members - actively change their disadvantaged position and become successful in getting teams to consider their unique knowledge? Previous research indicates that newcomers have difficulty influencing oldtimers with whom they do not share a superordinate identity (e.g., they come from another organization). Scenario study 1 extends this notion, showing that these newcomers benefit more from using an integrating strategy that emphasizes their new team identity - as opposed to a differentiating strategy that emphasizes one's personal identity - than do newcomers who do share a superordinate identity with the team. For newcomers, who do not share a superordinate identity with oldtimers, the integrating strategy increased perceptions of group concern, which in turn, increased anticipated knowledge consideration. Study 2 focuses on these categorically dissimilar newcomers, extending the investigation to examine the effectiveness of these strategies on bringing about long-lasting changes in the work routines used by interacting teams. As predicted the integrating strategy led to greater knowledge consideration, sustained adoption and expert recognition than did the differentiating strategy. We reflect on the social identity perspective in explaining our results, and offer practical guidance for the many who change organizations, and join new teams.",Group/team learning; Influence strategies; Newcomers,Active agents; Group/team learning; Influence strategies; Long lasting; Newcomers; Personal identity; Practical guidance; Social identity

Moreover, the specific elements of symbolic management have been under-theorized. This study addresses both of these issues by theorizing and testing the notion that firms that engage in symbolic management across four key questions (why, who, how, and what) can generate positive bankruptcy outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesize and find that that bankrupt companies can mitigate bankruptcy's stigma by i) strategically attributing blame for their failure, ii) publicly acknowledging their alignment with and concern for crucial external stakeholders, iii) proffering specific plans to address their organization's weaknesses, and iv) framing the bankruptcy as a deliberately chosen strategic opportunity. We argue that these sense-giving strategies can be effective in accentuating management's competence and control over the organization's fate, thus making crucial audiences more inclined to continue supporting the organization post-filing. We test our hypothesis with data on 250 bankruptcy cases spanning three years, employing a careful content analysis of these companies' rich language surrounding the bankruptcy filing. Our supportive results highlight the importance of active impression management for bankrupt firms, adding to our knowledge of symbolic management and the bankruptcy process.",Bankruptcy; Impression management; Sensegiving,Industry; Audience reaction; Bankruptcy; Bankruptcy filing; Content analysis; Impression management; Management strategies; Sensegiving; Strategic opportunity; Management

We propose that an iterative process, in which groups cycle back and forth between ideas over time, refining and evaluating them, facilitates collective engagement in the group task, and we link this process to creativity. This challenges the brainstorming model of group creativity, and suggests that idea generation and idea selection can be productively integrated in the creative process in groups.",Creativity; Groups; Qualitative,Health care; Iterative methods; Creative process; Creativity; Groups; Idea generation; Iterative process; Iterative processing; Parallel processing; Qualitative; Qualitative process analysis; Sequential processing; Problem solving

Second, we propose that the impact of employee satisfaction depends on the busyness of the store, which constrains the affective and performance based mechanisms.

From the supplier's perspective we find that the negative effect of an increase in competitive overlap on the likelihood of tie continuation is moderated by the importance of the buyer to the supplier.

While the answer to this question interests a wide range of sociology, psychology, and management scholars, in this paper we argue that most research in these fields only give a partial answer, as they tend to focus on the rise of cultural practices but rarely analyze their abandonment; and because most research focuses on practices that are or once were popular. Through simulations and the analysis of a dataset that has previously not been used to analyze the rise and fall of cultural practices, the New York Times text archive, we show that studying abandonment and studying a whole range of cultural objects, both popular and less popular, are essential for understanding the mechanisms of the dynamics of popularity. Specifically, we demonstrate that by only focusing on objects and practices that exhibit a fashion like pattern, one can arrive at the erroneous conclusion that increases in popularity beget further increases in popularity. We show that a proper analysis of data indicates the presence of the opposite mechanism whereby rises in popularity inhibit further increase.",Diffusion; Fads and fashion; Popularity,Diffusion; Analysis of data; Cultural practices; Data sets; Fads and fashion; New york time; Organizational practices; Popularity; Dynamics

Design: 229 individuals were randomly assigned to either a wait list control (n=112) or an active treatment (117) in which they were given complete information on the nature of stress and subsequently trained to consciously choose an enhancing stress-mindset (i.e. believe that experiencing stress would enhance their health and boost their work-performance). Main Outcome Measures: Mood and Anxiety Questionnaire (MASQ; Watson et al., 1995), Work Performance Scale (WPS; Welbourne, Johnson & Erez, 1998), and the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI; Frisch, 1992). Results: Participants in the stress-mindset training reported significant improvements in their experience of physical symptoms, greater overall satisfaction with their health, and better performance at work with respect to generating new ideas, sustaining focus, being engaged, and collaborating well at work. Mediation analyses demonstrate that these improvements occurred primarily through changes in mindset initiated by the training intervention.

Organizational members who hold legitimacy to drive the organization to explore less legitimate alternatives (i.e., members with relatively high organizational tenure and comparatively high performance) are indeed also those who wish to preserve the organizational arrangements. Empirical analysis of stock coverage initiation of investment banks shows that security analysts with higher organizational experience and better relative forecast performance are less likely to initiate new stock coverage for the bank they work for, but, when they initiate new coverage, they tend to focus on less covered stocks in the field.

We argue that these characteristics of resources simultaneously affect how well firms adapt to environmental shocks. Our empirical analysis is based on stochastic frontier analysis of firm-level panel data on investments in core resources (specifically IT resources) by investor-owned electric utilities. We find that (i) a firm's resource base and overall modularity jointly impact its performance, (ii) increased complexity of core resources decreases the change in relative firm performance in the short-run while increasing it in the long-run, (iii) increased modularity of core resources increases the change in relative firm performance in the short-run, while decreasing it in the long-run, and (iv) increased firm-specificity of core resources increases the change in relative firm performance in the long-run.

Focusing on the location of the parent firm for which the founder worked pre-founding as an important determinant of the human and social capital that the founder can instill into the spawn at founding, we examine how the location of the parent firm influences the post-founding performance of entrepreneurial spawns in the hedge fund sector. We find that hedge fund managers who previously worked for parent firms located in the industry hubs- New York and London-outperform their peers, regardless of the employer quality and where the actual hedge fund is located. We also find that this effect is greater if the entrepreneur worked in a job pre-founding that is highly related to hedge fund management. Our results are robust to controls for selection into job spells in New York/London. The evidence suggests that working in the industry's geographical hub pre-founding increases the nascent entrepreneurs' human and social capital which critically ""imprints"" the new spawns, and thereby lastingly influences the spawns' capabilities and post-founding performance. Further, it also suggests that entrepreneurs who pre-founding worked in a more related job to the new venture's industry are more likely to benefit from the spillover of relevant knowledge and accumulation of relevant social capital in the industry hub prefounding. This means that the performance of spawns is critically dependent on resources that they inherit from attributes of their parent firms.",Development of capabilities; Entrepreneurial spawning; New firm capabilities,Fences; Location; Development of capabilities; Entrepreneurial spawning; Firm capabilities; Firm location; Firm Performance; Hedge Funds; Nascent entrepreneurs; New ventures; New York; Social capitals; Industry

I find that spillovers driven by absorptive capacity, versus by demonstration effects, are more likely contentious as: domestic leadership is higher; outcomes are more sensitive to host country policies; and the firm dynamics, such as entry and exit, due to the spillovers are harder to observe. Thus baseline expectations of which firms lead an industry depend on the types of spillovers.",Entry and exit; Firm and industry dynamics; Spillovers,Dynamics; Absorptive capacity; Developing economies; Domestic firms; Domestic industries; Entry and exit; Firm and industry dynamics; Firm dynamics; Formal model; Host countries; Spillovers; Industry

Innovations rarely fit well with an organization's strategy, structure, resources or institutionalized patterns of thought (Chandy & Tellis, 2000; Dougherty & Hardy, 1996). High potential ideas are often weeded out at nascent stages because they challenge existing thought. Previous researchers have suggested that innovators succeed when they influence how audiences understand the meaning of their innovation (Dougherty & Heller, 1994; Hargadon & Douglas, 2001). Shaping how audiences understand the meaning of an innovation can be accomplished through several methods such as framing (Benford & Snow, 2000; Goffman, 1974) and general influence tactics such as assertiveness, ingratiation and coalitions (Kipnis, Schmidt & Wilkinson, 1980). Here we explore how innovators construct meaning by engaging in ""sensegiving"" (Gioia & Chittipedi, 1991) to move their innovation from ideation to adoption. To address our research question we use data collected from innovators and senior managers within Silicon Valley's high technology industry. Data were collected from 14 firms ranging in age from 12 to 114 years, with annual revenues for 2008 from approximately $5 to $105 billion and an employee base of 10,000 to 150,000. In contrast to previous research, which suggests that successful innovators either conform to (Hargadon & Douglas, 2001) or alter meanings (Dougherty & Heller, 1994), we find that innovators promoting nascent ideas present their projects as completely aligned yet different from their organization's extant schema. They present their innovations as optimally distinct (Brewer, 1991) through the use of narratives, symbols and timing of their sensegiving strategies.",Meaning management; Nascent innovations; Sensegiving,Research; Annual revenue; Douglas; High potential; High technology industries; Organizational support; Research questions; Senior managers; Sensegiving; Silicon valley; Wilkinson; Innovation

Further, expectancy theory is utilized to predict outcome interdependence as a moderator of whether these patterns result in efficient resource allocation and exchange. Support for these propositions is found in two field studies involving basketball and project teams.

While numerous and diverse, the attempts to remedy this concern scarcely involve the investigation of alternative frameworks and measures of cognitive ability, and this act may hold promise for addressing the validity-adverse impact tradeoff. One recent construct from cognitive psychology, executive attention, proposes a distinct view of cognitive ability that explains performance on cognitively simple and complex tasks including multi-tasking, an increasingly demanded organizational need. In a sample of 121 bank employees, we assessed the extent to which general cognitive ability and executive attention predict supervisory ratings of job performance and managerial simulation performance. Results indicated that, compared to general cognitive ability, executive attention was associated with (a) stronger relationships with performance criteria, (b) unique variance in performance criteria, (c) weaker relationships with employee ethnicity, and (d) lower levels of test bias.

Although researchers have begun to consider leadership as a social phenomenon, credible depictions of this process with respect to post-merger identification are lacking. During archival research of the primary Mexican American Civil Rights groups in South Texas in the 1920s, most of which eventually merged into the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), we discovered substantial intimation of the construction and preservation of a leadership identity capable of engendering enhanced post-merger identification. Accordingly, we examined the behaviors and beliefs of the principal founders of LULAC to reveal a process of post-merger leadership grounded in pragmatism and personalism that produced the climate, trust, and commitment needed to enhance the behavior and identification necessary for organizational success and maintenance of the leadership identity.",Leadership; Management history; Mergers,Merging; Civil rights; Latin americans; Leadership; Mergers; Organizational change; Mergers and acquisitions

Using data from 148 researchers in 29 academic research labs, we provide evidence on the importance of social categorization states (i.e., expertise diversity salience) in understanding both the information processes (i.e., task conflict) and the creativity processes (i.e., idea sharing) in groups with expertise diversity. We show that expertise diversity can either increase or decrease task conflict depending on the salience of group members' expertise in a curvilinear way: at a medium level of expertise diversity the moderating effect of diversity salience is strongest. Furthermore, enriched group work design can strengthen the benefits of task conflict for creative idea sharing only when expertise diversity salience is low. Finally, we show that idea sharing predicts group performance in interdisciplinary academic research labs over and above task conflict.",Conflict; Diversity; Field research,Job analysis; Research laboratories; Academic research; Conflict; Creative ideas; Diversity; Field research; Group members; Group performance; Group work; Information process; Interdisciplinary research; Moderating effect; Research efforts; Task conflicts; Research

We theorize that both knowledge transfer (proxied by the exiting employee team size) and knowledge spillovers (proxied by experience of the exiting employee team) will aid spin-out performance. However, knowledge transfer, being more rival, will have a greater adverse impact than knowledge spillovers on parent firm performance.

Using data on US investor-owned electric utility companies from 1992 to 2008, this paper finds that, on average, wholesale electricity deregulation is associated with lower probability of entry into the renewable generation business by incumbents whereas retail electricity deregulation is not significantly related either to entry or to increases in renewables over time. It appears that wholesale deregulation provides greater cost-reducing incentives than retail deregulation. Firms' different responses to wholesale vs. retail deregulation even within the realm of rate-of-return regulation suggest that deregulation might be composed of heterogeneous elements and involve more complexity than previously assumed.

Such economies are underpinned by functioning institutions, where compliance with regulation is assumed. Recently however, the capacity of this traditional CSR approach, to take account of the different economic and institutional arrangements found nonwestern contexts, has been challenged. It has been argued that CSR research needs to be more contextualised, and that the western interpretation and assumptions about what CSR is and how it is enacted needs to be broadened and challenged to take account of different stages of economic development. With this in mind, this paper presents a contextualised critique of CSR undertaken in the Russian Federation. Based on a qualitative study involving managers within privatised Russian firms, this paper explores the type, nature, and scope of CSR undertaken and the attendant motivation of firms to engage in CSR practice. In so doing, this paper adopts not only a 'beyond compliance' definition, but also seeks to contextualise the CSR experience within Russian firms by taking account of the historical and cultural antecedents of both the Soviet Union and the transition period itself. In so doing we reveal that while the market is driving conventional forms of CSR within some Russian firms, the historical legacy of the both the Soviet and transition period also influences the type and nature of CSR undertaken. Such CSR challenges both the assumptions about the voluntary nature of CSR and what it means for firms to go 'beyond compliance'.",Context; CSR; Russia,Privatization; Context; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); CSR; Economic development; Institutional arrangement; Qualitative study; Research needs; Russia; Russian federation; Soviet Union; Transition period; Industry

We discuss how an institutional diffusion process - that might seem to be a straightforward S-shaped pattern at the field level - actually emerges out of differential organizational response times, where a complex interaction of a macro institutional pressure with micro level enabling and/or constraining conditions shapes agents' decisions about their timing of adoption. This points to a more complex institutional trajectory than the mere distinction between early or late adopters in the classic institutional diffusion model.",Adoption; Institutions; Timing,Diffusion; Management; Managers; Adoption; Complex interaction; Diffusion model; Diffusion process; Field level; Institutional theory; Micro level; Micro mechanisms; Netherlands; Organizational levels; Response timings; S-shaped; Strategic response; Timing; Societies and institutions

We test this tension by examining the effects of expertise at the CEO and top management team on the likelihood of technology change among the population of U.S. solar photovoltaic manufacturing ventures between 1992 and 2007. Surprisingly we find that firms led by experts at both the CEO and management team level are actually more rigid, decreasing the likelihood of change. Furthermore, we find that firms led by non-experts (at the CEO and management team level) are in fact more flexible and likely to change technology. To explore these theories more we also conduct an interaction analysis in which we contrast the value of complementary knowledge, as suggested by the knowledge-based view, against the role of team structure, as suggested by a cognitive flexibility perspective. Interestingly we find that knowledge complementarity alone is insufficient to increase change. In contrast, cognitively flexible team structures can reverse the negative effects of expertise or amplify the positive benefits of cognitive flexibility. Finally, we argue that because technology ventures inhabit dynamic internal and external environments, change should be beneficial to performance and we find a positive relationship between change and performance.",Change; Cognition; Entrepreneurship,Industry; Change; Cognition; Cognitive flexibility; Deep knowledge; Entrepreneurship; External environments; Interaction analysis; Knowledge-based views; Management team; New ventures; Solar industries; Solar photovoltaics; Technology change; Technology ventures; Top management teams; Photovoltaic effects

We expand ideas underlying positive organizational scholarship and examine leading-edge studies from neuroscience and quantum physics that give support to our claims. The perspective we propose has profound implications regarding how we organize and how we manage. First, we argue that empathy enhances connectedness through the unconscious sharing of neuro-pathways that dissolves the barriers between self and other. This sharing encourages the integration of affective and cognitive consciousness which facilitates the ability to find common ground for solution-building. Second, empathy enhances connectedness through altruistic action. In giving to others, feelings of joy and harmony are activated. This in turn allows personal freedom to be enriched and transcendence from the rational ego-self is reduced to develop a more expansive, integrated and enlightened state underlying connectedness. Finally, empathy enhances connectedness which results in sharing the quantum field of coherence where there is little separation between self and other. This means living beyond self-interest in a coherent world based upon interdependent wholeness rather than atomization and separation. Empathy allows us to find that state of coherent connectedness.",Connectedness; Empathy; Organization,Separation; Societies and institutions; Common ground; Connectedness; Empathy; Leading edge; Positive organizational scholarship; Quantum field; Quantum physics; Quantum theory

Our study is among the first to develop and empirically test theory about how specific management practices can encourage employees to speak up about problems and to offer suggestions for solving them. We hypothesize that employees are more likely to speak up and offer solutions when organizations launch information campaigns to promote process improvement and when managers engage in process-improvement activities themselves. We test our hypotheses in the health-care context, in which problems are frequent and many organizations use incident-reporting systems to encourage employees to communicate about the operational problems they witness. Using data on nearly 7,500 reported incidents, we find that information campaigns encouraging process improvement promote both speaking up and offering solutions, while managerial engagement in process improvement promotes the latter.

The phases progressively reconfigure the coexistence of institutional logics within the organization, enabling actors to attain partial reconciliation.

These modes are therefore expected to have different implication on performance of these two types of firms. Extant literature on technology management has developed theoretical insights on developed economy context but has hardly addressed the emerging economy context. Addressing this gap, this paper explores how different modes of technological knowledge development in emerging economies influence firm performance for an extended period of time. The multi-industry longitudinal study of 3026 manufacturing firms in India reveals: payoffs from investments in different modes of technological knowledge development occurs over an extended period of time, but are different in nature (positive vis-à-vis negative) at different points of time. The pattern of payoff depends on the dimensions of performance and on the mode of technological knowledge development. The research contributes theoretical insights into the relationship between technological knowledge development mode and firm performance in emerging economy by investigating some modes which are important in emerging economies. It also systematically explores the effect of technological knowledge sourcing on different dimensions of performance over an extended period of time. It attempts to bring out theoretical difference between the two different types of investments in R&D: capital and current, especially as it applies in emerging economy. The results also indicate that decision of shareholders follow institutionalized norms rather than rational evaluation of technology investment by firms. This may have important implications for corporate governance in relation to technology management.",Emerging economy; R&D; Technology management,Industrial management; Industry; Investments; Corporate governance; Developed economies; Different modes; Emerging economies; Evaluation of technology; Firm Performance; Longitudinal study; Manufacturing firms; Technological knowledge; Technology development; Technology management; Technology managements; Economics

Our study was motivated by some important gaps in the corporate entrepreneurship literature on venturing and renewal. There is limited understanding of the different types and dimensions of firms' renewal activities. In particular, more understanding of discontinuous renewal, involving shifts in firms' core businesses, is required. There has also been very little examination of conditions that drive firms to undertake strategic renewal. For example, it is not known how venturing increases or reduces the benefits of renewal that involves shifts away from core businesses. We focus on firms' external venturing initiatives by examining CVC investments. We argue that CVC investments create growth options in new and existing businesses but these options do not result in firms' withdrawal from existing businesses. Therefore, CVC activity is negatively associated with the likelihood of a firm undertaking discontinuous renewal. The benefits of withdrawing from existing businesses are even lower, and the costs even higher, for firms in dynamic industries that possess strong internal capabilities. We test our predictions using longitudinal data on 477 firms from the 1990 Fortune 500 list for the period 1990-2000. Our results imply that external venturing allows firms to avoid discontinuous renewal involving withdrawal from existing businesses into new and unfamiliar ones.

I argue that pro-market reforms augment firm profitability because they increase the competitiveness of local markets, allowing firms to increase their market experiential knowledge and ultimately their profitability. However, I also explain that the effects of reforms on firm profitability may be enhanced by the international strategic choices of firms because such choices may increase the potential for absorptive capacity and learning. I propose that developing-country firms that operate in international markets increase their market experiential knowledge by learning how to compete at international levels, which makes it easier to be competitive in their home market in response to reforms. This effect is especially pronounced for developing-country firms that establish subsidiaries in advanced economies, as it forces them to develop their market knowledge to the highest international levels. It is also stronger for firms that become multinationals before the start of pro-market reforms implementation because such firms have a head-start over other local firms by learning how to compete at international levels before the local market becomes more competitive. In short, I argue that the different aspects of a firm's internationalization that help increase its market experiential knowledge enhance the benefits of pro-market reforms on firm profitability because they make it easier for the firm to compete successfully in a market where such reforms are implemented. Using a panel of the largest 500 companies in Latin America from 1989-2008 and data from multiple sources, the analyses provide robust support for these arguments.",Firm internationalization strategy; Firm profitability; Pro-market reforms,Competition; Developing countries; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Profitability; Absorptive capacity; Advanced economies; Firm internationalization strategy; International markets; Latin America; Local markets; Multiple source; Pro-market reforms; Strategic choice; Industry

While research suggests that isolation increases as one spends increasing amounts of time working offsite, our inductive, qualitative study of a Fortune 100 company found few if any differences in perceived isolation across workers ranging from 100% onsite to 100% offsite. Rather, with the advent of ""location autonomy"" or freedom to work where you want to work in this organization, more individuals work offsite, meaning fewer people are at the office, leaving even onsite workers at greater risk of being isolated. Building on these and other findings, we suggest that this company represents a new type of distributed work organization. We conducted a deductive, quantitative study with a different sample in the same organization to test the implications of this new type of distributed organization. Findings suggest that: location autonomy lead to an increase in telecommuting; that individuals' choices on where to work were most significantly predicted by their beliefs about where co-workers were working; and that isolation led to weaker relational attachments for everyone. Results were particularly negative for those working alone onsite: these workers were less satisfied with their jobs, had weaker information and friendship networks, and lower work-unit identification.",Attachment; Distributed work; Telecommuting,Industry; Telecommuting; Attachment; Distributed work; On-site workers; Qualitative study; Quantitative study; Human resource management

Second, we build on Mitchell and colleagues' (1997) suggestion that power, legitimacy and urgency attributes define the salience of stakeholders for managers by reallocating these attributes along the newly formed stakeholder tetrad, and by exploring in greater depth the relationships that exist between these attributes, which lead them to compound and/or interact in certain applications - which is captured in the snowball effect.

Objects are increasingly displacing direct social relations in the mediation of distributed work. When collaboration between organizational groups is virtually-mediated, the ""management of meaning"" that used to be centralized in strategic managers is distributed. In collaborating around virtuallymediated knowledge objects, various groups compete to define the meanings attached to those objects, in order to define the importance and legitimacy of various forms of organizational knowledge and thus control organizational roles, structures, and processes. This study analyzes how representational, technical, and organizational resources provide a mediation of knowledge and influence between different work-groups and how different forms of negotiated mediation lead to the adaptation of the information systems that collaborating workgroups define and use in common.

Because novel partners enhance a firm's innovativeness, joint ventures will therefore indirectly decrease its innovativeness. Finally, novel partners become more important when technological dynamism increases, which will in turn increase the innovative benefits of contractual agreements versus joint ventures. Application of a structural model to a panel of firms engaged in IT-related technology alliances during 1978-1999 generally supports the theory. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the behavioral and performance consequences of alliance governance.",Alliance governance; Partner selection,Industry; Model structures; Research; Technology transfer; Alliance governance; Contractual agreements; Innovativeness; Joint ventures; Partner selection; Structural models; Technology alliance; Information technology

Consistent with technology acceptance models, the benefits from healthcare information technology (HIT) and related analyses are found to progress from adoption, to integration, to use. However, we find that the integration of hospital information technology systems may not directly impact quality performance or patient outcomes. Instead, the results indicate that the analysis of information for organizational decision making mediates the impact of systems adoption and integration on quality and patient satisfaction. Additionally, we concurrently consider the relationship of the analysis of medical error data and the analysis of organizational data and their impacts on hospital performance outcomes. The findings show a significant association between organizational-level data analysis and floor-level error data analysis but suggest that cultures that emphasize error data analysis may not directly impact care quality and patient satisfaction outcomes contrary to popular thinking. The results are supported by analyses of a novel combination of three main sources of primary and secondary data: information systems adoption data from the HIMMS database, survey data on information systems and error data analysis from 250 hospitals throughout the United States, and publicly reported hospital quality and satisfaction data. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression are employed to analyze the relationships of systems and cultural factors and the effects of an integrated approach. This paper contributes to healthcare practice and future research by providing additional clarity to the questions surrounding the relationships between information systems, error cultures, and hospital performance. We find that the use of organizational data in decision making may have the most significant impact on performance outcomes of patient satisfaction and quality process of care.",Error reduction; Healthcare; Information systems,Decision making; Errors; Health care; Hierarchical systems; Hospitals; Information systems; Integration; Medical computing; Quality control; Cultural factors; Error data; Error reduction; Health care information system; Healthcare information technology; Hierarchical regression; Hospital information; Integrated approach; Medical errors; Organizational decision making; Patient satisfaction; Performance outcome; Quality performance; Quality process; Significant impacts; Structural equation modeling; Survey data; Technology acceptance model; Information management

In such settings, can virtual communication with team leader foster member inclusion and identification? Further, because cultural and national diversity have been identified as a key characteristic of virtual teams (e.g., Gibson & Gibbs, 2006) can member cultural orientation directly and indirectly predict workgroup identification? To answer these questions, we develop and test a theoretical framework that integrates leader-member virtual communication, member cultural orientation, and perceived inclusion in decision-making to predict workgroup identification. Findings from a multi-level investigation based on sample of 234 virtual team members embedded in 41 virtual teams suggests that dyadic leader-member virtual communication directly and indirectly influences workgroup identification. Member cultural orientation predicts workgroup identification in complex ways. Allocentrism predisposes members to identify with the workgroup; however, sustaining identification of idiocentric members may depend on leader-member virtual communication.",Distributed teams; Identification; Virtual teams,Identification (control systems); Management; Cultural orientation; Distributed teams; Key characteristics; Multi-level; Team leaders; Theoretical framework; Virtual communication; Virtual team; Workgroups; Communication

One approach to this has been to decompose variance in firm-level profitability into firm, suprafirm and industry components. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature in two main ways. First, in contrast to previous literature which has focused almost exclusively on listed corporations in the United States, we analyze differences in profitability between firms (both listed and non-listed), operating in all industries with the exception of the agrarian sector in 25 European countries. These data allow us to investigate the influence of country effects alongside firm, business group, industry and year effects. The size of the database allows us to use a repeated sampling approach in the analysis of the underlying population of firms along country, industry and size dimensions. Our second contribution is methodological. We propose a new method of variance decomposition, the Shapley Value method. Relative to methods used in prior studies, the Shapley Value method obtains more accurate estimates of the contributions of the different effects to the variance in firm profitability in the presence of covariance between effects. We show this by evaluating it against alternatives using Monte-Carlo simulations. Our empirical results suggest that business group effects are the second largest source of variance in firm-level profitability after firm effects, and that the importance of the business group appears to decrease with increasing group size. Industry effects appear to be much smaller than estimated in previous work, while country and year effects are smaller still.",Business groups; Profitability variance decomposition; Shapley Value,Game theory; Intelligent systems; Profitability; Business groups; Different effects; European Countries; Firm Performance; Firm-level profitability; Group size; Industry effects; Monte Carlo Simulation; Shapley value; Size dimensions; Strategic management; Variance decomposition; Industry

Professionals within organizations act as institutional workers transferring the institutional forces of their professions to organizational institutional setups and thus play an important role in institutional change and diffusion in general. We construct a framework of how staff professionals within organizations act as institutional workers, consisting of three activities: getting institutional support, manufacturing consent, and mobilizing allies to share the load of the institutionalization process. We then analyze the structural conditions necessary for functional workers to become institutional workers. We propose structural nomadism of employed professionals as a key enabler of these work processes.",Institutional work; Intraorganizational; Profession,Construction industry; Industrial hygiene; Construction companies; Institutional change; Institutional forces; Institutional support; Institutional work; Intraorganizational; Occupational health and safety; Profession; Structural condition; Work process; Societies and institutions
"Let me handle this, I've done it before: Experience and self-involvement in superstitious learning",2011,"Academy of Management 2011 Annual Meeting - West Meets East: Enlightening. Balancing.

We argue that previous research has confounded biases arising from experience with biases related to self-involvement (e.g. overconfidence, illusions of control) which are often pervasive and difficult to isolate from experience-based biases. We propose that, in contexts governed by uncertainty and causal ambiguity, experience accumulation by itself does not produce overconfident judgments -as currently expected by superstitious learning research- but rather, overconfident judgments are produced by the accumulation of experience coupled with self-involvement. We test this proposition using an experimental approach by contrasting the effects of learning through experience as opposed to learning through a descriptive source of information. We find evidence that, independent of subjects' competence level, learning through experience produces overconfident judgments about the outcome of a task only when the experienced person is involved in the execution of a task, but not when someone else executes the task. By contrast, learning through descriptive sources leads subjects to falsely believe that others are more likely than themselves to successfully execute a task.",Experience; Learning; Superstitious learning,Experience; Experimental approaches; Learning; Microfoundations; Superstitious learning

The paper weaves together new strands of research in business ethics with the current debate on sustainability. The argument is made in three steps. The first step sketches how the sustainability semantics has evolved from a sociopolitical searchlight to a heuristics for business policy and practice. Elaborating a key proposition of the ordonomic perspective on business ethics, the second step argues that business firms can use moral commitments as a factor of production by deploying individual or collective selfcommitments as well as commitment services in processes of new governance. In the third step, we combine these four moral commitments with the three ESG ('ecological, social, and governance') criteria of sustainability and derive a 12-box matrix for commitment strategies. We use three case studies to illustrate how this ordonomic matrix can be used to enhance strategic management for corporate sustainability.",Business ethics; Strategic management; Sustainability,Industry; Philosophical aspects; Semantics; Strategic planning; Business ethics; Business policies; Commitment strategy; Corporate-sustainability; In-process; Strategic management; Sustainable development

However, ""apologies"" often communicate two, distinct messages: responsibility (they take blame) and regret (they express remorse). Though theoretically and practically distinguishable, taking blame and expressing remorse, independently, have not received much research attention. This leaves an important gap, as organizational actors often do one without the other. My research focuses on blame-taking, examining its independent incidence and effectiveness after a common event: a failure with multiple causes. Study 1 investigated incidence, asking consultants to reflect on a failure that they had personally experienced. Their responses suggested that blame-taking is rare and confined to leaders and minor failures. Study 2 sampled separate consultants from the same firm; they reacted to someone who took blame or expressed remorse for the Study 1 stories. Notwithstanding its scarcity, blame-taking was roundly rewarded by the Study 2 participants, in comparison to remorse. With a sample of working adults, Study 3 replicated these effects and documented a reason: blame-taking establishes an actor's character more than remorse. Overall, this research highlights a potential disconnect between what organizational actors do and what others want them to do. People appear quite reluctant to take blame, even though their counterparts would almost uniformly welcome it.",Apology; Blame; Remorse,Apology; Blame; Remorse; Research

The assumption is that null results are less likely to be published in primary-level studies and, hence, less likely to be included in meta-analytic reviews, thereby resulting in an upwardly biased sample of primary-level effect size estimates and upwardly biased meta-analytically derived effect sizes. We conducted three studies to assess the extent of the file drawer problem. In Study 1, we examined correlation matrices including 50,841 effect sizes published in Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP) and Personnel Psychology (PPsych) between 1985 and 2009 and found that 47.76% of those correlations are not statistically significant. In Study 2, we examined 6,935 correlations used as input in 51 meta-analyses published in Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Management, JAP, PPsych, and Strategic Management Journal between 1982 and 2009 and found that 45.25% are not statistically significant. In Study 3, we examined 167 non-published correlation matrices including 27,886 effect sizes from non-published manuscripts written by management and applied psychology scholars and found that 47.12% of those correlations are not statistically significant. These results challenge the assumption that meta-analytically derived effect sizes are upwardly biased because they rely on primary-level effect sizes that are mostly statistically significant. Thus, our results have important implications for substantive theory and practice because they indicate that, contrary to a long-held and established belief, the file drawer problem may not pose a serious threat to the validity of meta-analytically derived conclusions.",Meta-analysis; Quantitative methods; Research synthesis,Correlation matrix; Effect size; Management journals; Meta-analysis; Quantitative method; Strategic management; Theory and practice; Publishing

These three factors interact to determine institutional entrepreneurs' intentions to alter institutional arrangements.

Further, we propose that changing subsidiary identity claims reflect the ongoing process whereby the subsidiary responds and adapts to the dynamic balance between multinational organization pressures and home country pressures.

The first is a model of adaptive cognition or a metacognition model (Haynie & Shepherd, 2009) and its impact on performance. The metacognition model addresses an individual's ability to be dynamic, flexible and self-regulating and consists of goals, learning, knowledge, monitoring, and experience. The second is an entrepreneurial orientation model and its impact on firm performance. The entrepreneurial orientation model consists of entrepreneurial culture and orientations toward growth, strategy, management and reward. Using representative models from each paradigm, we find both are significant but unequal determinants of firm performance. Using path analysis, we test the model on a sample of 150 small and medium sized entrepreneurial firms. We also test a third integrated model that combines the two partial models. The metacognition model explains nearly four times as much variance in firm performance compared to the entrepreneurial orientation. The conclusion section discusses the shortcomings of current theorizing in the area of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, and indicates future research areas. The limitations of this research are also highlighted.",Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm performance; Metacognition,Cognitive systems; Regression analysis; Additive models; Entrepreneurial cultures; Entrepreneurial firms; Entrepreneurial orientation; Firm Performance; Integrated models; Metacognition; Path analysis; Research areas; Small firm; Industry

We first examine whether governance arrangements matter for overall firm reputation and then begin to address the question of how and why they might matter by exploring a number of different contingencies. We investigate these issues by considering how poison pills impacted the overall reputation of large corporations from 1985- 1989, the time period when this practice gained prominence. Our results show that poison pills did indeed negatively affect the overall reputation of firms even after controlling for various measures of financial performance. In addition, we find that assessments of firm reputation differed somewhat depending on the characteristics of the firm (i.e., its relative visibility) and upon the reputation granting audience (executives vs. analysts). We also find evidence of temporal differences in this relationship and show that over time, the evaluations of different groups converged around a negative view of firms with poison pills. Our results suggest that corporate governance has implications for perceptions of the broader well being of the firm, beyond the more narrow definitions of financial performance that are typically the focus of empirical research in the governance literature.",Corporate governance; Institutional theory; Reputation,Industrial management; Pelletizing; Corporate governance; Empirical research; Financial performance; Institutional theory; Measures of financial performance; Reputation; Temporal differences; Time-periods; Well being; Industry

However, high power individuals are also often confronted with feedback. In this study, we focus on differences between high and low power individuals' affective and attitudinal reactions to unfavorable feedback. Understanding how high and low power individuals differ in their reactions to unfavorable feedback is important in order to reap the beneficial effects of unfavorable feedback and at the same time minimize its potentially negative consequences. Following insights into emotional stability and power, we propose that emotional stability reduces negative reactions to unfavorable feedback particularly in high power individuals. We conducted two experimental studies wherein we assessed participants' emotional stability and randomly assigned them to a high or low power condition. After task completion participants received negative performance feedback. In line with our hypothesis, we found in both studies that, with higher levels of emotional stability, only high power individuals were less likely to experience anger and shame in response to negative feedback. Our data also show that anger towards the feedback provider, contrary to shame and self-directed anger, mediates the interactive effects of emotional stability and power on liking and perceived ability of the feedback provider and feedback acceptance. Our results point to the importance of personality in high power individuals' feedback reactions.

Accordingly, whenever the leadership perceptions of an individual do not conform (i.e., they are hierarchically inconsistent) with those of other group members, he/she is induced to reduce such inconsistencies by aligning his/her own leadership perceptions. The paper tests this argument using a multi-method, multi-study approach. Study 1 follows the process of leadership emergence within a newly formed social group, showing how hierarchical relational schemas are reflected in the evolving network of leadership choices within the group.

I find that the target's technological capabilities create more value when there is little technological overlap between the target and the acquirer and that the acquirer's technological capabilities create more value when the acquirer is a technological leader. Further, I find that acquirers benefit most from combining the target's and the acquirer's technological capabilities when both little technological overlap is present and the acquirer is a technological leader.

However, opportunities for adjusting self-regulatory strategies and accessing a greater breadth of information sources decrease. These contingencies are used to generate hypotheses about relationships between current job seeker effort at three stages of job search and (1) prior effort, (2) individual differences in core self evaluations, (3) job search progress feedback, and (4) peer effort.

We hypothesize that an acquisition decision is vulnerable to bias and illusion if the decision is made during the honeymoon period of the pre-acquisition alliance. On the contrary, acquisition decisions made after the honeymoon period of pre-acquisition alliance is over reflect more exact information and a more sober understanding of the target. This hypothesis is examined in a panel database made up of acquisitions performed by French firms in the US between January 1988 and December 2006. We show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the duration of pre-acquisition alliance and the probability of acquisition failure.

Both decreases and increases in environmental performance result in surges in financial returns; investments in better environmental performance are more costly for high environmental performers; high maintenance costs make abandoning higher environmental performance levels a viable, if temporary, way of improving profitability.",Environmental performance; Financial performance; Strategic change,Maintenance; Profitability; Difference-in-differences; Differential costs; Environmental performance; Environmental strategy; Financial performance; Financial returns; Maintenance cost; Strategic changes; Environmental management

One of the most important behaviors in the domain of CSP is volunteerism. This study examined the reciprocal causal relationship between volunteerism and life satisfaction. Based on the findings and limitations of previous research, this study had four objectives: to examine the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism in a multivariate context with a large number of controls that have been previously shown to relate to both variables as antecedents; to examine these relationships in a large, national sample comprised of people from a variety of different age groups; to examine whether the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism was moderated by self-esteem; and finally, to address some of the methodological limitations of previous studies by investigating the relationships between the two variables in a longitudinal context with four waves of data collection. Several theoretical mechanisms served as the foundation for the hypothesized relationships between the variables in the study. The results of this study indicated that there is indeed a reciprocal causal relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism, though the link from life satisfaction to volunteerism has received more support in the general sample than from volunteerism to life satisfaction. In addition, self- esteem was also shown to moderate the relationship between life satisfaction and volunteerism. These results have implications for both theory and practice.",Life satisfaction; Self-esteem; Volunteerism,Age groups; Causal relationships; Data collection; Firm Performance; Life satisfaction; Longitudinal analysis; Self-esteem; Social performance; Theory and practice; Volunteerism

The integration problems exacerbate when individual subcomponents are perplexed with individual technological uncertainty that varies according to specific preferences for functionality of subcomponents. Empirical findings show that when architectural uncertainty is high, contractors prefer to solve architectural problems in the manufacturing stage. Conversely, under low architectural uncertainty, design becomes a preferred way of dealing with integration of subcomponents.",Architectural uncertainty; Customized project; Interdependence,Contractors; Design; Integration; Manufacture; Architectural problems; Architectural uncertainty; Customized products; Customized project; Empirical findings; Integration problems; Interdependence; Manufacturing stages; Off-shore oil industry; Standardized products; Technological uncertainty; Architecture

We test our theory using linked employer-employee data from the legal services industry. We find that individuals with extreme high performance are less likely to leave firms that offer higher pay dispersion than competitors, however, if they do leave these employers, they are more likely to create new ventures. In contrast, employees with extreme low performance are more likely to leave firms with more compensation dispersion than competitors, but these individuals are less likely to engage in entrepreneurial new venture creation.",Compensation dispersion; Entrepreneurship; Rent appropriation,Compensation structure; Compensation systems; Employee mobility; Entrepreneurship; Individual performance; Legal services; New venture creation; New ventures; Rent appropriation; Industry

Specifically, non-competition agreements reduce the risk that the firm loses the fruits of inventive activity by its employees, such that when the enforcement of non-compete covenants is stricter, firms grant corporate inventors more freedom to explore risky but high-potential research paths. This study uses data about U.S. patent applications between 1990 and 2000 to identify the impact of non-competition agreements and considers both cross-state and longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete clauses.

Based on interviews with organizational decision-makers involved in adverse event review and regression analysis of internal medical case data, I find that the level of organizational review accorded to an adverse event was associated with severity of injury to the patient; perceived risk of a malpractice lawsuit; the number of departments involved in the event; and preventability of the event. The odds of review for adverse events caused fully or in part by skill-based errors, or those committed while performing familiar tasks due to sensorimotor or attention failures, and those involving device malfunction were higher than those for events that did not involve these errors. Despite managers' promotion of organizational review for adverse events caused by coordination errors when acting on their own discretion, external reporting requirements mandated by state regulators shaped managerial decision-making when reviewing adverse events, constraining opportunities to review events at the senior level that did not conform to harm-driven regulatory priorities. Findings demonstrate that reporting regulation focused predominantly on outcomes can distort internal learning processes by shifting managerial attention away from adverse events that carry valuable information for organizational improvement and toward those yielding less new and actionable knowledge. These unintended effects suggest the need for separate compliance and learning activities in high-risk organizational settings subject to intensive regulation to ensure that the rules and norms governing internal structures for reviewing work process failure are aligned with learning goals.",Error; Incident review; Organizational learning,Errors; Hospitals; Regression analysis; Adverse events; Decision makers; Incident review; Internal learning; Internal structure; Learning Activity; Learning goals; Managerial behavior; Medical case; Medical center; Organizational improvement; Organizational learning; Organizational setting; Perceived risk; Service delivery; Severity of injuries; State regulators; Work process; Managers

Managerial crosscutting diversity exhibits a U-shaped relationship to performance while board crosscutting diversity moderates this nonlinear relationship.

Management consultants provide expert sensemaking to the organization that can be crafted to support the agenda of top management. Additionally, management consultants are expendable to the client organization, and this allows them to be used to effectuate experimental and risky organizational, technological, or strategic change. Finally, given that management consultants are expendable, they provide excellent scapegoats to top management if the desired outcomes are not achieved.

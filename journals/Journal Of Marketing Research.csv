"Power Distance Belief and Consumer Purchase Avoidance: Exploring the Role of Cultural Factors in Retail Dynamics","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174224745&doi=10.1177%2f00222437231182600&partnerID=40&md5=27cabd469b16c04016b2a5a87aab2575","A common problem faced by contemporary retailers is consumers’ tendency to avoid purchases that postpone or prevent cash flow for retailers, thus negatively affecting retailers’ sales and profits. Little is known about the factors that drive consumers to avoid purchases or about marketing tactics that may reduce the tendency, especially from a cultural perspective. The authors attempt to fill this gap by exploring the role of an important cultural variable, namely, power distance belief (PDB), on consumers’ tendency to avoid purchases. PDB is the extent to which people accept and endorse inequalities in society. A series of 14 studies (including 6 studies in the Web Appendix) using a variety of operationalizations of the key variables suggest that consumers high (vs. low) in PDB are less likely to avoid purchases (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) because they generally perceive greater constraints on their behavior (Study 2). These constraints are aversive, triggering the desire to overcome them and to have more as a compensatory mechanism, thereby reducing the tendency to avoid purchases. Accordingly, low (but not high) PDB consumers’ tendency to forgo purchases is significantly decreased when they perceive greater constraints on their choices and decisions (Study 3) and when they experience a high social density (Study 4). However, high (but not low) PDB consumers’ tendency to avoid purchases significantly increases when individuals perceive that constraints facilitate hierarchy (Study 5) or that constraints lead to positive outcomes (Study 6). Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © American Marketing Association 2023.","compensatory consumption; culture; perceived constraints; power distance belief; purchase avoidance tendency",""
"A Preemptive and Curative Solution to Mitigate Data Breaches: Corporate Social Responsibility as a Double Layer of Protection","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185150286&doi=10.1177%2f00222437231218969&partnerID=40&md5=2a9dc9fcd20e5cdc386ca6c112ed1e7f","Data breaches have the potential to weaken employee morale, corporate reputations, and customer and supplier relationships, while also disrupting marketing investments and financial performance. Research on reducing their frequency and harm focuses on tactical solutions, though breaches represent serious, even existential threats to firms. To date, research has not attempted to simultaneously address the closely connected phenomena of preventing and recovering from data breaches. The authors propose that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a strategic variable offering dual protection: reducing the likelihood of data breaches and attenuating harm when breaches occur. Drawing on stakeholder theory, the authors distinguish between internal (addressing primary stakeholders) and external (addressing secondary stakeholders) CSR. Study 1 shows that external CSR has no prophylactic effect, while moderate and high levels of internal CSR are equally effective at preventing data breaches, compared with low levels of internal CSR. Study 2 assesses mitigation following a data breach by examining (1) short-term effects (in the form of an event study on cumulative abnormal returns) and (2) long-term effects (with time-series analysis of Tobin's q). The results suggest that internal CSR props up financial performance only at high levels while the positive effect of external CSR is short-lived. © American Marketing Association 2024.","corporate social responsibility (CSR); data breach; data security; internal and external CSR; preemptive and curative strategies",""
"Omitted Budget Constraint Bias and Implications for Competitive Pricing","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153087418&doi=10.1177%2f00222437221145283&partnerID=40&md5=823c09b405ceecd750c7c1866f3e4e2c","Standard choice-based conjoint models often ignore or insufficiently approximate consumers’ budget constraints, despite the prominent role of budget constraints in economic theory. The authors offer a theoretically motivated improvement to the choice-based conjoint model that is especially appropriate for high-ticket durable goods and develop a Bayesian method for the inference of unobserved budget constraints. The proposed method leverages respondents’ stated budget constraints that suffer from measurement error and respondents’ financial demographic variables as additional information to reduce the dependency on functional form assumptions in the estimation. The authors show that accounting for budget constraints substantially increases model fit and the accuracy of competitive pricing in an industry-grade discrete-choice experiment on consumer preferences for high-end laptops. The proposed model performs better than the canonical linear price benchmark model, which is not flexible enough to approximate budget constraints. In theory, more flexible utility specifications, such as the nonlinear dummy price model, can approximate consumers’ budget constraints. However, they perform poorly when only finite data are available. The authors conclude that applied researchers in industry and academia will benefit from having a better tool for estimating budgets in high-ticket categories. © The Author(s) 2023.","Bayesian inference; budget restrictions; choice-based conjoint; competitive pricing; demand estimation",""
"The Art of Slowness: Slow Motion Enhances Consumer Evaluations by Increasing Processing Fluency","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165467454&doi=10.1177%2f00222437231179187&partnerID=40&md5=b13218e0a8aa1d8313bc5b84934466c8","Slow motion is a popular video editing tool used to enhance short-form videos (e.g., reels, stories, GIFs), which are commonly found in media entertainment and marketing communications. This research shows that slow motion increases the virality (e.g., likes, votes, views) of short-form videos and boosts brand liking, choice, and willingness to pay. The effect occurs because slow motion enhances the hedonic component of the viewing experience via processing fluency. By documenting how the success of slow motion is subject to moderators, this work shows marketers, entertainment producers, and everyday people how to use slow motion more effectively. Across a large-scale field data set and six experiments, the authors highlight that slow motion is especially effective when applied to short-form videos that are inherently pleasant and that involve complex movements that are difficult to perceive at regular speed. However, even simple movements benefit from slow motion when content creators zoom in on subtle movements to increase complexity. Moreover, slow motion is more effective when viewers engage in less elaborate processing. Finally, the authors show that the perceived disfluency of fast-motion editing is effective at boosting brand evaluations when viewers desire excitement. © The Author(s) 2023.","aesthetics; dynamic complexity; fluency; slow motion; social media",""
"Intransitivity of Consumer Preferences for Privacy","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144189933&doi=10.1177%2f00222437221122994&partnerID=40&md5=6566cef42b476cc6b84e500a20edfa95","Consumers frequently exchange their private personal data with companies in return for goods and services, such as access to search results or social networks. The authors provide a normative criterion to help assess whether companies compensate consumers adequately for their private data in these exchanges. Across a series of 11 experiments, they find that individuals place a higher price on their private data when they sell them for money than when they barter them for goods. In an application of the compatibility principle in cognitive psychology, the authors also find in two additional experiments that this effect occurs because money is a more compatible medium for valuing private data than goods are, which increases the weight of the data in monetary valuations, raising the prices that participants demand for their private data in money compared with goods. This discrepancy in valuations constitutes a violation of procedure invariance and amounts to an intransitivity of participants’ preferences for privacy. The findings raise the question of whether companies are compensating consumers adequately for their data and whether the ubiquitous markets for privacy function efficiently. Accordingly, the authors point to a possible consumer welfare argument for antitrust regulation of technology companies. © American Marketing Association 2022.","behavioral economics; compatibility principle; consumer privacy; marketing automation; preference transitivity; privacy preferences; procedure invariance",""
"Past Imperfect or Present Perfect? How Dynamic Ranks Influence Consumer Perceptions","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195897854&doi=10.1177%2f00222437241248660&partnerID=40&md5=fd9016eb2529cdafba19fbc87211724b","While ranked lists are ubiquitous, research on how consumers interpret changes in the rank of an entity is limited. Across seven studies (including a study with web data and a Google AdWords field experiment), this investigation shows that consumers reward a rise in rank and penalize a decline in rank, and that psychological momentum associated with the rank change information underlies these effects. Further, rewarding a rise and penalizing a fall are moderated by consumers’ perception of the reason for the rank change, the nature of the entity, and the nature of the ranked list. The impact of changing rank is attenuated when the rank change is attributed to other entities on the list, when entities are considered nonmalleable, or when the list is updated more frequently. The investigation also identifies a specific case in which consumers do not extrapolate the direction of a change in rank into the future. In addition to contributing to theory, this research provides actionable insights and demonstrates practical ways in which managers can communicate dynamic ranks to enhance the benefit of an improvement in rank or attenuate the penalty from a decline. © American Marketing Association 2024.","dynamic ranks; psychological momentum; ranked lists",""
"Disentangling Product Comparisons with the Attribute–Hedonic Model","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189177566&doi=10.1177%2f00222437241230912&partnerID=40&md5=6758922674e4c2b64160a188a73fda86","Marketers often assume that consumers comparing products (e.g., two TVs) will show a hedonic contrast. In other words, a product seems more appealing and consumers are willing to pay more for it when it is compared with an unappealing competitor than when it is compared with a highly appealing one. However, hedonic judgments (e.g., how appealing is this TV?) are confounded with underlying attribute judgments (e.g., how big is this TV?), and it is important to delineate their effects. This article presents six studies to disentangle them and shows evidence for two separate effects in opposite directions: while a product’s attribute judgments contrast with those of a competitor, its hedonic judgments assimilate. Thus, marketing tactics based on the assumption of the hedonic contrast hypothesis can potentially backfire, reducing willingness to pay. More generally, this research reveals the hidden complexity underlying product comparisons. © American Marketing Association 2024.","assimilation; contrast; hedonic; product comparison",""
"How Do Fast-Fashion Copycats Affect the Popularity of Premium Brands?

Despite the purported negative impact of copycats, the effect of fashion copycats on high-end brands remains empirically unclear. Research on this topic has been impeded by the absence of a modeling framework to quantify fashion and by the lack of consumer-level data on fashion choices. The authors collect data on the posting behaviors of consumers on a fashion-specific social media platform and develop a dynamic structural model with deep learning image analytics to characterize consumers’ choices of brands and styles. Results suggest that fast-fashion copycats can both harm high-end brands (a cannibalization effect) and help them (a market expansion effect). The authors also identify both static and dynamic mechanisms that contribute to the market expansion effect: The affordability of mixing copycats with high-end brands boosts the number of high-end items featured in posts by financially constrained consumers (a static mechanism). In addition, good styles from copycats enable users to build their popularity on social media over time, which may increase the users' valuation of high-end brands and reduce the users' future costs via sponsorship opportunities (dynamic mechanisms). The results could inform policy makers about the potential consequences of prohibiting fashion copycats. © American Marketing Association 2023.","computer vision; copyright policy; deep learning; fashion analytics; social media",""

Specifically, the authors propose, and provide evidence in ten studies, that timbral sound quality in audio logos (i.e., roughness/smoothness) informs abstract judgments of brand personality (i.e., ruggedness/sophistication). Study 1 shows that the industry practice of altering instrumentation, and thus timbre, in audio logos can change personality perceptions of even well-known brands. This effect persists when the sound source is kept constant with various instruments (Studies 2a–2d), with a combination of instruments (Study 3), and in the absence of an identifiable sound source (Study 4). The authors test specific acoustic underpinnings of timbral sound quality perceptions (Study 4) and show that the effect on brand personality judgments is counteracted by incongruent sensory information from another modality (Study 5). The results of Study 6 suggest that the influence of timbral sound quality on brand personality perceptions is nonconscious, as consumers are unaware of the extent to which the stimulus affects their judgments. Study 7 shows downstream consequences for purchase intentions.

"Vertical Versus Horizontal Variance in Online Reviews and Their Impact on Demand","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145700935&doi=10.1177%2f00222437221107549&partnerID=40&md5=15d197e980fec1fda2244b18e8c42ef0","This article examines the differential impact of variances in the quality and taste comments found in online customer reviews on firm sales. Using an analytic model, the authors show that although increased variance in consumer reviews about taste mismatch normally decreases subsequent demand, it can increase demand when mean ratings are low and/or quality variance is high. In contrast, increased variance in quality always decreases subsequent demand, although this effect is moderated by the amount of variance in tastes. Since these theoretical demand effects are predicated on the assumption that consumers can differentiate between the two sources of variation in ratings, the authors conduct a survey to test this assumption, demonstrating that participants are indeed able to reliably distinguish quality from taste evaluations in two subsets of 5,000 reviews taken from larger data sets of reviews for 4,305 restaurants and 3,460 hotels. The authors use these responses to construct sets of reviews that they use in a controlled laboratory experiment on restaurant choice, finding strong support for the theoretical predictions. These responses are also used to train classifiers using a bag-of-words model to predict the degree to which each review in the larger data sets relates to quality and/or taste, allowing the authors to estimate the two types of review variances. Finally, the authors estimate the effects of these variances in overall ratings on establishment sales, again finding support for the theoretical results. © American Marketing Association 2022.","crowdsourced data; machine learning; quality and taste variance; review variance; text analysis; vertical and horizontal content",""

Specifically, the authors argue that, immediately after viewing moralized content such as human suffering, consumers believe that it is morally appropriate to sustain negative emotions (Study 1). Thus, after exposure to content related to human suffering (vs. other negative content), consumers view subsequent mood-sustaining consumption as morally appropriate and hedonic consumption as morally inappropriate (Study 2). Consequently, they avoid repairing their emotions through hedonic consumption because of their preference to engage in morally appropriate behavior (Studies 3 through 4b); this is particularly true for individuals who view themselves as more moral (Study 4b). These effects are mitigated when the hedonic consumption is morally relevant (Study 4a), rather than prototypically frivolous. This research offers clear prescriptions to marketers about when and when not to offer hedonic consumption as mood repair. By allowing people to pay respect to suffering victims, marketers can give consumers needed space to feel their compassionate emotions. © American Marketing Association 2022.","emotion regulation; hedonic consumption; mood repair; morality",""

However, existing research has focused mainly on attributes (e.g., average ratings) that are not fully controlled by firms; only limited research has investigated how controllable attributes (e.g., review display formats) affect consumers. Drawing on visual perception research, the authors examine the effectiveness of two prominent graphical display formats used by major e-commerce platforms: one that displays rating distributions in a proportional format (e.g., Amazon) and one that does so in a simple format (e.g., Google). The results indicate that due to the changes in graphs’ reference points caused by the shrunken x-axis in simple bar graphs, consumers respond more positively to an item when its rating distribution is displayed in a graphically simple (vs. proportional) format. This effect is moderated by the distribution's peak value (i.e., the share of the most frequent rating) and imbalance score (i.e., the difference between the share of positive and negative ratings). Furthermore, even an item's future ratings are influenced by the graphical format in which its prior ratings are displayed. The contributions to the marketing literature are discussed, and insights that can aid managers in making more informed decisions are provided. © American Marketing Association 2024.","bar graphs‌; graphical displays; online consumer reviews; perception; rating distribution",""

Although prior research has examined the effects of deal-oriented content that primarily offers promotions for a single product on shopper spending, the effects of inspirational content that sparks ideas (e.g., ways to use products) on spending are unclear. Inspirational content can affect spending differently from deal-oriented content as it activates stronger motivation for consumption goal completion. This article proposes that inspirational content activates stronger motivations for the consumer’s goal completion and therefore increases spending more than deal-oriented content does. The authors propose and empirically test the hypotheses using data from a set of experimental studies, a field experiment, and an eye-tracking study. The results show that inspirational content increases spending more than deal-oriented content or no content does. This effect is mediated by consumption goal completion, such that it is attenuated when consumers already have consumption goals or when the content detracts from inspiration-induced goals.

Do consumers prefer otherwise identical products made by larger or smaller companies? The answer hinges on whether consumers perceive the products as low-tech or high-tech. This prediction stems from a novel framework charting two lay theories regarding key resources companies utilize to provide value to consumers: employees and finances. In the intrinsic motivation lay theory, consumers believe that employees of larger (vs. smaller) companies are less intrinsically motivated. In the financial resources lay theory, consumers believe that larger (vs. smaller) companies have greater capacity to fund research and development. Critically, product type (low-tech vs. high-tech) differentially affects the accessibility of these two lay theories: For low-tech (vs. high-tech) products, the intrinsic motivation lay theory is more accessible, driving quality evaluations and choice in favor of smaller companies. For high-tech (vs. low-tech) products, the financial resources lay theory is more accessible, driving quality evaluations and choice in favor of larger companies.

Specifically, the authors argue that high-UA (vs. low-UA) individuals are more (vs. less) brand loyal when shopping online than when shopping offline because the product experience is less predictable in the former (vs. latter), a distinction between online and offline shopping that increases (reduces) high-UA (low-UA) individuals’ tendency to stay with the brands.

Are you inclined to tell the prospective buyer, “Unfortunately, it is foggy outside. If it were not foggy, the view would be even better!”? Eight studies, spanning diverse domains, reveal a novel discrepancy: most presenters (e.g., the seller) choose to communicate such upward counterfactual information (UCI) to experiencers (e.g., the prospective buyer), believing it will enhance experiencers’ impressions (e.g., of the house)—yet UCI actually worsens their impressions. This discrepancy arises because presenters insufficiently account for the fact that they possess more knowledge about the presented target than experiencers do; they fail to realize that noting an imperfection reveals it. Accordingly, when experiencers are knowledgeable about the target, either because the imperfection is obvious or because they can easily envision the upward counterfactual, the discrepancy attenuates. Finally, the presenter–experiencer discrepancy occurs only when the counterfactual information is upward, such that presenters do not overcommunicate downward counterfactual information, which rules out a desire to share any information as an alternative mechanism for presenters’ communication decisions. Together, this research highlights the prevalence and costs of sharing UCI. © American Marketing Association 2022.","communication; counterfactual thinking; egocentrism; prediction errors; self–other asymmetry",""

Lobbying does not alter product quality, so an efficiency perspective would suggest no relationship. However, a legitimacy-based institutional theory perspective and associated regulation models suggest that lobbying reduces voluntary firm-initiated and mandatory regulator-initiated recalls. To provide insights into these questions, the current study explores nine years of multisource data from the automotive industry, related to recalls and lobbying. The results, obtained with an instrumental variable approach, support dual impacts of lobbying for reducing both voluntary and mandatory recalls. Defect severity and media coverage moderate the effects, and the data support full indirect moderation, such that the interaction between media coverage and lobbying mediates the interaction between defect severity and lobbying. In terms of effect sizes, approximately $404,367 ($1.66 million) more in lobbying expenditures is associated with one fewer voluntary (mandatory) recall, assuming a typical average recall of 235,638 vehicles.

This poses a challenge for policy makers and social marketers alike, given the substantial impact descriptive norms have on behaviors in the health domain. The authors propose a new way to address this challenge by identifying what they call the “uptrend effect.” This effect encourages descriptively nonnormative, healthy behaviors through uptrend messaging that makes salient actual increased engagement in those behaviors over time without referencing an objective descriptive norm. Across seven experimental studies, including studies conducted in the field and measuring real behaviors, this research demonstrates that uptrend messaging leads recipients to infer greater descriptive normativity for the target behavior, which subsequently improves engagement. The authors identify theoretically and practically relevant boundary conditions, showing that the uptrend effect is attenuated when the growth in a behavior is driven by a dissimilar group or when the message explicitly states a descriptive norm. They also demonstrate that uptrend messaging outperforms other norm-based approaches. The theory and findings of this research inform scholars, policy makers, and marketers by providing actionable and easy-to-implement techniques to encourage behaviors that improve consumer quality of life. © American Marketing Association 2023.","health behavior; messaging; social norms; trend information",""

In five studies, the authors demonstrate that sellers have a lower willingness to accept when selling heritage goods to buyers with a shared heritage connection relative to buyers without this connection (i.e., a heritage discount). This heritage discount cannot be explained by ingroup favoritism, sentimental value, or appropriateness of buyer usage and persists even when sellers perceive that the buyer has a higher willingness to pay. The authors provide process evidence that the effect of the buyer's identity on the seller's willingness to accept is driven by concerns about heritage loss.

Whereas prior work primarily studies CMPs in simplified experimental settings, actual fast-moving consumer goods markets are considerably more complex; ergo, consumers are unlikely to consider and evaluate all brands and CMPs in detail. In this analysis based on 63 CMPs across 20 categories, the authors therefore investigate the short-term sales impact of CMPs as a function of the brand and category context in which they are executed. On average, CMPs run 11 weeks and donate 3.2% of product price, resulting in an average sales lift of 4.9% per week. The findings suggest that a necessary precondition for CMP success is that consumers notice it at the point of sale and hence have considered the CMP brand for reasons other than the CMP itself. Accordingly, the sales impact of CMP can more than double when the category assortment is smaller, the category has less price dispersion, the brand is a category leader, or the brand is priced below the category average. Brands operating in less favorable market conditions can still achieve above-average CMP impact by combining CMPs with price promotions to ensure consumer consideration. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bayesian modeling; cause-related marketing; consideration-set formation; ethical buying behavior; price promotion; prosocial buying behavior; sales promotion",""

Owing to the rapid and sustained rise of digital media, an additional decision now operates at a micro level, namely, which specific customers to target with advertising. In the macro case, optimal control theory provides a powerful framework for firm profit maximization, specifically allowing for ad response, cost per medium, and discount rate, all in the presence of multiple competing brands. However, optimal control theory has never been applied to the situation of microtargeting individual customers. Consequently, in this study the author shows how optimal control theory can be adapted for application to individual customers. The author estimates a multinomial logit model with individual-specific advertising response parameters. In turn, these parameters are used to determine the optimal number of exposures each customer should receive for each advertising medium.

Indeed, the measurement of attitudes via natural language has influenced how marketing is practiced on a day-to-day basis. Yet recent findings suggest that sentiment analysis's current emphasis on measuring valence (i.e., positivity or negativity) can produce incomplete, inaccurate, and even misleading insights. Conceptually, the current work challenges sentiment analysis to move beyond valence. The authors identify the certainty or confidence of consumers’ sentiment as a particularly potent facet to assess. Empirically, they develop a new computational measure of certainty in language—the Certainty Lexicon—and validate its use with sentiment analysis. To construct and validate this measure, the authors use text from 11.6 million people who generated billions of words, millions of online reviews, and hundreds of thousands of entries in an online prediction market. Across social media data sets, in-lab experiments, and online reviews, the authors find that the Certainty Lexicon is more comprehensive, generalizable, and accurate in its measurement compared with other tools.

The authors examine this phenomenon using a quasi-experiment conducted by Zhihu, the largest online knowledge-sharing platform (or Q&A community) in China. Zhihu originally used a content-based filtering algorithm, which recommends content to users on the basis of the topics to which each user has subscribed. After more than a year, Zhihu moved to a social filtering algorithm, which recommends content with which users’ social connections are already engaged. The authors find that this algorithm change increased the creation of social ties by approximately 15% but decreased question subscriptions by 20% and answer contributions by 23%. The authors show that users’ increased social interests mainly involved following popular users, leading to a greater concentration of social interests on the platform. However, users’ topical interests became less concentrated, as popular topics received significantly fewer subscribers than unpopular topics. The authors explain these findings by exploring the underlying mechanism. They show that compared with content-based filtering algorithms, social filtering algorithms are more likely to expose general users to content consumed by their followees, who are more interested in niche topics than general users are. © American Marketing Association 2023.","algorithmic curation; consumption polarization; content-based filtering; social filtering; social network; user-generated content platforms",""

In eight studies (N = 7,515), the authors demonstrate that consumers perceive that they have made more progress on their goals when more (vs. less) self-control is required to choose to complete an identical goal-consistent task. This is because when consumers exert more (vs. less) self-control to choose a goal-consistent task over the goal-inconsistent alternatives, they infer higher commitment to the goal. The higher inferred commitment, in turn, leads consumers to perceive that future goal pursuit will be easier.

Thus, attention trajectories, as reflected in eye movements, predict the final brand choice of 85% of consumers before they implement it. Even when observing eye movements in only the first quarter of the decision process, attention already predicts brand choice much better (45%) than chance levels (20%). This superior prediction performance is due to a “double attention lift” for the chosen brand: The chosen brand receives progressively more attention toward the moment of choice, and more of this attention is devoted to integrating information about the brand rather than to comparing it with other options. In contrast, the currently owned brand grabs attention early in the task, and its attention gain persists for brand-loyal consumers and shifts for brand-switching consumers. A new attention and choice model used in tandem with the Bayesian K-fold cross-validation methodology on eye-tracking data from 325 representative consumers uncovered these attention trajectory effects.

Specifically, individuals with more integrated roles are more able to circumvent the constraints typically imposed by mental budgeting and earmarking; therefore, they are more likely to use funds that are allocated or budgeted for the purposes of one role to service the needs/wants of another role. This holds regardless of whether funds have been (1) allocated to a broader role-specific mental account for future expenditures or (2) earmarked for a specific purchase.

The authors theorize that because smartphones are considerably more personal and private than PCs, using them activates intimate self-knowledge and increases private self-focus, shifting attention toward individuating personal preferences, feelings, and inner states. Consequently, making choices using a personal smartphone, compared with a PC, tends to increase the preference for unique and self-expressive options. Six experiments and several replications examine the effects of personal smartphone use on the preference for unique options and test the underlying role of private self-focus.

They develop a dynamic structural model of consumption that enables them to investigate the probability of different types of label deviations (e.g., >4 g per day) and drivers of such behaviors. Label deviations are infrequent “tail area” behaviors, and the model uncovers them well. The analysis is based on a unique online consumption diary in which consumers select from two classes of acetaminophen products (single ingredient or a combination of ingredients) to treat their pain or non-pain-related symptoms. Consumers have a higher probability of taking >4 g of acetaminophen when they have multiple symptoms, and a variety of observable factors explain the individual propensity to deviate from the label.

One reason, the authors suggest, is that existing customers (referrers) view incentivized referring as an exchange activity that feels incompatible with their communal relationship with friends (referees), resulting in a psychological barrier (i.e., negative feelings such as discomfort, conflict, guilt, etc.). In seven studies (five preregistered, two in the field; N = 2,060) and one preregistered supplemental study (N = 176), the authors propose and find that disclosing the referrer reward in the invitation message—a not yet widely adopted method—can promote referring by making the referring action seem more compatible with communal norms and reducing the experienced psychological barrier.

The authors further identify three theoretically and practically relevant boundary conditions: (1) the relative reward amount (whether the referrer reward is greater than, equal to, or less than the referee reward), (2) the stated source of the referrer reward (the company or the referee's spending), and (3) the framing of the referral opportunity (whether it is already framed as a communal activity).

Study 2, a conjoint study, links the observable antecedents of the referring supplier–customer relationship to the choice of horizontal referrals.

In contrast to typical balance repayment, where consumers make repayments relative to a total amount owed, repayment-by-purchase prompts consumers to select items (e.g., a Starbucks coffee) or categories of purchase (e.g., restaurant and café purchases) and to make payments toward their related debt. A field experiment first suggests that customers who opted into repayment-by-purchase paid 12.18% more toward their statement balance than a control group. Subsequently, five lab experiments show that consumers repaying-by-purchase increase repayment by an average of 22.47% over typical balance repayment. Process evidence suggests that these differences may be driven by repayment-by-purchase's power to increase purchase salience, which in turns increases perceptions of progress toward reducing debt. Consistent with this theory, the effect of repayment-by-purchase on bill repayment emerges regardless of whether consumers repay durable versus nondurable goods, and for specific items or categories of purchases, as long as the bill uses labels that are concrete enough to raise past purchase salience. © American Marketing Association 2023.","consumer debt; financial decision making; goal progress; goal pursuit; personal finance",""

The authors outline two distinct initiatives—monitoring and community building—through which buying groups govern buyer–supplier exchange and impact supplier performance toward buyers. Two boundary conditions are identified for the performance efficacy of the buying group's governance efforts: the buyer's own governance of the supplier and the dependence relations among the focal parties. Analyses using two-wave primary data collected from the U.S. health care sector and replications using secondary outcomes indicate support for the proposed framework. The authors conduct a conjoint experiment to further enhance the generalizability of the findings and report that a buying group's monitoring of suppliers enhances supplier performance both by itself and with increasing supplier monitoring by the buyer firm.

In a set of hypotheses, the authors address how, why, and among whom parenting motivation affects a pervasive decision-making tendency, namely, variety seeking. Six studies, including a large-scale panel data study and five online and lab studies, show that, when shopping, parenting motivation spurs feelings of time crunch that result in less variety seeking among consumers. The effect is diminished when time-saving parenting support exists (which reduces feelings of time crunch in parenting), when consumers are led to believe that they have sufficient time available for shopping, and when they do not have much loyalty to any brand offered in the choice set and thus cannot save time by simply choosing the top-of-mind product option. The current research thus contributes to the growing literature on how parenting motivation affects consumer decision making. In addition, it augments the literature on variety seeking by identifying an important factor that can influence it. © American Marketing Association 2023.","feelings of time crunch; parenting motivation; variety seeking",""

Yet not all competitors are equal—over time, certain pairs of brands may develop special rivalry relationships. This research examines whether these relationships can alter the effects of interbrand communications. Drawing on rivalry theory, the authors distinguish between brand rivalry, a special competitive relationship between brands based on a shared history, and competition, a situation where brands merely have currently opposing goals. A series of studies using complementary methods (two archival studies using large-scale Twitter data and three preregistered experiments) provide evidence for the “rivalry reference effect” across multiple brands and product categories. That is, referencing a rival (vs. a nonrival) competitor in a public brand message increases consumer engagement. The effect is mediated by increased story embeddedness, defined as the perception that the reference is embedded within an ongoing story. The authors also show positive downstream effects on purchase intentions and test two moderators: brand preference (loyal vs. neutral consumers) and message valence (negative vs. positive). This research highlights the potential appeal of brand rivalry to consumers, illustrating how and under what conditions brands can use their rivalries to their advantage. © American Marketing Association 2024.","competition; consumer engagement; firm-generated content; rivalry; social media; storytelling",""

However, applying stigma theory allows novel insights into debt accumulation for middle-class individuals who access a variety of credit-related products. The authors define anticipated stigmatization of debt as the negative judgment and discrimination an individual expects to experience because of their consumer indebtedness. Results from a series of studies demonstrate that although financial stress motivates behaviors designed to reduce debt, debtors who anticipate stigmatization perform a variety of concealment behaviors (secrecy, social spending, and help avoidance) that hinder debt reduction and have negative effects on well-being. To understand how to help these individuals, the authors collaborated with a financial education company, designing a field experiment to examine the efficacy of a behavior change course. Individuals who anticipated stigmatization and formed new social connections in a community-based condition reduced their consumer debt. Although the emotional effect of community-based support has been examined in other stigma contexts, this study is the first to investigate the effect on well-being in a debt context and link social benefits to actual behavior change in terms of debt reduction behaviors and debt repayment. © The Author(s) 2023.","anticipated stigmatization; consumer debt; debt concealment; field experiment; financial decision making; stigmatization; well-being",""

While prior research on intertemporal choices has focused on choices for oneself, intertemporal choices often involve one individual choosing on behalf of another. How do intertemporal choices made for another person differ from otherwise identical choices made for oneself? This research introduces a self–other decision model that distinguishes reaction utility (derived from interpersonal feedback) from vicarious utility (derived from imagining the recipient's experience). The authors tested model-derived hypotheses in 13 experiments (N = 4,799) involving decisions between peers. Consistent with the proposed role of reaction utility in the model, they find that intertemporal choices made for others are typically more “impatient” than choices for oneself. Moreover, this “agent's impatience” is attenuated when contextual and individual differences weaken the anticipation of interpersonal feedback.

As the magnitude and direction of consumers’ response to CM are inconclusive, this meta-analysis synthesizes evidence on main and moderator effects from 237 studies. On average, the authors find a moderate effect for attitudinal response (d =.458) and a weak effect for behavioral response (d =.283; both ps <.001), both with high underlying heterogeneity. A multivariate meta-regression on CM moderators grounded along four conceptual pillars—transparency, signals of sincerity, purchase context, and consumers’ emotional attachment to CM—shows that attitudinal effects hinge mostly on emotional attachment. Suboptimal execution and poor communication of the donation appeal in particular can even have detrimental effects on attitudes. In addition, various moderators from other pillars play a relevant role. For behavioral outcomes, both emotional attachment and signals of sincerity are equally important. The visual prominence of the donation is the most relevant individual moderator, with only a few others related to the two pillars following at some distance. Therefore, CM requires different priorities depending on corporate objectives. This research further compares the effects of CM with those of discounts and other corporate social responsibility marketing instruments, simulates practical examples, and provides avenues for further research. © The Author(s) 2022.","attitude–behavior gap; cause-related marketing; corporate social responsibility‌; meta-analysis; prosocial behavior",""

In these maps, each product is typically visualized in a single map location. Such visualization, however, does not adequately accommodate multimarket membership products (MMPs), which are products that compete in multiple submarkets that are each characterized by distinct competitors and consumer preferences. The author proposes a novel framework that accommodates MMPs by visualizing products in the local context of each submarket in which they compete. This framework is then used to study market structure in the digital camera market. Competitive relationships are inferred from consumers’ online searches using bootstrapped neural product embedding. The research shows that 8% of cameras are MMPs and that 50% of all submarkets are affected by MMPs. The map generated with the proposed framework uncovers mismatches between manufacturer positioning and consumer perception of several cameras. An extensive comparison of the proposed framework with alternative mapping methods reveals that (1) commonly used mapping methods misrepresent MMPs’ competitive positions in their maps and (2) ignoring MMPs can lead to distorted visualizations of the underlying market structure. Both problems compromise firms’ abilities to accurately assess products’ competitive positions and evaluate the effectiveness of their positioning strategies. © The Author(s) 2022.","competitive market structure visualization; neural product embedding; online search; overlapping clustering",""

The authors partnered with UNICEF to launch three field experiments in Panamá among 2,418 children to examine four pillars of price discount promotions for children: what to discount (product selection), how to discount (message design), whom to target (children's age), and whether to discount again (repetition). They uncovered four previously undocumented insights. First, price discounts alone effectively increase demand among children 6–11 years of age, reconciling conflicting findings in prior literature. Second, product selection based on relative price—a particularly crucial factor in developing regions—drives opposing postpromotion effects: ironically, marketers should not discount expensive healthy options but rather moderately priced ones. Third, different from prior literature's practice of directly communicating final prices, discount messages that require older children to derive final prices are more effective. Fourth, repetition can amplify or undermine discounts’ efficacy depending on message complexity and children's age. This research offers concrete guidelines for researchers and practitioners, uncovering both positive and negative effects of price promotions on children, and shedding light on price promotion interventions that most powerfully nudge children of different ages to act. © American Marketing Association 2024.","children; developing economy; discount/coupon; field experiment; health; incentive; price promotion",""

The current work focuses on consumers’ perceptions of the simplicity or complexity of brands and a previously overlooked consequence of those perceptions. Results from six experiments and analysis of a proprietary customer satisfaction dataset from Consumer Reports (N = 147,600) show that when consumers think brands are simple, they judge them to be less likely to experience product or service failures. Although these lower risk judgments could be positive for brands, they can also lead consumers to punish simpler brands more in the event of failures. Results also suggest that consumers’ simplicity/complexity perceptions reflect the dimensionality of their mental representations of brands, and the relationship between simplicity and lower risk is attenuated when additional brand dimensionality is framed in terms of redundancy. The findings cast doubt on the degree to which evoking simplicity is a uniformly positive marketing strategy and encourage practitioners to more thoughtfully consider simplicity's implications for consumer and firm welfare. © American Marketing Association 2024.","brands; complexity; mental representation; risk; simplicity",""

The authors seek to theoretically examine whether publishers can collaborate and compete with the different types of news aggregators and, if so, what pricing and content-sharing strategies publishers should pursue. In the absence of a news aggregator, publishers sell their content as a composite publication; this intensifies interpublisher price competition and hurts publishers’ profits. A free aggregator, however, could help unbundle the articles of a publisher. Moreover, if publishers share articles on the same topic with a free aggregator, they can completely eliminate interpublisher competition and replace it with competition between the aggregator and the publishers, but they only partially eliminate interpublisher competition if they share articles on different topics with it. Yet, the free aggregator needs to bring sufficient additional traffic to the publishers to motivate them to share content and collaborate with it. Conversely, publishers will be willing to collaborate with a micropayment-facilitating aggregator even if it does not bring additional traffic to the publishers. This is because a micropayment-facilitating aggregator helps publishers unbundle their content and price discriminate. Lastly, publishers can be motivated to collaborate even with a subscription-charging aggregator that is powerful enough to dictate the terms of the revenue-sharing arrangement with the publishers. This is because the subscription-charging aggregator improves its profits without hurting the publishers’ surplus. © American Marketing Association 2023.","game theory; multisided market; news aggregation; platform-based marketing",""

Participative pricing occurs when people choose how much to pay for a good or how much they will sell it for. This pricing mechanism is increasingly common, for example, on platforms like Craigslist, eBay, or Etsy. A successful transaction requires that consumers converge on a mutually acceptable price, yet decades of research on the endowment effect show that sellers often demand more for goods than buyers are willing to pay. The authors propose that compared with traditional payment methods, when consumers use P2P payments they make somewhat more cooperative pricing decisions: buyers are willing to pay a bit more and sellers are willing to accept a bit less. This attenuates the endowment effect and increases the odds of a successful trade. This occurs because even when the trade is with a stranger, P2P payments can subtly activate a social transaction context, cuing the social transaction pricing norm of making more cooperative pricing offers. The authors test these proposals in eight studies using consequential and hypothetical choices, moderation, and mediated moderation. A simulation indicates that compared with traditional payment methods, the use of P2P payments can increase successful transactions in a marketplace by nearly 10%. © American Marketing Association 2022.","digital payment; mobile payment; P2P payment methods; participative pricing decision; person-to-person payment; social norms; social transactions; the endowment effect",""

The main focus is on Volkswagen cars other than the 2009–2015 diesel models—namely, vehicles that did not violate agency standards, enabling an assessment of whether the negative shock received by the emissions standards violators spilled over to other Volkswagen models that were in compliance.

Thus, there is a clear need to understand the magnitude and heterogeneity of the effect of FGC on movie demand and associated user-generated content (UGC). The authors empirically examine the complex interactions among FGC, UGC, and sales using social media (tweet) data that are normally available to firms. They investigate two potential mechanisms by which FGC may drive box office revenues: (1) a direct mechanism, such that users who see FGC directly drive revenue, and (2) an indirect “ripple effect,” by which FGC increases movie-related UGC, which then drives consumption. By analyzing 145,502 firm-generated and 5.9 million user-generated Twitter posts associated with 159 movies, the authors find a positive and significant effect of FGC on movie sales, which UGC fully mediates, which supports the indirect ripple effect reasoning. Impressions of FGC by followers of firm accounts, as opposed to nonfollowers of firm accounts, mainly drive the effect of FGC on UGC. In addition, FGC by movie accounts is more effective than that by actors and studios. Firms’ regular posts with a movie-specific hashtag are more effective than replies, retweets, and posts without the hashtag. The finding of the ripple effect suggests that movie executives should focus on creating FGC that sparks conversations among followers when new movies are released. © American Marketing Association 2023.","firm-generated content; microblogging; movies; online word of mouth; social media; Twitter; user-generated content",""

In the simplest mediation setting, the experimental treatment can affect the dependent variable through the mediator (indirect effect) and/or directly (direct effect).

To overcome this indeterminacy where possible, the authors develop the insight that a statistically reliable total effect, combined with strong evidence for conditional independence of the treatment and the outcome given the mediator, is unequivocal evidence for mediation as the underlying causal model into an operational procedure. This is particularly helpful when theory is insufficient to definitely causally order measured variables, or when the dependent variable is measured before what is believed to be the mediator. The procedure combines Bayes factors as principled measures of the degree of support for conditional independence, with latent variable modeling to account for measurement error and discretization in a fully Bayesian framework.

From a large-scale field experiment with real-world transactional data and five laboratory experiments, the authors document the asymmetric effects of VFR use conditional on consumer body types, characterize the theoretical underpinnings, and identify a systematic set of managerially actionable moderators that can mitigate adverse effects. Specifically, while VFR use enhances product evaluations and purchases among consumers with relatively low body mass index (BMI) levels, it negatively influences responses from high-BMI consumers due to self-image threat induced by avatars that resemble consumers’ own bodies. To cope with self-image threat, high-BMI consumers tend to shift the blame to the apparel item, resulting in negative product responses. The authors identify four feasible solutions to alleviate the negative responses among high-BMI users of VFRs, namely, promoting diversified beauty standards, featuring mannequin faces for VFR avatars, providing consumers opportunities to engage in prosocial behavior, and presenting high-status products.

Whether using a work–life positioning strategy is effective remains unclear, however. If this strategy signals work–life enrichment, it should increase consumers’ interest, but only if the product demands few resources from consumers. If the product instead demands substantial resources, a work–life positioning might inadvertently trigger perceptions of work–life conflict and lower consumers’ interest. To test these predictions, the authors partnered with three businesses to advertise their products, which impose varying resource demands, on social media using content that highlights the work–life interface or not. Analyses of ad click data support the predictions: Work–life ads are less effective than single-domain (work or life) ads if the advertising involves resource-demanding products, but they are more effective if it pertains to resource-undemanding products.

The authors examine advance selling in marketing channels to offer several insights. First, it is well established that a decentralized channel suffers from the issue of double marginalization; that is, the manufacturer and retailer both add positive margins when setting their prices, which results in inefficiently high retail prices. The authors find that, under a dynamic wholesale-price contract, advance selling can alleviate this double-marginalization problem and benefit the manufacturer, the retailer, and consumers. Second, the benefit of advance selling diminishes with the product's holding cost, the retailer's stockpiling ability, and the manufacturer's commitment to spot wholesale price. Third, with wholesale-price commitment, advance selling benefits the manufacturer and consumers but hurts the retailer; the manufacturer is better off making a price commitment only when its product's holding cost is sufficiently low and worse off otherwise. Last, the retailer's stockpiling ability decreases its own profit under a dynamic contract but increases it under a commitment contract. © American Marketing Association 2022.","advance selling; channel coordination; game theory; seasonal products",""

Using archival data and five experiments, this article tests a framework that outlines the unique role brands play in the labor market. The framework distinguishes between vertical and horizontal differentiation and shows that vertical brand differentiation is associated with lower pay, whereas horizontal brand differentiation is associated with higher pay. Employees are also vertically and horizontally differentiated, and firms high in horizontal brand differentiation pay more for employees who match their brands’ differentiating characteristics (i.e., brand-relevant complementarities). Results show that these brand–pay relationships have important downstream effects on employee behavior and, consequently, on firm profits. Specifically, leveraging vertical brand differentiation to lower pay represents a false economy because profits are attenuated by negative effects on employee productivity and retention. In contrast, when managers at firms high on horizontal brand differentiation pay more, profits increase via the same mediating employee behaviors. Six firm strategies and investments that influence firm bargaining power in the employee–brand matching process are found to moderate the brand–pay relationship and downstream effects on profits. © American Marketing Association 2023.","bargaining power; brand differentiation; employee differentiation; employee-based brand equity; employees; labor market; matching; pay",""

Seven studies show that people are more likely to donate to a charity that uses autonomous aid appeals than immediate aid appeals. The authors generalize this effect to various contexts and examine it with actual donation behavior. They find that managerially relevant boundary conditions support a serial mediation model first through perceptions of impact and then by feelings of hope for the recipient's future.

The authors implemented a large-scale randomized field experiment with an app firm to test the causal effects of such pricing and product design strategies. Results show that both soft landing and exclusive secondary offerings decrease existing app users’ willingness to subscribe, but there is a positive interaction between these two strategies on subscriptions.

Such variable rates are particularly common in loyalty programs in the hospitality industry. In this research, the authors show that the stability of the exchange rate—whether the exchange rate is fixed or variable across offers—systematically influences point redemption. Consumers are less likely to redeem loyalty points and instead spend money when they observe a variable exchange rate between money and points than when they observe a fixed exchange rate, even when the average value of points is the same. This effect is demonstrated in a series of studies across contexts, including an incentive-compatible retail loyalty program and a hotel loyalty program. The findings show that a variable point exchange rate induces more optimism than a fixed exchange rate, reducing point redemption. This effect is moderated by individual differences in optimism and by point expiration date. The authors conclude by discussing the implications for managers of loyalty programs and for consumers.

Theorizing and interviews with shoppers suggest a potential reason for this week-part difference: Shoppers are more mentally depleted on weekdays (vs. weekends). A final study demonstrates and tests mental depletion as the driving factor for how shoppers are affected by music during different week parts. When consumers are depleted (e.g., on weekdays) music increases affect, which mediates the impact of music on sales.

The authors apply the proposed model to investigate topics driving browsing and purchase activities in an online deal marketplace of fashion products and explore how preference structures evolve over time. They find commonalities and differences in the topics that drive the browsing and purchase stages of online shopping processes. In general, browsing covers a broader range of product attributes than purchases. Consumers tend to browse products of premium positioning and/or deep discounts in the deal marketplace, but when purchasing, they tend to gravitate toward lower-tiered products at their original prices and modest depths of discounts. The authors illustrate how insights from the proposed model can be utilized to profile consumers based on their price preferences and to improve personalized product recommendations.

Results from the analysis of sales data from Amazon and seven experimental studies demonstrate that consumers’ preference for older brands decreases with their expectations of category innovativeness. The rationale is that with expectations of category innovativeness, consumers place less importance on consistency-related brand traits (e.g., stability, reliability) and more on excitement-related brand traits (e.g., dynamic, adventurous). Because older brands are associated with consistency, preference for older brands diminishes with expectations of category innovativeness. Further, this research identifies two factors that moderate the effects of category innovativeness on preference for older (vs. younger) brands. First, familiarity with the older brand moderates the effect of category innovativeness on brand preferences such that category innovativeness increases preferences for younger brands only when consumers are choosing between unfamiliar brands. Second, consumers’ need for uniqueness reduces the effect of category innovativeness on preferences for younger brands. Together, the findings suggest that the dominance of older brands reduces with expectations of category innovativeness.

Using a data set of 7.4 million reviews associated with 3.5 million photos from Yelp, and applying machine learning algorithms, the authors quantify the similarity of the content between text and photos. They find that, overall, photos increase the helpfulness of a review. More importantly, though, greater similarity between photos and text heightens review helpfulness more. The authors then validate algorithm-based similarity assessments with similarity perceptions of human judges. Using real-world reviews from Yelp and carefully designed stimuli, they replicate the core findings in five laboratory experiments. Further, testing the underlying mechanism, they find that greater similarity facilitates the ease with which consumers can process the review, which, in turn, increases that review's helpfulness to consumers. Finally, they show that factors that impede the ease of processing (e.g., language difficulty or poor image quality) can reduce the effect of similarity on helpfulness.

This assumption is at odds with the large body of literature studying incomplete information and the role of the consumer's “evoked set” or “consideration set.” The author develops a novel empirical discrete-choice demand model derived from an underlying theory of consumers' rational inattention. The model distinguishes between factors that shift demand through the utility function, such as prices and product attributes, and factors that shift demand through the consumer's information “evaluation costs.” The author conducts an empirical case study of the laundry detergent category. Using a set of exclusion restrictions based on retail promotional instruments, specification tests select the rational inattention model over the conventional full-information discrete-choice model. Exploiting the launch of Tide Pods midway through the sample, the author demonstrates the role of evaluation costs for the measured value creation from a new product. A conventional discrete-choice model always assigns positive incremental consumer value from new products. However, the rational inattention model developed herein finds a decrease in overall consumer welfare from the new Tide Pods’ entry, with the increased friction in information associated with the larger choice set offsetting the potential gains from higher match value. © American Marketing Association 2022.","consideration; consumer welfare; discrete-choice consumer demand; rational inattention",""

This study documents the changes to marketing conduct elements and their effectiveness due to the introduction of soda tax across more than 200 retail stores in five markets. Findings related to price changes are consistent with prior literature; in addition, the study reveals a substantial, hitherto overlooked decrease in promotional frequency (−2%), promotional depth (−12%), and feature promotion frequency (−14%) compared with matched control markets, exacerbating the tax's negative sales effect. Introducing a soda tax also considerably influences the marketing conduct's effectiveness, such that consumers become less sensitive to changes in regular price, feature promotions, and the depth of the promotional discount but respond more to the presence of promotions. Importantly, marketing conduct and effectiveness changes do not align (e.g., while consumers become more sensitive to promotion frequency, managers often reduce them), a relevant insight for policy making. © The Author(s) 2023.","difference-in-differences; marketing conduct; marketing effectiveness; public health; soda tax",""

Across 12 experiments (total N = 27,227, five preregistered), the authors demonstrate that when a video ad depicts a product in slow motion (vs. regular speed), consumers perceive the featured product or brand as more luxurious. The effect emerges across various product categories (chocolate, shampoo, mineral water, wine) and in different countries (United States, United Kingdom, France). Tests of mediation and moderation suggest that the effect occurs because viewing a slow-motion ad increases feelings of immersion, which lead consumers to expect greater hedonic value from the featured product and thus view it as more luxurious. Consistent with this account, the effect weakens when video blurriness or buffering impairs the immersive viewing experience afforded by slow motion, and the effect attenuates among consumers who are very weakly or very strongly predisposed to experience immersion. Finally, by enhancing perceptions of luxuriousness, slow motion subsequently boosts consumers’ desire for the featured product or brand (as manifested by higher willingness to pay, purchase intentions, and ad click rates), particularly when the goal to consume luxury is salient (vs. not). © American Marketing Association 2023.","digital marketing; hedonic value; immersion; perceptions of luxuriousness; slow motion; video advertising; video speed",""

Whereas prior work focuses on choices for the self (others) as based on self-needs (other-needs), the authors theorize when and why self-choices involve consideration of other-needs. Five studies, including a nursery school field study, test the effect of choosing healthy food for a child on the healthiness of parents’ self-choices, focusing on the role of anticipating potentially sharing self-choices with one's child. Potential sharing increased parents’ likelihood of making an unhealthy subsequent self-choice if they first made a healthy choice for their child. This effect was driven by parents’ present-focused parenting concerns about whether one's child would eat and enjoy healthy options chosen for them. This effect was mitigated when parents instead had future-focused parenting concerns. Additionally, this effect was mitigated after making an initial choice for the child that was (1) unhealthy or (2) healthy but relatively liked by the child. This research contributes to understanding how choices for others shape choices for the self and offers important marketing and policy implications. © American Marketing Association 2023.","caregiving; child; choices for others; food; parent; relationships; sequential choice; sharing",""

However, many consumers dislike being tracked, and, furthermore, repeat advertising may lead to ad wearout. The authors develop a model with consumers, an advertiser, and an ad network to investigate, under the preceding considerations, the impact of regulations that endow consumers with the choice to opt in to or out of online tracking. The authors find that, if ad effectiveness is intermediate, opting in to tracking decreases ad repetition; otherwise, opting in increases ad repetition. To make an opt-in decision, a consumer weighs the cost of ad wearout from repeat ads against the benefit of obtaining potentially relevant product information from them, and the consumer opts in to tracking if either ad effectiveness is intermediate or sensitivity to ad wearout is low. This opt-in pattern creates counterintuitive implications; for instance, higher ad effectiveness, even though it implies higher ad valuation for the advertiser, may reduce repeat ads and the ad network's profit. Under regulation that requires consumer consent for tracking, the results shed light on when and why consumers give such consent, and provide useful insights for practitioners and policy makers. © American Marketing Association 2023.","ad wearout; consumer purchase journey; consumer tracking; privacy regulations",""

While prior research has established the importance of habits in consumer behavior, little work has been done to understand the implications of routines—which the authors define as repeated behaviors with recurring, temporal structures—for customer management. One reason for this dearth is the difficulty of measuring routines from transaction data, particularly when routines vary substantially across customers. The authors propose a new approach for doing so, which they apply in the context of ridesharing. They model customer-level routines with Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes, leveraging a novel kernel that allows for flexible yet precise estimation of routines. These Gaussian processes are nested in inhomogeneous Poisson processes of usage, allowing the authors to estimate customers’ routines and decompose their usage into routine and nonroutine parts. They show the value of detecting routines for customer relationship management in the context of ridesharing, where they find that routines are associated with higher future usage and activity rates, and more resilience to service failures. Moreover, the authors show how these outcomes vary by the types of routines customers have, and by whether trips are part of the customer's routine, suggesting a role for routines in segmentation and targeting. © The Author(s) 2023.","Bayesian nonparametrics; customer management; customer relationship management; Gaussian processes; machine learning; ridesharing; routines",""

Using auditory, tactile, and visual properties of text, PARA detects nonverbal communication cues, aspects of text often neglected by other word-based sentiment lexica. This work is the first to reveal the importance of textual paralanguage as a critical indicator of sentiment valence and intensity. The authors further demonstrate that automatically detected textual paralanguage can predict consumer engagement above and beyond existing text analytics tools.

One common criterion for selecting an influencer partner is popularity. While some firms collaborate with “mega” influencers with millions of followers, other firms partner with “micro” influencers with only several thousand followers, but who also cost less to sponsor. To quantify this trade-off between popularity and cost, the authors develop a framework for estimating the follower elasticity of impressions (FEI), which measures a video's percentage gain in impressions (i.e., views) corresponding to a percentage increase in the number of followers of its creator. Computing FEI involves estimating the causal effect of an influencer's popularity on the view counts of their videos, which is achieved through a combination of (1) a unique data set collected from TikTok, (2) a representation learning model for quantifying video content, and (3) a machine learning–based causal inference method. The authors find that FEI is always positive, averaging.10, but often nonlinearly related to follower size. They examine the factors that predict variation in these FEI curves and show how firms can use these results to better determine influencer partnerships. © American Marketing Association 2023.","causal inference; deep learning; heterogeneous treatment effects; influencer marketing; representation learning; video data",""

Specifically, the authors theorize that simultaneously offering consumers the opportunity to adopt a farsighted behavior now or later (i.e., offering “simultaneous precommitment”) may signal that the behavior is not urgently recommended; however, offering consumers the opportunity to adopt that behavior immediately and then, only if they decline, inviting them to adopt it later (i.e., offering “sequential precommitment”) may signal just the opposite. In a multisite field experiment (N = 5,196), the authors find that simultaneously giving consumers the chance to increase their savings now or later reduced retirement savings. Two preregistered lab studies (N = 5,080) show that simultaneous precommitment leads people to infer that taking action is not urgently recommended, and such inferences predict less adoption of recommended behaviors. Importantly, offering sequential precommitment increases inferred urgency, predicting greater adoption. Together, this research advances knowledge about the limits and potential of precommitment. © The Author(s) 2023.","choice architecture; farsighted decisions; field experiment; inference making; precommitment",""

This research examines how consumers think about flexibility during goal pursuit, for themselves and others. Flexibility involves leaving details of a plan, such as when to go to the gym or what to eat, open or easy to change, whereas rigid plans determine those details in advance. Here, several studies across a variety of goals show that people usually choose rigid plans for others. However, people are more likely to opt for some flexibility in their own plans. This occurs because many people believe flexible plans are less effective, but also more appealing (or less unpleasant), than rigid ones. Choosing for oneself, versus for someone else, increases the degree to which one follows one's heart (i.e., relies on feelings and desires), which makes people more likely to choose the more appealing option, flexibility. Asking people to “follow their heads” instead (i.e., rely on logic and reason) causes people to choose similar (rigid) plans for themselves and others. Finally, the authors use this framework to increase preferences for rigid fitness plans in a field experiment. This research provides insight into the psychology of flexibility and how to nudge consumers to set themselves up for success. © American Marketing Association 2023.","decision making; flexibility; follow your heart; self/other differences",""

Building on existing automated text analysis methodologies linking word lists to sentiments, MEMSA adds metaphors that associate topics with sentiments across domains. Using MEMSA, researchers can leverage the sentiment potential of these located metaphors and scale insights to the level of big textual data by employing a dictionary approach enhanced by a specific and useful linguistic property of metaphors: their predictable structure in text (something is something else). This article shows that metaphors add associative detail to sentiments, revealing the targets and sources of sentiments that underlie the associations.

A preregistered experiment and three replications examined the extent to which intended claiming age is a function of theory-driven interventions, individual difference measures, and relevant interactions between interventions and individual differences. The interventions that increased intended claiming age were those that suggest that delayed claiming may be the right choice (i.e., injunctive norm, information about the commonality of regret), those that highlight the financial benefits from delayed claiming (i.e., gains framing, focus on benefits to the future self), and those that guide preference construction through self-reflection (i.e., focus on right-tail longevity, reason generation). In addition, intertemporal discounting, subjective life expectancy, and perceived ownership of SSA benefits predicted intended claiming age.

Although positive effects of time scarcity promotions on consumer interest have been evidenced in the brick-and-mortar world, should retailers expect similarly robust effects online? The present research suggests the answer may be no. First, the authors report meta-analytic and experimental results suggesting that previously identified positive effects of time scarcity promotions observed offline may not emerge in online shopping contexts. Then, consistent with the prediction that online time scarcity promotions activate more persuasion knowledge than identical control promotions, the authors detail findings suggesting that providing retailer-exogeneous justifications for online time scarcity promotions’ time restriction (e.g., consumers’ birthdays, seasonal changes) can increase the potential of observing positive effects on consumer interest online. Further, results suggest that the positive effects of including exogenous time justification may be more likely when less time remains until the online promotion’s expiration. However, results stop short of suggesting that online time scarcity promotions will consistently yield superior outcomes compared with identical online control promotions. Therefore, the authors highlight the continued need for careful managerial use as well as further research examining the optimal translation of offline tactics to online retail. © American Marketing Association 2022.","digital marketing; online marketing; promotion; scarcity; time scarcity",""

The factor model approach to estimate treatment effects accommodates a large number of control units and can easily handle a large number of treatment units while flexibly allowing for cases where the treatment is outside the range of the control units. However, the factor model method lacks formal inference theory, instead relying on bootstrap or permutation procedures with strong assumptions. Specifically, the extant Xu (2017) bootstrap procedure requires that the treatment and control error variances are equal. In this research the authors establish that when this assumption is violated, the bootstrap procedure results in biased coverage intervals. The authors develop a formal inference theory for the factor model approach to estimate the average treatment effects on the treated. The approach enables formal quantification of uncertainty through hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. The inference method is applicable to both stationary and nonstationary data. More importantly, the inference theory accommodates treatment and control unit outcomes with different distributions, which includes different error variances as a special case.

How do such restrictions affect consumers’ information processing? Building on the proposition that people strategically allocate cognitive resources, the authors hypothesize that consumers of content that cannot be viewed repeatedly consider the risk of failing to process it sufficiently and, consequently, allocate more cognitive resources to its processing (e.g., by increasing viewing time). The authors test this hypothesis in ten preregistered online studies (total N = 17,620), an exploratory analysis of eye-tracking data, and a field study on Facebook's advertising platform. Across the studies, they find that making content ephemeral elevates consumers’ perceived risk of missing information; consequently, it increases attention allocation, prolongs voluntary viewing time, and magnifies focus on relevant information. These effects have important downstream consequences, including improved content comprehension and recall, enhanced positive attitudes, and increased efficiency of sponsored content placement on social media.

While existing research shows that customers are willing to pay extra for this uniqueness, the present investigation points to a potential cost of self-customization that has been largely overlooked thus far. Specifically, the authors argue that what creates value for the individual consumer-designer (i.e., the original customer of the self-customized product) might conversely be detrimental to potential customers on the secondhand market, particularly in the context of aesthetic (vs. functional) customization. Results of three distinct data sets (including an analysis of more than 500,000 preowned car sales listings) support this uniqueness-hurts-resale hypothesis and provide a series of more nuanced findings. Consistent with the theorizing and empirical studies, three follow-up experiments show that although consumer-designers’ valuations are positively affected by uniqueness, uniqueness indeed negatively affects secondhand-market customers’ willingness to pay. This is because the more unique a given configuration is to a given consumer-designer, the lower the likelihood that said design will meet secondhand-market customers’ taste preferences. The findings point to a tension between maximizing utility at first purchase and minimizing the related cost of aesthetic customization at resale. © American Marketing Association 2023.","aesthetics; customization; design; resale; secondhand market; uniqueness",""

An increase in consumers’ hostility mediates these effects. Feminine brands that employ aggressive branding cues (e.g., the color red) can also benefit from failure messaging. Additionally, the benefits of failure messaging are enhanced when people do (vs. do not) take responsibility for their failures, and this moderating effect is intensified (weakened) when failures are attributed to unstable (stable) causes.

Dr. Oz, a celebrity physician, often makes medical recommendations with limited or marginal scientific evidence. Although reputable news agencies have traditionally acted as gatekeepers of reliable information, they face the intense pressure of “the eyeball game.” Customer reviews, despite their authenticity, may come from deceived consumers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether public information sources can correct the misleading health information. In the context of over-the-counter weight loss products, the authors carefully analyze the cascading of information post endorsement. The analysis of extensive textual content with deep-learning methods reveals that legitimate news outlets respond to Dr. Oz's endorsement by generating more news articles about the ingredient; on average, articles after the endorsement contain higher sentiment, so news agencies seem to amplify rather than rectify the misleading endorsement. The finding highlights a serious concern: the risk of hype news diffusion. Research articles react too slowly to mitigate the problem, and online customer reviews and product discussions provide only marginal corrections. The findings underscore the importance of oversight to mitigate the risk of cascading hype news. © American Marketing Association 2021.","health care; hype news; misinformation; natural language processing; Oz Effect",""

They may watch several YouTube videos in the same category or view several thematically similar artistic images on Instagram in a row, finding it difficult to stop. What causes individuals to choose to consume additional media on a topic that is similar to (vs. different from) what they just experienced? The authors examine a novel antecedent: the consecutive consumption of multiple similar media. After viewing multiple similar media consecutively, more consumers choose to (1) view additional similar media over dissimilar media or (2) complete a dissimilar activity entirely, even when the prior consumption pattern is externally induced. The rabbit hole effect occurs because of increased accessibility of the shared category: when a category is more accessible, people feel immersed in it and anticipate that future options within that category will be more enjoyable. The authors identify three characteristics of media consumption that contribute to the rabbit hole effect by increasing category accessibility: similarity, repetition, and consecutiveness of prior media consumption. This research contributes to literature on technology, choice, and variety seeking, and it offers implications for increasing (vs. slowing) similar consumption. © American Marketing Association 2022.","anticipated enjoyment; categorization; choice; immersion; media consumption; persistence; similarity",""

Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual framework and investigate whether and to what extent providing AI assistance to service employees improves service outcomes. The randomized controlled trial in the context of tutoring services shows that helping service employees (tutors) adapt to students’ learning needs by providing AI-generated diagnoses significantly improves service outcomes measured by academic performance. However, the authors find that some tutors may not utilize AI assistance (i.e., AI aversion), and factors associated with unforeseen barriers to usage (i.e., technology overload) can moderate its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, tutors who significantly contribute to the firm's revenue relied heavily on AI assistance but unexpectedly benefited little from AI in improving service outcomes. Given the wide applicability of AI assistance in a variety of services marketing contexts, the authors suggest that firms should consider the potential difficulties employees face in using the technology rather than encourage them to use it as it is. © American Marketing Association 2021.","AI aversion; artificial intelligence; field experiment; one-on-one tutoring services; technology overload",""

In such context, this article focuses on how people react toward brands with national associations when the nation faces threats perpetrated by institutions. Institutions are important as they are one of the core elements defining national identity. Institutional threats to national identity can come from within the nation (internal threat) and from outside (external threat). Weekly supermarket scanner data from 2004 showed that sales of American-sounding brands declined in counties that saw higher coverage of the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal (internal threat), and sales of American-sounding brands increased in counties with more war casualties (external threat). Seven additional experiments demonstrated that (1) self-enhancement derived from national identity mediates these main effects, (2) advertisements that refocus attention on how the brand helps cope with external threats mitigate the negative effects of internal threats for American brands, and (3) such advertisements do not mitigate the negative effects of internal threats for non-American brands. Qualitative surveys (N = 218), surveys (N = 1,603), experiments (N = 3,123), and secondary data analyses (encompassing sales of over 8,000 brands across more than 1,100 U.S. stores) were used to triangulate the results. © American Marketing Association 2023.","advertising strategy; brand choice; external threats; internal threats; mitigation; national identity; social identity",""

This article compares six methods for latent moderation analysis: multigroup, means, corrected means, factor scores, product indicators, and latent product. It reviews their use in marketing research, describes their assumptions, and compares their performance with Monte Carlo simulations. Several recommendations follow from the results. First, although the means method is the most frequently used method in the review (95% of articles), it should only be used when reliabilities of the moderation variables are close to 1, which is rare. Then, all methods except the multigroup method perform similarly well. Second, the results support using the factor scores method and latent product method when reliabilities are smaller than 1. These methods perform best with parameter and standard error bias less than or equal to 5% under most investigated conditions. Third, specific settings can warrant using the multigroup method (if the moderator is discrete), the corrected means method (if moderation variables are single indicators), and the product indicators method (if indicators are nonnormally distributed).

Such discrimination is not only morally wrong and illegal; it is also bad for business. Therefore, the authors also show when and why racial discrimination is mitigated: namely, when Black customers signal higher socioeconomic status, or a Black customer's company (for which they seek the loan) has a more complex and sophisticated legal structure (corporation vs. sole proprietorship). Exploring this mitigation effect further, the authors show that a more sophisticated business structure increases the employee's trust toward Black customers, which reduces the perceived default likelihood and increases the likelihood to offer a loan; yet, this process does not emerge for White applicants.

Such a ratchet effect arises when a retailer feels compelled to modify its investments to better serve the end customers in order to hide positive prospects and restrain future wholesale price hikes. In a two-period model of supply chain interactions, the authors demonstrate that such an endogenous ratchet effect can have multifaceted reverberations. A retailer fearing price hikes may be tempted to curtail near-term profits to ensure favorable long-term pricing. In response, the supplier can use deep discounts in its initial wholesale prices to convince the retailer to focus on its short-term profits rather than long-term pricing concerns. These deep discounts not only encourage mutually beneficial investments but also alleviate double marginalization inefficiencies along the supply chain. In light of these results, the authors show that a mandatory information disclosure policy to reduce the ratchet effect decreases total channel efficiency compared with no information disclosure, precisely because mandatory disclosure interrupts the healthy tension among supply chain partners. Thus, the model presents a scenario in which ratcheting concerns can create a degree of self-enforcing cooperation that results in socially beneficial responses in supply chains. © American Marketing Association 2021.","information disclosure; pricing; ratcheting; supply chains",""

Many online review platforms claim a role as guardians of trust in the information exchange process. Yet, little is known about the practices firms can utilize to design platforms that build and safeguard consumer trust. The authors draw on governance and identity disclosure literature streams to propose five practices that mitigate fakery and build trust in the platform: monitoring, exposure, community building, status endowment, and identity disclosure. Five studies (1) establish the individual and joint effects these practices have on platform trust, (2) identify the mediating processes by which the practices build trust, (3) verify the ecological value of the conceptual framework, (4) provide support of the salience of the practices, and (5) show how the practices build trust above and beyond review content–level characteristics. Interaction effects suggest that exposure, community building, and status endowment obviate the need for identity disclosure in building platform trust, a finding that mitigates related privacy concerns. Collectively, the findings can improve platform design, enabling review platforms to fulfill their promise of mitigating fakery and increasing trust. © American Marketing Association 2023.","conjoint experiment; fake reviews; mitigating review fakery; network governance; review intermediaries; review platform design; trust",""

Drawing on the conceptual metaphor literature, the author proposes that people interpret the abstract concept of risk using a more tangible concept: their location relative to the center or edge of a space. Five main studies (and a pilot) reveal the existence of a metaphorical association between risk and spatial location and show how this association systematically affects consumer risk-taking behavior. Specifically, people positioned closer to the edges (vs. center) of space are disproportionately more likely to seek (vs. avoid) risky choices. This phenomenon is demonstrated across various decision-making scenarios in the laboratory and field, using both physical and virtual manipulations of space. This effect occurs because being located closer to the edges (vs. center) evokes concepts related to risk (vs. safety), making risky (vs. safe) products easier to process and, as a result, more desirable. Moreover, this research sheds light on the effect characteristics and boundary conditions.

Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type.

One area of concern is the small proportion of women and people of color retained as film directors, coupled with little evidence of improvement in representation among widely released U.S. movies over time. In this study, the authors examine factors that explain gender- and race-related performance disparities in the movie industry. They estimate a two-stage model that accounts for the effects of selection in matching director gender and race to (1) projects of varying potential, (2) production budgets, and (3) the number of screens secured during distribution. They use instrumental variables for revenue, budget, screens, and audience reviews and find that once endogeneity and selection are captured by the models, gender- and race-based performance differences disappear. The results show evidence of biases favoring male, nonminority directors in project assignment, budgeting, and distribution. These biases are stronger for movies with female and minority lead actors but weaker for directors with high clout and for international directors. A matched-sample analysis illustrates that women directors produce similar outcomes with lower budgets and that minority directors produce outsized revenues with equivalent budgets. © American Marketing Association 2022.","box office revenue modeling; endogeneity; gender; minority film directors; minority leaders; motion pictures; movies; race; selection; women film directors; women leaders",""

Across five studies, the authors demonstrate that, relative to (1) high-SES consumers or (2) contexts of intragroup interaction, low-SES consumers are willing to pay higher prices and to accept lower-value rewards to avoid commercial settings that require intergroup interaction (e.g., poor consumers in a high-end shopping mall). This effect is driven by the poor consumers’ heightened expectations of discrimination in upscale commercial settings, a concern virtually nonexistent among wealthy consumers.

The author shows how the method can be extended to linear panel models by combining fixed-effects transformations with the common generalized least squares transformation to allow for heterogeneous intercepts. To account for between-regressor dependence, the author proposes determining the joint distribution of the error term and all explanatory variables using a Gaussian copula function, with the distinction that some variables are endogenous and the others are exogenous. The identification does not require any instrumental variables if the regressor–error relation is nonlinear. With a normally distributed error, nonnormally distributed endogenous regressors are therefore required. Monte Carlo simulations assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrate its superiority to conventional instrumental variable estimation. A specific advantage of the proposed method is that the estimator is unbiased in dynamic panel models with small time dimensions and serially correlated errors; therefore, it is a useful alternative to generalized-method-of-moments-style instrumentation. The practical applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated via an empirical example. © American Marketing Association 2022.","copula function; dynamic panels; endogeneity; fixed effects; instrumental variables; maximum likelihood; panel data",""

This article focuses on prevalent situations in which a score deviates from prior scores and examines how the presentation format of the scores impacts decision makers’ (e.g., consumers, managers) evaluations of the entity scored.

How can established organizations adapt to marketization? To answer this question, the authors study the adaptation of five established religious schools to the marketization of education in Brazil. They develop the novel hybridization strategy of nested coupling and explain that established organizations respond to marketization by balancing competing demands for differentiation and conformity.

Nested coupling provides a novel strategic approach for established organizations in marketized or marketizing fields, such as hospitals, museums, and schools, to capitalize on a logic that preexists marketization and to create a unique competitive positioning in the market. © The Author(s) 2021.","conformity; differentiation; education; institutional logics; marketization; resource-based theory",""

The authors use data covering over 1,600 brands from 14 product categories collected in 7 developed and 7 emerging Indo-Pacific Rim countries across more than 10 years to estimate marketing elasticities for line length, price, and distribution and examine which brand, category, and country factors influence these elasticities.

However, if prices can be negotiated, what impact does this initial perceived discount (IPD) have on the ultimate discount, demand, and revenue? With data from consumers of a large durable goods retailer, in a natural decision-making environment, this study provides evidence that a greater IPD is associated with smaller negotiated discounts. Then, a lab experiment involving negotiation and purchase decisions for multiple products, with randomly assigned values of the IPD, establishes that a $1 increase in IPD lowers the negotiated discount by 5.7 cents. Furthermore, 55% of this decrease can be attributed to reduction in the participants’ likelihood to initiate a negotiation. Under bargaining, almost one-third of the increase in revenue from a higher IPD stems from an increase in the negotiated price, which is unlike fixed pricing, in which setting an increase in IPD affects revenue only through changes in demand. Finally, the optimal advertised reference prices a seller would post under bargaining and fixed pricing are similar, but the benefit from posting this price is significantly higher under bargaining.

Using detailed viewership and game statistics data from broadcasts of tournaments of a popular video game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the authors compute measures of suspense and surprise for a rational viewer. They then develop and estimate a stylized utility model that underlies viewers’ decisions to both join and leave a game stream. The method used enables the authors to causally identify the direct effect of suspense and surprise on viewers’ utilities, separating it from other sources of entertainment value (e.g., team skill) and from indirect/supply-side effects (e.g., word of mouth, advertising). The authors show that suspense enters a viewer's utility but find little evidence of the effect of surprise. The magnitudes imply that a one-standard-deviation increase in round-level suspense decreases the probability of leaving a stream by.27 percentage points. The authors find no detectable effect of suspense and surprise on the decision to join a stream, ruling out indirect effects. Variation in suspense levels explains 9.2% of the observed range of the evolution of a stream's viewership. The authors use these estimates to evaluate counterfactual game and platform designs. They show that historical updates to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive game rules have increased tournament viewership by 4.1%, that rules can be further modified to increase viewership, and that alternative platform designs that inform joining users of games’ scores will additionally increase overall viewership by 1.3%. Together, these results illustrate the value of the authors’ method as a general tool that content producers and platforms can use to evaluate and design media products. © American Marketing Association 2022.","choice modeling; entertainment marketing; media consumption; platform design; preferences for information; product design; suspense and surprise",""
"How Does Global–Local Identity Affect Consumer Preference for Access-Based Consumption? Investigating the Mediating Role of Consumption Openness","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122689407&doi=10.1177%2f00222437211055130&partnerID=40&md5=5c930fcd65c1b380b3bc8e13088bb3aa","Given the increasing importance of the global sharing economy, consumers face the decision of whether to choose an access-based option versus an owned option. However, understanding of how consumers’ global–local identity may influence their preference for access-based consumption is rather limited. The authors fill this knowledge gap by proposing that consumers high in global identity (“globals”) have a greater preference for access-based consumption than those high in local identity (“locals”). Such effects are mediated by consumers’ consumption openness. Consistent with the “consumption openness” account, the authors find that when the desire for openness is enhanced by a contextual cue, locals’ preference for access-based consumption is elevated, whereas globals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. However, when the desire for openness is suppressed by a contextual cue, globals’ preference for access-based consumption is reduced, whereas locals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. Similarly, consumers’ traveler–settler orientation sets a boundary for the relationship between global–local identity and preference for access-based consumption, given its close association with consumption openness. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © American Marketing Association 2022.","consumption openness; global–local identity; preference for access-based consumption; sharing economy; traveler–settler orientation",""

By contrast, high-PDB consumers tend to prefer education products presented with cognitive appeal because of their outcome learning mindset, which focuses on acquiring skills and social/economic gains relevant to such skills. These effects were supported by converging results from four experiments, a field study, and a content analysis across 37 countries using a wide range of education products and services.

Second, creative documents are typically accompanied by summaries (e.g., abstracts, synopses). Accordingly, the author jointly models the content of creative documents and their summaries, and captures systematic variations in topic intensities between the documents and their summaries. This article validates and illustrates the model in three domains: marketing academic papers, movie scripts, and TV show closed captions. It illustrates how the joint modeling of documents and summaries provides some insight into how people summarize creative documents and enhances understanding of the significance of each topic. It shows that the model described produces new measures of distinctiveness that can inform the perennial debate on the relation between novelty and success in creative industries.

This research examines whether such debunking messages provided by these parties can impact consumer purchase behavior. If so, does debunking effectively correct consumers’ misinformed beliefs—an ideal outcome from a policy maker's perspective—or does it merely reinforce correct beliefs, as predicted by biased belief updating? With theory providing contradictory predictions, the authors design and implement a conjoint experiment that enables measurement of willingness to pay under exposure to real-world misinformation and debunking messages. Focusing on three ingredients in product categories where misinformation is prevalent (aluminum in deodorant, fluoride in toothpaste, and genetically modified organisms in food), the authors find that debunking plays an important role in mitigating the impact of misinformation. More specifically, debunking can attenuate the decrease in willingness to pay caused by misinformation by correcting misbeliefs, a promising finding for policy makers.

But how do these unsustainable behaviors influence each member of the couple? This research shows that how consumers respond to their partners’ unsustainable behaviors depends on the amount of relationship power they possess: high-relationship-power individuals compensate for their partners’ unsustainable behavior by acting in a more sustainable manner relative to their baseline tendencies, but low-relationship-power individuals do not increase their own sustainable behavior. This effect occurs because high-relationship-power partners feel more responsible for the reconstruction of the couple identity after it has been damaged by their partner's unsustainable choice; as a result, they have a stronger desire to signal a positive couple identity (i.e., a positive couple sustainable identity). Consistent with this theory, this effect is attenuated for high-relationship-power individuals who have weak green identities. Seven studies provide evidence for these findings by measuring and manipulating relationship power and assessing hypothetical and actual sustainable behaviors.

This effect does not depend on the helpfulness of the adviser (Study 2b) but is qualified by features of the recommendation itself (Study 3a) as well as the type of combination recommended (Study 3b). Importantly, the authors find this effect to have important downstream consequences, as the increased perceptions of expertise that follow a combinatory recommendation improve consumers’ attitudes both toward products included in the recommendation and toward subsequent recommendations made by the adviser (Study 4, Study 5).

A privacy notice, by placing legally enforceable limits on a firm's data practices, communicating safeguards, and signaling transparency, might be expected to promote confidence that personal data will not be misused. Indeed, most managers expected a privacy notice to make customers feel more secure (Study 1). Yet, consistent with the analogy that bulletproof glass can increase feelings of vulnerability despite the protection offered, formal privacy notices undermined consumer trust and decreased purchase interest even when they emphasized objective protection (Studies 2, 3, and 5) or omitted any mention of potentially concerning data practices (Study 6). These unintended consequences did not occur, however, when consumers had an a priori reason to be distrustful (Study 4) or when benevolence cues were added to privacy notices (Studies 5 and 6).

Across five experiments with both lab-created couples and married participants and financial data from a couples’ money management mobile app, the authors show that after making high progress on a joint goal (vs. low or no progress), partners with higher relationship power are more likely to disengage from the joint goal to pursue personal concerns (e.g., indulge themselves, pursue individual goals), whereas partners with lower relationship power do not disengage from the joint goal and continue engaging in goal-consistent actions that maintain its pursuit.

However, the effectiveness of these strategies in online learning platforms is uncertain. The authors examine this issue by assessing the impact of two different types of content sharing on learner engagement.

Because such indulgences accumulate resource costs (e.g., money, calories), consumers are often prompted to cut back, posing questions for how to design cutback programs with consumer appeal. This research distinguishes between frequent indulgences that consumers think of as social (vs. solitary), demonstrating that thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) decreases preferences to cut “frequency” (how often the indulgence occasion occurs) and increases preferences to cut “intensity” (choosing a within-category substitute that involves lower resource expenditure). The author explains these effects by differentiating between enjoyment from the product itself and enjoyment from aspects outside the product. Thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) heightens people’s anticipated enjoyment, particularly for aspects outside of the product, decreasing interest in cutting the number of occasions (cutting frequency) and increasing interest in cutting back on the product itself via a within-category substitute (cutting intensity). This divergence in cutback preferences for social (vs. solitary) experiences is thus eliminated (1) when consumers think of social experiences with distant (vs. close) others, which involve lower enjoyment outside of the product, or (2) when solitary experiences primarily involve heightened enjoyment for aspects outside of the product. © American Marketing Association 2022.","enjoyment; frequency; indulgence; intensity; social; solitary; substitution",""

This article explores the empirical effect of a change in context information provided by a private European ad exchange. Analyzing this as a quasi-experiment using difference in differences, the authors find that average revenue per impression rose when the exchange provided subdomain information to ad buyers. Thus, ad context information is important to ad buyers, and they will act on it. Revenue per impression rises for nearly all sites, which is what auction theory predicts will happen when rational buyers with heterogeneous preferences are given more information. Exceptions are sites with thin markets prior to the policy change; consistent with theory, these sites do not show a rise in prices.

In this article, the authors show that although consumers are willing to pay more for physical than digital goods, this difference attenuates—and even reverses—when consumers are asked to make a choice between the two product formats. This effect is explained by a contingent weighting principle: In willingness to pay, a quantitative task, consumers anchor on quantitative information (e.g., market beliefs). However, in choice, a qualitative task, consumers anchor on qualitative information (e.g., which good dominates on the most important attribute). These differences in contingent weighting result in physical goods being preferred in willingness to pay, but their digital equivalent being preferred relatively more in choice.

Online product images, videos, and virtual reality (VR) interfaces enliven consumer experiences and are a source of product information. Because consumers are unable to physically touch products in these digital environments, this research examines vicarious touch, or the observation of a hand in physical contact with a product in a digital environment. Across eight studies, the authors use images, GIFs, and VR to show that vicarious touch affects consumers’ psychological ownership and product valuation due to the active nature of product touch, which results in a felt sense of body ownership of the virtual hand. This is termed the “vicarious haptic effect.” Results demonstrate that it is not enough to show a hand in an advertisement; the hand must be touching a product. The vicarious haptic effect is strongest for people who become highly stimulated by an immersive VR experience (i.e., measured via the elevation in heart rate).

They focus on two aspects of historical price information: the direction and the frequency of past price changes. The authors advance a theoretical framework postulating that the interaction between these two factors shapes consumers’ decisions to buy now versus later. Controlling for the total magnitude of price changes, the authors propose that consumers are more likely to defer purchase when the price of the product has previously increased compared with when the price has decreased. Importantly, the authors hypothesize that this effect is more pronounced when consumers observe a single large change in price (e.g., a decrease of $100 vs. an increase of $100) compared with when they observe multiple smaller changes that establish a trend (e.g., four decreases of $25 vs. four increases of $25). The authors argue that these effects are driven by differences in consumers’ expectations about future prices.

This is surprising, since most food waste occurs at the retail and consumption stages of the food life cycle. This research fills this gap by examining how resource mindset and self-construal jointly shape consumer food waste. Specifically, inducing a scarcity mindset signals that there is no resource to waste, mitigating consumer food waste regardless of self-construal. In contrast, under an abundance mindset, where there is resource to waste, activating an interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal can effectively reduce consumer food waste. The authors identify sharing obligation, the tendency to share valuable resources with in-groups, as a key mechanism behind the effect. In support of this mechanism, enhancing sharing obligation (e.g., highlighting the sharing concept, highlighting others’ food needs) or diminishing it (e.g., highlighting family resource abundance) attenuates the effect of self-construal on consumer food waste under an abundance mindset. The results from one large-scale field study, four controlled experiments, and a country-level secondary data analysis provide convergent support for the proposed framework.

The model is particularly applicable for routinized exchange relationships, whereby centralized buyers periodically evaluate and choose contracts and then downstream users order items on contracted terms. The model captures different utility trade-offs for users and buyers while accounting for how buyer and user choices interact to influence user adoption/usage and buyer contracting. Further, the authors consider the dynamics induced by share-of-wallet (SOW) pricing contracts, commonly used in business-to-business markets to reward customer loyalty with discounts for buying more than a threshold share from a supplier. The authors assemble novel panel data on surgeons’ product usage, SOW contracts, contract switching, and hospital characteristics. They find two segments of hospitals in terms of the relative power of surgeons and buyers: a buyer-centric segment and a surgeon-centric segment. Further, they find that innovations diffuse faster in teaching hospitals and when surgical procedures are concentrated among a few surgeons. Finally, the authors answer questions such as these: Should the marketer focus on push (buyer-focused) or pull (user-focused) strategies? Do SOW contracts hurt the innovations of smaller firms? Surprisingly, the authors find that SOW contracts can help speed the diffusion of major innovations from smaller players. © American Marketing Association 2022.","B2B innovation; B2B markets; health care marketing; new product adoption; new product diffusion; organizational buying behavior",""
"Default Effects of Credit Card Minimum Payments","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126221061&doi=10.1177%2f00222437211070589&partnerID=40&md5=4288226f26adb01fca33c24a11d2d033","Credit card minimum payments are designed to ensure that individuals pay down their debt over time, and scheduling minimum automatic repayments helps people avoid forgetting to repay. Yet minimum payments have additional, unintended psychological default effects by drawing attention away from the card balance due. First, once individuals set the minimum automatic repayment as the default, they then neglect to make the occasional larger repayments they made previously. As a result, individuals incur considerably more credit card interest than late payment fees avoided. Using detailed transaction data, the authors show that approximately 8% of all of the interest ever paid is due to this effect. Second, manual credit card payments are lower when individuals are prompted with minimum payment information. In an experiment, the authors test two new interventions to mitigate this effect—a prompt for full repayment and a prompt asking those repaying little to pay more—yielding large counter effects. Thus, shrouding the minimum payment option for automatic and manual payments and directing attention to the full balance may remedy the unintended effects of default minimum payments. © The Author(s) 2022.","automatic repayment; consumer debt; credit card; default; inattention",""

This research classifies social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selfie images appear online: consumer selfies (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selfies” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selfie images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selfie images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement. © The Author(s) 2021.","deep learning; image analysis; interpretable machine learning; natural language processing; social media; user-generated content",""

This study investigates the association between the energy level in ad content and consumers’ ad-tuning tendency. Using a data set of over 27,000 TV commercials delivered to U.S. homes between 2015 and 2018, the authors first present a framework to algorithmically measure the energy level in ad content from the video of ads. This algorithm-based measure is then compared with human-perceived energy levels showing that the measure is related to the level of arousal stimulated by ad content. By relating the energy levels in ad content with the ad-tuning tendency using two empirical procedures, the authors document the following: overall, more energetic commercials are more likely to be tuned in or less likely to be avoided by viewers. The positive association between energy levels in ad content and ad tuning is statistically significant after controlling for placement and other aspects of commercials. However, the association varies across product categories and program genres. The main implication of this study is that advertisers should pay attention to components of ad content other than loudness, which has been regulated by law. © American Marketing Association 2022.","ad avoidance; ad tuning; advertising; audio information retrieval; multimedia data",""

First, in contrast to methods that rely on word frequency, they develop a deep learning convolutional–long short-term memory hybrid model to account for language structure. The convolutional layer accounts for spatial structure (adjacent word groups or phrases), and long short-term memory accounts for the sequential structure of language (sentiment distributed and modified across nonadjacent phrases). Second, they address the problem of missing attributes in text when constructing attribute sentiment scores, as reviewers write about only a subset of attributes and remain silent on others. They develop a model-based imputation strategy using a structural model of heterogeneous rating behavior. Using Yelp restaurant review data, they show superior attribute sentiment scoring accuracy with their model. They identify three reviewer segments with different motivations: status seeking, altruism/want voice, and need to vent/praise. Surprisingly, attribute mentions in reviews are driven by the need to inform and vent/praise rather than by attribute importance. The heterogeneous model-based imputation performs better than other common imputations and, importantly, leads to managerially significant corrections in restaurant attribute ratings. More broadly, the results suggest that social science research should pay more attention to reducing measurement error in variables constructed from text. © American Marketing Association 2022.","convolutional neural networks; customer satisfaction; deep learning; endogeneity; long-short term memory (LSTM); missing data; online reviews; text mining",""

Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades.

Despite their prevalence, little is known about how communications of no preference impact joint decision making and the consumption experience. Do consumers take the other party's indifference at face value? Does the decision become easier to make without one party's preference to incorporate? How will such communications ultimately impact consumption and social utility? In a series of six studies using both hypothetical and real joint consumption decisions, the authors find that recipients of no-preference communication infer that the co-consumer (i.e., the person communicating having no preferences) actually does have preferences but is not disclosing them. These perceptions of undisclosed preferences increase the decision makers’ decision difficulty and cause them to like the co-consumer less. Further, the authors find that the decision maker intuits that the co-consumer's (undisclosed) preferences are probably dissimilar to their own, which leads them to choose an option they like less and ultimately decreases their enjoyment.

The rapid growth of online video consumption brings new opportunities for marketing executives and researchers to analyze consumer behavior. However, video also introduces new challenges. Specifically, analyzing unstructured video data presents formidable methodological challenges that limit the use of multimedia data to generate marketing insights. To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel video feature framework based on machine learning and computer vision techniques, which helps marketers predict and understand the consumption of online video from a content-based perspective.

Online news publishers that rely on advertising income tend to perceive users’ adoption of ad blockers purely as a threat to revenue. Yet, this perception ignores the possibility that avoiding ads—which users presumably dislike—may affect users’ online news consumption behavior in positive ways. Using 3.1 million visits from 79,856 registered users on a news website, this research finds that ad blocker adoption has robust positive effects on the quantity and variety of articles users consume. Specifically, ad blocker adoption increases the number of articles that users read by 21.0%–43.2%, and it increases the number of content categories that users consume by 13.4%–29.1%. These effects are stronger for less-experienced users of the website. The increase in news consumption stems from increases in repeat visits to the news website, rather than in the number of page impressions per visit. These postadoption visits tend to start from direct navigation to the news website, rather than from referral sources.

The authors further demonstrate that initial pricing mistakes are largest for products whose demand conditions differ the most from those of previously privatized markets, that retailers with previous experience in the category are initially better informed, and that learning is faster for products with more precise sales information. These findings indicate that firm behavior converges to rational models of firm conduct, but such convergence takes time to unfold and plays out differently for different firms.

They further investigate the effect of positive (negative) momentum, or the positive (negative) deviation from the long-term expected performance on subsequent sales performance. Exploiting the differences in the social environment of the call centers, the authors find that the social working environment mitigates the harmful effect of negative momentum and sustains positive momentum. Further, they demonstrate that calls made midday, early-week, and late-week boost performance by mitigating the adverse effects of negative momentum.

Yet the prevalence of swear word use suggests that an offensiveness perspective may not fully capture their impact in marketing. This article adopts a linguistic perspective to develop and test a model of how, why, and when swear word use affects consumers in online word of mouth. In two field data sets and four experiments, the authors show that relative to reviews with no swear words, or with non-swear-word synonyms (e.g., super), reviews with swear words (e.g., damn) impact review readers. First, reviews with swear words are rated as more helpful. Second, when a swear word qualifies a desirable [undesirable] product attribute, readers’ attitudes toward the product increase [decrease] (e.g., “This dishwasher is damn quiet [loud]!”). Swear words impact readers because they convey meaning about (1) the reviewer and (2) the topic (product) under discussion. These two meanings function as independent, parallel mediators that drive the observed effects. Further, these effects are moderated by swear word number and style: they do not emerge when a review contains many swear words and are stronger for uncensored and euphemistic swear words (e.g., darn) than censored swear words (e.g., d*mn). Overall, swear words in reviews provide value to readers—and review platforms—because they efficiently and effectively convey two meanings. © The Author(s) 2022.","linguistics; meaning; profanity; review; word of mouth",""

Furthermore, the authors manipulate one specific mitigation strategy proposed by prior literature: the fostering of users’ realistic expectations regarding the accuracy of an algorithm. The results show that the effectiveness of the churn prediction application strongly depends on customer characteristics (most importantly the predicted churn probability and prior revenue) and salesperson characteristics (technology perceptions, abilities, and selling orientations). Fostering realistic expectations improves the effectiveness of the churn prediction only under very specific circumstances.

Contrary to common intuition, the research demonstrates that while the release of an upgraded product is received positively by nonowners of a previous version, this is not always the case for owners. The authors propose that owners respond unfavorably because the new upgrade increases perceived distance between the owners and the brand as the brand progresses forward with the enhanced products. That is, when the new product replaces an existing product the consumers own, consumers perceive that the brand is moving away from them. This negative effect of an upgrade is attenuated if the owners are provided with an extra source of connection to the brand.

These tasks typically ask a series of similarly structured questions. The authors posit that every time a respondent answers an additional elicitation question, two things happen: (1) they provide information about some parameter(s) of interest, such as their time preference or the partworth for a product attribute, and (2) the respondent increasingly “adapts” to the task—that is, using task-specific decision processes specialized for this task that may or may not apply to other tasks. Importantly, adaptation comes at the cost of potential mismatch between the task-specific decision process and real-world processes that generate the target behaviors, such that asking more questions can reduce external validity.

Respondents increasingly relied on task-specific decision processes as more questions were asked, leading to reduced external validity for both related tasks and real-world behaviors. Importantly, the external validity of measured preferences peaked after as few as seven questions in both types of tasks.

The authors propose this bias occurs in large part because (1) consumers base their predictions on typical expenses that come to mind easily during prediction, (2) taken together, typical expenses lead to a prediction near the mode of a consumer's expense distribution rather than the mean, and (3) expenses display positive skew (with mode < mean). Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions—and therefore prediction accuracy—by bringing atypical expenses to mind. Ten studies (N = 6,044) provide support for this account of the bias and the “atypical intervention” developed to neutralize it. © The Author(s) 2022.","accessibility; budgeting; consumer financial decision making; expense prediction bias; skewness; typicality",""

The authors test hypotheses regarding the role of project size, subcontractor diversity, and task configuration on product and process innovation. Their empirical tests show a pattern of nuanced effects on the two innovation types. A project's task configuration, as reflected in the general contractor's participation in project tasks, plays a coordination role that helps unlock a positive effect of project size on product innovation. At the same time, such participation impedes process innovation due to subcontractor concerns about information leakage. Study 2 bolsters the first study through a survey of 230 subcontractors in the U.S. construction industry to show how leakage concerns arise, their outcomes, and how they are mitigated.

To improve the public's voluntary compliance, governments and health authorities seek to publicize timely information about the pandemic. Yet social planners may exaggerate or downplay their private information about the disease's severity to elicit their preferred level of social distancing. This is because the relative weight they assign to the costs of isolation over public health may be unbalanced, and people may not fully consider how their social distancing may influence others’ infection risk. Consequently, messages and claims about the pandemic may be distrusted. The author investigates whether and when communication can be fully or partially credible despite apparent incentives for misrepresentation. The author finds that a government would communicate truthfully in equilibrium if and only if the disease severity levels are not too close to each other in the public's prior belief. Nevertheless, an increasing difference between the severity levels need not enhance the credibility of communication. Greater communication credibility may hurt social welfare. Moreover, as the government becomes more concerned about the costs of social distancing, its equilibrium messages may become more or less trustworthy.

The central thesis is that when retellers believe they are more (vs. less) knowledgeable than their recipient about the information they are relaying, they feel more compelled to provide guidance on its meaning and to do so in a persuasive manner. This enhanced motivation to guide persuasively, in turn, leads retellers to not only select the subset of facts they deem most essential but, critically, to provide their interpretations and opinions on those facts, with negativity being used as a means of grabbing their audience’s attention.

Six studies demonstrate that upper-class consumers are more likely to purchase a product with social costs when it has a higher price because they experience greater entitlement, which the authors term the “price entitlement effect,” allowing for purchase justification. In contrast, lower-class consumers do not feel entitled to purchase a product with social costs when it is higher-priced. This effect occurs because upper-class consumers tend to have a greater self-focus, with a higher price entitling them to more resources than others. Consistent with the entitlement mechanism, when egalitarian values are made salient, the price entitlement effect is mitigated, reducing upper-class consumers’ purchase of socially costly products. Notably, the price entitlement effect occurs only when products have social costs rather than for all higher-priced products. However, when the social costs of a product are severe, price entitlement does not sufficiently justify product purchase. This research provides theoretical and practical insights regarding when and why higher price entitles purchase of socially costly products, contributing to research on social class and socially responsible (vs. costly) consumption as well as choice justification. © The Author(s) 2022.","entitlement; green product purchase; price; social class; social costs",""

The authors propose a new regret function and explore its properties. Then, they propose a generalized framework of multiple goal pursuit and apply it to a utility maximization and regret minimization problem. Pareto-optimal sets are an outcome of multiple goal optimization problems where there are multiple alternatives that are nondominated. The proposed framework enables the authors to generalize a dual-goal problem as a constrained optimization problem where either utility is maximized subject to the constraint on regret or regret is minimized subject to the utility constraint.

Even with student loans, however, the authors find that students psychologically realize the financial costs of a college education long before their loan repayments begin. This early cost realization frames financial decisions between most pairs of colleges as an intertemporal trade-off. Students choose between investments with (1) smaller short-term costs but smaller long-term returns (a lower-cost, lower-return [LC-LR] college) and (2) larger short-term costs but larger long-term returns (a higher-cost, higher-return [HC-HR] college).

Preferences for LC-LR colleges are pronounced among financially impatient students and in choice pairs of LC-LR and HC-HR colleges where the equilibrium is set at a low-discount-rate threshold. A return-on-investment strategy, future uncertainty, and debt aversion cannot explain these results.

The findings further show that consumers use self-confidence as metacognitive information for inferring preference uncertainty in subsequent decisions.

For example, periods like 1:45 p.m.–3:15 p.m. and March 31–April 6 (boundary-expanded) feel longer than, say, 1:15 p.m.–2:45 p.m. and April 2–April 8 (boundary-compressed). Reflecting this, participants anticipated completing more work during boundary-expanded periods than during equivalent boundary-compressed periods. This effect appears to result from the salience and placement of time boundaries. Consequently, participants preferred scheduling pleasant activities for boundary-expanded periods and unpleasant activities for boundary-compressed periods. Moreover, participants were willing to pay more to avoid—and required more money to endure—a long wait when that wait was presented as boundary-expanded. Finally, data from more than 1.8 million rideshare trips suggest that consumers are more likely to choose independent rides (e.g., UberX) when they are boundary-compressed when the alternative shared option (e.g., UberPool) is boundary-expanded.

First, they argue that the move from waterfalling to header bidding was a revenue-improving move for publishers in the old regime when exchanges employed second-price auctions. Given the publisher move to header bidding, the authors show that exchanges move from second-price to first-price auctions to increase their expected clearing prices. Interestingly, when all exchanges move to first-price auctions, each exchange faces stronger competition from other exchanges, and some exchanges may end up with lower revenue than when all exchanges use second-price auctions; yet all exchanges move to first-price auctions in the unique equilibrium of the game.

To correct for endogeneity bias, the authors propose a new method that accounts for the regressor–error dependence using flexible semiparametric odds ratio conditional models; the approach requires neither parametric distributional assumptions nor tuning parameters for modeling endogenous regressors’ distributions conditional on the error term and exogenous regressors. Inference is achieved via optimizing the profile likelihood concentrating on the parameters of interest. The proposed approach requires no use of instrumental variables (IVs), observed or latent, that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction. Nonnormally distributed endogenous regressors are required for model identification with a normal error distribution. The approach's flexibility in capturing regressor–error dependence increases the capability of IV-free endogeneity correction and provides opportunities to improve the accuracy of causal effect estimation. Unlike existing IV-free methods, the proposed approach can handle discrete endogenous regressors with few levels, such as binary regressors or count regressors with small means, and is thus applicable to a plethora of applications involving such regressors.

In this article, the authors examine the causal effect of a subscription program on customer behavior. To account for self-selection and identify the individual-level treatment effects, they combine a difference-in-differences approach with a generalized random forests procedure that matches each member of the subscription program with comparable nonmembers.

The authors examine the impact of trademark rights on brand assets from the perspective of appropriability—that is, the firm’s ability to benefit from innovation and creativity. To ensure causal identification, they use a natural experimental context in which U.S. Supreme Court decisions on trademark rights provide an exogenous variation in strength of trademark rights. Using a database of trademarks registered in the United States and a difference-in-difference estimation approach, the authors show that, overall, trademark applications and applications to register in other categories increase when trademark rights are strengthened and decrease when trademark rights are weakened. However, trademarking responses of brands to a change in property rights are muted for design trademarks and amplified when a firm has multiple brands.

Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI failures? In 13 preregistered studies (N = 3,724) across a range of policy areas, the authors show that algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. This effect is termed “algorithmic transference” as it is an inferential process that generalizes (i.e., transfers) information about one member of a group to another member of that same group. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm to a greater extent than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Capturing AI's impact on consumers and societies, these results show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize. © American Marketing Association 2022.","algorithms; artificial intelligence; government; public policy; social categorization; social impact",""

Yet, for many durable goods, customers purchase extended warranties against which they rarely make claims. This study offers a reference-dependent-preferences-based theoretical explanation for why consumers purchase extended warranties even if their purchased good is already covered by a base warranty. The authors show that consumers treat base warranties as a reference point, thereby creating a qualitative difference in the valuation of an extended warranty on the purchased product. The proposed theory model is validated using observational data from the automobile industry and shows how the reference-dependent-preferences-based effect varies with vehicle quality and macroeconomic conditions. The analyses reveal auto buyers’ elevated loss-aversion motivations and higher price sensitivity during weaker macroeconomic conditions than during more robust macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the authors use the empirical model to identify opportunities for auto dealers to engage in targeted price promotions as a function of prevailing macroeconomic conditions.

In this research, the authors explore how a consumer’s global–local identity can affect consumer engagement with a global brand’s environmental sustainability initiative. Specifically, they examine consumer engagement in response to environmental messaging based on regulatory focus, spatial construal, and temporal construal. They theorize and find, across six experimental studies, that consumers with a strong global identity are more engaged with environmental sustainability initiatives when messaging includes frames congruent with their global identity, specifically promotion frames coupled with distant spatial frames and with proximal temporal frames. For consumers with a local identity, these regulatory and construal messaging frames do not impact consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives. Consumer environmental mindset mediates the effect of global–local identity on consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives when such congruent frames are used, and consumer eagerness to act provides additional process explanation for the asymmetric spatial (distant) and temporal (proximal) construal effects.

The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants’ preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies. Importantly, they find that participants are able to adapt their decision strategies to the environment they face, and thus the overall market outcome and the performance of each firm are influenced by both the competitive environment and the assumption on the extent of consumer optimality. © American Marketing Association 2020.","approximate dynamic programming; bounded rationality; competition; experiments; loyalty programs; promotions",""

Front-of-pack nutritional warning labels are a prominent regulatory tool to fight obesity and have been implemented or are currently being debated in many countries. Existing studies document that warning labels incentivize consumers to substitute away from unhealthy products. However, not much is known about equilibrium price changes in response to consumers’ utility for warning labels. Using household purchase data in the cereal category, this article studies the adjustments of prices after the mandatory introduction of warning labels in Chile. The authors develop a model showing that warning labels lead to higher prices of labeled cereals, as is also observed in data. In contrast, prices of unlabeled products tend to drop or at least increase less, incentivizing price-sensitive consumers to remain in the category. The authors decompose postlabeling market share adjustments into a pure label effect that fixes prices at initial levels after regulation and a total effect that accounts for price reoptimizations. Their findings point to self-enforcing effects of a warning label regulation as the price adjustments amplify policy makers' goal of reducing unhealthy food intake, especially because market forces incentivize low-income segments to choose healthier alternatives. © The Author(s) 2022.","equilibrium price adjustments; market segmentation; product differentiation; warning labels",""

In this research, however, eight studies provide converging support that indulgent consumption can have a positive effect: signaling interpersonal warmth. Specifically, consumers who post indulgent (vs. healthy) consumption content on social media are perceived as warmer (Study 1). The effect occurs because consumers believe that indulgent consumption is what people genuinely prefer, so indulgent (vs. healthy) consumption seems more authentic, and authenticity mediates the effect of indulgent consumption on perceived warmth (Studies 2a and 2b). Providing additional support for the authenticity mechanism, the authors show that the positive effect of indulgent (vs. healthy) consumption on perceived warmth is attenuated when the indulgent content is sponsored, which casts doubt on its authenticity (Study 3). Further, sharing sharing indulgent consumption can increase the appeal of a service provider among consumers who are seeking a warm service provider, but this occurs only when the content is not sponsored (Studies 4a and 4b).

Thus, consumers with high (vs. low) moral identity are more likely to comply with health messages when risk factor stigma is low, and this positive moral identity effect is undermined when risk factor stigma is high. The authors test stigma's threat to moral identity by measuring defensive processing (Studies 1 and 2) and the attenuating effect of self-affirmation on the negative effect of stigma (Studies 3 and 4). They apply the stigma-by-association principle to develop and test a messaging intervention (Study 5).

In this article, the authors examine under what conditions firms will differentiate through product quality versus advertising intensity. Firms select quality in a first stage, advertising in a second stage, and price in the last stage. The probability that a consumer is informed of a firm’s offering depends on its advertising expenditure. The authors find that when advertising is not cost effective, both firms choose a light ad spending. This allows them to minimally differentiate in quality without concern of intense price competition, as each firm has a segment of “captive” consumers. When advertising is moderately cost effective, one firm spends heavily on advertising. The rival advertises lightly, while choosing the same maximal quality level. This strategy softens price competition by inducing the heavy advertiser to price high more often to capitalize on its large captive segment. When advertising is very cost effective, both firms advertise heavily and differentiate in quality. Three extensions are examined: upfront fixed quality costs, continuous advertising levels, and simultaneous advertising and pricing decisions. This research reveals that letting market awareness be determined endogenously suggests less product differentiation than previously suspected and regions of advertising differentiation. © American Marketing Association 2022.","advertising; competition; differentiation; product quality",""

Making a more nuanced argument, this research proposes that certain material possessions—namely, favorite possessions—can mitigate the detrimental psychological effect of income inequality on SWB. In support of this proposition, experimental data from nine countries (N = 3,687) and social media posts from 138 countries (N = 31,332) converge to show that, while SWB generally declines as income inequality increases, encouraging consumers to attend to their favorite possessions can mitigate the negative effect of inequality on SWB. This is because attending to favorite possessions reduces consumers’ tendency to make social comparisons related to material resources and wealth, which otherwise arise when income inequality is high. Consequently, even when they perceive high income inequality, consumers feel less deprived relative to others, which buffers their SWB. These findings have meaningful consumer welfare implications. In particular, one way consumers can feel happier with their quality of life in an unequal society is to avoid comparing their material wealth with that of others and instead attend to the material possessions most special to them. © The Author(s) 2023.","consumerism; income inequality; special possessions; subjective well-being",""

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate.

Unlike ordinary stockouts caused by store-specific inventory policies, shortages involve the entire supply chain. One tool for managing shortages is imposing purchase limits. Purchase limits restrict the quantity each shopper can purchase of the scarce product (e.g., gasoline, toilet paper, sanitizers, meat, batteries), possibly increasing availability to other shoppers. Although altruistic stores might use purchase limits for egalitarian goals (e.g., reducing hoarding, waste, panic buying, arbitrage, unfair distribution), the authors find that profit-maximizing stores can use purchase limits to increase profits during shortages. These findings suggest that stores’ price-and-limit strategies depend on shortage severity, store size, competition, and seasonality. For moderate shortages, large multiproduct stores, where average shopping basket sizes are large, should maintain low prices and impose limits, whereas small stores should increase prices and not impose limits. For severe shortages, by contrast, large stores should keep low prices but not impose limits, whereas small stores should increase prices and impose limits. Generally, large stores benefit from increased future store traffic when they impose limits. Interestingly, purchase limits can improve both store profits and, with lower prices, consumer surplus. © American Marketing Association 2022.","competitive strategy; COVID-19; natural disasters; pandemics; pricing; purchase limits; shortages; store traffic",""

Using a 12-month longitudinal data set of 11,536 Airbnb properties, they find that Uber/Lyft's exit led to a 14% decrease in Airbnb occupancy in Austin. In response, hosts decreased the nightly rate by $9.30 and the supply by 4.5%. The authors argue that when Uber/Lyft exited Austin, the transportation costs for most Airbnb guests increased significantly because most Airbnb properties (unlike hotels) have poor access to public transportation. The authors report three key findings: First, demand became less geographically dispersed, falling (increasing) for Airbnb properties with poor (excellent) access to public transportation. Second, demand decreased significantly for low-end properties, whose guests may be more price sensitive, but not for high-end properties. Third, the occupancy of Austin hotels increased after Uber/Lyft's exit; the increase occurred primarily among low-end hotels, which can substitute for low-end Airbnb properties.

Over the span of ad exposure, while the predictiveness of emotion peaked early and fell, that of social cognition had a peak-and-stable pattern, followed by a late peak of predictiveness in perception and executive function. At the aggregate level, neural signals—especially those associated with social-affective response—improved the prediction of out-of-sample ad liking compared with traditional anatomically based neuroimaging analysis and self-report liking.

This effect occurred for both financial and nonfinancial incentives and when assessing review content across multiple natural language processing tools and human judgments. Incentives influence review content by modifying the experience of writing reviews. That is, when incentives are associated with review writing, they cause the positive affect that results from receiving an incentive to transfer to the review-writing experience, making review writing more enjoyable. In line with this process, the effect of an incentive on review positivity attenuates when incentives are weakly (vs. strongly) associated with review writing (i.e., incentive for “participating in an experiment” vs. “writing a review”) and when the incentive does not transfer positive affect (i.e., when an incentive is provided by a disliked company).

The theory suggests that when team members are heterogeneous in sales abilities, the proposed maximum contract (where the team output is set by the largest individual sales output) dominates the average contract (where the team output is determined by the average output of team members) in terms of overall team effort. This is because the stronger team member will exert higher effort under the maximum contract compared with the average contract, and this increase exceeds the decrease in the weaker team member’s effort. The authors validate the theoretical predictions by employing two laboratory experiments to provide a causal test of the theory and two randomized field experiments to deliver additional corroborating evidence.

Recently, Ticketmaster has entered and been trying to control the resale market by prohibiting consumers from reselling on competing resale platforms. Several states in the United States have passed or are discussing laws requiring tickets to be transferrable on any resale sites, worrying that platform integration—Ticketmaster controlling both the primary and the resale platforms—will increase ticket service fees and harm musicians and consumers. This article establishes a game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen: platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets, alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting the musician and consumers.

We outline a process whereby animated display enhances the visual salience of transitions in a trajectory (i.e., successive changes in data values), which leads to transitions being utilized more to form cognitive inferences about risk. In turn, this leads to inflated risk judgments. The studies reported in this article provide converging evidence via eye tracking (Study 1), serial mediation analyses (Studies 2 and 3), and experimental manipulations of transition salience (graph type; Study 3) and utilization of transitions (global trend; Study 4 and investment goals; Study 5) and, in the process, outline boundary conditions. The studies also demonstrate the effect of animated display on consequential investment decisions and behavior.

Approaches have been developed to ensure that research subjects provide honest and thoughtful responses. However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject’s utility function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances. The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task. “Gremlins,” in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power.

Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals’ perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4).

Using analytical and empirical analyses, the authors reveal the marketing strategies helping private nonprofit hospitals achieve higher output, prices, and profits than for-profit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals, focusing on both profits and output, obtain these outcomes by expanding their service mix with high-priced premium specialty medical services (PSMS), whereas for-profit hospitals can be more profitable with higher prices for basic services. Competition increases the differences between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in PSMS breadth, output, and prices. Nonprofit hospitals lose their competitive advantage when competing with other nonprofits; that is, presence of a for-profit competitor broadens available nonprofit PSMS. With broader service mixes, nonprofits focus more on national advertising than for-profits because PSMS (e.g., pediatric trauma, neurosurgery, heart transplants, oncology) require larger geographic markets than local basic services (e.g., laboratory, diagnostics, nursing, pharmaceutics). Exogenous, heterogeneous state regulations restricting for-profit hospital entry help econometric identification (i.e., markets prohibiting for-profits act as controls).

These ABIs are based on salespeople’s activity measures derived from their call reports. Despite their prevalence and theory-based expectations, there is a distinct lack of empirical work studying the sales productivity effects of ABI pay. With the cooperation of a large pharmaceutical firm, the authors conducted a three-year-long intervention based on a “treatment-removal” design. Their first intervention added modest ABI pay for frontline salespeople and their supervisors across 305 sales territories; the second intervention removed ABI pay from the salespeople; and the third intervention removed ABI pay from the supervisors as well, returning to the status quo. Using detailed territory-level data from the intervention in conjunction with syndicated market-level data and employing synthetic control procedures, the authors find sales gains of around 6%–9% from each of the two ABI interventions relative to the no-ABI baseline. These effects are moderated by the number of salespeople in a territory, with territories with more salespeople showing larger effects. Analyses of activity effects show that when supervisors are paid ABIs, they exert behavior control downward on salespeople. Managerially, both ABI schemes improve performance over an output-only pay plan. Between the two, a rudimentary gross profit impact calculation shows that ABIs targeted at supervisors alone are more efficient than ABIs targeted at both salespeople and their supervisors. The results support tying compensation to call reports despite the potential for self-serving biases in these measures because supervisors are able to exercise more behavior control with ABIs. © American Marketing Association 2021.","activity-based incentives; field experiments; principal-agent theory; sales compensation; synthetic control",""

The present research shows that, yes, consumers respond more positively to nongraspable products if a haptic cue (an object that is graspable or suggestive of hand action) is located within the same visual field as the target and is positioned to appeal to the viewer’s dominant hand. This result is driven by the creation and transfer of perceived ownership from cue to target.

Using data from a major online retailer, the authors show that Q&As complement consumer reviews: unlike reviews, questions are primarily asked prepurchase and focus on clarification of product attributes rather than discussion of quality; answers convey fit-specific information in a predominantly sentiment-free way. Drawing on these observations, the authors hypothesize that Q&As mitigate product fit uncertainty, leading to better matches between products and consumers and, therefore, improved product ratings. Indeed, when products suffering from fit mismatch start receiving Q&As, their subsequent ratings improve by approximately.1 to.5 stars, and the fraction of negative reviews that discuss fit-related issues declines. The extent of the rating increase due to Q&As is proportional to the probability that purchasers will experience fit mismatch without Q&A. These findings suggest that, by resolving product fit uncertainty in an e-commerce setting, the addition of Q&As can be a viable way for retailers to improve ratings of products that have incurred low ratings due to customer–product fit mismatch. © American Marketing Association 2021.","e-commerce; Q&A; reputation systems; user-generated content",""

The authors utilize store count and revenues for franchised and company-owned outlets of nationwide convenience store chains in 47 geographical markets in Japan between 1984 and 2010. The empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry threat. The simulation analysis highlights how franchising decisions in response to an elevated threat of entry may be beneficial (or harmful) for an incumbent firm, which yields key implications for firms, consumers, and policy makers. © American Marketing Association 2020.","entry accommodation; entry deterrence; franchising; organizational-form choice; retailing; threat of entry",""

The authors propose discrete choice experiments to holistically measure the link between attributes and benefits, as well as between attributes and choice, resulting in data that can be analyzed with a generalized probit model. The approach contributes to mediation research by offering an alternative method of handling multiple multinomial mediators and dichotomous outcome variables. An empirical illustration of bread choices shows how consumer judgments about health and value perceptions of products mediate purchase decisions.

Although the benefits of RBF are varied, some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits, such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF, those associations can generate negative mental imagery, which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present, demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process, with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively, this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations, such as the color green, consumer demand for RBF diminishes. Conversely, focusing on the societal benefits or limiting the number of cues available to create physical waste associations generates consumer demand for these foods on a level equivalent to that of conventional food. © American Marketing Association 2021.","corporate social responsibility; food waste; mental imagery; rescue-based food; sustainability",""

The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group’s realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents’ preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing.

Through six studies, the authors show that scented ads enhance consumers’ sense of proximity of the advertised product and consequently increase product appeal. In line with the proposed visceral nature of the effect, this effect holds even for unpleasant scents but is contingent on the scent’s ability to represent the advertised product. The effect is weakened when the product is physically close. The findings of this research have implications for when and why firms should use scented ads. © American Marketing Association 2019.","olfaction; product appeal; proximity; psychological ownership; scented advertising; sensory marketing",""

The latter have been consistently growing their footprints since. This study documents the role of television advertising to explain satellite operators’ success. Using data on U.S. households’ subscription choices and operators’ advertising decisions, the authors document both demand- and supply-side conditions conducive to the growth of the satellite operators. First, the authors find that consumers in this market were sensitive to advertising, and especially so to that of the satellite operators (ad elasticities of about.05–.06 for satellite operators vs.02 for cable operators). The authors employ a border strategy to demonstrate advertising-elastic demand and discuss its robustness to potential threats to identification. Second, the authors provide suggestive evidence that a form of asymmetric cost efficiencies in television advertising benefited the entrants more than the incumbents. Specifically, the unit costs of local advertising tend to be higher than those of national advertising, which likely allowed the satellite operators to better leverage their national presence with (cheaper) national advertising. Overall, this study highlights the interaction between advertising efficiencies and the scale of entry in explaining the competition between market incumbents and entrants. © American Marketing Association 2021.","advertising; border strategy; cost advantage; television service market",""

A promising means to do so is to leverage the digital presence of service employees on their website. A large-scale field study and several experimental studies show that the digital presence of service employees on the firm website increases current website service quality perceptions and positively shapes memories related to employee service quality perceptions from past service encounters. Both effects indirectly increase customer loyalty and, in turn, financial performance, and are amplified by employee accessibility and a service firm’s customer orientation. The authors examine further boundary conditions for the memory process: only service employees evoke the beneficial spillover effect to employee service quality perceptions, and the spillover effect does not generalize to evaluations of product quality. Remarkably, an employee’s digital presence, although factually unrelated, augments customer perceptions of service employees’ competence and commitment and thus strengthens rather than erodes service employees’ role in customer–firm relationships.

A robust finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater value on customized than on standard products because these unique products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers’ customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands. In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer’s expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers’ desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product’s signaling value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take customization too far.

In a series of online and field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using consensus language.

Two field studies and five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially focuses on internal motivations (e.g., “because I love it”) or external motivations (e.g., “because it is on sale”) for unplanned purchases at the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned purchases and consumers’ relative spending on unplanned purchases.

Despite their appeal, consumers may often be prompted to consider lower-calorie-package offerings instead (e.g., 100-calorie packs). The question thus arises: What predicts consumers’ preferences between different kinds of lower-calorie offerings? The authors conceptualize two different routes to lower-calorie versions of indulgent foods: a lower-caloric-density version (e.g., baked potato chips) or a smaller-portion-size version (e.g., a smaller bag of potato chips). The authors examine how such versions are differentially preferred and why, focusing on the key role of dietary restraint. The authors show that as dietary restraint increases, the preference for a lower-calorie version created via lower caloric density (vs. a smaller portion size) increases. Differential weights placed on health and fullness goals help explain differing preferences across dietary restraint (as the lower-caloric-density version is perceived as healthier and more filling, albeit less tasty, than the smaller-portion-size version). This framework offers theoretical implications for understanding two routes to cutting calories, practical implications for food marketers, and methodological implications for studying food choices. © American Marketing Association 2020.","calories; dietary restraint; healthiness; portion size; substitution",""

Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, the authors conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. The authors show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being suboptimal, such as postponing effort exertion (“hockey stick”) and not exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome (“giving up” and “resting on laurels,” respectively) may indeed be induced optimally by the firm. This is because, under certain conditions that depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate rewards on extreme demand outcomes. Doing this induces gaming and reduces expected demand but also makes motivating effort cheaper, thus saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods, this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, “hockey stick,” “giving up,” and “resting on laurels” can be optimal for the firm even under repeated short time horizon contracting.

Taking a different perspective, this study suggests that the way in which consumers evaluate an endorser (i.e., the cognitive process, such as applying family origin or achievement as the basis for evaluation) will carry over to the evaluation of the endorsed product (e.g., applying country of origin or performance as the criteria). Five experiments support this process-transfer account and show that it can be induced by subtle verbal/visual cues in advertisements. Because the process transfer is not inherently associated with positive/negative valence, it provides a theoretical rationale for explaining successful endorsements involving endorsers who are less favorable/credible, less of a “fit” with the product, or associated with some negative meanings, in addition to those involving positively or neutrally evaluated endorsers. The process-transfer model supplements existing models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of endorser effects.

Whereas prior research has shown that a default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer preferences may evolve across choices due to “spillover” effects from one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects. The findings show that firms’ setting of high-price defaults with the aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can backfire through the attenuation of spillover.

Ten studies show that the presence (vs. absence) of such food decreases the enjoyment of a concurrent (target) experience across a wide array of consumption activities, such as listening to music, evaluating pictures, and coloring. The presence (vs. absence) of food prompts mental imagery of consuming that food, which decreases engagement with the target experience, resulting in lower enjoyment. Consistent with prior work on mental imagery, the effect occurs only for food that is considered tasty; when a food’s functional benefits are highlighted, the effect disappears. In addition, the effect can be triggered in the absence of food when participants are explicitly instructed to engage in mental imagery. The authors demonstrate the role of engagement by showing that the valence of the target experience moderates this effect, such that the presence of food decreases enjoyment of positive experiences but increases enjoyment of negative experiences.

Moreover, research on identity-based consumption and negativity bias suggests that corporate political advocacy (CPA) is more likely to repel existing customers who oppose the CPA than to attract new customers who support it, implying that the net effect will be negative even if consumers overall are evenly divided in their support/opposition. In this research, the authors posit that despite this negativity bias in individual-level choice, the net effect of CPA at the market level is determined by a sorting process that benefits small-share brands and hurts large-share brands. This is because having few customers to lose and many to gain can offset the risk of the negativity bias in consumers’ identity-driven responses to CPA, potentially leading to a net influx of customers for small-share brands. Five experiments provide support for this theorizing and identify authenticity as a necessary condition for small share brands to benefit. © American Marketing Association 2020.","brand activism; choice share; corporate political advocacy; identity-based consumption; market share; negativity bias; political orientation",""

The authors examine whether a firm relies on information from benchmark leaders or similar peers to resolve disclosure uncertainty. A novel identification strategy, which uses partially overlapping strategic groups to mitigate simultaneity and correlated unobservables, shows robust evidence for herding effects among peer firms in the same strategic group. Moreover, firms are more likely to resolve disclosure uncertainty from similar peers rather than from benchmark leaders.

The proposed efficient, implementable learning algorithm is proven to rapidly converge to the optimal strategy while achieving zero regret and constituting a competitive equilibrium. This is the first algorithmic solution to the online knapsack problem to offer such theoretical guarantees without assuming a priori knowledge of object values or costs. Furthermore, it meets advertiser requirements by accommodating any valuation metric while satisfying budget constraints. Across a series of 100 simulated and 10 real-world campaigns, the algorithm delivers 98% of the value achievable with perfect foresight and outperforms the best available alternative by 11%. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be augmented to simultaneously estimate impression values and learn the bidding policy.

This research specifically examines reward-based crowdfunding, in which those who take part in the crowdfunding process receive the new product for which funding is sought in return for their financial support. This work illustrates that consumers make fundamentally different decisions when considering whether to contribute their money to crowdfund versus purchase a product. Six studies demonstrate that compared with a traditional purchase, crowdfunding more strongly activates an interdependent mindset and, as a result, increases consumer demand for social-good products (i.e., products with positive social and/or environmental impact). The research further highlights that an active involvement in the crowdfunding process is necessary to increase demand for social-good products: when a previously crowdfunded product is already to market, the effect is eliminated. Finally, it is demonstrated that crowdfunding participants exhibit an increased demand for social-good products only when collective efficacy (i.e., one’s belief in the collective’s ability to bring about change) is high. © American Marketing Association 2020.","collective-efficacy beliefs; construal level; crowdfunding; interdependent self-construal; social-good products",""

They find that attention allocation depends on, among other factors, the consumer’s prior belief about whether the product matches their needs and their unit information processing cost. A consumer processes both “confirmatory” and “disconfirmatory” information to their prior belief, but to different degrees under different conditions. In general, if the consumer has an extreme prior, or if the unit cost of processing information is high such that only a small amount of information is optimally processed, they process more confirmatory than disconfirmatory information; this offers a rational explanation for the phenomenon known as “confirmation bias.” The authors also find that a seller can benefit by influencing the consumer’s attention allocation by strategically choosing how much favorable and unfavorable information to make available for the consumer to process and by influencing the information processing cost, where the optimal strategy depends on the seller’s ability to adjust product price. Surprisingly, a seller has a lower incentive to suppress unfavorable information when the consumer has a worse prior belief about product fit.

Across six studies, the current research shows that consumers under life-role transition have more favorable attitudes toward distant (i.e., low- or moderate-fit) brand extensions than consumers who are not under life-role transition. The effect is driven by a sense of self-concept ambiguity associated with life-role transition, which subsequently prompts dialectical thinking that helps improve perceived fit between a parent brand and its extension, finally resulting in more favorable brand extension evaluation. This effect diminishes for (1) near (i.e., high-fit) brand extensions that do not require dialectical thinking for perceiving fit; (2) for sub-brand (vs. direct brand) architecture, for which there is less of a need to use dialectical thinking to reconcile the inconsistencies between a parent brand and its extension; and (3) when consumers perceive they have resources to cope with the life-role transition, which attenuates self-concept ambiguity.

The authors document a robust preference expression asymmetry wherein “requestors” soliciting others’ consumption preferences (e.g., “Where do you want to go for dinner?”) desire preference expressions (e.g., “Let’s go to this restaurant”), whereas “responders” instead do not express preferences (e.g., “Anywhere is fine with me”). This asymmetry generalizes under a broad set of situations and occurs because the requestor and responder roles differ in their foci. Compared to responders, requestors are more focused on mitigating the difficulty of arriving at a decision, whereas compared to requestors, responders are more focused on conveying likability by appearing easygoing. Responders thus behave suboptimally, incurring a “preference cost” (when masking preferences) and a “social friction cost” (requestors favor responders who express preferences). Requestors can elicit preference expression by conveying their own dislike of decision making, which increases responders’ focus on mitigating decision difficulty. The authors conclude by discussing the framework’s contributions to looking “under the hood” of joint consumption decisions. © American Marketing Association 2020.","joint consumption; no choice; no preference; preference expression; shared consumption",""

The lack of repeated observations for these customers poses a structural challenge for firms to infer unobserved differences across them. This is what the authors call the “cold start” problem of customer relationship management, whereby companies have difficulties leveraging existing data when they attempt to make inferences about customers at the beginning of their relationship. The authors propose a solution to the cold start problem by developing a probabilistic machine learning modeling framework that leverages the information collected at the moment of acquisition. The main aspect of the model is that it flexibly captures latent dimensions that govern the behaviors observed at acquisition as well as future propensities to buy and to respond to marketing actions using deep exponential families. The model can be integrated with a variety of demand specifications and is flexible enough to capture a wide range of heterogeneity structures. The authors validate their approach in a retail context and empirically demonstrate the model's ability to identify high-value customers as well as those most sensitive to marketing actions right after their first purchase. © The Author(s) 2021.","cold start problem; customer relationship management; deep exponential families; probabilistic machine learning",""

The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million) and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers. They segment customers by retailer-brand and channel usage, revealing a sizeable group of customers who shop across multiple retailer-brands and both purchase channels.

Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and cooperation from customers.

Whereas direct channel usage predominantly lowers agency conflicts in terms of information asymmetry and sales partner moral hazard, indirect channel usage amplifies moral hazard concerns. How those sales partner effects translate into manufacturer performance outcomes critically depends on governance mechanisms, confirming predictions from governance value analysis: formalization enhances performance outcomes for manufacturers in the case of indirect channel usage but diminishes performance in the case of direct channel usage.

The authors show that households likely to be earning the minimum wage increase their calories purchased in response to minimum wage increases, and that these gains are predominantly found among households purchasing the least amount of food prior to the minimum wage rising. Although the authors do not find evidence that the average household improves the nutritional content of calories purchased, they do find evidence that the least healthy households (as measured by past purchases) buy more healthy foods in response to rising minimum wages. Overall, the findings suggest that higher minimum wages may not only help households afford more calories but also encourage some households to purchase more healthy calories. In addition, the authors find an increased openness among minimum wage households to purchasing new grocery items.

According to this theory, the magnitude of product malfunctions can have a paradoxical effect on consumption experience. In particular, the less severe a product malfunction is, the more inclined consumers are to defer the initial decision about whether to take corrective action. Subsequent opportunities for corrective action are devalued relative to previously forgone ones. This dynamic tends to trap consumers in a state of inaction, resulting in their enduring smaller malfunctions longer than larger ones. A consequence of these inaction traps is that minor product malfunctions may result in less enjoyable overall consumption experiences than more severe defects. Evidence from eight experiments and a survey provides support for this theorizing by demonstrating the inaction-trap phenomenon, examining its downstream consequences, shedding light on the psychological dynamics of inaction, and identifying boundary conditions that suggest interventions for counteracting consumers’ vulnerability to suffering disproportionately from relatively minor product malfunctions. © American Marketing Association 2020.","consumer inaction; consumption experience; decision dynamics; enjoyment; product malfunctions",""

Yet this effect is likely moderated by the different types of brand-related messages or cues (e.g., logo, brand attributes) embedded in the ads and by the ways (e.g., explicitly or implicitly) these cues are conveyed to TV audiences. The authors thus measure 17 cues often used within ads to build brand awareness (or salience) and brand image and investigate their influence on ad effectiveness. Technically, the study builds a dynamic model to quantify the effects of advertising on sales; builds a robust and interpretable (i.e., nonparametric and sparse) factor model that integrates correlated, left-censored branding cues; and then models the effects of advertising as a function of the factors identified by these cues. An analysis of 177 campaigns aired by 62 brands finds that salience cues (e.g., logo) and benefit and attribute messages moderate ad effectiveness. It also finds that explicit cues are more effective than implicit ones; nonetheless, the primary drivers of ad effectiveness are visual salience cues: the duration and frequency with which the logo and the duration with which the product are displayed. The study can thus suggest ways brand and ad agency managers can improve the effects of creative ad content on sales. © American Marketing Association 2020.","ad content; ad effectiveness; brand communication; Dirichlet process mixtures; nonparametric factors; sequential Monte Carlo methods; sparse Tobit factor model",""

The authors show that, given the platform’s percentage referral fee, a lower search cost can either increase or decrease the platform’s profit. By contrast, if the platform optimally adjusts its referral fee, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s profit. As the consumer’s search cost decreases, if the platform’s demand elasticity increases significantly, the platform should reduce its fee, potentially resulting in an all-win outcome for the platform, the sellers, and the consumers; otherwise, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s optimal fee percentage, potentially leading to higher equilibrium retail prices. Furthermore, the availability of filtering on the platform will in expectation induce consumers to search fewer products but buy products with higher match values, and filtering can either increase or decrease equilibrium retail prices. When filtering reveals only a small amount of the products’ match-value variations, it will benefit the platform, the sellers, and the consumers. This article shows that the effects of filtering and those of a decrease in search cost are qualitatively different. © American Marketing Association 2020.","channel; competition; e-commerce; filtering; pricing; retail platform; search",""

This research asks a novel question: Does being crowdfunded carry any signal value for the broader market of observing consumers? Seven studies reveal a consumer preference for crowdfunded products, even after controlling for a product’s objective product characteristics. The authors identify two inferences that help explain this effect: (1) consumers perceive crowdfunded products to be of higher quality, and (2) they believe that supporting crowdfunding reduces inequality in the marketplace. The authors further document an important boundary condition of the first inference: the identified effect reverses in high-risk domains (e.g., products that involve high physical risk) due to consumer perceptions that the crowdfunding model lacks sufficient professionalism to mitigate risk. With regard to the second inference, the authors find that the positive crowdfunding effect is particularly strong among consumers who value social equality. Taken together, this work sheds new light on consumer perceptions of crowdfunding, elucidates why and when consumers prefer crowdfunded products, and offers actionable implications for managers. © The Author(s) 2021.","consumer inferences; crowdfunding; inequality; new products; start-ups",""

A number of industries have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main purchase (e.g., add-ons, insurance, financing, service and maintenance). In these aftermarkets, firms often retain an information advantage, even if information asymmetries are eliminated from the main purchase. This has given rise to an interesting setting untapped by prior research: information “symmetry” in the front end (main purchase) and information “asymmetry” in the back end (aftermarket). The authors argue that symmetry in the front end provides an opportunity to build trust, as the knowledgeable customer can verify the information disclosed by the seller. In an observational study in the automotive industry, the authors find that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the cost of a car at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in the back end than others. As corroborated in subsequent studies, this effect holds only when cost is disclosed at the beginning of the negotiation and when customers can verify the cost information. © American Marketing Association 2020.","aftermarkets; information asymmetry; information disclosure; negotiation; trust",""

Because beliefs are rarely observed, researchers typically assume that consumers have rational expectations or update beliefs consistent with Bayesian updating. These assumptions are restrictive and do not enable the researcher or the retailer to price discriminate among consumers on the basis of heterogeneity in beliefs. The authors use Monte Carlo experiments to show how these assumptions affect estimates of search cost. Next, they design an incentive-aligned online study in which participants search over the price of a homogeneous good, and the authors elicit distributions of price beliefs before and after each search. Drawing on data collected from a nationally representative panel, they find substantial heterogeneity in prior price beliefs, such that participants update their beliefs in response to search outcomes but deviate from Bayesian updating in that they underreact to new information. Importantly, the authors show that (1) assuming Bayesian updating does not significantly bias search cost estimates at the aggregate level if the researcher accounts for heterogeneous prior beliefs, (2) eliciting heterogeneity in prior expected prices is much more important than eliciting heterogeneity in prior price uncertainty, and (3) a retailer can increase profits through third-degree price discrimination by recognizing the heterogeneity in prior beliefs. © American Marketing Association 2021.","Bayesian updating; consumer search; price beliefs; rational expectations; search costs; sequential search",""

The authors address this gap with an examination of panel data from the flat panel TV industry, across key regions globally. Results from their estimation indicate that core-component outsourcing reduces the firm’s ability to be on the technological frontier; this hurts demand, because the authors’ estimates suggest that consumers care about firms being on the frontier. However, such outsourcing also reduces costs. Finally, the authors find that outsourcing increases the intensity of competition in the marketplace.

Applying this methodology to sales and advertising data across eight brands from three categories substantiates for the first time, and uniformly across all brands, that managers depart from optimality through adaptive experimentation, which is in line with dual control theory that suggests they do so to learn about advertising effectiveness. The adaptive experimentation finding, combined with evidence on the use of heuristic methods, suggests that budget decision making is characterized by bounded rationality. Furthermore, budgeting decisions are brand-specific, reflecting the considerations of a brand’s market position and performance. Finally, simulation studies show that brands from categories with high uncertainty in advertising effectiveness can benefit from double-digit revenue lifts by placing higher emphasis on adaptive experimentation. © American Marketing Association 2020.","adaptive dual control; adaptive experimentation; advertising budget; bounded rationality; heuristics",""

At an individual level, psychological ownership of borrowed money is distinct from other individual factors such as debt aversion, financial literacy, income, intertemporal discounting, materialism, propensity to plan, self-control, spare money, and tightwad–spendthrift tendencies, and it predicts willingness to borrow above and beyond these factors. At a contextual level, the authors document systematic differences in psychological ownership between different debt types.

More specifically, providing greater incentives to distributor sales managers undermines the relationship between their salespeople’s training and effort but enhances the relationship between their salespeople’s incentives and effort. Furthermore, greater sales manager training enhances the impact of salespeople’s incentives on effort; however, greater salesperson training undermines the relationship between salesperson incentives and effort.

While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online.

Extending these insights, Study 2 demonstrates that participants better remember print ads across contents, context, and brand associations when using snippets as retrieval cues. In addition to establishing the robustness of previous findings, Study 3 provides further evidence that the observed memory advantage for print ads is primarily due to superior encoding during initial exposure. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that marketers should not discount the value of print media in advertising, despite the rapid growth of digital media and communications. © American Marketing Association 2021.","digital media; functional magnetic resonance imaging; memory recall; memory recognition; print media",""
"Lowering the Minimum Donation Amount Increases Consumer Purchase Likelihood of Products Associated with Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087302948&doi=10.1177%2f0022243720916463&partnerID=40&md5=2bbd13be7b6fb9e5372f8a61cb49a60f","Both the total amount to be donated and the way it is communicated can influence consumer reactions to cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns. While companies often choose not to explicate any donation limit, this study argues that donation frames (e.g., minimum or maximum total donation) can enhance the likelihood of consumer purchases associated with CM campaigns. In a series of four studies, the authors find that consumers often respond more favorably to minimum-frame CM campaigns with a relatively low donation amount (e.g., at least $100,000 will be donated) than those with a high donation amount (e.g., at least $10 million will be donated) despite the superiority of the latter for the recipient cause. This effect is inverted for maximum donation frames, such that a high donation amount leads to greater consumer participation. This research also demonstrates that this effect is driven by the consumer desire to make a personal contribution to a cause, which is more likely to be observed when consumers endow it with high importance. These effects are obtained with attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual expenditures. © American Marketing Association 2020.","cause-related marketing; donation; framing; minimum-maximum; personal contribution",""

Such promotions can present gifts in different formats: customers could be informed that they will receive a gift directly or that they will receive a voucher entitling them to a gift. Normatively speaking, the two formats are equivalent, as a voucher’s value is identical to that of the gift it represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs. direct gift) influences consumers’ intention to purchase the focal product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that, compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts. This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between the focal product and the gift, reducing people’s tendency to compare the gift’s value with the focal product’s value. The effect observed can be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value. © American Marketing Association 2020.","comparison tendency; conditional promotion; decoupling; free gift; purchase intention; voucher",""

Using a large consumer panel data set of credit and employment information, the authors find that receiving a bonus increases auto loan demand by 21%. These loans, however, are associated with higher risk, as the delinquency rate increases by 18.5%–31.4% depending on different measures. In contrast, an increase in consumers’ base salary will increase their demand for auto loans but not their delinquency. By comparing consumers with bonuses with those without bonuses, the authors find that bonus payments lead to both demand expansion and demand shifting on auto loans.

Two pilot studies show that most marketers have a surprisingly strong lay intuition about the existence of this inference bias, admit that they are frequently affected by it, and try to avoid it when predicting consumer preferences. Moreover, the pilot studies indicate that most marketers use a very natural and straightforward approach to avoid the false consensus effect in practice, that is, they simply try to “suppress” (i.e., ignore) their personal preferences when predicting consumer preferences. Ironically, four subsequent studies show that this frequently used tactic can backfire and increase marketers’ susceptibility to the false consensus effect. Specifically, the results suggest that these backfire effects are most likely to occur for marketers with a low level of preference certainty. In contrast, the results imply that preference suppression does not backfire but instead decreases the false consensus effect for marketers with a high level of preference certainty. Finally, the studies explore the mechanism behind these results and show how marketers can ultimately avoid the false consensus effect—regardless of their level of preference certainty and without risking backfire effects. © The Author(s) 2021.","attitude certainty; customer centricity; customer insights; debiasing; false consensus effect; managerial decision making; new product development; thought suppression",""

Using a longitudinal data set that combines SDIAS of 1,243 school districts with academic performance and disciplinary records of more than 9,000 Texas public schools between 2000 and 2014, the authors find that a one-standard-deviation increase in SDIAS (an average increase of $.6 million) is associated with an improvement in eight academic performance indicators, with effect sizes ranging from 2% to 5% of a standard deviation, amounting to a $.8 million to $1.8 million increase in cumulative income for the current students of a school district.

In this article, the authors develop an integrated model to connect the latent topics embedded in consumers’ search phrases to their website visits and purchase decisions. Using a unique data set containing more than 8,000 search phrases submitted by consumers, the model identifies latent topics underlying the searches that led consumers to the firm’s website. Compared with a model lacking any textual information from consumers’ search phrases, a model using textual data in a heuristic approach, and a model based on the latent Dirichlet allocation, the proposed model provides a better evaluation of a consumer’s position on the path to purchase and achieves much better predictive accuracy, which could in turn substantially increase the firm’s revenue.

The present research tests the impact of a feedback format that is more targeted at how consumers select and revise their meals: real-time aggregation of calorie content to provide dynamic feedback about meal calories via a traffic light label. Because these labels intuitively signal when a meal shifts from healthy to unhealthy (via the change from green to a yellow or red light), they prompt decision makers to course-correct in real time, before they finalize their choice. Results from five preregistered experiments (N = 11,900) show that providing real-time traffic light feedback about the total caloric content of a meal reduces calories in orders, even compared with similar aggregated feedback in numeric format. Patterns of ordering reveal this effect to be driven by people revising high-calorie orders more frequently, leading them to choose fewer and lower-calorie items. Consumers also like traffic light aggregation, indicating greater satisfaction with their order and greater intentions to return to restaurants that use them.

Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households.

Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes.

Using data on content sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many others have already shared it.

The profitability of such a strategy, relative to selling only at posted prices, depends on consumers’ willingness to initiate a negotiation and ability to negotiate a discount. In this article, the authors incorporate consumers’ decision of whether to negotiate into a demand model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from consumers’ ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28 to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs’ not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing strategy and consumer surplus. Ignoring these costs results in biased estimates of consumers’ willingness to pay, translating to annual losses of $1.6 million in the current study setting. © American Marketing Association 2018.","bargaining; bargaining costs; fixed pricing; Nash equilibrium; price discrimination",""

For this reason, the literature finds that PMGs can only signal low prices when firm heterogeneity is sufficiently large. Because PMGs are offered by retailers that purchase the same product from the same producer, large firm heterogeneity may be a strong assumption.

However, the manufacturer's need for retail informational services has always been one of the essential reasons for retailers to exist and is a means for retailers to achieve profitability. The popular arguments about the threat of showrooming ignore the strategic role of the manufacturer in the distribution channel. This article analytically shows that when the manufacturer's decisions are considered (i.e., when the manufacturer-retailer contract is endogenous), consumers' ability to engage in showrooming may lead to increased, rather than decreased, profitability for B&M retailer(s). Thus, retail efforts to restrict showrooming behavior may be misguided.

The effects seem to be driven by cross-modal sensory compensation, whereby prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods.

This is a prevalent practice for firms and a worldwide concern for consumers. Extant research has examined BBP under the assumption that consumers observe firms’ practice of BBP. However, consumers do not know that specific firms are doing this and are often unaware of how firms collect and use their data. In this article, the authors examine (1) how firms make BBP decisions when consumers do not observe whether firms perform BBP and (2) how the transparency of firms’ BBP practice affects firms and consumers. They find that when consumers do not observe firms’ practice of BBP and the cost of implementing BBP is low, a firm indeed practices BBP, even though BBP is a dominated strategy when consumers observe it. When the cost is moderate, the firm does not use BBP; however, it must distort its first-period price downward to signal and convince consumers of its choice. A high cost of implementing BBP serves as a commitment device that the firm will forfeit BBP, thereby improving firm profit. By comparing regimes in which consumers do and do not observe a firm’s practice of BBP, the authors find that transparency of BBP increases firm profit but decreases consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore, requiring firms to disclose collection and usage of consumer data could hurt consumers and lead to unintended consequences. © American Marketing Association 2019.","behavior-based pricing; game theory; privacy; signaling; transparency",""

Whereas existing research has demonstrated that customers assign greater overall value to customized products, this research focuses on the effect of customization on customers’ perceptions of specific product attributes (e.g., how healthy a product is). The findings of six studies—in the field, laboratory, and online—demonstrate that customizers and noncustomizers differ in their product perceptions even if the product is objectively the same. This is because customization leads customers to perceive the product in line with their own self-image (e.g., as an unhealthy eater), a phenomenon that the authors term “self-image-consistent product perceptions.” Essentially, customization may influence product perceptions depending on the product and individuals’ self-image; this can have downstream consequences on recommendations and social media communication. The authors test this theory for different product categories (clothing, food, and vacation packages) and attributes (fashionable, healthy, and adventurous) and demonstrate that framing customization as a simple choice or strengthening product positioning through labeling mitigates negative effects of customization. © American Marketing Association 2019.","customization; product perceptions; product recommendations; self-image",""

Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms’ ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews. Finally, the correlation between firm revenue and chain-wide reputation is decreasing, whereas the correlation with individual hotel reputation is increasing. © American Marketing Association 2018.","Branding; Franchising; Machine learning; Online platforms; Online reviews",""

This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact.

In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant’s optimal quality depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent’s product quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant’s optimal quality when the entrant’s core technology can offer a significant quality improvement over the incumbent’s. By contrast, if the entrant’s technology can raise its product quality only incrementally over the incumbent’s product quality, the royalty contract will tend to reduce the entrant’s optimal quality. A wide range of royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g., alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent, alternative licensing contract). © American Marketing Association 2018.","Competition; Intercompetitor licensing; Pricing; Product quality; Royalty",""

Thus, a female identity and a global (vs. local) identity, as is the case with a male identity and a local (vs. global) identity, results in identity incongruence (vs. congruence). The authors argue that identity incongruence depletes cognitive resources and induces affective processing, which in turn activates a sacrifice mindset and results in lower price sensitivity.

A numerical attribute’s format communicates the extent to which the magnitude of a benefit is predictable (Study 1a), such that people who experience a control threat and want to see their external environment as predictable (Study 1b) rely on point value (vs. range) information as a general signal that the environment is predictable (Study 2). A personal control threat changes consumers’ preferences as a function of whether the numerical information appears as a point value or a range (Studies 3–4).

Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people’s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the “character strengths” taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering.

This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values.

The authors test an analytical technique (i.e., a theory-based approach to analyzing the new product) that successfully allows a manager to adopt a customer orientation without an attendant bias toward optimism. © American Marketing Association 2019.","customer needs; mental imagery; new product development; regulatory focus; unrealistic optimism",""

The DPF effect is driven by pricing focalism: relative to IPF, DPF creates a focus on the price difference, which, because it is smaller than the total price, leads to lower perceived expensiveness and thus greater choice share for the premium option. This price framing effect is robust to displaying the total cost of the purchase, bad deals, and easy-to-compute price differences, and it appears to be uniquely effective in pricing contexts. However, DPF effects are reduced among consumers who adopt a slow and effortful decision process.

Specifically, the authors measure the effects of these design decisions on two types of nonmonetary rank-based utility: self-generated and peer-induced. They run a set of laboratory experiments involving contests under various reward spreads and disclosure schemes. First, they find that virtually all commonly adopted disclosure schemes generate positive peer-induced rank-based utility. However, the relative performances of alternative disclosure schemes can depend on the spread of contest rewards and the number of contestants. Second, being recognized as a winner confers positive peer-induced rank-based utility; moreover, being recognized as the sole first-place winner or as one among multiple winners does not produce significantly different peer-induced utility. Third, “shaming” by disclosing the identity of contestants ranked at the bottom leads to negative peer-induced rank-based utility, but the effect is marginally insignificant. Finally, a smaller spread of contest rewards consistently results in higher levels of self-generated rank-based utility. These results underscore the importance of jointly choosing incentive structures and disclosure schemes. © American Marketing Association 2019.","lab experiments; rank-based utility; recognition; sales contests",""

If they consider two discounts—for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an additional 12% off—consumers weight the two percentages to make their evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.

Monte Carlo simulations and a large-scale application to self-reported cigarette consumption among pregnant women (n = 1,315) demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. The ICRT provides more valid and precise prevalence estimates and is more efficient than direct self-reports and previous item count techniques. It accomplishes this by (1) incentivizing participants to provide truthful answers, (2) accounting for procedural nonadherence and differential list functioning, and (3) obviating the need for a control group. The ICRT also facilitates the use of multivariate regression analysis to relate the prevalence of the sensitive behavior to individual-level covariates for theory testing and policy analysis. The empirical application reveals a significant downward bias in prevalence estimates when questions about cigarette consumption were asked directly to pregnant women, or when standard item count techniques were used.

This article argues that because of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies—two field studies and three controlled experiments—the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect—especially positive affect—relative to PC-generated content.

Building on this literature, the authors suggest that the salience of product ownership not only activates the product-related self but also simultaneously deactivates product-unrelated selves, resulting in impaired performance on tasks unrelated to the activated self. In five experiments, we first elicit feelings of ownership over a product (e.g., a calculator) to activate a product-related identity (e.g., the math self). Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do.

However, in two field experiments and a fully incentivized lab experiment, this research finds that “prosocial” (i.e., recipient-benefiting) referral incentives recruit more new customers. Five subsequent experiments test a process account for this effect, identifying two key psychological mechanisms: reputational benefits and action costs. First, at the referral stage, senders (existing customers) anticipate reputational benefits for referring recipients (potential new customers), who receive a reward for signing up. These reputational benefits render recipient-benefiting referrals just as effective as sender-benefiting referrals at the relatively low-cost referral stage. Second, at the uptake stage, recipient-benefiting referrals are more effective than sender-benefiting referrals: recipient-benefiting referrals directly incentivize recipients to sign up, providing a clear reward for an otherwise costly uptake decision. The preponderance of selfish, or sender-benefiting, referral incentives in the marketplace suggests these effects are unanticipated by marketers who design incentive schemes. © American Marketing Association 2019.","incentives; judgment and decision making; prosocial behavior; referral rewards",""

Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks.

This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to choose arises from external rather than internal constraints, opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time, budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal when that trade-off is “built-in” (e.g., when a marketing incentive requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate opportunity cost overestimation. © American Marketing Association 2019.","decision bias; judgment and decision making; opportunity cost; perceived loss",""

To explain these divergent effects, the authors examine the role of price presentation moderators, which reflect how managers convey prices to consumers (e.g., Is the total price present or absent?), magnitude moderators, which reflect the actual prices charged (e.g., What is the surcharge magnitude?), and contextual moderators, which reflect nonprice transaction characteristics (e.g., Is the product category hedonic or utilitarian?). A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category, when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the product category is utilitarian. © American Marketing Association 2018.","Consumer preferences; Meta-analysis; Partitioned pricing; Price presentation; Surcharge",""

In seven studies, the authors show that the payment method for such supplementary products (multiple payments vs. a single lump sum) affects customers’ tendency to defect from the provider’s core service over time. Specifically, when customers pay for add-ons in multiple payments—provided that (1) they perceive the add-on as being bundled with the core service and (2) the payment period has an end point—they are initially less likely to defect from the service provider than when they pay in a single payment. Over time, however, as payments are made, this gap closes, such that defection intentions under the two payment methods eventually become similar. The authors propose that this phenomenon reflects “commitment projection,” wherein a decrease in customers’ commitment to the add-on product over time is projected onto their commitment to the service provider. These findings carry important managerial implications, given that many service providers offer add-on products in multiple-payment plans and that customers’ defection decisions substantially affect firms’ profitability. © American Marketing Association 2019.","commitment; customer defection; multiple payments",""

They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality.

Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion. © American Marketing Association 2019.","consumer purchase journey; deep learning; economic impact of text; natural language processing; product reviews; regression discontinuity in time",""

Because consumers can use physical products to signal their identities, posting about products on social media may be a way for consumers to virtually signal identity. The authors propose that there are conditions in which this action can paradoxically reduce a consumer’s subsequent purchase intentions. Five experiments demonstrate that posting products on social media that are framed as being identity-relevant can reduce a consumer’s subsequent purchase intentions for the same and similar products, as this action allows consumers to virtually signal their identity, fulfilling identity-signaling needs. Fortunately for retailers, the authors suggest theoretically and managerially relevant moderators that attenuate this negative effect on intent to purchase. These findings have important implications for how firms can conduct social media marketing to minimize negative purchase outcomes. © American Marketing Association 2019.","Digital marketing; Identity; Identity signaling; Social media; User-generated content",""

The published ranking offers information about the universities’ objective quality but also affects their prestige, which may increase student utility. This prestige effect gives the commercial publication incentive to act contrary to the best interest of the students. If a ranking created with the commonly used attribute-and-aggregate methodology creates prestige, then to maximize profit the publication needs to (1) choose attribute score weights that do not match student preferences and (2) alter those attribute score weights over time, even in the absence of changes to student preferences and/or education technology. Without a prestige effect, the publication should choose attribute score weights that match student preferences.

They also demonstrate that these effects occur because more (vs. less) descriptive logos are easier to process and thus elicit stronger impressions of authenticity, which consumers value. Furthermore, two important moderators are identified: the positive effects of logo descriptiveness are considerably attenuated for brands that are familiar (vs. unfamiliar) to consumers and reversed (i.e., negative) for brands that market a type of product/service linked with negatively (vs. positively) valenced associations in consumers’ minds. Finally, an analysis of 597 brand logos suggests that marketing practitioners might not fully take advantage of the potential benefits of logo descriptiveness.

They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the “Twittersphere” became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, the authors show that online store sales increased, on average, by 1.45% per business-day reduction in delivery time, from a baseline of seven business days. The authors also find a positive spillover effect to the retailer’s offline stores. These effects increase gradually in the short-to-medium run as the result of higher order count. The authors identify two main drivers of the observed effect: (1) customer learning through service interactions with the retailer and (2) existing brand presence in terms of online store penetration rate and offline store presence.

Mortality and hubris can cause imbalance, but with the right skills and structures, these factors can be proactively managed.

Additionally, they find that consumers are significantly more likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) than comparable nonfree offers (with monetary costs). The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free offers as fair.

In line with egocentric categorization theory, which identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect. Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement motives.

Yet using arbitrary distributional assumptions can result in false inference, which in turn misleads managers. The author therefore presents a set of flexible Bayesian nonparametric (NP) dynamic models that treat error densities as unknown but assume that they emerge from Dirichlet process mixtures. Although the methods address mis-specification in dynamic linear models, the main innovation is a particle filter algorithm for nonlinear state-space models. The author used two advertising studies to confirm the benefits of the methods when strict error assumptions are untenable. In both studies, NP models markedly outperformed benchmarks in terms of fit and forecast results. In the first study, the benchmarks understated the effects of competitive advertising on own brand awareness. In the second study, the benchmark inflated ad quality, and consequently, the effects of past advertising appeared 36% higher than that predicted by the NP model. In general, these methods should be valuable wherever state-space models appear (e.g., brand and advertising dynamics, diffusion of inno-vation, dynamic discrete choice). © American Marketing Association 2019.","Advertising effectiveness; Dirichlet process mixture; Hybrid particle filter; Non-Gaussian kernel; Particle filter; Rao-Blackwellized particle filter",""

Previous research has attributed this discrepancy to givers' inaccurate predictions of the receivers' preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price, especially when givers are uncertain about receivers' preferences. Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with heterogeneous prices.

They employ a principal–agent model in which the firm tasks sales agents to mobilize the side of the platform that it monetizes (i.e., sellers). Specifically, the presence of network effects alters the agency relationship between the firm and the sales agent, requiring the platform firm to alter the compensation design, and the nature of the alteration depends on whether the network effects are direct or indirect and positive or negative. The authors first show how the agent’s compensation plan should account for different types of network effects. They then establish that when the platform firm compensates the agent solely on the basis of network mobilization on the side cultivated by the agent (sellers), as intuition would suggest, it will not fully capitalize on the advantage of positive network effects; that is, profit can be lower under stronger network effects. To overcome this limitation, the platform should link the agent’s pay to a second metric, specifically, network mobilization on the buyer side, even though the agent is not assigned to that side. This design induces a positive relation between the strength of network effects and profit.

While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews.

The framework specifies two broad mechanisms to account for the three forms of misresponse: lack of motivation to process items in detail (“inattention”) and lack of ability to comprehend items accurately (“difficulty”). The authors propose a procedure to identify potential misresponse effects on the observed item responses and factor loadings, and they report two empirical studies to test the framework; the second study uses eye movement recordings to examine the underlying process. The findings reveal that polar opposite, reversed, and negated items contribute to misresponse to varying degrees and that difficulty rather than inattention may be a more potent cause of misresponse in surveys than has traditionally been acknowledged. © American Marketing Association 2018.","eye tracking; method effects; misresponse; negations; reversed items",""

The authors extend prior work by proposing that this choice is driven, in part, by chronic differences in consumers’ cognitive and emotional responses to subgoal success. In Studies 1–5, they develop and validate a measure that captures these individual differences: the Persistence–Licensing Response Measure (PLRM). They demonstrate that the PLRM predicts persistence and licensing where existing constructs and measures do not, showing that consumers’ responses to subgoal success represent a unique dimension of self-regulation. In Studies 6–10, the authors demonstrate that the PLRM moderates the effect of subgoal success on persistence and licensing behavior, revealing that the same subgoal success situation can lead to systematically different behaviors. The authors also examine how marketing interventions can be used to increase consumers’ persistence following subgoal success.

Using automobile sales data from China and a discrete choice model for differentiated products, the authors relate brand name types to demand, with evidence showing that Chinese consumers preferred vehicle models with semantic brand names (7.64% more sales than alphanumeric) but exhibited the least preference for phonosemantic names (4.92% lower sales than alphanumeric). Domestic Chinese firms benefited from semantic brand names, whereas foreign firms gained from using foreign-sounding brand names. Entry-level products performed better with semantic brand names, and high-end products excelled when they had foreign-sounding brand names.

The present research helps fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer variety-seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness. The effect of sleepiness on variety seeking uncovered in this research is somewhat nonintuitive, in the sense that, a priori, one might expect sleepiness to be more likely to decrease rather than increase exploratory behavior.

Nevertheless, most extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally, this method can accommodate several practical considerations including consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media coverage to matched content websites. © 2018, American Marketing Association","Constrained convex optimization; Internet media selection; Online display advertising; Programmatic advertising; Real-time bidding",""

Drawing on informational market feedback and managerial learning theories, the authors posit that when firms are uncertain about how responsive the product market will be to their marketing activities, signals received from the capital market help them update their beliefs about the product market’s responsiveness. In the pharmaceutical context, the authors decompose the abnormal returns at a new drug approval event into components that the firm can and cannot predict (i.e., predicted and unpredicted abnormal returns) and find that the postapproval advertising budget is larger when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher. Furthermore, this tendency is more pronounced for spending on detailing than for direct-to-consumer advertising. Consistent with these higher budgets, the authors find that postlaunch advertising is more effective when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher, particularly for detailing spending (vs. direct-to-consumer advertising). Overall, this study suggests that information flows from the capital market’s initial perceptions at new product introduction play an important role in subsequent marketing decisions in the product market. © American Marketing Association 2018.","advertising budget; advertising effectiveness; persistence modeling; unpredicted abnormal event returns; unpredicted consumer demand",""

Extending prior research that assumes that economic considerations (e.g., project quality, campaign success likelihood) drive backers’ decisions, the authors provide the cleanest field evidence so far that consumers also have prosocial motives to help creators reach their funding goals. They find that projects collect funding faster right before (vs. right after) meeting their funding goals because consumers not only are more likely to fund projects but also contribute greater amounts of money prior to goal attainment. This effect is amplified when the nature of a project tends to evoke consumers’ prosocial motivation and when a project’s creator is a single person.

The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized). © American Marketing Association 2019.","anthropomorphism; compensatory consumption; robots; service; technology",""

Although incentives motivate sales performance, private information can induce moral hazard by salespeople to gain compensation at the expense of the firm. The authors investigate the sales performance–moral hazard trade-off in response to multidimensional performance (acquisition and maintenance) incentives in the presence of private information. Using unique panel data on customer loan acquisition and repayments linked to salespeople from a microfinance bank, the authors detect evidence of salesperson private information. Acquisition incentives induce salesperson moral hazard, leading to adverse customer selection, but maintenance incentives moderate it as salespeople recognize the negative effects of acquiring low-quality customers on future payoffs. Critically, without the moderating effect of maintenance incentives, the adverse selection effect of acquisition incentives overwhelms the sales-enhancing effects, clarifying the importance of multidimensional incentives for customer relationship management. Reducing private information (through job transfers) hurts customer maintenance but has greater impact on productivity by moderating adverse selection at acquisition.

Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity.

"Delusion in attribution: Caveats in using attribution for multimedia budget allocation","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063460562&doi=10.1177%2f0022243718802845&partnerID=40&md5=8d2650de9e7ee69717630176fb1a9f63","Media attribution is the assignment of a percentage weight to each media touchpoint a consumer is exposed to prior to purchasing. Many firms consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate. An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition. Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase, taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels. By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based allocation. © American Marketing Association 2018.","Advertising carryover; Advertising response; Attribution modeling; Interaction effects; Path-to-purchase; Probit model; Profit-maximizing media allocation",""

This article explores the practice of behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers’ taste is diverse and the consideration set is limited. The analysis identifies a novel mechanism that can help firms earn more profits with BBP than without it. Prior research shows that BBP intensifies price competition for new consumers. The authors show that if consumer valuation is low, the lower price can help expand sales to consumers for whom only the second preferred product is available, and the resulting increase in revenue more than offsets the loss in revenue because of the intensified price competition. The opposite result occurs if product valuation is high. Moreover, the difference in the price charged for old and new consumers under BBP decreases with the diversity in consumers’ taste if consumer valuation is low. The result, however, is reversed if consumer valuation is high. © American Marketing Association 2019.","behavior-based pricing; game theory; product availability; spokes model",""

These spikes capture manifestations of peak consumer attention and are therefore of managerial importance, yet they have not received research attention. This article is the first to provide a comprehensive descriptive treatment of WOM spikes. The authors propose a conceptual framework to present spikes as a standalone WOM dimension and explain their emergence. They employ a robust filtering procedure to detect spikes and apply it in a data set of 90,000 prerelease online WOM messages on 157 Hollywood movies. The results indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details than is WOM outside spikes. Prerelease WOM spikes also contribute significantly to the predictability of future product sales. © American Marketing Association 2018.","bursts; content analysis; prerelease word of mouth; robust time series analysis; user-generated content",""

In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store, that drives complementarity. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Channels/distribution; Informative advertising; Integrated marketing; Online/offline",""

Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of how the effectiveness of direct marketing communications varies by value propositions. Typically, direct marketing efforts are geared toward explicitly featuring economic or relational values. To implement an effective communication strategy catering to customers' preferences, firms should understand how customers consistently evaluate these organizational marketing communications, which ultimately affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1) effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using transaction data.

After controlling for salesperson, seasonality, year, and target effects, the authors estimate that sales, on average, dropped by 4.36%. Furthermore, they estimated individuallevel sales changes and effort changes to validate the incentive-effort-sales causal chain. The results show that the top salespeople experienced the largest drops in sales. A post-intervention survey of social and individual difference variables reveals that salespeople from households with less discretionary financial resources and those who think more abstractly about the uses of cash income exhibited smaller reductions in effort and sales.

The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental).

While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","Churn/retention; Field experiments; Heterogeneous treatment effect; Machine learning; Proactive churn management",""

The authors propose a new dual-objective compound design criterion that incorporates prior information for the joint purpose of efficiently estimating the effects of the active attributes and detecting the effects of attributes labeled as inactive that may turn out to be active. The approach leverages self-stated auxiliary data as prior information both for individual-level customized design construction and in a heterogeneous variable selection model.

The authors use the Elo algorithm, a statistical model calibrated on paired comparisons, to score the full set of ads on relative perceptions and click performance. The estimated scores validate the theoretical link between perceptions and performance. Second, the authors predict the perceptions and performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual content metrics. The predictive model allows for direct effects and interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a ""large p, small n"" problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of equations.

This research tests for what types of messages mandatory endorsements have this effect, and why. Mandatory endorsements boosted evaluations of policy-focused attack ads-those typically plagued by overcomeable skepticism-but had no consistent effect on positive or character-focused ads. Mandatory endorsements boost ad believability-largely outside of participants' awareness-for two reasons: (1) the tagline offers a legitimizing association with regulation and (2) the candidates' own personally delivered endorsement language offers an implicit promise of the ads' truth value.

The prevailing notion is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible. We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across all stimuli. Five studies establish this finding across multiple domains (music, art, and food) and provide process evidence that an ad hoc categorization for the overall experience underlies our effect.

Five experiments, involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading.

The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4, 865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors' expectations of future firm performance. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Event study; Investors' expectations; New product announcements; Stock returns; Tobin's q",""

The authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to chum, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted customers more valuable.

However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort.

Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners.

Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction.

The authors develop a methodology they call ""ghost ads,"" which facilitates this comparison by identifying the control group counterparts of the exposed consumers in a randomized experiment. The authors show that, relative to public service announcement and intent-to-treat A/B tests, ghost ads can reduce the cost of experimentation, improve measurement precision, deliver the relevant strategic baseline, and work with modem ad platforms that optimize ad delivery in real time. The authors also describe a variant, ""predicted ghost ad"" methodology, which is compatible with online display advertising platforms; their implementation records more than 100 million predicted ghost ads per day. The authors demonstrate the methodology with an online retailer's display retargeting campaign. They show novel evidence that retargeting can work: the ads lifted website visits by 17.2% and purchases by 10.5%. Compared with intent-to-treat and public service announcement experiments, advertisers can measure ad lift just as precisely while spending at least an order of magnitude less. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Advertising effectiveness; Digital advertising; Field experiments",""
"Seller beware: How bundling affects valuation","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034056107&doi=10.1509%2fjmr.15.0277&partnerID=40&md5=e1f93962920b97b79c8d8dbaba02b850","How does bundling affect valuation? This research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus, consumers resist altering the ""whole"" of the bundle by removing or adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis)satisfaction (Study 3). Moreover, bundle composition-the ability of different items to create the impression of a ""whole""-moderates the effect of bundling on valuation (Study 4), and the need to replace missing items (i.e., restoring the ""whole"") mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study 6). © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Bundling; Gestalt; Pricing; Satisfaction",""

However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers' inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes. By illustrating the curvilinear relationship between scale expansion and multiple measures, the authors also offer practitioners some insight into the limits of scale expansion. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Attribute importance; Conjoint analysis; Discriminability; Multiattribute judgment",""

While some campaigns indeed go ""viral,"" their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes.

This impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing department has high influence in the top management team, and when the economy is growing. Liberal CEOs' greater rate of NPIs is associated with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility.

They show that during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response. During the affectively charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect.

Through six studies, the authors find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence shows that this pitch-size effect occurs through a process of visual mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information.

The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price.

The authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households augmented by zip code-level house price and foreclosure data. The model suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term patience increases mortgage abandonment.

Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers' search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products, they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese TV market, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi-natural experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV channels' viewership, offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Consumer search; Demand estimation; Natural experiment; Television",""

Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects.

They account for salesperson heterogeneity using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the model. They find conditional compensation in the form of quota bonus incentives to improve performance; however, such compensation may lead to lower future performance. The authors find little difference in effectiveness between a quota bonus plan and punitive bonus plans framed as a penalty for not achieving quota. They [find that unconditional compensation, in the form of reciprocity, is effective at improving sales force performance only when it is given as a delayed reward; however, the effectiveness of this plan decreases with repeated exposure. The authors also find heterogeneity in the impact of compensation on performance across salespeople, such that unconditional compensation is more effective for salespeople with high base performance, whereas conditional compensation is equally effective across all types of salespeople. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Field experiment; Heterogeneity; Loss aversion; Reciprocity; Sales force compensation",""

Noting the increasing prevalence of online grocery shopping, the authors focus on shopping channels as one such contextual factor and investigate how food choices made online differ from food choices made in a traditional brick-and-mortar store. A database study and three lab experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers' desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to purchase fewer vices. These findings highlight several unexplored differences between online and offline shopping, with important implications for consumers, public policy makers, and retailers. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Grocery shopping; Instant gratification; Product presentation; Shopping channel; Unhealthy food choices",""

When TMSEs switch firms, a pattern of informal organizational connections results; this pattern reflects the flow of information and knowledge among firms and creates managerial social capital in the process. To model this information flow, the current study considers information reach and richness, conceptualized according to the network position (i.e., centrality and brokerage) of the firm in the TMSE mobility network, which can be constructed by tracing' executive movements through the work experience records of TMSEs in an industry. TMSE tenure (i.e., time with the firm) and firm market orientation constitute critical moderators, which capture motivation and ability at the individual and firm level, respectively.

Matchmakers in various industries often advertise proprietary technologies that presumably help users find an ideal match in a short time. However, matchmakers may have incentives to provide suboptimal matchmaking services so that users remain clients longer and pay more fees. This article considers a matchmaking market with network effects and strategic consumers and analyzes under what conditions matchmakers would offer more effective versus less effective matchmaking services. The authors find that stronger pricing power paradoxically leads to lower technology provision when consumers have high valuation for the matchmaking service. Moreover, network effects typically encourage matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking. In addition, consumer patience prompts competing matchmakers to implement ineffective technology.

It is often assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should facilitate-or at least not disrupt-memory-based comparisons. Using the domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so. Attempting-and failing at-explicit price recall focuses attention on metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory blocking-metacognitive memory blocking-in which the feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memoiy during judgments. They also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference price. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Blocking; Memory; Metacognition; Price comparison; Price memory",""

Previous research provides evidence of the equivocal effects of these deviations, with both positive and negative deviations motivating prosocial behaviors. The current research reconciles these competing findings by introducing construal as a moderator. Across four studies, the authors find that positive deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for independent donors, whereas negative deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for interdependent donors.

In addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether ""liking"" brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. When consumers see that a friend has ""liked"" a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement.

Using a quantal response equilibrium model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players' decisions, or by the exogenous game structure. To do so, the authors compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal, which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players, significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel members have fairly different payoffs. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Distribution channels; Experimental economics; Fairness ideals; Quantal response equilibrium",""

The author finds that when people are in the middle of a goal pursuit journey (vs. when they have just begun or are about to complete their goal), to circumvent potentially negative comparisons, they avoid information about social referents who are relevant (pursuing the same goal), proximal (in the same stage of goal pursuit), and superior. Head turn frequency, eye movements, and consumers' direct choices in the lab and in the field are used to document a U-shaped pattern of information avoidance behavior, which paradoxically contributes to the phenomenon whereby goal pursuers become ""stuck in the middle"" of their pursuits. These findings connect the information avoidance literature with the psychophysics of goal pursuit and shed light on the questions of when and why people may be undermining their goal striving by avoiding relevant, motivating social information. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","Consumer motivation; Goal progress; Information avoidance; Self-regulation; Social comparison",""

Managers, however, argue that such metrics are costly to report, reveal sensitive information to competitors, and therefore will lower future cash flows. To examine these counterarguments, this study presents the first empirical examination of the prevalence and consequences of backward- and forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics by manually coding 511 annual reports of firms in two industries, telecommunications (365 reports) and airlines (146 reports). The results reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries, firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures. Notably, forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics are negatively associated with investors' uncertainty in both industries and with analysts' uncertainty in the telecommunications industry. Importantly, the results do not support the managerial thesis that such disclosures have a negative impact on future cash flows. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Accounting; Customer metrics; Disclosure; Financial reporting; Marketing-finance interface",""

Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by duration (e.g., ""within exactly two weeks from now"") instead of date (e.g., ""between today and November 17""). This pattern may arise because dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in achieving their goals. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","Focus; Framing; Goal adoption; Temporal description; Time intervals",""

Such cost-benefit heuristics in goal pursuit have been observed across several domains, but their antecedents have not been fully explored. In this research, the authors propose that a person's tendency to use cost-benefit heuristics depends on the extent to which that person subscribes to the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), an influential concept originally introduced to explain the rise of capitalism. The PWE is a core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to over generalize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are more likely to use cost-benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes.

Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer-referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","Customer referral programs; Customer relationship marketing; Referral marketing; Social networks; Word-of-mouth marketing",""

For example, with some price promotions (e.g., spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future), consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost of the first purchase when they receive the promotion, as well as from the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon, referred to as ""double mental discounting,"" is driven by the extent towhich gains feel associated, or coupled, withmultiple purchases.

After accounting for selection on observables and unobservables, the authors find a substantial increase in the total quantity (servings per capita) of packaged food purchases attributable to shopping at this format. Because there is no effect on the nutritional quality of purchases, this translates into a substantial increase in calories, sugar, and saturated fat per capita. The increase comes primarily from storable and impulse foods, and it is drawn equally from foods that have positive and negative health halos.

Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these cycles for a unique set of 252 brands-ranging from high-advertising, high-priced ""premium mass"" brands to low-advertising, low-priced ""value niche"" brands-in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price increases remain unchanged.

This effect occurs because performance on the common feature is judged not at face value but relative to an expectation about which product should perform best on that feature.

Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Annuities; Conjoint analysis; Financial decision making",""

For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand's exact rank. The authors propose that when marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10) can influence consumers' evaluations and willingness to pay. Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Categorization; Expectations; Rankings; Transparency",""

For most people, this process encourages the choice of the most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal, and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the alternative that is most efficacious for the goal.

The authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these thoughts of contamination.

Yet there are times when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest rate credit option varies as a function of the savings' intended use. Paradoxically, people are most likely to turn to high interest rate credit with the belief that doing so is the responsible option.","Debt; Emergency spending; Mental accounting; Personal responsibility; Savings",""

Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations' margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented. Analysis of customer transaction data confirms this finding, showing that less than 10% of consumers use the posted price information effectively. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Difference-in-differences; Posted prices; Price information; Price transparency; Retail competition",""

A possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone.

Only after the PW, when rivals’ prices are restored and the focal brand's reduced retail price is maintained, can substantial sales, revenues, and share gains be realized. Moreover, restoring prices without additional price promotion support can severely damage brands’ performance.

Specifically, the authors predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories.

The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory-driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts.

Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations.

Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions.

In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method - electroencephalography (EEG) - can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Choice prediction; Consumer neuroscience; EEG; N200; Theta power",""

In a series of five studies, they show that a touch interface, such as that provided by an iPad, compared with a nontouch interface, such as that of a desktop computer with a mouse, facilitates the choice of an affect-laden alternative over a cognitively superior one-what the authors call the ""direct-Touch effect."" The studies provide some mediational support that the direct-Touch effect is driven by the enhanced mental simulation of product interaction with the more affective choice alternative on touch interfaces. The authors also test the moderator of this effect.

The empirical investigation shows that a firm's acquisition cost per customer is more sensitive to market position and competition than retention cost per customer. Furthermore, whereas firms leading in market share, on average, do not have a cost advantage over other firms in retaining customers, they have a substantial cost advantage in acquiring customers, and this advantage tends to increase with market penetration.

This study examines (1) the direct effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance variables (buyer's click rate and seller's click price), and (3) how the effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage.

Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food) on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained) eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Dietary restraint; Fitness; Food consumption; Physical activity",""

A laboratory experiment tests this prediction and provides data for model calibration. Consistent with the idea of small victories, when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest).

Such efforts can be guided by insight into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on customers’ past purchase activity—namely, the recency and frequency of past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver a customer's requested level of service.

Specifically, in a series of studies, the authors show that high rather than low need for cognitive closure can lead to a lack of openness to new information and therefore may dilute consumers' tendency to update their investment portfolios in a way that reflects their risk preferences. In addition, the authors address possible ways to influence consumers' assimilation of new information, to help even those with high need for cognitive closure make investment decisions that are in line with their levels of risk aversion. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Financial decision making; Investment decisions; Market uncertainty; Need for cognitive closure; Risk aversion",""

Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing).

The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal, and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization.

Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as well as how much they are willing to pay to save time.

First, they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty. This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal-agent models that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse. Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary to the standard principal-agent model. Third, they provide intuition for this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random. When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random demand. When the customers' response to effort (or price) is random, the decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to agents' risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case, higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard principal-agent models. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Adaptive selling; Information; Principal-agent; Sales force; Sales uncertainty",""

Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative.

Firms can identify these customers through past purchases of either new products that failed or existing products that few other customers purchase. The authors discuss how these insights can be readily incorporated into the new product development process.

In this article, three studies examine how productivity metrics influence consumer decision making. Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller when consumers receive additional information about time savings through product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time savings. Consumers' intuitions about time savings are also more accurate when they estimate time savings than when they rank them. Estimates are based less on absolute than on proportional changes in productivity (and proportional changes correspond more with actual time savings). © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Efficiency; Heuristics and biases; Numeracy; Productivity; Time perception",""

They show that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium. Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease consumer welfare or channel profits. However, store brands hurt the manufacturer's profits and make two-part tariffs ineffective in improving channel coordination. Nonetheless, the retailer can enhance channel coordination by procuring the store brand from the national brand manufacturer.

However, little research has examined whether consumer communities actually foster C2C helping, and who is helped. In contrast, the brand- community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood of community members helping non-community members. If so, strategies that promote third party-hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C2C helping. Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both?

Using a data set containing the shirt sponsorships from 43 English football clubs between 1990 and 2010, the authors' estimates suggest assortative matching between a club's attendance and a sponsor's revenue. In addition, sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors. Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors. Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be most affected by a ban. More generally, the results demonstrate that when marketing relationships are viewed as the result of a matching process, actions that affect only some marketers may have substantial indirect effects on a variety of players in the market. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Advertising regulation; Equilibrium outcomes; Matching markets; Sponsorships; Sports marketing",""

The authors hypothesize that this effect is due to low versus high levels of IC triggering distinct psychological motives. Low IC activates the motive to self-enhance, and communicating positive information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating negative information. In contrast, high IC activates the motive to protect others, and communicating negative information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating positive information.

The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options.

Alternatively, consumers experiencing stress may show increased spending behavior, directed specifically toward products that the consumer perceives to be necessities and that allow for control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment.

In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: The constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a ""contractual externality"" in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Agency theory; Dynamics; Hiring; Incentives; Sales force compensation",""

Consumers look to their own experiences, as well as those of others, when deciding what to buy and what to recommend. Contrary to the intuition that varied experiences should enhance evaluation, five studies demonstrate that in some situations, perceiving usage experiences as less-not more-varied improves postpurchase product evaluation. Less varied usage experiences make consumers think that products are used more frequently. As a result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more likely to recommend it. In addition to their practical implications, the findings make important theoretical contributions to the variety literature and toward understanding frequency and numerosity judgments. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Experiences; Frequency judgments; Product evaluation; Similarity; Variety",""

However, there are few suitable approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model to quantify under- and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes within-person differences between answers obtained under direct questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408 respondents from a commercial web panel. The results show that respondents are averse to decreases in privacy and that randomized response is less effective if respondents provide biased responses to earlier direct questions. © 2015 American Marketing Association.","alcohol; dishonesty; lying; privacy; randomized response",""

Using a Bayesian estimation, the authors are also able to infer the consumer's latent budgetary constraint using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to understand the customer's budgetary constraint without having to survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and conventional CLV approaches. Finally, they conduct two policy simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV, as well as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting, and develop managerial insights in this context. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Bayesian estimation; Consumer packaged goods; Customer lifetime value; Customer relationship management; Multiple discreteness",""

A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, the authors pharmaceutical^ reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects' cognitive resources. In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects' tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision making. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Choice deferral; Compromise effect; Real payments; Serotonin; Tryptophan depletion",""

Investors use consistency in stakeholder group treatment as a signal of complementarity in a firm's investments, which can improve the likelihood of competitive advantage. Specifically, the authors propose that a firm's achievements (lapses) directed at customers have a stronger positive (negative) impact on investors' valuation of the firm if they are validated by the firm's achievements (lapses) directed at employees, and vice versa. Applying a multilevel model to a large sample of firms across various industries between 1994 and 2010, the authors find evidence to support these arguments.

The authors demonstrate that the two paradigms can and do coexist in the same decision-making space, even at the level of individual consumer choices.

Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear.

However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched.

These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads' aggregate, market-level elasticities.

Mystery ads, which suspend conveying what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively after longer exposure durations.

Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by ""roughly scheduling"" (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity.

The first study, a secondary data analysis, finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed orders.

Agency industry literature has called for the advertiser to fully reimburse such costs to all agencies that enter the contest. The authors analyze the optimal stipend policy of an advertiser facing agencies with asymmetric bid-preparation costs, such that the incumbent agency faces a lower bid-preparation cost than a competitor agency entering the contest. The authors show that reimbursing bid-preparation costs in full is never optimal, nor is reimbursing any part of the incumbent's bid-preparation cost.

The results show that EEG measures (beta and gamma oscillations), beyond stated preference measures, provide unique information regarding individual and population-wide preference and can thus, in principle, be used as a neural marker for commercial success.

They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item.

The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational embeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects.

They posit that this phenomenon occurs because referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product.

An online experiment reveals that the 75% contingent match drives commitment to recurring donations because it simultaneously provides social proof while offering a low enough target to remain plausible that the match will occur.

Findings from three studies show that women near ovulation seek positional goods to improve their social standing. Additional findings reveal that ovulation leads women to pursue positional goods when doing so improves relative standing compared with other women but not compared with men. When playing the dictator game, for example, ovulating women gave smaller offers to a female partner but not to a male partner.

Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed.

This distinction is important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership, chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a model of consumers' reactions to store acquisitions. The authors estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering ±200 local markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition, consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach. Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a hard discounter, in which case customers' previous store knowledge is less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater. © 2014, American Marketing Association.","Choice models; Outlet loyalty; State dependence; Store acquisitions; Store choice; Takeovers",""

Specifically, they find that due to a belief in contagion, products from a company's original manufacturing location are viewed as containing the essence of the brand. In turn, this belief in transferred essence leads consumers to view products from the original factory as more authentic and valuable than identical products made elsewhere. The authors further reveal that consumers who are higher in sensitivity to contagion are more likely to exhibit this effect and that activating the concept of contagion enhances preferences for products made in the brand's original factory.

The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help-and often hurts-when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds.

Under CvSS, consumers first select one starting solution from a set of prespecified products, which they then refine to create their final customized product. Evidence from nine studies (three of which were conducted in field settings) across a wide range of product domains (shirts, cars, vacation packages, jewelry, and financial products) shows that the CvSS architecture results in substantial benefits relative to the standard attribute-by-attribute product customization format for both consumers (increased satisfaction with their product choices, reduced choice complexity, and enhanced mental simulation of product use) and firms (purchases of more feature-rich, and thus higher-priced, products). © 2014, American Marketing Association.","Choice architecture; Consumer decision making; Field experiments; Product customization",""

These motivations are economic (the value of forgone points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological (customers value points differently than cash).

Data from a large-scale test-control field experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010 and involved 39, 946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly increased consumers' favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower) involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic).

Using economic experiments, the authors show that two-person group incentives can outperform individual incentives and that the relative efficacy of group incentives depends on three important factors. First, the strength of social ties among the group members matters. Effort decisions in group-based incentives increase significantly when members socialize briefly before committing effort. Second, the design of the group incentive matters. For the group incentive to work better than the individual incentive, the group-based component (i.e., how much the payment scheme weights the contribution of others) in the former cannot be too large. Third, the informational feedback that group members receive matters. When socialized group members can observe one another's true effort, rather than only their output, effort surprisingly decreases.

When buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are uncertain about seller costs, buyers' fairness perceptions and, thus, their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior. Consequently, buyers' fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies. Finally, the basic model is extended to examine how the fair selling equilibrium may be influenced by cost disclosure, buyer dynamic learning, and seller competition. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral economics; Distributional fairness; Inequity aversion; Pricing; Reference price",""

Second, managers' self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathie managers' self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions.

However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm-customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months.

The authors extend traditional brand-message recall measurements to facilitate comparisons between Internet formats and television by supplementing brand-message surveys conducted during the campaign with a set of precampaign surveys to control for preexisting brand knowledge. They find that accounting for differences in preexisting brand knowledge is paramount in obtaining valid comparisons across advertising formats because people who are exposed to Internet display ads have significantly lower levels of preexisting brand knowledge than television viewers. Without considering the differences in these ""initial conditions,"" television advertising seems to be more effective than advertising on the Internet, but when the preexisting differences among media formats are taken into account, the brand recall lift measures for Internet ads are statistically indistinguishable from comparable television lift measures. © 2014, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Brand metrics; Internet; Television",""

Second, predictions with samples as small as 20 consumers are reliable. Third, there is a stronger predictive link between raw ideas and consumers' purchase intent of final product designs than there is between those intentions and market outcomes.

Results from four experiments show that consolation prizes lower consumers' expectations of winning the big prize, their valuations of the lottery, and their intentions to participate in the lottery. Because of the high likelihood of attaining the consolation prizes, consumers shift their focus from the value of a big prize to the probability of attaining it. This shift increases the weight given to the probability dimension and results in lowered valuations of the lottery. The first two experiments demonstrate the effect in hypothetical and real choices. In Experiment 3, the authors propose and show a boundary condition for the effect. In Experiment 4, they conduct an exploratory test of the process.

Contrary to this, the authors find that when the budget contracts to a particular level, consumers select less variety (as measured by the number of different items with some of the budget allocated to them) than when their budget expands to that same level. This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion under the expanding budget.

This article introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data of customers' touches. The authors propose a measurement model to analyze customers' (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to different channels and find that these channels' relative contributions are significantly different from those found by other currently used metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions.

The analysis considers how these advertising expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly through intermediate search advertising metrics-namely, impressions and clickthrough rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities. Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising.

The results of seven experiments suggest that the relationship between options under consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which respondents evaluate options in the choice set.

However, with regard to net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions-the dominant approach among chains-is not necessarily the best practice, because retailers observe the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less. © 2014, American Marketing Association.","Calendar; In phase; Out of phase; Promotion effectiveness",""

The authors' premise is that such a narrow focus does not capture the complete impact of brand imitation. They offer a broader, theory-based perspective of harm by proposing that brand imitation affects both brand consideration and preference in the consumer choice process. The authors establish a formal nexus between brand consideration and the legal doctrine ""initial interest confusion."" Using choice experiments and statistical modeling, they show that brand imitation harms the imitated brand even after controlling for brand confusion. Moreover, brand imitation harms not only the imitated brand but also other national brands in the category that are not being imitated. To quantify brand consideration and preference harm in financial terms, the authors propose two metrics: choice share shift and share-equalizing price cut. The results show that brand imitation harms the national brand more when the imitating brand is not associated with a well-known retailer and that brand imitation harm extends beyond brand confusion.

Consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the marketer's explicit intent. The experiments also suggest that the urge to exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the market.

Meanwhile, pay-per-impression (PPI) schemes persist, and several publishers have begun to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes. Given the proliferation of pricing schemes, this study examines the optimal choices for publishers. The authors highlight two-sided information asymmetries in online advertising markets and the consequent trade-offs faced by a high-quality publisher using P4P schemes. Pay-for-performance schemes enable a high-quality publisher to reveal its superior quality; however, such schemes may incur allocative inefficiencies stemming from inaccurate estimates of advertiser qualities. The authors identify conditions under which a publisher may opt for a PPI, P4P, or hybrid scheme and, in doing so, provide theoretical explanations for the observed variations in the pricing schemes and the increasing popularity of hybrid schemes. Using a new ""uncompromised"" equilibrium refinement, the authors find that the hybrid scheme can emerge as an equilibrium choice in a variety of conditions. In addition, they provide prescriptive guidelines for firms choosing between different pricing schemes. © 2014, American Marketing Association.","Hybrid pricing; Information asymmetry; Online advertising; Pay for performance",""

First, the authors conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect reading processes.

Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's Impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: Price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and longterm advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger.

In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer)s group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light.

In contrast with two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or ""free"" units of the service.

Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from twopart to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly ""overuse"" in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint.

Base-rate information influences these attributions. The research findings suggest that for brands with positive prior beliefs, a high (vs. low) base rate of product-harm crises leads to less blame if the crisis is said to be similar to others in the industry (referred to as the ""discounting effect""). However, in the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the ""subtyping effect""). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who discount a first crisis also tend to discount a second crisis for the same brand, whereas consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Base-rate information; Consumer attributions; Product-harm crises",""

Prior research has shown that experienced pleasure often assimilates to the valence of one's active emotions, such that negative emotions decrease pleasure. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure, such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that generalizes to other negative emotions.

In this study, the authors demonstrate how the latter can be improved by uncovering common trajectories hidden behind the coevolution of a large array of indicators.

To demonstrate the importance of the methodology, the authors investigate two issues of relevance to retailers, namely, how retailers should (1) allocate promotional expenditures across brands in a category and (2) coordinate timing of promotions of brands across categories. The authors estimate the proposed model using consumers' purchases in pasta sauce and pasta categories. The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation of promotional expenditures across brands. Furthermore, retailers are better off contemporaneously promoting brands across the two categories than promoting them in different periods, and ignoring cross-category effects in quantity decisions leads to the opposite inference, namely, that retailers are better off promoting brands across the two categories in different periods. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Basket utility maximization; Choice models; Multicategory brand choice decisions; Purchase incidence decisions; Quantity decisions",""

Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand-day observations provide robust evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run.

In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Construal level theory; Field experiments; Online advertising; Online decision process; Retargeting",""

In conjunction with an entrance survey of purchase intentions, they conduct several descriptive analyses that focus on the incidence, category propensity, behavioral characteristics, and outcome of unplanned consideration. The results reveal several new empirical insights.

Second, planned consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence, number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g., remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to shelf, references to a shopping list).

The authors suggest that the nature of the food attributes the claims emphasize-namely, functional versus hedonic-determines the extent of consumption of the indulgence. Health claims featuring functional attributes (e.g., ""extra antioxidants"") trigger high levels of health-goal accessibility, which, together with simultaneously accessible indulgence goals attached to the indulgence, results in goal conflict. This conflict leads to reduced consumption of the food. In contrast, health claims featuring hedonic attributes (e.g., ""low fat"") render health goals less accessible while accentuating the pleasure dimension of the food, resulting in lower goal conflict and increased consumption of the food.

Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the external situation can influence brand extension evaluations, particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions. These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set).

With rock-bottom prices and minimal assortments, they differ greatly from ""large discounters"" such as Wal-Mart, constituting complements to, rather than substitutes for, more traditional supermarkets. Therefore, the authors propose that HD impact of entry on local incumbents is different as well. Using a store choice and spending model that explicitly accounts for interstore synergies and multiple-store shopping behavior, the authors study consumer responses to 194 HD openings. Although they find that HDs, like large discounters, especially appeal to private label-prone shoppers and lead to sizable incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains alongside the incumbent are lost. Second, the authors find that chains located in close proximity to new HDs do not suffer more from their entry. Third, losses are lower for upscale chains and incumbents that strongly complement the HD. The authors conclude by discussing implications for proper response to HD entry. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Competitive response; Grocery retailing; Hard discounters; Multiple-store shopping; Store entry",""

In other words, they show that two status products that are (imperfect) substitutes in the consumer utility function may be complements in the profit function. As a consequence, competition could lead to higher prices than the optimal ones under monopoly ownership of both products.

In this research, the authors propose that because bidders are differentiated in their value to the buyer and competition in these auctions is anonymous, bidders infer their potential quality advantage or disadvantage through their observation of competitive bids and incorporate this information into their responses and price bids. Using point-by-point bid data from two industrial procurement auctions, the authors show that bidders appear to be making inferences about their own implied quality differentials and adjust their bidding strategies and bidding aggression accordingly. Specifically, they find that highquality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding against potentially lower-quality competition.

Researchers have typically explained the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by which people select items from among those available. This precludes the possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets themselves-that is, how people decide which options to consider when making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in multiple- versus single- item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose simultaneously, choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent) choice set.

In this article, the authors provide a method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms over time).

This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced.

Service innovations are enabled primarily by the Internet or people, corresponding to two types of innovativeness: E- and p-innovativeness. The authors examine the determinants of service innovativeness and its interrelationships with firm-level customer satisfaction, firm value, and firm risk and investigate the differences between e- and p-innovativeness in these relationships. They develop a conceptual model and estimate a system of equations on a unique panel data set of 1049 innovations over five years, using zeroinflated negative binomial regression and seemingly unrelated regression approaches. The results reveal important asymmetries between e- and p-innovativeness. Whereas e-innovativeness has a positive and significant direct effect on firm value, p-innovativeness has an overall significantly positive effect on firm value through its positive effect on customer satisfaction but only in human-dominated industries. Both e- and p-innovativeness are positively associated with idiosyncratic risk, but customer satisfaction partially mediates this relationship for pinnovativeness to lower this risk in human-dominated industries.

The intervention led to significant sales productivity improvement; this effect was heterogeneous across ability deciles, with much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The authors find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through ""timing games."" At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable output).

This specification yields a novel set of 456 elasticities across categories and time that are generated using the same method and therefore can be directly compared. On average, price sensitivity is countercyclical: It rises when the macroeconomy weakens. However, substantial variation exists, and a handful of categories exhibit procyclical price sensitivity. The authors show that the relationship between price sensitivity and macroeconomic growth correlates strongly with the average level of price sensitivity in a category.

Because intermediate effects-cognition, affect, and experience-are unobservable constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models explain how advertising grows sales but ignore the role of intermediate effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments the dynamic advertising-sales response model by integrating the hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic advertising-sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating hierarchy (advertising experience → cognition → affect sales). The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales growth and brand building.

Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost.

An examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review value is negatively related to review valence but that this negative relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity cues.

This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement.

In this article, the author assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers. Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage benefits. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Competition; Empirical generalizations; National brands; New products; Private labels; Retailing",""

This article demonstrates that attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare, and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more broadly. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Attitudes; Attributes; Conjoint analysis; Hedonic and utilitarian choice; Numerosity",""

The authors show that this shift in preferences is due to a change in elaboration from having features to using features, and they identify three key moderators to the effect: need for cognition, feature trivialness, and materialism. Finally, the authors investigate the downstream consequences of usage estimation on product satisfaction, demonstrating that consumers who estimate usage before choice experience greater product satisfaction and are more likely to recommend their chosen product.

In this study, the authors study the effect of reference price on the quantity purchased and also on the pricing outcome of the transaction. They estimate a simultaneous equation system of both pricing and quantity purchased. The findings are as follows: (1) Reference price effects exist on quantity purchased and on the transaction pricing outcome In business-to-business market transactions, (2) business customers react asymmetrically to price increases and price decreases, and (3) salespeople have their own reference prices that affect the transaction price.

The BTS mechanism, which mathematically rewards ""surprisingly common"" answers, both rewarded truth telling, by heavily penalizing foil recognition, and induced truth telling, in that participants who were paid according to their BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils than control groups, even when given competing incentives to exaggerate. Survey takers who received BTS-based payments without explanation became less likely to recognize foils as they progressed through the survey, suggesting that they learned to respond to BTS incentives despite the absence of guidance.

The authors derive the profit-maximizing total budget, its optimal split between national and regional spends, and its optimal allocation across multiple regions. They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a second-order differential equation for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures). By solving the HJB equation analytically, the authors furnish closed-form expressions for the optimal total budget and its regional allocations. In addition, they develop a method to estimate the proposed model and apply it to market data from a leading German cosmetics company.

Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove-Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric.

Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors.

Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in ""choice mode."" Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral search models; Consumer decision making; Product recommendations; Product search",""

We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this flat-rate bias without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a ""winner's curse"": Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching costs deter them from changing tariffs. Using the estimated model, the authors find that tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by 20% when the per-use tariff is dropped, because more consumers choose and stay with the flat rate. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Consumer learning; Dynamic discrete choice; Tariff choice",""

The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion, advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing customers while taking into account the development of customer demand over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right product to the right customer at the right time using the right communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors demonstrate that households have different preferences and responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%) and instantaneous promotional effect (2%).

Although information technologies are creating increasing opportunities for firms to facilitate and manage these two types of social interaction, to date, researchers have encountered difficulty in disentangling their competing effects and have provided limited insights into how these two social influences might differ from and interact with each other. Using a unique natural experimental setting resulting from information policy shifts at the online seller Amazon.com, the authors design three longitudinal, quasi-experimental field studies to examine three issues regarding the two types of social interaction: (1) their differential impact on product sales, (2) their lifetime effects, and (3) their interaction effects. An intriguing finding is that while negative WOM is more influential than positive WOM, positive OL information significantly increases sales, but negative OL information has no effect. This suggests that reporting consumer purchase statistics can help mass-market products without hurting niche products. The results also reveal that the sales impact of OL increases with WOM volume. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Natural experiment; Observational learning; Social influences; Social interactions; Word of mouth",""

Compounding the issue, many incongruent products are the result of innovative changes in product form intended to increase hedonic appeal. Crossing various product categories with various positioning tactics in a single meta-analytic framework, the authors find that positioning plays an important role in how consumers evaluate incongruent form. The results demonstrate that when a product is positioned on functional dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for moderately incongruent form than for congruent form. However, when a product is positioned on experiential dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent form than for moderately incongruent form. Importantly, an increase in perceived hedonic benefits mediates the former, whereas a decrease in perceived utilitarian benefits mediates the latter. The mediation effects are consistent with the view that consumers must first understand a product's functionality before engaging in hedonic consumption. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Experiential positioning; Form and function; Functional positioning; Product designs; Product incongruity",""

When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed.

This debate raises the question: Do a retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does this affect their choice share vis-à-vis national brands? The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such crossbrand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative to national brands.

They estimate the model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in the U.S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Entertainment industry; Market share; Multiple channel demand; Seasonality",""

In contrast, the authors propose and demonstrate that a single goal evokes a stronger implementation intention, which in turn has a greater effect on behavior change.

The authors use a triple difference-indifference methodology by appropriately defining treatment and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week.

To investigate the value of general versus specific brand image, the authors specify a higher-order factor model in which a set of correlated factor scores arise from a general brand factor and a set of orthogonal residual scores that measure the specific dimensions of brand image. The general brand factor is consistent with the concept of a halo effect, which theory ascribes to either an overall evaluative effect or errors in cognition. The authors apply the model to stated preference data on branded midsized sedans accompanied by data on consumer brand-image associations.

However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and affects behavior in counternormative ways. They demonstrate the phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger preference to avoid taxrelated costs than to avoid equal-sized (or larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases, financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who identify with ""antitax"" parties to consider positive uses of their tax payments mitigates tax aversion.

Standard economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level, customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the contract-for example, due to ""hassle costs."" If customers use period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract. They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic discounting. The findings suggest that in setting prices, firms should consider the timing of hassle costs customers face. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Contractual discounting; Field experiment; Hassle costs; Period-level bracketing; Pricing; Services",""

For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not imposed a price restraint. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Budgets; Consideration sets; Consumer spending; Price restraints; Quality perceptions",""

The authors propose that this behavior reflects investors' emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment, regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold.

When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet relies on subscription fees only for revenues.

Thus, a belief originally associated with high uncertainty (certainty) tends to lose this uncertainty (certainty) across communications.

They demonstrate that adding a certain and immediate mere token amount to both options increases choices of the later-larger option in intertemporal choice and of the riskier-larger option in risky choice.

Four studies show the deliberate consideration of price anchors that can play a key role in whether the effect of the anchors will generalize across product categories.

The results show that people are 8% less likely to say that they will purchase an alcoholic beverage in states that have alcohol advertising bans compared with states that do not. For consumers exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that have bans.

This is the case even though decision delegation actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their belief in free will (Study 2).

Furthermore, the authors show that when prices increase as a result of an increase in marginal costs, consumers respond by searching more, which then leads to higher prices and instant price adjustment.

Firms differ in their competence, and positions are differentiated in their prominence, which reflects consumers' online search behavior. They find that when endogenously evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the weaker competitor wins it.

However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences.

Primary demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand.

This research investigates how data on prior advertising expenditures and sales outcomes are used in budget allocation decisions and attempts to answer three important questions about data-based inferences. First, do biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall, exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme allocations.

Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong. Two incentive-aligned experiments show that this prediction can be valid in situations with public announcements of contest outcomes. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral economics; Contests; Experimental economics; Loss aversion; Sales management",""

The authors pursue these questions by analyzing the effects of advertising on new and refill prescriptions through the use of an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations.

This is because higher self-awareness increases customers' tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the provider. Self- awareness can even influence satisfaction with service interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store.

The authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she can decide whether to exercise the option.

That is, although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty. The authors discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for marketing. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Advertising effectiveness; Attitude certainty; Consumer behavior; Perceived elaboration; Self-regulatory depletion",""

Conventional wisdom suggests that adding an upscale or downscale item to a product line has a directionally consistent impact on price image, such that upscale extensions increase price image and downscale extensions decrease price image. In contrast, this research argues that vertical extensions can have the opposite effect, such that upscale extensions can decrease rather than increase price image, and vice versa for downscale extensions. The authors further propose that the impact of vertical extensions on price image is a function of consumer goals and, in particular, whether consumers have the intent of browsing or buying. The authors test these predictions in a series of five empirical studies that offer converging evidence in support of the proposed theory. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Browsing; Buying; Consumer goals; Price image; Vertical extensions",""

The authors give an affirmative answer to this question by developing a model that explicitly reports how persistent and transient marketing effects evolve over time. The proposed model provides managers with a valuable tool to evaluate their allocation of marketing expenditures over time. An application of the model to many pharmaceutical products, estimated through (exact initial) Kalman filtering, indicates that both persistent and transient effects occur predominantly immediately after a brand's Introduction. Subsequently, the size of the effects declines. The authors theoretically and empirically compare their methodology with methodology based on unit root testing and demonstrate that the need for unit root tests creates difficulties in applying conventional persistence modeling. The authors recommend that marketing models should either accommodate persistent effects that change over time or be applied to mature brands or limited time windows only. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Kalman filtering; Long-term marketing effectiveness; Persistence modeling; Pharmaceutical marketing; Time-varying parameters",""

Compatible appeals (i.e., appeals that elicit the same emotion as being incidentally experienced by the consumer) are less effective in influencing behavioral intentions and beverage consumption because of a process in which consumers discount the notion that they may cause the negative consequences outlined in the message.

It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors' approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households' choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Advertising; Customer choice; Econometric models; Endogeneity; Price effects",""

They focus on a validity problem that has not been investigated previously, namely, the impact of cognitive inertia on IAT effects. Cognitive inertia refers to the difficulty in switching from one categorization rule to another, which causes IAT effects to depend on the order of administration of the two IAT blocks. In Study 1, the authors observe an IAT effect when the compatible block precedes the incompatible block but not when it follows the incompatible block. In Studies 2 and 3, the IAT effect changes its sign when the order of the blocks reverses. Cognitive inertia distorts individual IAT scores and diminishes the correlations between IAT scores and predictor variables when the block order is counterbalanced between subjects. Study 4 shows that counterbalancing the block order repeatedly within subjects can eliminate cognitive inertia effects on the individual level. The authors conclude that researchers should either interpret IAT scores at the aggregate level or, if individual IAT scores are of Interest, counterbalance the block order repeatedly within subjects. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Cognitive inertia; Implicit association test; Implicit attitudes; Order effects; Validity",""

This is extremely difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members' television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are watching.

The authors conduct a simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of these three approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification. In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Covariance structure analysis; Generalized structured component analysis; Monte carlo simulations; Partial least squares; Structural equation modeling",""

However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the console war either with 10% more games or with a ""head start"" of one million units in installed base at the time of the PlayStation introduction. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Dynamic programming; Indirect network effect; Penetration pricing; Policy simulation; Price skimming",""

A major question is whether consumers continue to be willing to pay a price premium for NBs over PLs. Using consumer survey data from 22,623 respondents from 23 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas across, on average, 63 consumer packaged goods categories per country, this article studies how marketing and manufacturing factors affect the price premium a consumer is willing to pay for an NB over a PL. These effects are mediated by consumer perceptions of the quality of NBs in relation to PLs. Although the results do not bode well for NBs in the sense that willingness to pay decreases as PLs mature, the authors offer several managerial recommendations to counter this trend. In countries in which PLs are more mature, the route to success is to go back to manufacturing basics. In PL development countries, there is a stronger role for marketing to enhance the willingness to pay for NBs. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Consumer packaged goods; Cross-continent survey; Marketing-mix effects; Private labels; Willingness to pay",""

For example, in addition to supplying goods and services, a supplier may have a research-and-development alliance and a marketing alliance with a customer. This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The findings from panel data on supplier-customer relationships suggest that an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, among other methodological concerns.

The effect attenuates over longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time.

By comparing a product to a familiar but disparate experience, an analogy has the power to focus consumers on the evaluative, emotional, and multisensory information associated with the product experience. This focus on subjective product experience enables the identification of base preference (i.e., a consumer's liking for the comparison experience) as an important moderator of analogical persuasiveness.

The authors show that when evaluating combinations of healthy (virtue) and indulgent (vice) options, consumers tend to systematically underestimate the combined calorie content, such that they end up averaging rather than adding the calories contained in the vice and the virtue. The authors attribute this bias to the qualitative nature of people's Information processing, which stems from their tendency to categorize food items according to a good/bad dichotomy into virtues and vices.

The authors demonstrate that when an individual-level trial hazard model is properly specified to account for potential sources of biases, substantial contagion effects may be detected in the diffusion of many CPGs. Using longitudinal panel data on individual-level trial and repeat purchases of 67 newly introduced CPGs, they show that standard diffusion models fail to detect contagion. However, after extending the model to allow for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in contagion and controlling for various crosssectional and temporal confounds, they find statistically significant contagion effects in 33 to 40 of the 67 sample products. The empirical evidence of contagion in the diffusion of many CPGs has important implications because most new product trial models for CPGs have assumed a priori that there is no contagion in the diffusion of these products. Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into the unobservable network of influences among consumers. Such analysis allows a vendor to identify the most influential early adopters among its customers, who could help diffuse a new product more effectively in the market. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Consumer packaged goods; Contagion; Diffusion model; New product launch; Spatial heterogeneity; Temporal heterogeneity",""

The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space.

Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997-2005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures.

The current research demonstrates that even when consumers make a purchase, the same item may generate lower satisfaction when chosen from a larger rather than a smaller assortment. The authors explain this effect in terms of an expectation-disconfirmation mechanism. When assortments are small, consumers have low expectations about their ability to match their preferences. As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers' expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set. Either less positive or more negative disconfirmation leads to lower choice satisfaction.

They demonstrate through simulations that learning enables a firm to make more customized allocations and that acting on long-term customer responses prompts the firm to make proactive decisions that prevent customers from leaving.

The results from a set of experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices. Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 - 3.96, an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations (e.g., 5.00 -4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00).

It is important for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different consumer types. This article develops a dynamic model for debt repayment behavior of new customers in the credit card market that makes it possible to differentiate between low-risk, delinquent customers and high-risk customers. The authors apply the model to a data set of new consumers' monthly spending and repayment records. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Bayesian estimation; Customer relationship management; Market segmentation; Risk prediction; State space model",""

However, the question of how to motivate service employees to enhance service production has received little research attention. The authors address this gap by advocating a control mechanism first discussed in the economics literature-buyer monitoring. The authors focus on a pervasive form of buyer monitoring, voluntary tipping, and examine the effectiveness of this control mechanism as a means for improving service in two contexts: leisure cruises and restaurant dining. Despite a substantial interdisciplinary literature reporting a weak relationship between customers' perceptions of service and their tipping behavior, the results show that a policy of voluntary tipping has positive effects on the motivation and behavior of service workers and on customers' perceptions of the service those workers provide. These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for motivating service employees. The findings also call into question trends away from tipping in service contexts, such as the cruise industry, and suggest that many service businesses for which tipping is not viable can benefit from alternative forms of buyer monitoring. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Buyer monitoring; Employee control mechanisms; Personalized service; Service quality; Tipping",""

The authors use the governance lens of transaction cost economics to propose that leveraging the vendor's brand reputation and safeguarding the vendor's customization investments are key motivators for choosing branded component contracts. Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and when the component supplier has made significant component customization investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the ""wrong"" contract form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in nature. In particular, choosing a ""white box"" contract when the theory argues for a branded component contract leads to more adverse outcomes than choosing a branded component contract when the theory predicts a ""white box"" contract.

Partitions draw attention to the consumption decision by introducing a small transaction cost; that is, they provide more decision-making opportunities so that prudent consumers can control consumption. Thus, people are better able to constrain consumption when resources associated with a desirable activity (which they are trying to control) are partitioned rather than when they are aggregated. This effect of partitioning is demonstrated for the consumption of chocolates (Study 1) and gambles (Study 2). In Study 3, process measures reveal that partitioning increases recall accuracy and decision times. Importantly, the effect of partitioning diminishes when consumers are not trying to regulate consumption (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, Study 4 explores how habituation may decrease the amount of attention that partitions draw to consumption.

The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions, accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country, the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects.

The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from high-local-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million. Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically, the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Alliance management; Customer equity; Dynamic programming; Sports marketing",""

However, little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color, and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Endogeneity; Eye tracking; Instrument variable; Promotion; Visual marketing",""

Specifically, they show that size estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension).

The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95% spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability by 66% over a model that ignores these effects. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Competition; Outlet location; Pricing; Spatial statistics; Structural models",""

The extant marketing theory predicts that the optimal prize structure should have two characteristics: (1) The number of prizewinners should be greater than one, and (2) prize values should be unique and rank ordered. However, this theory has not been empirically examined. This article presents two empirical studies that examine whether the prize structure of a sales contest affects sales performance. In each study, the authors investigate the incremental effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one. However, introducing rank-ordered prizes into contests with multiple prizewinners does not boost sales effort and revenues.","Experimental economics; Field experiments; Sales contests; Sales management",""

This article challenges this claim. The authors formulate an empirically realistic model of dynamic price competition that allows for differentiated products and imperfect lock-in. They calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased packaged goods markets. These data are ideal in the sense that they have the necessary variation to identify switching costs separately from consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes the results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching costs. More important, equilibrium prices do not increase even in the presence of switching costs that are of the same order of magnitude as product price. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Brand loyalty; Competition; Dynamic oligopoly; Pricing; Switching costs",""

The authors suggest two mechanisms (prior perception spillover and dynamic perception spillover) and one moderating variable (product/brand similarity). To test for spillovers across competing brands, the authors develop a structural Bayesian learning model and estimate it using prescription choice and marketing communication data from a panel of physicians. From their model results, the authors find evidence of prior and dynamic perception spillovers across competing brands only when brands are sufficiently similar. In contrast, they find no evidence of spillover effects across brands that are highly dissimilar. Finally, several policy experiments illustrate the strength and significance of competitive spillovers for product diffusion, and from the results, the authors derive strategic implications for order-of-entry effects and the entry of ""me-too"" products. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Bayesian learning framework; Branding; Consumer choice; New products; Spillovers",""

Second, the authors investigate the impact of priors for the covariance of parameter heterogeneity when the predictor variables are qualitative. Estimates of the omitted effects are spurious with the standard prior. The authors propose an effects prior that treats all effects symmetrically. Third, the authors consider willingness to pay. These ratio estimators magnify uncertainty in the price coefficients and can give unreasonable values for price-insensitive consumers. The authors show that estimation of willingness to pay can be greatly improved by restricting the parameters without distorting them. In all three cases, the standard, noninformative priors perform well for nonsparse data.

This conflict in imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness. Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help, characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the amount of money they donated.

The authors examine these propositions in a series of studies that allow self-customization through the use of either a by-attribute or a by-alternative method. They show that consumers tend to choose an intermediate (compromise) option significantly more often when they customize a product using the by-attribute method than when using the by-alternative method. In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty, greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally, the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics.

In Experiment 1, bargainers use informational and relational messages to establish a positive social tenor in the interaction. Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of high (versus low) rustworthiness also produce quicker and more efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits. However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad. Compared with no communication, relational messages elicit the most positive (negative) outcomes when trustworthiness reputations are high (low).

The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's ""control function"" approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated.

Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect.

The authors develop a behavioral theory-driven choice model that accounts for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 × 2 conjoint choice experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their decision goals. The authors further suggest possible marketing actions a firm can take to promote the use of a specific decision strategy that leads consumers to choose its product. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Bayesian; Category-based screening; Complementary products; Decision heuristics; Structural heterogeneity",""

Retention of the benefits leader is evidenced by the distortion of new information to favor the benefits leader and by greater-than-normative reversion to it. The authors also find that reversion does not occur when the initially leading product (that consumers switch from) is based on a cost savings.

The former is caused by consumer heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms' decisions. In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity, and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and without instrumenting for the explanatory variables.

This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996-2004 presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the author finds that the data support the model and its implications. Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic.

The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities.

Second, choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand shares when some of the brands are less popular than others.

For products for which heaviness is considered a positive attribute, packages with the product image placed at heavy locations are preferred, whereas for products for which heaviness is considered a negative attribute, packages using light locations are preferred. Furthermore, in the former category (e.g., snacks), a salient health goal, as opposed to a neutral goal, weakens the preference for packages using heavy locations, though this moderating effect of goal is weaker for healthful snacks than for regular snacks.

This calls for the extension of current stockkeeping unit choice models to consider attribute-level feedback effects.

In three laboratory experiments and two field studies, the authors find that changes in size appear smaller when packages and portions change in all three spatial dimensions—height, width, and length—than when they change in only one dimension. Specifically, they show that size estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension). Finally, consumers expect (and marketers offer) steeper quantity discounts when products are supersized in three dimensions than when they are supersized in one dimension, regardless of whether size information is present. © 2009 American Marketing Association.","estimation; food; packaging; psychophysics; purchase quantity; visual biases",""

In other words, the authors propose a ""no-regret"" rule in bidding. They impose no other restrictive assumptions on ""maximands"" or the bidders' behaviors in a competitive auction context. The authors model WTP as having two components: a pure product feature component and one based on the auction market environment. The latter includes bidder experience, seller reputation, and measures for competition among bidders and items. The proposed model is general enough to include a ""buy-it-now"" (equivalent to a posted price) auction mechanism. The authors use data on notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea. They find that most product characteristics matter in the expected ways. There are two additional primary findings: First, WTP declines as more similar items are concurrently listed with the focal item; there is an additional effect if these similar items also belong to the same brand. Therefore, market thickness matters for consumer WTP. Second, more extensive site surfing and bidding histories lead to lower WTP, implying that search costs and experience matter in bidding. As specific substantive benefits, the authors demonstrate how sellers can calculate changes in WTP and, thus, the expected revenue as the number of concurrently available similar items varies. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the basis of the model estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines for optimal bundle design. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

In contrast, in the near future, the concerns are more about switching- and affective-cost uncertainties. In Studies 2 and 2a, using theories of mental simulation, the authors show that in the distant-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote outcome simulations are more effective in reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in the near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote process simulations are better at reducing switching cost and affective uncertainties, assuaging anxiety, and increasing behavioral intentions. The authors also find positive effects of these communication strategies on actual adoption rates and postconsumption satisfaction (Study 2) and on delayed behavioral intentions (Study 2a). In addition, these communication strategies are more efficacious in increasing behavioral intentions when uncertainty levels are higher (Study 3). The key managerial implications are that communication strategies for new products need to reduce uncertainties about costs and benefits and account for temporal distance to adoption. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Communication strategies; Mental simulation; New products; Postconsumption satisfaction; Temporal distance",""

The authors take an intrapsychic perspective on social desirability and propose that the presence of others - in the absence of direct interaction - leads to the automatic activation of a concern with the impression others are forming. They find that words applicable to social desirability are accessed faster when respondents are in the presence of another person than when they are alone. Across three experiments, semantic (but not perceptual) memory for words and advertisements applicable to social desirability is greater than that for neutral cues after respondents are exposed to these in the actual or imagined presence of others than when they are alone. Respondents' chronic impression management tendencies (self-monitoring) moderate the effects, suggesting that the effects are, at least in part, determined by motivational factors. This novel theoretical framework provides direct implications for advertisers and marketing researchers who rely on recall memory as one of the most common measures of advertising effectiveness. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

They develop a dynamic structural model of a household that decides when, what, and how much to buy, as well as how much to consume, to maximize its expected utility over an infinite horizon. By making certain simplifying assumptions, the authors reduce the dimensionality of the problem. They estimate the proposed model using household purchase data in the canned tuna and paper towels categories. The results from the model offer insights into the decomposition of promotional effects into its components. This could help managers make inferences about which brand's sales are more responsive to stockpiling or increase in consumption expansion and how temporary price cuts affect future sales. Contrary to previous literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant force for the increase in sales. They show that brand-loyal consumers respond to a price promotion mainly by stockpiling for future consumption, whereas brand switchers do not stockpile at all. The authors also find that heavy users stockpile more, whereas light users mainly increase consumption when there is a price promotion. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Consumer heterogeneity; Decomposition of promotional effects; Dynamic structural model; Flexible consumption",""

The authors examine alternative theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group, stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast, and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher postpurchase evaluations.

In this article, the authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters (JUMP) model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two related but independent facets - satisfaction level and satisfaction strength - and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction-loyalty link in a business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty).

In most industries, competing firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters.

Four studies manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to-read font (Study 1) or by asking participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice (Studies 2-4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of decision conflict, these effects are obtained without changing the attributes of the alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or the reference points.

However, the resultant increase in consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article, the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes. They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an increase in repeat purchases. These benefits easily offset the negative aspect of consumer stockpiling - namely, purchase acceleration by loyal customers who would have bought the brand at regular price at a later date. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

Because preferences are often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks). However, this difference in choice likelihood due to task transparency is observed only for novices (versus experts), and making the identification of stated preferences more difficult eliminates the effect by decreasing the choice likelihood following more (versus less) transparent tasks. The author identifies consumers' understanding of their own preferences as the mechanism underlying the task transparency effect.

With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer-supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism.

In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The authors show that this ""preference"" might just be a learned solution to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers' preferences. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Behavioral decision theory; Choice construction; Constructed preferences; Context-dependent preferences; Preference learning",""

Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit impact. Deep, featured promotions on high ""consumer-pull"" brands generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact.

Under their assumptions for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/ substitutability across categories.

They develop three buyer-centric measures for the intensity level of each competing make from this information: (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to the buyer's location).

The authors describe and test two characteristics pertaining to one specific rule that dictates that consumers should not pay for delays, even if they are beneficial: rule invocation and rule override. The results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule, that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem but can be overridden.

An alternative perspective suggests that consumers often suffer from a reverse self-control problem-namely, excessive farsightedness and overcontrol, or ""hyperopia."" This research examines whether consumers can foresee the detrimental long-term consequences of hyperopia. Five studies demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret relaxes self-control and motivates consumers to counteract their righteousness. Consumers are more likely to select indulgences and luxuries when they judge the longer-term regrets of others, anticipate their own regret in the distant future, and reflect on their regret regarding an actual decision made in the more distant past. The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping mall and during Thanksgiving. These experiments demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret leads consumers to buy pleasurable products rather than practical necessities and to spend more on shopping.

However, preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high.

There is no difference in ownership of products that have been available for many years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when risks associated with a really new product are not specified to consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for products that are not portrayed as new.

In such situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they may be uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV). They find that consumer learning can result in a win-win situation for both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall CLV with consumer learning than without.

In this article, the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable - namely, product capital - that affects acquisition performance and predicts which firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors also present a mechanism by which product capital affects performance - namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment of targets' innovation potential.

Such firms are better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying this potential to gain competitive advantage.

In Experiments 1-3, the authors demonstrate that when people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility hinders processing of the message.

Across three studies, the authors show that the effect of issue capability is moderated by gender, depending on the compatibility between the goal orientation of the decision maker and the nature of the decision task. For decisions that are mainly driven by achievement of gains (e.g., investment decisions), men's risk-taking propensity is more influenced by their levels of issue capability than women's because the nature of the decision task is consistent with men's agentic orientation focused on the self. Conversely, for decisions that are mainly driven by avoidance of losses (e.g., insurance decisions), women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability than men's because the nature of such decisions is consistent with women's communion orientation. The authors analyze the betting data from the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! game show (Study 1).The results show that gender moderates the effect of issue capability on the actual betting behavior in Jeopardy! In Study 2, the authors test the underlying mechanism through mediation analyses of the focus of attention. In Study 3, the authors manipulate the task nature and demonstrate that men's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in investment decisions, whereas women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in insurance decisions. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Agency-communion theory; Financial decisions; Gender; Goal orientation; Issue capability; Risk taking",""

The authors examine whether such trade-in behavior, in which consumers must negotiate the price for both the new and the used product, affects their willingness-to-pay price for the new good. Drawing on research on mental accounting, the authors reason that when consumers engage in a transaction involving a trade-in (i.e., when they act as both buyer and seller simultaneously), they place more importance on getting a good value for the used product than on getting a good price for the new product. As a result, such consumers exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay price for the new product than consumers who just buy the new product alone. The results from a series of laboratory experiments provide systematic support for this hypothesis. Finally, the authors lend external validity to their results by confirming the hypothesis using real-world transaction data from the automobile market. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Automobile market; Mental accounting; Trade-ins",""

With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI - a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers-using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","",""

It is argued that when consumers are uncertain about their preferences, they are more likely to prefer an assortment for which the number of available options matches the desired purchase quantity. This prediction is based on the notion that a match between the size of an assortment and the number of to-be-purchased items enables consumers to simplify the selection process by eliminating the need to trade off the benefits and costs of individual choice alternatives - a strategy referred to as the ""quantity-matching heuristic.""

The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation-imitation decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Entry strategy; Innovation management; Market research; New product development",""

This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and longterm effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity.

These appeals are deliberately vague in the sense that they give little information about the product to which the prices refer. The author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image even with this vagueness. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use such a strategy. The author shows analytically that such advertising can be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers' costs or when the selling cost is high.","",""

Yet there is evidence that many users prefer a flat rate even though their billing rate would be lower with a pay-per-use tariff (flat-rate bias), and some users prefer a pay-per-use tariff even though they would save money with a flat rate (pay-per-use bias). The authors conduct four empirical analyses based on three different data sets. They show that the flat-rate bias is more important and has a greater regularity and time persistence than the pay-per-use bias. They classify potential causes of the flat-rate bias as ""insurance effect,"" ""taxi meter effect,"" ""convenience effect,"" and ""overestimation effect"" and show that the insurance, the taxi meter, and the overestimation effects lead to a flat-rate bias. They provide evidence that underestimation of usage is a major cause of the pay-per-use bias. They show that the flat-rate bias does not significantly increase customer churn and thus results in a short- and long-term profit increase.

The core organizing principle of this model is a three-way fit among firm resources, investments, and governance that yields the highest net receipts. From this principle, the authors derive predictions and test them using data from 193 original equipment manufacturers that engage independent component suppliers. The data show that investments must be aligned with more complete contract terms (e.g., fixed prices, ""hard"" designs) to yield cost reduction outcomes for all firms. However, investments must be aligned with more incomplete contracts (e.g., cost-plus prices, ""soft"" designs) to yield endproduct enhancement outcomes, but only for firms with relatively small downstream market margins. Firms with larger downstream market margins find that the previous alignment reduces end-product enhancements. These results are robust to checks for common method bias and alternative estimation procedures.

The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion).

The model is applied to seven years of data on weekly sales of 100 different brands in 25 product categories. The authors find many significant moderating effects on the elasticity of price promotions. Brands in categories that are characterized by high price differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find significant effects for the cumulative elasticity.

When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is difficult to control for item- and time period-specific unmeasured characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists. In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting the stores, the data contain the time period-specific item-level information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has some sales in each time period.

The authors show that when the service differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

The standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without including the common variables. This is the object required for marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete variables is required.

The authors propose an alternative model in which consumers use only ""ordered value"" information; that is, utilities are functions only of the relative orderings of the attributes' values across alternatives (e.g., choices depend only on the price ordering and not on actual prices). The ordered value model is attractive because it fits well with psychological evidence that consumers often favor decision mechanisms that are cognitively less demanding. Using a supermarket shopper panel data set, the authors evaluate four models in which (1) all consumers use actual values; (2) all consumers use ordered values; (3) some consumers use actual values all the time, and some consumers use ordered values all the time; and (4) all consumers use both actual values and ordered values but with different propensities. In the analysis, the ordered value model finds stronger support than the actual value model: Model 1 outperforms Model 2; in the two hybrid choice models (Models 3 and 4), ordered value processing is more prevalent than actual value processing.

In this study, the authors investigate consumers' evaluations of different mass customization configurations when they are asked to mass customize a product. For example, mass customization configurations may differ in the number of modules that can be mass customized. In the context of mass customization of personal computers, the authors find that mass customization configuration affects the product utility that consumers can achieve in mass customization as well as their perception of mass customization complexity. In turn, product utility and complexity affect the utility that consumers derive from using a certain mass customization configuration. More specifically, product utility has a positive effect and complexity has a negative effect on mass customization utility. The effect of complexity is direct as well as indirect because complexity also lowers product utility. The authors also find that consumers with high levels of product expertise consider mass customization configurations less complex than do consumers with low levels of product expertise and that for more-expert consumers, complexity has a less-negative impact on product utility. The study has important managerial implications for how companies can design their mass customization configuration to increase utility and decrease complexity.","",""

For example, temporary price reductions (high-frequency price changes) can be used to price discriminate in the short run, whereas regular price adjustments (low-frequency price changes) might reflect changes in long-term costs or demand. Time disaggregation cannot disentangle these factors, because frequency aggregation exists even when data are analyzed at the lowest possible level of temporal aggregation. Because little is known about the nature of pricing interactions across various planning cycles, this article develops several empirical generalizations about the role of periodicity in pricing. Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the planning horizon of the predominant interaction does not typically coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5) periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within a category.

The authors show that SKU-level parameters can be recovered by calculation from estimated attribute-level parameters, circumventing the need for direct estimation of the more complex SKU-level model. They calibrate the store data market share model using 98 weeks of data for ten brands and 168 SKUs of toothpaste. Rather than estimate 168 preference parameters (when there is an ""outside"" alternative in addition to the 168 ""inside"" ones), it is only necessary to estimate ten brand-preference parameters from which the 168 parameters can be computed, as long as share and marketing-mix data are available at the SKU level.

In this article, the authors compare the impact on retailer profitability of two price discrimination mechanisms: quantity discounts based on package size (second-degree price discrimination) and store-level pricing or micromarketing (third-degree price discrimination). Whereas the latter has been well addressed in the marketing literature, there is limited empirical research on the use of quantity discounts for price discrimination. Using store-level sales data, the authors estimate a structural demand model, accounting for parameter heterogeneity and price endogeneity. They combine the parameter estimates with a model of retailer pricing to conduct optimal pricing and profitability simulations under several scenarios, ranging from constraining the retailer not to engage in any form of price discrimination to the least restrictive scenario of setting nonlinear price schedules specific to each store. The pricing simulations enable the decomposition of profitability as a result of the different forms of price discrimination.

Because consumers give more weight to capability and less weight to usability before use than after use, they tend to choose overly complex products that do not maximize their satisfaction when they use them, resulting in ""feature fatigue."" An analytical model based on these results provides additional insights into the feature fatigue effect. This model shows that choosing the number of features that maximizes initial choice results in the inclusion of too many features, potentially decreasing customer lifetime value.

This article examines how standards competition affects consumer behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements-negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion - disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3).

It is proposed that regulatory fit changes the significance of consumers' reactions to something, including the perceived monetary value of a choice they have made or the persuasiveness of a message they have received. When there is a fit, people engage more strongly in and ""feel right"" about what they are doing, and subsequent evaluative reactions (positive or negative) can be intensified by this fit experience. The fit experience is shown to influence the strength of value experiences independent of hedonic experiences. The authors discuss how the fit effect on value is distinct from other factors that affect value, such as relevancy, matching, hedonic mood, and arousal. Using prior research on this topic, this article summarizes the current state of knowledge about how fit influences value and offers new ideas for further research. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

However, there is considerable disagreement about how life stages should be defined and how households progress through these stages. Existing studies use a priori definitions, which are tested on a cross-sectional survey of households collected at a single point in time and thus cannot reveal the real dynamics of the household life cycle. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have followed since 1968. They develop a hidden Markov model in which the stages of the household life cycle are taken as latent, unobservable states that are uncovered from the manifest household demographic profiles over the 34 years, assuming that households evolve through these latent stages following a first-order Markov process. The authors apply their results to classify members of another panel (Consumer Expenditure Survey) into life stages, which enables them to study the impact of the household life cycle on households' budgetary allocations, providing a comprehensive analysis of lifestyles (through expenditure patterns) over the household life cycle. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

A few open questions are whether loss aversion is a stable feature of preference, whether it is an expression of fear, and what are its properties.","",""

The authors analyze the data with a dynamic simultaneous-equations model of the drivers and the interrelationships of the behaviors of movie audiences, studios, and exhibitors. Specifically, the authors test for the attenuating role of third-party information sources, such as critics' review consensus and cumulative word of mouth, on the strength of the two aforementioned signals. The authors find evidence of such an effect both at the release phase across movies and over the postrelease phase for any movie.

In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related ""hard-part"" product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically ""Good,"" ""Better,"" ""Best""); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter to previous grocery retailing-based findings. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real café reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting ""bonus"" stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a ""regular"" 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal. In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients.

Additional studies show that screening encourages decision makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and 4).

In this article, the authors propose an alternative model.

The author accommodates heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and criterion attributes.

In this comment to Novemsky and Kahneman's article, the authors consider the new empirical results that involve probabilistic buying and selling, suggesting caution in generalizing the results to nonprobabilistic commerce. The authors expand Novemsky and Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion could evolve.","",""

Specifically, they address the question, Why are some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between 1960 and 2001 from a cross-national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate for a moderate length of time on promising ideas. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

The results from five studies show that customers evaluate a counterextension more favorably when the preceding extension is a success rather than a failure. Furthermore, the evaluation of the counterextension is superior if it is launched by a major brand, especially if the previous successful extension was also launched by a major brand. Finally, a successful extension indirectly dilutes a brand and results in a greater loss in choice share to a counterextension than does a failed extension.

Marketing models are usually applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing. Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium, allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and for psychologists who prize realism. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

The framework draws on research in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus noncomparative nature of thoughts generated influences their diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.","",""

Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time.

These two features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules currently described in the literature.

Applications using both types of data suggest that the proposed models predict as well as linear models do; can make different predictions of consideration, choice, and market shares; and provide insights into consumer decision processes that are different from those obtained with linear models. © 2005, American Marketing Association.","",""

The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals, particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals, leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn, this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic goals. The results have public policy implications for behaviors such as binge drinking and unrestrained eating. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","",""

Corrections to these default judgments occur when processing is thoughtful. These results underscore the idea that culture does not exert a constant, unwavering effect on consumer judgments.

In experimental settings, in which consumers are presented with simple descriptions of product offerings, continuous distributions of heterogeneity, such as the multivariate normal, provide a useful representation of preference. However, in more complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that result in selective attention to a subset of the information available, continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different respondents. Identifying which attributes are used in a brand choice decision is closely related to the statistical procedure of variable selection.

Most theoretical approaches to vertical integration of the distribution function pose the classic question of whether to forward integrate or use independent entities. Having concurrent channels means doing both. This phenomenon is poorly understood, even though it has been growing rapidly. The authors argue that under certain circumstances, it is impossible for manufacturers to prevent channel types from competing with each other, either because both channel types contact the same customer or because the customer sets them in competition against each other. The authors argue that when these situations are frequent or more consequential for the parties involved, firms reduce their usage of concurrent channels to prevent severe channel conflict. The authors posit five such circumstances. Using original data from prominent manufacturers operating in competitive markets worldwide, they model usage of both types of channels to cover one geography with the same products. They find substantial support for their model. Furthermore, in a subset of firms that use both channel types in the same market, they model the degree to which direct and indirect channels compete destructively against each other when contacting the same customers. The authors find that suppliers reduce such behavior by incurring costs to differentiate each channel's offerings, setting out ""rules of engagement,"" and compensating both channel types when either one makes a sale. © 2005, American Marketing Association.","",""

First, the authors model how respondents infer missing levels of product attributes in a partial conjoint profile by developing a learning-based imputation model that nests several extant models. The advantage of this approach over previous research is that it infers missing levels of an attribute not only from prior levels of the same attribute but also from prior levels of other attributes, especially ones that match the attribute levels of the current product profile. Second, the authors provide an empirical demonstration of their approach and test whether learning in conjoint studies occurs; to what extent; and in what manner it affects responses, partworths, and the relative importance of attributes. They show that the relative importance of attribute partworths can shift when subjects evaluate partial profiles, which suggests that consumers may construct rather than retrieve partworths and are sensitive to the order in which the profiles are presented. Finally, the results show that consumers' imputation processes can be influenced by manipulating their prior information about a product category. This research is of both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this research sheds light on how customers integrate different sources of information in evaluating products with incomplete attribute information; practically, it highlights the potential pitfalls of imputing missing attribute levels using simple rules and develops a better behavioral model for describing and predicting customers' ratings for partial conjoint profiles.","",""

Most of the proposed methodologies in the marketing literature require household panel data, which can be difficult to obtain. There is a growing stream of work in marketing and in empirical industrial organization that estimates segmentation structure with aggregate data. This article is a careful attempt to understand the extent to which disaggregate structure in the form of a latent-class model can be recovered from aggregate data. The authors show that under specific assumptions and when the household-level model is correctly specified, most of a latent-class segmentation structure is identifiable even if only store-level aggregate data are available. Therefore, the store data-based estimates for the latent-class model are consistent. In other words, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the estimates goes to zero with infinite sample size. To assess how well latent-class structure can be estimated from store data sets of sample sizes that are comparable to those in real life, the authors simulate more than 60,000 store data sets and compute the consequent model estimates and their estimation errors. The results show that the MAD of the latent-class estimates diminishes much more slowly with store data than with household data. Moreover, the rate is so slow that obtaining estimates with reasonably small MADs often requires unreasonably large sample sizes. The authors' simulations offer guidance on conditions that favor obtaining more accurate estimates from store-level data.","",""

However, consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and choice deferral for the two response modes. The authors' theoretical account suggests that an initial focus on the buy/no-buy decision activates greater use of alternative-based evaluations, thus making purchase deferral more sensitive to the valence of shared features and category reference information than in the unconditional brand-choice mode.

The findings include insights into the dynamics of product compliance: The data support the proposed four-stage evolution of compliant behavior between consecutive service provider (e.g., doctor) interventions. For marketers, the authors find substantial heterogeneity across consumers for the effects of cues from advertising and distribution. For example, in some segments, advertising has a positive impact on compliance (directly and/or by heightening responsiveness to product-efficacy evaluations), whereas in other segments, its effect is negative.

In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the ""idiosyncratic fit heuristic,"" whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.","",""

Given the model assumptions and the market being studied, the authors find that not accounting for demand endogeneity can create bias in the estimation, the retailer seems to price below the static profit-maximizing prices for two of the three brands, and the inferred marginal wholesale prices are below the equilibrium uniform wholesale prices for two brands.

Although the models are motivated by theory from economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications, the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity, and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference point over ""tournament models"" in which each option serves as a reference point.

The author finds that signaling can limit a seller's ability to screen, especially when buyers are willing to pay a significant premium for higher quality. To signal, the seller generally lengthens base warranties and shortens optional coverage, making the bundles for each type of buyer more and more similar.

The authors develop the comparability-based balance model, which is a unified framework for modeling bundle choices. The model can be employed for any bundle, regardless of the heterogeneity of bundle components, under a pure bundling strategy. The conjoint model and balance model are special cases of the general model. The authors use mixture distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in a more flexible manner than the extant approaches such as latent-class and random-coefficient models. The empirical tests of the model show that most attribute effects are significant and consistent with the model's predictions. The model is superior to those that do not consider the issues of comparability of attributes, latent-class structure, and heterogeneity among respondents.

However, prechoice disclosure of an attribute's triviality heightens the role of the brand and context cues. Competing low equity brands benefit by sharing the trivial attribute with a higher equity brand, whereas competing high equity brands benefit from uniquely offering a trivial attribute. Postchoice revelation that an attribute is trivial hurts the subsequent ability of a low but not a high equity brand to differentiate in a new product category, particularly among subjects who had previously chosen the target brand.

Second, the authors show that though the desire for uniqueness leads to higher prices and firm profits, a desire for conformity leads to lower prices and profits.

The key to measuring the influence of loyalty programs is that they operate as dynamic incentive schemes by providing benefits based on cumulative purchasing over time. As such, loyalty programs encourage consumers to shift from myopic or single-period decision making to dynamic or multiple-period decision making. In this study, the author models customers' response to a loyalty program under the assumption that purchases represent the sequential choices of customers who are solving a dynamic optimization problem. The author estimates the theoretical model using a discrete-choice dynamic programming formulation. The author evaluates a specific loyalty program with data from an online merchant that specializes in grocery and drugstore items. Through simulation and policy experiments, it is possible to evaluate and compare the long-term effects of the loyalty program and other marketing instruments (e.g., e-mail coupons, fulfillment rates, shipping fees) on customer retention.

To establish the institutional and theoretical bases for these results, the authors relax the conventional assumption that the product being exchanged is completely specifiable in a contract. They show that the institution of bargaining has force, and it affects channel coordination when the complexity of nonspecifiability of the product exchange is present.

Response models condition on the observed marketing-mix variables and focus on the specification of the distribution of observed sales given marketing-mix activities. The models usually fail to recognize that the levels of the marketing-mix variables are often chosen with at least partial knowledge of the response parameters in the conditional model. This means that contrary to standard assumptions, the marginal distribution of the marketing-mix variables is not independent of response parameters. The authors expand on the standard conditional model to include a model for the determination of the marketing-mix variables. They apply this modeling approach to the problem of gauging the effectiveness of sales calls (details) to induce greater prescribing of drugs by individual physicians. They do not assume a priori that details are set optimally, but instead they infer the extent to which sales force managers have knowledge of responsiveness, and they use this knowledge to set the level of sales force contact. The authors find that their modeling approach improves the precision of the physician-specific response parameters significantly.

For example, to target consumers for a coupon mailing, a retail chain may want to predict whether a prospective customer's grocery expenditures exceed a predetermined threshold. The current approach to this prediction problem is to model the response variable and then apply the discretizing function to the predicted value of the response variable. In contrast with this ""indirect"" approach, the authors propose a ""direct"" approach in which they model discretized values of the response variable. They show theoretically that the direct approach achieves better predictive performance than the commonly used indirect approach when the response model is misspecified and the sample size is large. These two conditions are commonly met in direct marketing situations. This result is counterintuitive because the direct approach entails ""throwing away"" information. However, although both the discretized response data and the continuous data provide biased predictions when a misspecified model is used, the lower information content of the discretized variable helps the bias be smaller. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation experiment, a retail targeting application, and a customer satisfaction application. The key managerial implication of the result is that the current practice of restricting attention to models based on the indirect approach may be suboptimal. Target marketers should expand the set of candidate models to include models based on the proposed direct approach.","",""

A key result is that the majority of the sales promotion elasticity, approximately 74% on average, is attributed to secondary demand effects (brand switching) and the remainder is attributed to primary demand effects (timing acceleration and quantity increases). The authors demonstrate that this result does not imply that if a brand gains 100 units in sales during a promotion, the other brands in the category lose 74 units. The authors offer a complementary decomposition measure based on unit sales. The measure shows the ratio of the current cross-brand unit sales loss to the current own-brand unit sales gain during promotion; the authors report empirical results for this measure. They also derive analytical expressions that transform the elasticity decomposition into a decomposition of unit sales effects. These expressions show the nature of the difference between the two decompositions. To gain insight into the magnitude of the difference, the authors apply these expressions to previously reported elasticity decomposition results and find that approximately 33% of the unit sales increase is attributable to losses incurred by other brands in the same category.","",""

However, the role of synergy in multimedia communications is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how advertisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multimedia communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive theoretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspending. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research.","",""

Hypothesis testing is facilitated by survey data on actual purchase decisions and hazard models that incorporate individual heterogeneity. The results support the suggested role of attitude functions in explaining and predicting interpurchase intervals and suggest means by which managers can position their products to shorten interpurchase intervals.","",""

The psychophysics of pricing suggests that changes in monetary magnitude are not based on their absolute level, but rather on their deviation from some reference level, or how the change is ""framed."" Often, however, a promotion is presented in nonmonetary terms (e.g., a premium). When two resources are delivered simultaneously, but in different currencies (e.g., receive a free razor with the purchase of a can of shaving cream), the marginal value of the nonmonetary, incremental benefit may be difficult to evaluate in relation to the focal product or its price. Therefore, the value of the premium may be less likely than a comparable discount to be viewed in a relative sense and thus less likely to suffer from diminishing marginal returns. This research explores how people often fail to exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to an incremental benefit, or cost, when it is accrued in a currency other than the referent currency. The authors define two different carriers of wealth or welfare (i.e., resources) that are difficult to convert into any meaningful common unit of measurement as ""incommensurate.""

This practice can be problematic if there are unobservable factors that affect the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. When such a correlation exists, it is important to model simultaneously the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. The authors propose a model suitable for scanner-panel data in which the no-purchase decision depends on the price, feature, and display of each brand in the category and on house-hold stock of inventory. They link the no-purchase model to the brand-choice outcome through marketing-mix covariates and through unobservables that affect both outcomes. The authors assume that model parameters are heterogeneous across households and allow for a flexible correlation structure between the coefficients in the no-purchase model and those in the brand-choice model. The model formulation is more general than what is possible from either a nested logit model or a translog utility model and from models in which the no-purchase outcome is an additional outcome with the deterministic component of its utility set equal to zero. The authors estimate the proposed model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods.

The authors extend the processing fluency model to examine the effect of conceptual fluency on attitudes. In three experiments, the authors show that when a target comes to mind more readily and becomes conceptually fluent, as when it is presented in a predictive context (e.g., a bottle of beer featured in an advertisement that shows a man entering a bar) or when it is primed by a related construct (e.g., an image of ketchup following an advertisement of mayonnaise), participants develop more favorable attitudes toward the target. It is believed that positive valence of fluent processing underlies these processing-fluency effects.

To identify domains in which individual adaptation is promising (and domains in which it is not), the authors evaluate the performance of polyhedral choice-based conjoint analysis methods with Monte Carlo experiments. They vary magnitude (response accuracy), respondent heterogeneity, estimation method, and question-design method in a 4 × 23 experiment.

The benchmarks for individual adaptation are random designs, orthogonal designs, and aggregate customization.

In an influential meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories, and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81 studies, the average price elasticity is -2.62. A salient finding is that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price elasticities.

Almost all applications of the models in marketing rely on segment retention criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, consistent Akaike's information criterion, and information complexity to determine the number of latent segments to retain. Because these applications employ real-world data in which the true number of segments is unknown, it is not clear whether these criteria are effective. Retaining the true number of segments is crucial because many product design and marketing decisions depend on it. The purpose of this extensive simulation study is to determine how well commonly used segment retention criteria perform in the context of simulated multinomial choice data, as obtained from supermarket scanner panels, in which the true number of segments is known. The authors find that an Akaike's information criterion with a penalty factor of three rather than the traditional value of two has the highest segment retention success rate across nearly all experimental conditions. Currently, this criterion is rarely, if ever, applied in the marketing literature. Experimental factors of particular interest in marketing contexts, such as the number of choices per household, the number of choice alternatives, the error variance of the choices, and the minimum segment size, have not been considered in the statistics literature.

To address those gaps, the authors first review prior approaches and identify the sources of their limitations. Then, the authors use the response surface approach (RSA) and derive three managerial insights that can be garnered from its use. They apply RSA to industrial distributor-supplier relationships and contrast it with previous methods. The empirical study results suggest that distributors perceive differential effects of supplier dependence and distributor dependence on outcome variables.

Two studies using simulated music shopping agents show that (1) additional recommendations of familiar products serve as a context in which unfamiliar recommendations are evaluated; (2) when the presentation of the recommendations makes unfamiliar and familiar products appear similar, evaluative assimilation results; and (3) when additional information about unfamiliar products is given, consumers discriminate them from the familiar products, which produces evaluative contrast. These results establish that information that leads to higher evaluations when context is absent can lead to contrast and lower evaluations in the presence of attractive contextual recommendations.","",""

Results from the model offer predictions on the relationships among coupon redemptions, shelf price, and coupon face value. The authors test these predictions on a large data set of hundreds of coupon events across six packaged goods categories. The data show that when a small coupon face value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory. When a firm moves from uniform pricing (e.g., no coupons) to second-degree price discrimination (e.g., coupons), all consumers may face a lower price. This finding has public policy implications because second-degree price discrimination may increase the welfare of every consumer.","",""

This is because not doing so biases response coefficient estimates that can potentially alter the conclusions drawn from such analyses. In this article, the authors present an extension to the latent class model (LCM) that accounts for additional heterogeneity by allowing households' preferences to be a continuous mixture of segment-level preferences. The authors show how their model generalizes the LCM by the mere addition of S + 1 parameters, where S refers to the number of segments. Because a limitation of the traditional LCM is that it does not adequately account for heterogeneity in responses across households, the authors' model mitigates this criticism leveled at the LCM. They then compare their model with the traditional LCM and the equivalent continuous mixture (random-effects) models in terms of model selection criteria and predictive ability. The results indicate that the authors' model outperforms both the LCM and the equivalent random-effects (logit) model on these criteria.","",""

A nested logit model improves the estimates, but not completely. Second, the authors estimate the models on real data. The results indicate that the structural model fits better and produces sensible coefficient estimates. The authors then observe the same pattern in switching elasticities as they do in the simulation. Third, the authors predict sales assuming a 50% increase in promotion frequency. The reduced-form models predict much higher sales levels than does the dynamic structural model. The authors conclude that reduced-form model estimates of brand-switching elasticities can be overstated and that a dynamic structural model is best for addressing the problem.

If so, why? The authors examine the effects of ambient scent on recall and recognition of brands in two studies. In the first (i.e., encoding) phase of each study, subjects are asked to evaluate familiar and unfamiliar brands while viewing digital photographs of products on a computer screen; stimulus viewing times are measured covertly on the computer. Ambient scent is manipulated in the experiment room through a diffuser. In the second (i.e., retrieval) phase, conducted 24-hours later, brand recall and recognition accuracy are assessed. In both studies, ambient scent improves both recall and recognition of familiar and unfamiliar brands. This pattern emerges whether or not the scent is congruent with the product category (Study 1), and the enhancement in brand memory is due to the presence of ambient scent during encoding rather than retrieval (Study 2). Although ambient scent apparently did not alter subjects' self-assessed mood or arousal levels, it increased their attention in terms of longer stimulus viewing times. Mediation analyses suggest that the attention mechanism most likely explains why ambient scent improves brand memory.","",""

To determine the appropriate number of entries in a specific firm's product line, the author develops a model that balances the benefits of increased revenue from a broad product line against production and engineering costs. Two innovations were central in the development of the model: (1) redefining how products are scored on various product attributes so that attribute scores vary normally across the population of products and (2) redefining how the number of entries in a product portfolio is calculated in order to discount the significance of entries that are highly similar to existing products. The author also introduces the notion of a centroid time to more easily adjust sales and total development costs for product life cycle and investment life cycle effects. These redefinitions enable a firm's profit to be modeled as a simple function of its effective number of product entries, the effective number of competitors entries, the total sales in the segment, variable profits adjusted for capacity constraints, and product development costs. This leads to a simple expression for the profit-maximizing number of effective entries, both when competitor portfolios are fixed and when competitors dynamically adjust their portfolios.

These conditions involve a focal relationship's time horizon (i.e., its extendedness) and particular norms. The key theoretical argument is that the effect of specific investments on opportunism will shift in a nonmonotonic fashion over the range of these relationship conditions.

Models with continuous representations of heterogeneity fit the data better than models with discrete representations of heterogeneity. The goal of the current study is to compare the relative performance of logit choice models with discrete versus continuous representations of heterogeneity in terms of the accuracy of household-level parameters, fit, and forecasting accuracy. To accomplish this goal, the authors conduct an extensive simulation experiment with logit models in a scanner data context, using an experimental design based on AAC and other recent simulation studies. One of the main findings is that models with continuous and discrete representations of heterogeneity recover household-level parameter estimates and predict holdout choices about equally well except when the number of purchases per household is small, in which case the models with continuous representations perform very poorly.

They use a framework based on consumer brand choice under uncertainty and brands as signals of product positions to conduct their analysis. More specifically, they examine whether uncertainty about quality (or the positioning of the brand in the product space); perceived quality of store brands versus national brands; consistency in store-brand offerings over time; and consumer attitudes toward risk, quality, and price underlie the differential success of store brands at least partially in the United States and Europe.

Previous cross-category studies have typically assumed that the cross-category effects are the same across brands or items because the potential number of price effects to be estimated is large. The authors address this problem by decomposing the variability of cross-category price effects into two components: variability across items and across stores. They capture the variability across items by representing the item-level parameters as draws from distributions with category-level means. They account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen, and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than that of store brands on national brands.

The authors' model copes with the challenges that dynamic environments entail: nonstationarity, changes in parameters over time, missing data, and cross-sectional heterogeneity. They use this approach to model sales response in the frozen pizza category, in which the introduction of rising-crust pizza brands represents a major innovation. The model is directly applicable to other domains in which market structure might be nonstationary, such as changes in promotion strategy, shifts in the retail environment, and movements in macroeconomic factors. The authors find that innovation (1) makes the existing brands appear more similar, as indicated by increasing cross-brand price elasticities; (2) decreases brand differentiation for the existing brands, as indicated by an increase in the magnitude of own-brand price elasticities; and (3) increases the variance of the sales response equations temporarily around the time of the introduction of the innovation, indicating increased uncertainty in sales response. The authors discuss the managerial implications by presenting maps of how clout and vulnerability evolve over time, assessing the effect of new brands on cannibalization, and considering the strategic implications of the introduction of a flanker innovation to facilitate an extant brand's ability to attack an incumbent leader.","",""

They draw on research that supports links between color and feelings of relaxation and between feelings of relaxation and time perception. The authors predict that the background screen color influences how quickly a page is perceived to download and that feelings of relaxation mediate this influence. In a series of experiments, they manipulate the hue, value, and chroma dimensions of the color to induce more or less relaxed feeling states. The findings suggest that for each dimension, colors that induce more relaxed feeling states lead to greater perceived quickness. The authors provide triangulating evidence with an alternative manipulation: the number of times subjects wait for a download. As does color, this also leads to variation in levels of relaxation and perceived quickness. A final experiment reveals that color not only affects perceived download quickness but also has consequences for users' evaluations of the Web site and their likelihood of recommending it to others.","",""

Moderated relationships are central to marketing (e.g., Does the effect of promotion on sales depend on the market segment?). Multiple regression models not including a product term are widely used and well understood. The authors argue that researchers have derived from this simpler type of multiple regression several data analysis heuristics that, when inappropriately generalized to moderated multiple regression, can result in faulty interpretations of model coefficients and incorrect statistical analyses.

The resulting hypothesis that a hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices was supported in two choice experiments. In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership. Finally, consistent with the experimental findings, a field survey showed that, relative to market prices, owners of relatively hedonic cars value their vehicles more than do owners of relatively utilitarian cars.

The results of exploratory factor analyses revealed that perceived similarity is a multidimensional construct and that the number and structure of these dimensions of similarity are different when products differ in their degrees of goal congruency. Structural equation analyses of the measures based on a second sample confirmed the structure obtained in the earlier exploratory analyses and demonstrated that brand attitudes and purchase intention exhibit different relationships to the underlying dimensions of similarity in the goal-congruent and goal-incongruent conditions, consistent with expectations based on the theory of goal-derived categorization.

In contrast, and consistent with research by Wilson and colleagues (e.g., Wilson et al. 1989) on the disruptive effects of reasons analysis, the authors find that thinking about reasons significantly decreases the attitude - behavior correlation when the observed behavior occurs after a substantial delay. Study 2 not only replicates this finding but also suggests that the timing of the reasons task can be an important moderator of the disruption effect. Specifically, the authors draw on the literature on accountability effects to show that even when there is a delay between attitude and behavior measurement, reasons analysis leads to an increase in the attitude - behavior link, as long as reasons are analyzed after attitude measurement. Finally, in Study 3, the authors validate the account of the effects of reasons analysis by obtaining parallel findings for attitude persistence.

The pattern of results was similar when memory was tested a week after the initial exposure. In Experiment 2, in which participants were required to engage in a task designed to promote the ""binding"" between a brand and its claim, the memory confusion effects of repetition were significantly reduced. Finally, Experiment 3 replicated and generalized these findings by using more realistic stimuli and procedures.

Researchers expect to find a postpromotion dip because analyses of household scanner panel data indicate that consumers tend to accelerate their purchases in response to a promotion - that is, they buy earlier and/or purchase larger quantities than they would in the absence of a promotion. Thus, there should also be a pronounced dip in store-level sales in the weeks following a promotion. However, researchers rarely find such dips at either the category or the brand level. Several arguments have been proposed to account for the lack of a postpromotion dip in store-level sales data and to explain why dips may be hidden. Because dips are difficult to detect by traditional models (and by a visual inspection of the data), the authors propose models that can account for a multitude of factors that together cause complex pre-and postpromotion dips. The authors use three alternative distributed lead and lag structures: an Almon model, an unrestricted dynamic effects model, and an exponential decay model.

The authors find evidence that the level of contribution of each of these components varies by brand and culture. With respect to empirical generalizations, the key implication is that it is premature to make firm conclusions about theory on the basis of only one study.","",""

In this article, the authors present a decompositional model for analyzing brand ratings that addresses this nagging problem and provide insights for understanding the sources of brand equity. Starting with consumers' perceived level of a brand on an attribute, the authors decompose the rating into two components: brand-specific associations and general brand impressions. Brand-specific associations refer to features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand and that differentiate it from the competition. General brand impressions refer to general impressions about the brand that are based on a more holistic view of the brand. In this article, the authors focus on two principal issues: (1) How can the sources of bias that may be present in brand ratings be disentangled? and (2) Do these putatively biasing effects, if present, have any managerial implications for brand equity? The authors demonstrate the properties and advantages of the model in the context of three empirical applications.","",""

In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent. In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.","",""

The first model form captures individual heterogeneity by a latent class structure. The second model form captures individual heterogeneity by postulating that the brand-choice probabilities follow a Dirichlet distribution, which yields the popular Dirichlet multinomial formulation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with a view toward assessing whether individual transition probabilities can be captured from knowledge of only aggregated brand choices. Results indicate that the proposed method can indeed capture individual brand-transition probabilities under several different conditions. An empirical application illustrates how these models can be used to provide important information on individual brand transitions and the role of marketing-related covariates.","",""

Furthermore, the authors analyze cross-category correlations in gain and loss sensitivity to shed light on their individual-and category-specific characters. In three categories, the results show significant heterogeneity in loss sensitivity among consumers and indicate that loss sensitivity is greater and more heterogeneous than gain sensitivity. Across categories, the results show that loss-sensitive shoppers are less influenced by past brand use and that both loss-and gain-sensitive shoppers more sensitive to price, display, and feature than the average consumer. Loss-sensitive households tend to be larger, and their heads are less likely to be fully employed, whereas gain-sensitive households have no clear demographic profile.

Because there are potentially billions of possible schedules, the authors give a procedure for designing a fractional factorial experiment that can accommodate both programs of varying length and constraints on eligible program times. The authors also develop a latent class multinomial logit model for modeling program preferences and present a validation of our experimental procedure and the model. They also present an empirical test of the procedure in which they use the model to predict ratings for all the possible program schedules, not just those constituting the choice sets. In this example, the optimum schedule increases the predicted total weekly ratings during prime time by 18% for a network.

Although it has long been recognized that most purchase decisions are made with incomplete information, researchers still know little about the effect of missing information on consumer choice. Building on prior work by Slovic and MacPhillamy (1974), the authors demonstrate that a tendency to give more weight to attributes on which all considered options have values (common attributes), compared with attributes for which not all options have values (unique attributes), can often lead to intransitive preferences. Using process measures, the authors further show that buyers tend to interpret missing attribute values in a way that supports the purchase of the option that is superior on the common attribute. The results indicate that information presentation format and inferences about missing values cannot account for the observed effects of missing information on consumer choice. The authors also show that the purchase decisions of buyers who consider attribute importance before making a choice and those with high need for cognition are less susceptible to influence by missing information.

In this study, the authors find that the effects of fit disappear when attribute information is added to extension stimuli and are applicable only for later product adopters.

Building on the foundations of the recently developed judgment uncertainty and magnitude parameters (JUMP) model, which statistically and simultaneously separates the drivers of judgment magnitude from those of judgment uncertainty, the authors present a model of the formation of uncertain intentions that decomposes a stated intention into a magnitude and an uncertainty dimension. The authors then develop hypotheses regarding the impact of affective and continuance commitment and critical sales events on intention magnitude and the effect of critical sales events and role stress on intention uncertainty. Subsequently, the authors develop a threshold model of the intention-behavior link that articulates a psychological mechanism within which uncertainty-laden intentions translate into actual behavior. Empirically, results from sales force intention and turnover data provide strong support for the theorizing. In addition to identifying some drivers of intention-to-quit magnitude and uncertainty, the authors identify the crucial role of intention uncertainty in shaping both the probability and timing of subsequent behavior. Consistent with the psychological underpinnings of the threshold model, the authors find that intention uncertainty lowers the probability of intended behavior.

Ethnic self-awareness occurs when a person engages in a process of self-categorization and uses ethnic criteria as the basis for this categorization. The authors hypothesize that ""ethnic primes"" - visual or verbal cues that draw attention to ethnicity - direct self-categorization and increase ethnic self-awareness. To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct two experiments. Using 109 Asian and Caucasian participants, Experiment 1 assessed the impact of exposure to an Asian ethnic prime on ethnic self-awareness and on response to targeted television advertising. Exposure to an ethnic prime increased the rate at which participants spontaneously mentioned their ethnicity in self-descriptions (a measure of ethnic self-awareness) and caused participants to respond more favorably to same-ethnicity spokespeople and advertising that targeted their ethnicity. Experiment 2 tested the theory in a print advertising context and extended the design by manipulating the type of ethnic prime participants saw (Asian or Caucasian) and the market that the focal advertisement targeted (Asian or Caucasian).

The model is called the fuzzy latent class model (FLCM), because it extends Dillon and Mulani's (1984) latent class model by freeing it from the restrictive assumption that all items are crisp for a given categorization. Instead, FLCM allows for items to be either crisp or fuzzy. Crisp items belong exclusively to one category, whereas fuzzy items belong - in varying degree - to multiple categories. This relaxation in the assumption about the nature of qualitative data makes FLCM more widely applicable: Qualitative data in marketing research are often fuzzy, because they involve open-ended descriptions of complex phenomena.

This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier.

On the basis of a study of 141 cross-functional product development teams, the authors find that innovativeness is positively related to the strength of superordinate identity in the team, encouragement to take risk, customers' influence, and active monitoring of the project by senior management. Beyond a moderate level, social cohesion among team members has a negative effect on innovativeness. The effect of superordinate identity on innovativeness is strengthened by encouragement to take risk and weakened by social cohesion. Functional diversity has no effect on innovativeness.

The authors conducted two empirical studies involving a repeated entry-pricing game to test the hypotheses. The results of Study 1 show that the entrant's perceptions of the aggressiveness of the incumbent depend on the focus and strength of the incumbent's signals. The results of Study 2 show that the strength of the entrant's responses to the incumbent's signals depends on the incumbent's use of bluffs and the cost of information about the factors driving the incumbent's signals. The implications of these findings for how firms should signal to achieve such strategic objectives as revealing or concealing information, developing a desired reputation, and influencing competitors' responses over time are discussed.The authors conclude by discussing the limitations of the article and its implications for further research.","",""

They develop a theoretical framework that begins with a consumer's first-ever purchase in a product category and describes subsequent purchases as components of sequential purchasing stages. The theory is based on the notion that choices made by consumers new to a market are driven by two competing forces: consumers' desire to collect information about alternatives and their aversion to trying risky ones. These forces give rise to three stages of purchasing: an information collection stage that focuses initially on low-risk, big brand names; a stage in which information collection continues but is extended to lesser-known brands; and a stage of information consolidation leading to preference for the brands that provide the greatest utility. The authors use a logit-mixture model with time-varying parameters to capture the choice dynamics of different consumer segments. The results show the importance of accounting for product experience and learning when studying the dynamic choice processes of consumers new to a market.

In real-world validation of choice models, true parameter values are unknown, so examination of parameter bias is not possible. In contrast, the main focus of this study is parameter bias in simulated scanner-panel choice data with known parameter values. Study of parameter bias enables the assessment of a fundamental issue not addressed in the choice modeling literature - the extent to which the logit choice model is capable of distinguishing unobserved effects that give rise to persistence in observed choices (e.g., heterogeneity and state dependence). Although econometric theory provides some information about the causes of bias, the extent of such bias in typical scanner data applications remains unclear. The authors present an extensive simulation study that provides information on the extent of bias resulting from the misspecification of four unobserved effects that receive frequent attention in the literature - choice set effects, heterogeneity in preferences and market response, state dependence, and serial correlation. The authors outline implications for model builders and managers. In general, the potential for parameter bias in choice model applications appears to be high.

Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or ""decoupling"" of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.","",""

The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduct on timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and that intentional vaporware can deter entry The authors also show that there is a curvilinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy; that is, firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, whereas firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data.

Focusing on contract-governed versus joint venture-governed relationships, the authors present a theoretical framework that specifies the conditions that make one or the other form of relationship structure more appropriate. This study was designed to address potential limitations regarding measurement, financial consequences, and context in the extant literature. The authors employ measures derived from Standard & Poor's Compustat financial database and an overall measure of firm reputation to examine empirically differences in firm characteristics across the two types of relationships. To examine the financial consequences of relationship structure, the authors use event-study techniques that tie stock price reactions to the governance mechanism choice. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers are more likely to form a joint venture (versus simple contract) when (1) the supplier's degree of asset specificity is high, (2) monitoring the supplier's behavior is difficult, and (3) the supplier has a poorer reputation. The authors find that vertical joint ventures (between buyers and suppliers) are economically similar to contracts, to the extent that abnormal wealth gains go solely to the supplier firms. Horizontal joint ventures (partners are at the same level of the value chain), however, provide bilateral, synergistic wealth gains. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers can use joint ventures to reduce certain governance problems rather than to gain synergies.","",""

(2) Which products should be added to a given assortment to maximize the fraction of customers who can find their most preferred assortment? and (3) For a given assortment, what type of customer is likely to purchase it? The model is applied to assortment choices constructed from a set of eight popular magazines with five measured attributes: business, current events, human interest stories, sports, and technology. The analysis indicates that consumers are heterogeneous: Some customers are price sensitive and unresponsive to the magazine attributes, and others are sensitive to the magazine features but do not necessarily want more of them. In addition, the authors observe that many subjects do not prefer varied assortments; rather, consumers focus on purchasing magazines with high levels of the attribute they want.","",""

Indeed, experimental studies have shown that additional inventory on hand can lead to an endogenous increase in consumption. The authors develop a model of price competition between firms in response to the stockpiling and subsequent consumption dynamics of consumers. In this setting, the flexible consumption effect causes more intense price competition, deeper promotions, and an increase in the frequency of promotions.

Consistency is commonly understood to apply among marketing mix elements, but it also involves a temporal dimension: Marketing messages and, more generally, marketing mix strategies should achieve some degree of consistency over time.

In this specific context, temporal (in)consistency captures the degree of variability of prices, displays, and features, as well as availability over time, for a stockkeeping unit. The authors find that sales promotion mix consistency over time affects both consumer utility mean and scale and thus consumers' choices and brand shares. Lack of sales promotion mix consistency is generally deleterious to consumer brand evaluations through (1) decreases to average valuations and (2) decreases in scale, both of which can lead to decreases in market share.","",""

Instead, asymmetries should be investigated in absolute cross-price effects, that is, change in market share of a competing brand for a unit price change of the focal brand.

The model makes use of the idea that if two markets have the same retailers or are located close to each other, then branded goods in these markets should have similar sales performance (other factors being held constant). In holdout samples, the proposed spatial prediction method improves greatly on naive predictors such as global-market averages, nearest neighbor predictors, or local averages. In addition, the authors show that the spatial model gives more plausible estimates of price elasticities. It does so for two reasons. First, the spatial model helps solve an omitted variables problem by allowing for unobserved factors with a cross-market structure. An example of such unobserved factors is the shelf-space allocations made at the retail-chain level.

In particular, the authors propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity to luxury rewards, because higher efforts reduce the guilt that is often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities. A series of studies with approximately 3100 consumers demonstrated that (1) higher program requirements shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (2) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (3) the effect of program requirements on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure. In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards.

For service organizations, a market orientation is implemented largely through individual service workers. The authors investigate the mediational role of customer orientation in a hierarchical model of the influence of personality traits on self-rated and supervisor-rated performance. The results support a partially mediated hierarchical model. Three basic personality traits (emotional stability, agreeability, and the need for activity) account for 39% of the variance in the customer orientation of employees. In turn, the customer orientation measure and conscientiousness account for 26% of the variance in self-rated performance. The customer orientation measure, along with the direct effects of conscientiousness and agreeability, account for 12% of the variance in manager ratings.

These multiple preferences may be the result of multiple individuals in a household, different uses and usage occasions, and/or variety seeking. As such, single ideal point models that assume a single invariant ideal point may be operating from a false and misleading assumption. We propose a multiple ideal point model to capture these multiple preference effects. The basic premise of the model is that consumers may possess a set of ideal points, each of which represents a distinct preference. At any given purchase occasion, one of these points is ""activated"" with some probability, and choices are made with respect to its characteristics. In this article, the authors assess the multiple ideal point model and an associated estimation procedure with respect to the model's ability to recover a true choice structure. The authors then empirically test the model on Information Resources Inc. panel data from the powdered soft drink category.

Rather than use the self-stated importances as prior information, as has been done in several previous approaches, the authors consider them data and therefore include them in the formulation of the likelihood, which helps investigate the relationship of self-stated and derived importances at the individual level. The authors formulate several special cases of the model and estimate them using the Gibbs sampler. The authors reanalyze Srinivasan and Park's (1997) data and show that the current model predicts real choices better than competing models do. The posterior credible intervals of the predictions of models with the different heterogeneity specifications overlap, so there is no clear superior specification of heterogeneity. However, when different sources of data are used - that is, full profile evaluations, self-stated importances, or both - clear differences arise in the accuracy of predictions. Moreover, the authors find that including the self-stated importances in the likelihood leads to much better predictions than does considering them prior information.","",""

Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element omission may actually lead to an improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.","",""

However, no study has compared the relative effectiveness of FM and HB conjoint analysis models in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. To conduct such a comparison, the authors employ the simulation methodology proposed by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms with some modification.

The authors show that FM and HB models are equally effective in recovering individual-level parameters and predicting ratings of holdout profiles. Two surprising findings are that (1) HB performs well even when partworths come from a mixture of distributions and (2) FM produces good parameter estimates, even at the individual level.

By specifying a demand function at the brand-chain level for each brand in the product category, the author derives pricing rules for the retailer. The author decomposes the retail price of a brand into effects due to wholesale price, markup (obtained from the demand functions), additional promotional payments, retail competition, and the retailer's objectives for the store brand.

The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations.","",""

For example, latent attitudes and perceptions may play as much of a role in shaping choice as the attributes that have been manipulated and used to define the alternative offerings. In this article, the authors present several full information models that can accommodate latent variables such as attitudes and satisfaction within the context of binary and multinomial choice models. The models proposed are particularly useful when the focus is on understanding how softer attributes can influence choice decisions. The authors accomplish this by integrating structural equation models within the basic framework of binary and multinomial choice models. Two empirical applications are provided. In addition to illustrating the proposed models, these applications provide insights into the circumstances under which the simultaneous factor-choice modeling approach makes a difference.","",""

The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge in order to assess the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it ""damages"" the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, judgments are revised in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e.g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e.g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information at the time of the challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information.","",""

In two experiments, the authors demonstrate that the relationship between expertise and adoption is relatively complex. Specifically, their findings indicate that, compared with novices, experts report higher comprehension, more net benefits, and therefore higher preferences for continuous innovations. However, for discontinuous innovations, experts' entrenched knowledge is related to lower comprehension, fewer perceived net benefits, and lower preferences compared with that of novices.

Much of the previous theoretical work in economics suggests that price-matching refunds are associated with higher prices. In contrast, the trade press postulates that price-matching policies are associated with lower prices. Given these inconsistent views regarding price-matching policies, the authors experimentally examine how consumers view and interpret such policies and then develop a model that incorporates these consumer interpretations as well as asymmetries across stores. In the model, the asymmetry across stores is the key to deriving the conditions under which a signaling equilibrium exists in the presence of price-matching policies. The critical point is that the competition-reducing and price discrimination effects, which seem to form the basis of most of the previous theoretical literature, can be counteracted by the presence of differentiated firms and uninformed consumers. The model suggests that under some conditions, price-matching policies can lead to more intense price competition. Furthermore, all firms will not find it profitable to offer refunds, and consistent with consumer expectations, the firms with lower prices will offer refunds.","",""

These phenomena can produce complex nonlinearities and interactions in the deal effect curve that are best captured with a flexible approach. Because a fully nonparametric regression model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose a semiparametric regression model. Store-level sales over time are modeled as a non-parametric function of own- and cross-item price discounts and a parametric function of other predictors. The authors compare the predictive validity of the semiparametric model with that of two parametric bench-mark models and obtain superior performance. The results for three product categories indicate threshold and saturation effects for both own- and cross-item temporary price cuts. The authors also find that the nature of the own-item curve depends on other items' price discounts. Comparisons with restricted model specifications show that both the flexible main effects and flexible interaction effects contribute to the superior results for the semiparametric approach. The interaction effects are so complex that it is unlikely for any parametric model to be satisfactory. In a separate analysis, the authors illustrate how the shape of the deal effect curve depends on own-item promotion signals.

Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks- and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer. Results from three experiments provide support for the idea that product ownership depends more on perception than possession.","",""

Moreover, the authors consider the time-dependent nature of these mechanisms by observing their effects on commitment over the course of a relationship life cycle. The results indicate that (1) a retailer's TSIs have a negative effect on its perceptions of supplier commitment; (2) a supplier's TSIs and relational norms increase the retailer's perception of supplier commitment, whereas explicit contracts are associated with perceptions of lower supplier commitment; and (3) each of the three control mechanisms moderates the negative impact of retailer investments on perceptions of supplier commitment contingent on the relationship phase. Specifically, bilateral TSIs enhance commitment in the exploration phase and a positive effect during the decline phase.

Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality.

The authors conduct an experiment using a multi-item scale that consists of five dimensions and manipulate three such context effects: explicit item labeling, item presentation (alone/grouped), and subscale items presented contiguously or not. In a refined analysis of variance, the authors use a special one-dimensional case of the spatial and attribute-based distance metric proposed by Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (1999) to explain subscale variance, replacing the indicator variable for clustering used in a standard analysis of variance. This metric provides a scalar measure of how much variation exists in the order of presentation of items within a subscale (the subscale distance). This analysis indicates a significant decrease in subscale variance (increased reliability) with decreasing subscale distance but no-longer-significant effects due to labeling and grouping. The authors discuss implications of their findings for researchers conducting surveys in computer-mediated environments.","",""

Companies are increasingly engaging in mass customization and offering consumers a ""choiceboard"" (or a menu of choices) of various features and options for configuring their own products and services. The authors discuss the use of experimental choice menus for assessing customers' preferences and price sensitivities for the variety of features and options that might be offered by a firm in its choiceboard. The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices. Various technical issues and methodological contributions are discussed. The authors illustrate the approach in a commercial application of a customized Web-based information service, which is typical of offerings in the information economy. To assess predictive performance, the authors compare the proposed approach with alternative traditional approaches. The authors conclude with a discussion of the types of insights that can be obtained from this approach to menu choices and the managerial implications of these findings.","",""

Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs, though with intriguing differences, even when only part of the market is aware of firms' differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in the long run, as information spreads and the proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.","",""

The authors call this strategy partitioned pricing. Although firms presumably use partitioned pricing to increase demand and profits, there is little clear empirical support that these prices increase demand or any theoretical explanation for why this should occur. The authors test hypotheses of how consumers process partitioned prices and how partitioned pricing affects consumers’ processing and recall of total costs and their purchase intentions and certain types of demand. The results suggest that partitioned prices decrease consumers’ recalled total costs and increase their demand.

The modeling framework incorporates psychological variables, such as consumer expectations of choice set elements and latent product interest, and the influence of information sources, such as critic reviews and word of mouth, within a discrete choice formulation. Model estimation allows for the relationship between consumer choice and postchoice behavior. The authors develop an estimation procedure that explicitly accounts for measurement errors in the latent psychological variables. In particular, they propose a probit measurement error model that provides consistent parameter estimates. Data for the model estimation are obtained from a laboratory experiment and a field study. The empirical results provide insights into the role of psychological variables (such as consumer expectations and latent product interest) in consumers’ choice decisions for new movies.

This principle, however, is easier to accept than it is to execute, because long-run effects of marketing spending are difficult to estimate. The authors address this problem by examining the behavior of market response and marketing spending over time and identify four common strategic scenarios: business as usual, hysteresis in response, escalation, and evolving business practice. The authors explain and illustrate why each scenario can occur in practice and describe its positive and negative consequences for long-term profitability. The authors propose to use multivariate persistence measures to identify which of the four strategic scenarios is taking place and illustrate this approach in the pharmaceutical and packaged-food industries.

A price promotion is theorized to be informative about brand quality when it stands out because it deviates from either its own past behavior or industry norms. Product category experts, who have alternative sources of information to make quality judgments, are expected to make less use of price promotions as a quality cue than novices are. The authors describe three laboratory studies in the context of a price promotion that is designed to increase trial in a service industry. Results suggest that consistency with past promotional behavior, distinctiveness in terms of how common it is to promote in an industry, and consumer expertise are important variables that moderate when price promotions have an unfavorable effect on brand evaluations.

Using these conditions, the author demonstrates that whereas the linear and all concave consumer demand functions lead to less than 100% optimal retail pass-through, there exists a subset of convex consumer demand functions for which a retailer rationally engages in greater than 100% pass-through.

When relatively equivocal information about two hypothetical brands is acquired one attribute at a time, the evaluation of a subsequent attribute is distorted to support the brand that emerges as the leader. This distortion in favor of the leading brand occurs in the absence of any prior brand preference and even when no choice is required. In the latter case, brand preference is formed spontaneously and privately. The magnitude of this predecisional information distortion is roughly double the well-known postdecisional distortion due to cognitive dissonance. A second study shows that, even when the product information is diagnostic, substantial distortion remains. Furthermore, when the diagnostic information leads to a reversal of the currently preferred brand, distortion reappears in support of the new leading brand. The implications of predecisional distortion of product information are discussed for the presentation order of brands, the presentation format of product attributes, and the potential bias in preference assessment techniques, such as conjoint measurement, that rely on pairwise choices. © 1998 American Marketing Association.","",""

Building on a distinction between goals and resources, the authors propose that (1) in episodes involving a tradeoff between a goal (e.g., pleasure) and a resource (e.g., money), consumers tend to highlight either goal fulfillment or resource conservation by selecting similar attribute levels for items consumed in the same episode (e.g., a tasty, expensive appetizer and a tasty, expensive entree on one occasion and less tasty, less expensive items on another occasion) and (2) if each choice involves a tradeoff between two goals (e.g., pleasure and good health), consumers tend to balance attribute levels (e.g., in each episode have one tasty item and one healthy item).

A Bayesian variance components approach is used to model the covariation of household response parameters across categories. The model enables the authors to identify similarities in households’ state dependence effects across categories. On the basis of purchase data from a panel of 785 households, they also (1) estimate the correlations between household parameters for the marketing mix and state dependence, (2) study whether state dependence effects diminish over time, (3) investigate whether state dependence for a household is related to its demographic and behavioral characteristics, and (4) analyze whether category variables influence state dependence. The results indicate that households display similar state dependence effects across the five categories, with two categories exhibiting significantly lower state dependence levels than the other three.

Understanding how product attributes influence product categorization is important for marketing decisions about product development, brand extension, and product positioning. Existing attribute-level measures of product attitude emphasize evaluation rather than categorization. Measures of category membership either are at the overall product level or emphasize feature-based attributes, whereas product attributes are often continuous in nature. A comprehensive approach for conceptualizing product categorization is provided by fuzzy set theory, with its basic postulate that no clear boundaries exist between members and nonmembers of a fuzzy set. The authors conceptualize product categories as fuzzy sets in which products have degrees of membership along specific attributes, argued to arise as a result of the degree to which a product possesses an attribute. Two fuzzy set-based measures of category membership are developed that assess gradedness of category membership at the attribute level, which is then combined across attributes to reach overall measures of gradedness for a product.

As the Internet is used by more consumers, firms' pricing and communications strategies on the Internet will mirror the strategies they pursue in a conventional channel. Firms can increase their market power by strategically using information on multiple channels to achieve finer consumer segmentation. The author suggests directions the Internet might take and derives managerial implications. The findings generalize to other channels that enable firms to segment consumers and inform them at low cost.","",""
"Buyer-seller relationships in business markets","1999","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033236256&doi=10.2307%2f3151999&partnerID=40&md5=a96dfe2e9c86633d72e56b62205000b8","During the past decade, marketing managers and scholars have focused increased attention on buyer-seller relationships in business markets. This article contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in this important arena. Building from theories of relationships and empirical research across several disciplines, the authors specify six key underlying dimensions (connectors) that characterize the manner in which buyers and sellers relate and conduct relationships. Measures for these relationship connectors (information exchange, operational linkages, legal bonds, cooperation, and relationship-specific adaptations by buyers and sellers) are developed in a series of pretests. Then, on the basis of relationship profiles for more than 400 buyer-seller relationships sampled from a wide array of industries and market situations, the authors apply numerical taxonomy to develop an empirically based classification of different types of business relationships. Contrary to approaches used in much of the extant literature, taxonomic methods do not rely on an assumption that the connectors are highly intercorrelated or that they combine in some linear fashion to form a single underlying dimension. Furthermore, the research specifies antecedent market and purchase situations and shows that they affect when specific types of relationships are used. The research also shows how customer satisfaction and evaluations of supplier performance vary across different types of relationships. The results provide new insights about the nature of relationships in business markets.","",""

The authors examine brand choice behavior across five product categories as a function of these variables. Choice within a category is modeled with a multinomial probit model. A Bayesian variance components approach is used to model the covariation of household response parameters across categories. The model enables the authors to identify similarities in households' state dependence effects across categories. On the basis of purchase data from a panel of 785 households, they also (1) estimate the correlations between household parameters for the marketing mix and state dependence, (2) study whether state dependence effects diminish over time, (3) investigate whether state dependence for a household is related to its demographic and behavioral characteristics, and (4) analyze whether category variables influence state dependence. The results indicate that households display similar state dependence effects across the five categories, with two categories exhibiting significantly lower state dependence levels than the other three. Furthermore, significant correlations exist between state dependence effects and marketing mix sensitivities. A household's level of brand choice inertia diminishes with time elapsed since the previous purchase. State dependence is influenced by shopping behavior variables but not by demographics.","",""

Specifically, the author shows conditions on the curvature of consumer demand functions that make it optimal for a profit-maximizing retailer to pass through greater (less) than 100% of the trade deal amount it gets from a manufacturer. Using these conditions, the author demonstrates that whereas the linear and all concave consumer demand functions lead to less than 100% optimal retail passthrough, there exists a subset of convex consumer demand functions for which a retailer rationally engages in greater than 100% pass-through. This subset contains many commonly used demand functions, such as the constant elasticity demand function, the negative exponential demand function, and many other varying elasticity demand functions.","",""

To explain their result, Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpandé (1992) suggest that, as a relationship becomes more longterm, it becomes prone to negative influences that dampen the positive impact of relational factors.

This principle, however, is easier to accept than it is to execute, because long-run effects of marketing spending are difficult to estimate. The authors address this problem by examining the behavior of market response and marketing spending over time and identify four common strategic scenarios: business as usual, hysteresis in response, escalation, and evolving business practice. The authors explain and illustrate why each scenario can occur in practice and describe its positive and negative consequences for long-term profitability. The authors propose to use multivariate persistence measures to identify which of the four strategic scenarios is taking place and illustrate this approach in the pharmaceutical and packaged-food industries. The results substantiate the authors' proposition that the strategic scenario is a major determinant of marketing effectiveness and long-term profitability.

The authors develop a dynamic brand sales model in which brand growth and market response parameters vary by stage of life cycle entry, namely, by pioneers, growth-stage entrants, and mature-stage entrants. The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets. The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage. Growth-stage entrants reach their asymptotic sales level faster than pioneers or mature-stage entrants, are not hurt by competitor diffusion, and enjoy a higher response to perceived product quality than pioneers and mature-stage entrants. Pioneers reach their asymptotic sales levels more slowly than later entrants, and pioneer's sales, unlike later entrants’ sales, are hurt by competitor diffusion over time. On the positive side for pioneers, buyers are most responsive to marketing spending by pioneers. Mature-stage entrants are most disadvantaged; they grow more slowly than growth-stage entrants, have lower response to product quality than growth-stage entrants, and have the lowest response to marketing spending. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

The authors distinguish between potential and realized competition and, focusing on interinnovation duration as the dependent variable, develop hypotheses to capture the effects of competition, feedback from the marketplace, and product characteristics on innovation dynamics. Weekly diffusion and innovation data for 11 computer software products available on the Internet, involving more than 100 new versions in the period 1991 to 1994, are used to test the hypotheses. Model comparison tests provide strong support for the hybrid model over models based on restricted conceptualizations. Domestic inertia considerations explain 45% of the variance in interinnovation duration, and market motives and distinctive capabilities explain 33% and 22%, respectively. The authors support the expectation of a U-shaped effect of potential competition and find that realized competition increases interinnovation duration. Products that are more customer-driven witness faster innovation, and the diffusion rate of a current innovation plays a significant role in future innovative activities: It moderates the effect of potential competition and interacts with product bundling to delay innovation. Furthermore, the authors find that product bundling per se does not influence innovation activities and that, when a product is enjoying a high rate of diffusion, competition does not hasten the arrival of innovations. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

The former option-framing method presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The latter presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Combined, the studies support the managerial attractiveness of the subtractive versus the additive option-framing method. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. This effect holds across different option price levels (Study 1) and product categories of varying price (Study 2). Moreover, this effect is magnified when subjects are asked to anticipate regret from their option choice decisions (Study 2). However, option framing has a different effect on the purchase likelihood of the product category itself, depending on the subject's initial interest in buying within the category. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low (Study 3).

For that purpose, a model is developed that identifies relations between the consumer and the product at the segment level, which increases the action-ability and responsiveness of the segments. The model accounts for different response tendencies, across and within countries, that commonly hamper identification of cross-national segments. A Monte Carlo study shows that the model performs well in recovering the parameters across a wide range of conditions.

With an empirical study, the authors compare 1411 choices subjects made regarding a business to patronize using paper and electronic telephone directories. The choices were contingent on information search costs imposed by the different media. By providing a theoretical basis for predicting differences in information search costs, the authors help designers create more effective Web sites for achieving their marketing objectives.","",""

Although practitioners have assumed that event sponsors are identified primarily through pure recollection, the authors show that sponsor identification involves a substantial degree of construction. Results from three experiments indicate that sponsor identification is biased toward brands that are prominent in the marketplace and semantically related to the event. These biases appear to emanate from constructive processes whereby, during identification, respondents use the prominence and relatedness of available brands as heuristics to verify their recollection of event-sponsor associations. The effects of relatedness on sponsor identification seem stronger and more robust than those of prominence, which appears to be invoked only for large events. Both effects are robust across methods of identification assessment though less pronounced when the accuracy threshold is high.","",""

This article contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in this important arena. Building from theories of relationships and empirical research across several disciplines, the authors specify six key underlying dimensions (connectors) that characterize the manner in which buyers and sellers relate and conduct relationships. Measures for these relationship connectors (information exchange, operational linkages, legal bonds, cooperation, and relationship-specific adaptations by buyers and sellers) are developed in a series of pretests. Then, on the basis of relationship profiles for more than 400 buyer–seller relationships sampled from a wide array of industries and market situations, the authors apply numerical taxonomy to develop an empirically based classification of different types of business relationships. Contrary to approaches used in much of the extant literature, taxonomic methods do not rely on an assumption that the connectors are highly intercorrelated or that they combine in some linear fashion to form a single underlying dimension. Furthermore, the research specifies antecedent market and purchase situations and shows that they affect when specific types of relationships are used. The research also shows how customer satisfaction and evaluations of supplier performance vary across different types of relationships. The results provide new insights about the nature of relationships in business markets. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

A price promotion is theorized to be informative about brand quality when it stands out because it deviates from either its own past behavior or industry norms. Product category experts, who have alternative sources of information to make quality judgments, are expected to make less use of price promotions as a quality cue than novices are. The authors describe three laboratory studies in the context of a price promotion that is designed to increase trial in a service industry. Results suggest that consistency with past promotional behavior, distinctiveness in terms of how common it is to promote in an industry, and consumer expertise are important variables that moderate when price promotions have an unfavorable effect on brand evaluations. The authors highlight implications for service providers that are offering promotions to attract new customers in industries in which promotions are uncommon and discuss the theoretical implications of the finding that expertise moderates the effects of dislinctiveness and consistency on evaluations in the context of price promotions.","",""

Prior to the research presented here, the only established causal antecedent of perceived price unfairness was increased relative profit. In Study 1, the author extends the existing research by demonstrating that the inferred motive, as well as inferred relative profit, provides causal explanation of perceived price unfairness. When participants inferred that the firm had a negative motive for a price increase, the increase was perceived as significantly less fair than the same increase when participants inferred that the firm had a positive motive. In addition, the author shows in Study 2 that the firm's reputation can influence the inferred motive, thereby altering perceptions of price unfairness. Specifically, participants sometimes gave a firm with a good reputation the benefit of the doubt when inferring motive. If the “good” firm did not profit from the price increase, participants inferred significantly more positive motives than if it did profit. The firm with a poor reputation did not receive this benefit; inferred motive was equally negative regardless of whether the firm profited from the price increase. Together, these studies provide evidence that consumer inferences of the motive for a price increase influence the perceived fairness of the increase. Furthermore, reputation is shown to moderate the effect of inferred relative profit on inferred motive. Finally, analyses show that perceived unfairness leads to lower shopping intentions and demonstrate that perceived unfairness mediates the effects of inferred motive and relative price on consumers’ shopping intentions. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

They focus on how designers’ use of a specific cognitive process, visual mental imagery, can influence the customer appeal of a design. The authors present a conceptual framework for examining how visual imagery might influence the customer appeal of a design output. This is followed by two experiments that test the hypotheses that flow from the proposed model. The experiments manipulate the type of visual imagery used and the incorporation of the customer in the imagery invoked and then examine its effects on the usefulness, originality, and customer appeal of the resulting design. Consistent with the framework and the proposed hypotheses, the findings show that including the customer in imagination visual imagery during the design process has a greater effect on the usefulness of the design produced than including the customer in memory visual imagery. The results also show that imagery based on imagination results in more original designs than imagery based on memory. Most important, the use of bounded imagination, which results from the incorporation of the visual images of the customer in imagination imagery, leads to the creation of designs that are more appealing to the customer. The findings are integrated into a discussion that clarifies the role of visual imagery in design and underscores the potential of this cognitive tool in the new product design process. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

The authors employ a differential shrinkage approach in which price elasticities are held closely to the restrictions of the additive utility theory and store-to-store variation is accommodated through differences in expenditure elasticities.

In a market in which a segment of consumers is sensitive to product quality and consumers' brand choice in low-involvement packaged goods categories is characterized by inertia, the authors show that quality store brands can be an instrument for retailers to generate store differentiation, store loyalty, and store profitability, even when the store brand does not have a margin advantage over the national brand. In addition, this loyalty argument does not apply for the ""cheap and nasty"" private label strategy. Such a private label policy, on the contrary, reinforces rather than reduces price competition among stores. Indeed, the quality of the store brand must be above a threshold level to create this opportunity. It also follows that quality store brands, when carried by competing retailers, can be an implicit coordination mechanism that enables all the retailers to become more profitable. Finally, a quality store brand policy is profitable only if a significant portion of shoppers buys the national brand. This surprising result establishes the complementary roles of store brands and national brands. The former create store differentiation and loyalty, whereas the latter enable the retailer to raise prices and increase store profitability. The authors provide empirical support for their thesis by using evidence from Europe and house-hold-level scanner panel data from the United States and Canada.","",""

The authors develop a dynamic brand sales model in which brand growth and market response parameters vary by stage of life cycle entry, namely, by pioneers, growth-stage entrants, and mature-stage entrants. The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets. The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage. Growth-stage entrants reach their asymptotic sales level faster than pioneers or mature-stage entrants, are not hurt by competitor diffusion, and enjoy a higher response to perceived product quality than pioneers and mature-stage entrants. Pioneers reach their asymptotic sales levels more slowly than later entrants, and pioneer's sales, unlike later entrants' sales, are hurt by competitor diffusion over time. On the positive side for pioneers, buyers are most responsive to marketing spending by pioneers. Mature-stage entrants are most disadvantaged; they grow more slowly than growth-stage entrants, have lower response to product quality than growth-stage entrants, and have the lowest response to marketing spending.","",""

Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects’ relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns.

The results of the empirical analysis show that new product introduction strategy is influenced significantly by incumbent reaction strategy, and vice versa. The relationship of a new product's marketing spending to the anticipated incumbent reaction is different for incumbents of different sizes. The analysis shows that higher spending by a new brand results in incumbent response that is significantly lower in magnitude. The results also show that multimarket contact leads to both lower introduction spending and milder incumbent response. The author discusses the managerial implications of these results.","",""

The first demonstrates that (1) exposure to brand extensions facilitates the speed with which subjects can categorize parent brands correctly, (2) this result is moderated by parent brand dominance such that nondominant brands benefit more from such exposure, and (3) extension fit moderates this effect for nondominant but not for dominant parent brands. The second study demonstrates that (1) longitudinal exposure to brand extension advertising facilitates parent brand recall but that (2) both recall and recognition are facilitated to a lesser degree than that resulting from exposure to parent brand advertising. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

Prior to the research presented here, the only established causal antecedent of perceived price unfairness was increased relative profit. In Study 1, the author extends the existing research by demonstrating that the inferred motive, as well as inferred relative profit, provides causal explanation of perceived price unfairness. When participants inferred that the firm had a negative motive for a price increase, the increase was perceived as significantly less fair than the same increase when participants inferred that the firm had a positive motive. In addition, the author shows in Study 2 that the firm's reputation can influence the inferred motive, thereby altering perceptions of price unfairness. Specifically, participants sometimes gave a firm with a good reputation the benefit of the doubt when inferring motive. If the ""good"" firm did not profit from the price increase, participants inferred significantly more positive motives than if it did profit. The firm with a poor reputation did not receive this benefit; inferred motive was equally negative regardless of whether the firm profited from the price increase. Together, these studies provide evidence that consumer inferences of the motive for a price increase influence the perceived fairness of the increase. Furthermore, reputation is shown to moderate the effect of inferred relative profit on inferred motive. Finally, analyses show that perceived unfairness leads to lower shopping intentions and demonstrate that perceived unfairness mediates the effects of inferred motive and relative price on consumers' shopping intentions.","",""

They focus on how designers' use of a specific cognitive process, visual mental imagery, can influence the customer appeal of a design. The authors present a conceptual framework for examining how visual imagery might influence the customer appeal of a design output. This is followed by two experiments that test the hypotheses that flow from the proposed model. The experiments manipulate the type of visual imagery used and the incorporation of the customer in the imagery invoked and then examine its effects on the usefulness, originality, and customer appeal of the resulting design. Consistent with the framework and the proposed hypotheses, the findings show that including the customer in imagination visual imagery during the design process has a greater effect on the usefulness of the design produced than including the customer in memory visual imagery. The results also show that imagery based on imagination results in more original designs than imagery based on memory. Most important, the use of bounded imagination, which results from the incorporation of the visual images of the customer in imagination imagery, leads to the creation of designs that are more appealing to the customer. The findings are integrated into a discussion that clarifies the role of visual imagery in design and underscores the potential of this cognitive tool in the new product design process.","",""

Understanding how product attributes influence product categorization is important for marketing decisions about product development, brand extension, and product positioning. Existing attribute-level measures of product attitude emphasize evaluation rather than categorization. Measures of category membership either are at the overall product level or emphasize feature-based attributes, whereas product attributes are often continuous in nature. A comprehensive approach for conceptualizing product categorization is provided by fuzzy set theory, with its basic postulate that no clear boundaries exist between members and non-members of a fuzzy set. The authors conceptualize product categories as fuzzy sets in which products have degrees of membership along specific attributes, argued to arise as a result of the degree to which a product possesses an attribute. Two fuzzy set-based measures of category membership are developed that assess gradedness of category membership at the attribute level, which is then combined across attributes to reach overall measures of gradedness for a product. The results of a study demonstrate the validity of these measures and illustrate important attribute-level analyses that are not possible with existing approaches.","",""

Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects' relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992).","",""

The authors distinguish between potential and realized competition and, focusing on interinnovation duration as the dependent variable, develop hypotheses to capture the effects of competition, feedback from the marketplace, and product characteristics on innovation dynamics. Weekly diffusion and innovation data for 11 computer software products available on the Internet, involving more than 100 new versions in the period 1991 to 1994, are used to test the hypotheses. Model comparison tests provide strong support for the hybrid model over models based on restricted conceptualizations. Domestic inertia considerations explain 45% of the variance in interinnovation duration, and market motives and distinctive capabilities explain 33% and 22%, respectively. The authors support the expectation of a U-shaped effect of potential competition and find that realized competition increases interinnovation duration. Products that are more customer-driven witness faster innovation, and the diffusion rate of a current innovation plays a significant role in future innovative activities: It moderates the effect of potential competition and interacts with product bundling to delay innovation. Furthermore, the authors find that product bundling per se does not influence innovation activities and that, when a product is enjoying a high rate of diffusion, competition does not hasten the arrival of innovations.","",""

The authors quantify the (heretofore anecdotal) relationship between customer satisfaction and subsequent service usage and provide new theoretical insights into the antecedents of customer satisfaction by introducing the concept of perceived payment equity. The primary contribution of the article is an understanding of how service usage changes over time, and particularly, how the consumer's view of the fairness or “equity” of the exchange over time affects the consumer's usage of services. Specifically, payment equity represents the customer's changing evaluation of the fairness of the level of economic benefits derived from usage in relation to the level of economic costs, that is, the customer's evaluation of the fairness of the exchange. By examining the antecedents of payment equity, it can be determined how customers use price and usage over time to update their evaluations of the fairness of the exchange. This evaluation affects overall satisfaction, which in turn affects future usage.

The results suggest that customers' usage levels can be managed through pricing strategies, communications, and more generally dynamic customer satisfaction management.","",""

Although practitioners have assumed that event sponsors are identified primarily through pure recollection, the authors show that sponsor identification involves a substantial degree of construction. Results from three experiments indicate that sponsor identification is biased toward brands that are prominent in the marketplace and semantically related to the event. These biases appear to emanate from constructive processes whereby, during identification, respondents use the prominence and relatedness of available brands as heuristics to verify their recollection of event-sponsor associations. The effects of relatedness on sponsor identification seem stronger and more robust than those of prominence, which appears to be invoked only for large events. Both effects are robust across methods of identification assessment though less pronounced when the accuracy threshold is high. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

The research employs a mixed-design experiment, conducted using a survey method, in which customers evaluate various failure/recovery scenarios and complete a questionnaire with respect to an organization they recently had patronized. The authors execute the research in the context of two different service settings, restaurants and hotels. The results show that customers prefer to receive recovery resources that “match” the type of failure they experience in “amounts” that are commensurate with the magnitude of the failure that occurs. The findings contribute to the understanding of theoretical principles that explain customer evaluations of service failure/recovery encounters and provide managers with useful guidelines for establishing the proper “fit” between a service failure and the recovery effort. © 1999 American Marketing Association.","",""

The results of Study 1 indicate that consumers’ global assessments of extended affective episodes elicited by advertisements are dominated by the peak emotional experience and the final moment of the series and also are correlated with the pace at which momentary affective reactions improve over time. Ad duration is related only weakly to overall ad judgments, though longer advertisements have an advantage as long as they build toward a peak emotional experience. In Study 2, the authors replicate these findings under more realistic viewing conditions and demonstrate that the results cannot be attributed solely to memory artifacts that are based on recency. Study 3 implicates adaptation as a possible explanation for the preference for delayed peaks and high ends and further explains the weak effects of ad duration by showing experimentally that longer advertisements can both enhance and depress ad judgments depending on how duration affects the peak emotional experience and the final moment. © 1997 American Marketing Association.","",""

Because spatial and tree representations in general possess different distance patterns, diagnostic measures calculated from the input data of dissimilarities or similarities should be able to indicate how appropriate a certain type of representation might be for a given set of input data. In this article, the author draws from previous literature on the characteristics of diagnostic measures and representation models to develop some partial hypotheses about how well the measures might indicate the appropriateness (in terms of fit) of different models. Empirical analysis indicates that the skewness diagnostic is clearly the best predictor of the appropriateness of representation models; this finding is consistent across a variety of comparable spatial and tree models. Centrality and the reciprocity-related measure, in conjunction with skewness, are useful for specific types of space–tree pairs. The author uses the U-Method (closely related to jackknifing) of prediction, in conjunction with discriminant analysis models, to show that the diagnostics can predict the relative appropriateness of spaces versus trees with accuracy levels substantially greater than what would be expected by chance. © 1998 American Marketing Association.","",""

The results show that when consumers screen brands using an elimination-by-aspects strategy, logit forecasts choices reasonably well, but the parameter estimates are severely biased. However, when consumers screen through brands previously purchased, augmented by brands promoted, logit both forecasts poorly and produces biased parameter estimates, even when dedicated screening variables are included in the logit utility function.

The mechanisms through which innovative late movers outsell pioneers are unclear. To identify these mechanisms, the authors develop a brand-level model in which brand sales are decomposed into trials and repeat purchases. The model captures diffusion and marketing mix effects on brand trials and includes the differential impacts of innovative and noninnovative competitors' diffusion on these effects. The authors develop hypotheses on how the diffusion and marketing mix parameters of the brands differ by market entry strategy (pioneering, innovative late entry, and noninnovative late entry). The authors test these hypotheses using data from 13 brands in two pharmaceutical product categories. The results show that an innovative late mover can create a sustainable advantage by enjoying a higher market potential and a higher repeat purchase rate than either the pioneer or noninnovative late movers, growing faster than the pioneer, slowing the pioneer's diffusion, and reducing the pioneer's marketing spending effectiveness. Innovative late movers are advantaged asymmetrically in that their diffusion can hurt the sales of other brands, but their sales are not affected by competitors' diffusion.

Multiple factors such as price points, odd pricing, and just-noticeable differences often cause steps and spikes in response. The result is market response functions that are frequently nonmonotonic. However, existing regression-based approaches employ functions that are inherently monotonic, which thereby limits representation of important irregularities. In this article, the authors use a stochastic spline regression approach in the framework of a hierarchical Bayes model that permits the estimation of irregular pricing effects and apply the approach to data sets from several product categories. A simulation study indicates that the stochastic spline approach is flexible enough to accommodate irregular response functions. The empirical results show that there are irregularities in own-price response for most of the brands examined and that there are important profit implications of these irregular response functions in pricing decisions.

Exposures of each household within each daypart during each week follow a Poisson process with a distinct rate, which is inferred from the household's past exposure history after accounting for the advertising intensity. Because exposure pattern is computed at the household-level, the model accounts for audience accumulation of dayparts combination, which has a considerable managerial importance in media planning. The model is shown to fit the observed exposure pattern well at both disaggregate and aggregate levels.

Twins usually are made in the same plant and have essentially the same physical attributes but different brand names. If the models of a twin pair are perceived as perfect substitutes, their relative price should equal unity. Brand names could cause the demand for twin models to differ if consumers use the brand names to make inferences about unobservable quality. Consumers also might prefer one brand to another for prestige or status. The relative prices of most of the twin pairs in the sample differ from unity, which implies that consumers do not perceive the twin models to be perfect substitutes. Parent-brand quality and other brand factors are related to the relative prices of the twin pairs. The results suggest that consumers rely on information about the parent brand to make inferences about individual products that carry the parent name.

To explain this counter-intuitive finding, the authors propose a conceptual framework that focuses on initial problem structure as a key moderator of the effect of expertise on performance. Specifically, they argue that the expert–novice performance differential should be greatest at moderate levels of problem structure and weakest at both extremes. To examine this central hypothesis, the authors conduct a controlled experiment that compares experts with novices when solving a complex problem that had characteristics of a moderately ill-structured problem. Relative to novices, the authors find that experts select fewer, but more diagnostic, information inputs and are more consistent when evaluating nonquantified inputs. As a result, they make more accurate and tightly clustered judgments than do novices, and also are more confident in their decisions.

Interdependence in purchase timing between the two categories is modeled using a bivariate hazard function approach that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. The authors provide empirical results from five durable and nondurable goods product category pairs - pasta and pasta sauce, liquid and powder detergents, clothes washers and dryers, soup and yogurt, and room air conditioners and dishwashers. The latter two categories are included in the analysis to ensure that the model can distinguish between true and spurious dependence caused by categories being purchased together. The authors find that the estimated cross-category correlation parameter obtained from the bivariate hazard model is consistent with prior expectations in each of the product categories. As in the literature on univariate hazard models, the authors find the bivariate hazard functions to be non-monotonic in nature. Using the proposed model, the impact of price reductions in one category on the purchase probabilities in both categories is examined using the pasta/pasta sauce product pair. Given the positive relationship in the purchasing in these two categories, the authors find that a price cut in one category increases the purchase probabilities of both pasta and pasta sauce.","",""

Punitive actions are affected by interdependence, but a more complete picture is achieved by also examining punitive capability. The authors test hypotheses based on bilateral deterrence, conflict spiral, and relative power theories, but none of these comprehensively explains the effects of both total power and power asymmetry. Dealer punitive actions are inhibited as total interdependence increases, but are promoted as total punitive capability increases. Using spline regression, the authors find that interdependence asymmetry has no direct effect on punitive actions, whereas punitive capability asymmetry does. As dealers' punitive capability advantage as compared with their suppliers' increases, dealers make greater use of punitive actions, whereas they use fewer punitive actions as their punitive capability deficit increases. The authors also find that dealers with a relative advantage in dependence or punitive capability are more likely to reciprocate their supplier's punitive actions.","",""

In two studies, the authors examine how consumers form assortment perceptions in the face of SKU reduction with a particular emphasis on two heuristic cues: the availability of a favorite product and the amount of shelf space devoted to the category. Results indicate that retailers might be able to make substantive reductions in the number of items carried without negatively affecting assortment perceptions and store choice, as long as only low-preference items are eliminated and category space is held constant. Thus, the potential risk inherent in item reduction might be more limited than initially thought.

Twins usually are made in the same plant and have essentially the same physical attributes but different brand names. If the models of a twin pair are perceived as perfect substitutes, their relative price should equal unity. Brand names could cause the demand for twin models to differ if consumers use the brand names to make inferences about unobservable quality. Consumers also might prefer one brand to another for prestige or status. The relative prices of most of the twin pairs in the sample differ from unity, which implies that consumers do not perceive the twin models to be perfect substitutes. Parent-brand quality and other brand factors are related to the relative prices of the twin pairs. The results suggest that consumers rely on information about the parent brand to make inferences about individual products that carry the parent name.

The authors propose a model of coupon redemption that extends previous models of coupon usage by considering the joint effects of coupon attractiveness and coupon proneness on redemption, and does not require explicit measurement of these variables. Empirical application of the model shows that it correctly predicts redemption intentions for nearly 90% of consumers in a holdout sample and substantially outperforms a logit model that includes traditional measures of coupon proneness, coupon characteristics, and demographics.

Each studio wants to capture as much of the season as possible by opening early in the season. At the same time, each wants to avoid head-to-head competition. The authors model competition between two motion pictures in a share attraction framework and conduct an equilibrium analysis of the product introduction timing game in a finite season. The following three different equilibrium configurations emerge: (1) a single equilibrium with both movies opening simultaneously at the beginning of the season, (2) a single equilibrium with one movie opening at the beginning of the season and one delaying, and (3) dual equilibria, with either movie delaying opening. A key factor is the product life cycle, which can be captured well with a two-parameter exponential decline. The authors relate the life-cycle parameters to these possibilities with the general result that the weaker movie may be forced to delay opening. These results are related to case studies of the opening of recently released movies.

The authors estimate the model on the basis of more than eight years of panel data for a frequently purchased, nonfood, consumer packaged-goods product. The results suggest that consumers' stockpiling behavior has changed over the years. The increased long-term exposure of households to promotions has reduced their likelihood of making category purchases on subsequent shopping trips.

Two field experiments and two lab studies show that anchor-based promotions - presented as multiple-unit prices, purchase quantity limits, and suggestive selling - can increase purchase quantities.

The authors illustrate the approach in a case study that investigates the tendency of Dutch shoppers to combine grocery, drugstore, and clothing purchases across multiple shopping destinations.

Multiple factors such as price points, odd pricing, and just-noticeable differences often cause steps and spikes in response. The result is market response functions that are frequently nonmonotonic. However, existing regression-based approaches employ functions that are inherently monotonic, which thereby limits representation of important irregularities. In this article, the authors use a stochastic spline regression approach in the framework of a hierarchical Bayes model that permits the estimation of irregular pricing effects and apply the approach to data sets from several product categories. A simulation study indicates that the stochastic spline approach is flexible enough to accommodate irregular response functions. The empirical results show that there are irregularities in own-price response for most of the brands examined and that there are important profit implications of these irregular response functions in pricing decisions. The authors find that the irregularities in the response functions include sales increases associated with odd prices in the range of 12% to 76%, flatness at the extremes of the range of observed prices, and kinks in the response function that are consistent with segmentation effects.","",""

The primary objectives of PTM modeling are to forecast the market share/sales volume of a new product and to determine the sources of new product share at the aggregate market level. The authors describe a new approach that is designed to provide a parsimonious description of competitive changes before and after a new product is introduced by identifying latent segments (i.e., groups of consumers) that vary in size and composition with respect to the relative preferences for a set of brands before and after a new product is introduced. Each latent segment represents a particular preference state characterized by a set of segment-level choice probabilities. The modeling framework is based on a class of dynamic latent class models that explicitly recognize two major types of preference heterogeneity: (1) heterogeneity caused by before-after changes in latent preferences for the brands (i.e., time-varying relative choice probabilities) and/or (2) heterogeneity caused by consumers changing their latent preference segment in response to a new product (i.e., time varying latent segment probabilities).

In these markets, consumers’ expectations about the future installed base and the resultant externality benefits play a critical role in their product adoption decisions. The authors investigate the strategic implications of consumer uncertainty regarding network externality and show that a firm can credibly convey private information about future installed base through its new product introduction strategy. The authors initially consider a market in which consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of quality. They show that under complete information the optimal strategy entails provision of full (efficient) quality in the first period itself, providing any upgrade in the second period is suboptimal. However, under asymmetric information about externality, a high-externality firm provides less than full quality initially and then makes up for the quality differential through provision of an upgrade in the second period. Thus, underprovision of introductory quality (i.e., withholding quality) serves as a signal of high externality, and upgrades serve as the mechanism for implementation of the signaling strategy. The authors demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in quality valuation. The additional insight here is that signaling entails sequential targeting of segments in addition to sequential provision of quality. © 1997 American Marketing Association.","",""

These vivid methods have high face validity and are attractive to top management, but they have only begun to be tested for validity. The authors evaluate one virtual representation called information acceleration (IA) that has been applied eight times to consumer and business-to-business products. They report on three tests of validity—two internal and one external. The first internal test compares the ability of IA to represent a physical automobile showroom and salesperson. The second internal test compares the ability of IA to represent the interpersonal interaction of a medical technician with a physician when evaluating a new medical instrument. The external test compares forecasts, made in 1992 for a camera launched in 1993, with actual sales for 1993 and 1994. The authors also compare actual sales to forecasts modified for the actual marketing plan and for an unforeseen negative Consumer Reports article.

Each studio wants to capture as much of the season as possible by opening early in the season. At the same time, each wants to avoid head-to-head competition. The authors model competition between two motion pictures in a share attraction framework and conduct an equilibrium analysis of the product introduction timing game in a finite season. The following three different equilibrium configurations emerge: (1) a single equilibrium with both movies opening simultaneously at the beginning of the season, (2) a single equilibrium with one movie opening at the beginning of the season and one delaying, and (3) dual equilibria, with either movie delaying opening. A key factor is the product life cycle, which can be captured well with a two-parameter exponential decline. The authors relate the life-cycle parameters to these possibilities with the general result that the weaker movie may be forced to delay opening. These results are related to case studies of the opening of recently released movies. A statistical analysis of the 1990 summer season in North America provides support for the conclusions and suggests that current release timing decisions can be improved.

The authors focus on the sources and types of information used in the selection of an artistic event and discuss the impact of critics' reviews on the length of a show's run and attendance. In addition, the authors empirically determine the influence of other variables, such as previews, newspaper advertising, ticket prices, show type, talent characteristics, and timing of opening. The results indicate that New York newspaper theater critics have a significant impact on the success of Broadway shows. It is also found that the newspaper critics have a differential impact, with the critic from the New York Times yielding nearly twice as much influence as critics from the Daily News or the New York Post. Theater critics, it appears, are not only predictors but influencers as well. Among the various show types, musicals appear to fare better than other categories of shows. Previews have a significant impact on the attendance, but not on the longevity, of Broadway shows. Advertising also has a significant impact on both longevity and attendance. However, the characteristics of the key talent do not have a consistently significant influence on show success. In addition, ticket prices do not have a significant relationship with either longevity or attendance.

The results show that when consumers screen brands using an elimination-by-aspects strategy, logit forecasts choices reasonably well, but the parameter estimates are severely biased. However, when consumers screen through brands previously purchased, augmented by brands promoted, logit both forecasts poorly and produces biased parameter estimates, even when dedicated screening variables are included in the logit utility function.

The authors estimate the model on the basis of more than eight years of panel data for a frequently purchased, nonfood, consumer packaged-goods product. The results suggest that consumers’ stockpiling behavior has changed over the years. The increased long-term exposure of households to promotions has reduced their likelihood of making category purchases on subsequent shopping trips.

In this article, the author draws from previous literature on the characteristics of diagnostic measures and representation models to develop some partial hypotheses about how well the measures might indicate the appropriateness (in terms of fit) of different models. Empirical analysis indicates that the skewness diagnostic is clearly the best predictor of the appropriateness of representation models; this finding is consistent across a variety of comparable spatial and tree models. Centrality and the reciprocity-related measure, in conjunction with skewness, are useful for specific types of space-tree pairs.

In the latter case, brand preference is formed spontaneously and privately. The magnitude of this predecisional information distortion is roughly double the well-known postdecisional distortion due to cognitive dissonance. A second study shows that, even when the product information is diagnostic, substantial distortion remains. Furthermore, when the diagnostic information leads to a reversal of the currently preferred brand, distortion reappears in support of the new leading brand. The implications of predecisional distortion of product information are discussed for the presentation order of brands, the presentation format of product attributes, and the potential bias in preference assessment techniques, such as conjoint measurement, that rely on pairwise choices.","",""

Two field experiments and two lab studies show that anchor-based promotions—presented as multiple-unit prices, purchase quantity limits, and suggestive selling—can increase purchase quantities. The final study shows that consumers who retrieve internal anchors can counter these anchor-based promotions effectively.

Second, the author identifies the functional forms of the short- and long-term effects of advertising in the discrete Markov process and shows that pulsing can be optimal if the transition probabilities are concave in advertising. As an alternative to a pure Markov carryover (if any), the author considers that carryover effects of advertising also might be caused by accumulation of memory for the advertisement.

Interdependence in purchase timing between the two categories is modeled using a bivariate hazard function approach that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. The authors provide empirical results from five durable and nondurable goods product category pairs—pasta and pasta sauce, liquid and powder detergents, clothes washers and dryers, soup and yogurt, and room air conditioners and dishwashers. The latter two categories are included in the analysis to ensure that the model can distinguish between true and spurious dependence caused by categories being purchased together. The authors find that the estimated cross-category correlation parameter obtained from the bivariate hazard model is consistent with prior expectations in each of the product categories. As in the literature on univariate hazard models, the authors find the bivariate hazard functions to be nonmonotonic in nature. Using the proposed model, the impact of price reductions in one category on the purchase probabilities in both categories is examined using the pasta/pasta sauce product pair.

In high-motivation conditions, incongruent extensions are scrutinized in detail and lead to the modification of family brand evaluations, regardless of the typicality of the extensions. However, in low-motivation conditions, brand evaluations are more extreme in the context of high (versus low) typicality. The less typical extension is considered an exception, which reduces its impact on evaluations.

However, prior research has provided limited empirical evidence regarding the conditions under which (1) information confers such benefits on the market, (2) firms make strategic use of such information flows, and (3) consumer behavior influences the achievement of these market effects and strategic benefits. The author performs a longitudinal quasi-experiment to investigate these issues using the introduction of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) as a research context. Results indicate that information did promote consumer dynamics that may have fostered competitive activity among firms. Specifically, marketers changed the quality of base brands and their brand extensions in unique and opposite ways that enabled brands to occupy distinct strategic positions in the market. Market information also influenced the nature of competitive rivalry by shifting price promotion levels depending on the healthy positioning of firm brands. Such approaches were speculated to provide firms with a means of coping with the uncertainty of competitive and consumer reactions to the NLEA, extending theories of the market-level effects of information to include the strategic use of such information by firms. © 1998 American Marketing Association.","",""

The more important attributes for each respondent are identified first using the self-explicated approach. Full-profile conjoint analysis customized to the respondent's most important attributes then is administered. The conjoint utility function on the limited set of attributes then is combined with the self-explicated utility function on the full set of attributes. Surprisingly, the authors find that the self-explicated approach by itself yields a slightly (but not statistically significantly) higher predictive validity than does the combined approach. © 1997 American Marketing Association.","",""

Specifically, customers are faced with both adverse selection and moral hazard problems that involve, respectively, uncertainty about supplier characteristics and the risk of quality cheating. Drawing on prior research, the authors propose that agency problems in a customer relationship can be resolved by means of customer bonds and price premiums, which serve as signals and supplier incentives, respectively. The authors also propose that adverse selection and moral hazard problems exist in relationships between suppliers and their employees. Similar to the customer relationship, these problems can be addressed with signals and incentives of various kinds. The authors present hypotheses regarding the agency problems in both of these relationships and test them empirically in the context of automotive service purchases. Data obtained from 287 service managers support the hypotheses. The data also suggest that institutional differences across service outlets (e.g., ownership structure and size) influence how the two types of agency problems are managed.","",""

However, prior research has provided limited empirical evidence regarding the conditions under which (1) information confers such benefits on the market, (2) firms make strategic use of such information flows, and (3) consumer behavior influences the achievement of these market effects and strategic benefits. The author performs a longitudinal quasi-experiment to investigate these issues using the introduction of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) as a research context. Results indicate that information did promote consumer dynamics that may have fostered competitive activity among firms. Specifically, marketers changed the quality of base brands and their brand extensions in unique and opposite ways that enabled brands to occupy distinct strategic positions in the market. Market information also influenced the nature of competitive rivalry by shifting price promotion levels depending on the healthy positioning of firm brands. Such approaches were speculated to provide firms with a means of coping with the uncertainty of competitive and consumer reactions to the NLEA, extending theories of the market-level effects of information to include the strategic use of such information by firms.","",""

The mechanisms through which innovative late movers outsell pioneers are unclear. To identify these mechanisms, the authors develop a brand-level model in which brand sales are decomposed into trials and repeat purchases. The model captures diffusion and marketing mix effects on brand trials and includes the differential impacts of innovative and noninnovative competitors’ diffusion on these effects. The authors develop hypotheses on how the diffusion and marketing mix parameters of the brands differ by market entry strategy (pioneering, innovative late entry, and noninnovative late entry). The authors test these hypotheses using data from 13 brands in two pharmaceutical product categories. The results show that an innovative late mover can create a sustainable advantage by enjoying a higher market potential and a higher repeat purchase rate than either the pioneer or noninnovative late movers, growing faster than the pioneer, slowing the pioneer's diffusion, and reducing the pioneer's marketing spending effectiveness. Innovative late movers are advantaged asymmetrically in that their diffusion can hurt the sales of other brands, but their sales are not affected by competitors’ diffusion. In contrast, noninnovative late movers face smaller potential markets, lower repeat rates, and less marketing effectiveness compared with the pioneer. © 1998 American Marketing Association.","",""

In two studies, the authors examine how consumers form assortment perceptions in the face of SKU reduction with a particular emphasis on two heuristic cues: the availability of a favorite product and the amount of shelf space devoted to the category. Results indicate that retailers might be able to make substantive reductions in the number of items carried without negatively affecting assortment perceptions and store choice, as long as only low-preference items are eliminated and category space is held constant.

Conversely, “enriched” attributes (e.g., brand name), which are more difficult to compare but are often more meaningful and informative when evaluated on their own, tend to receive relatively greater weight when preferences are formed on the basis of separate evaluations of individual options. Consistent with this analysis, systematic preference reversals were observed in a series of studies, which tested the proposed explanation on the basis of attribute-task compatibility, demonstrated that the findings generalize across preference elicitation tasks and attributes that have the characteristics prescribed by their theory, and examined rival accounts.

This latent structure, ordered probit, multidimensional scaling (MDS) based methodology improves on existing industry techniques of illustrating perceived customer value because it enables researchers to infer the underlying dimensions of perceived value from the data without specifying these a priori, as is common in existing methods. The authors compare the proposed model against more traditional MDS approaches in an empirical illustration involving the perceived value of compact cars.

In a marketing setting, consumers often are promised a delayed reward, contingent on the performance of future effort. In such situations, the author proposes that at the time of brand choice, the future effort is underweighted, relative to the future savings. Consequently, an incentive that appears attractive at the time of brand choice may appear unattractive at the time of redemption. The author hypothesizes and experimentally demonstrates the effect of face value, level of effort, and temporal delay on choice, redemption, and profits. Results show that temporal delay between choice and redemption causes a systematic underweighting of future effort, which mediates the increased attractiveness of alternatives with delayed incentives. The author also uses an analytical model to derive the profitability implications of delayed incentives.","",""

The authors investigate factors that moderate the impact of a new feature on brand choice. Building on two principles, multiattribute diminishing sensitivity and performance uncertainty, they propose that the characteristics of the products to which new features are added are important determinants of the impact of these features on sales and market share. Specifically, in six studies, they show that a new feature adds greater value and increases the choice share of a brand more when the brand (1) has relatively inferior existing features, (2) is associated with lower (perceived) quality, (3) has a higher price, and (4) is both high-priced and high-quality. The results also suggest that the addition of a new feature reduces buyers’ price sensitivity for low-quality, but not for high-quality, brands and that multiattribute diminishing sensitivity is a more important moderator of the effect of new features than performance uncertainty.

The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action.

(2) What should its performance level be? and (3) How do the decisions of a competing firm affect a firm's timing and product performance decisions? The authors present a detailed case study of the initial competitors in the personal digital assistant (PDA) industry on the basis of which they construct a stylized game-theoretic model of entry timing and product performance level decisions in a duopoly. Situations in which the duopolists are symmetric as well as asymmetric in terms of their estimates of market size and product development capabilities are considered. When firms are symmetric, the authors show that an equilibrium exists when the firms enter at different times with different performance levels. In the asymmetric cases, the firm that has a higher estimate of market size enters first, as does the firm with a superior development process. The performance level decisions, however, depend on the sensitivity of demand to this variable. The results provide one explanation for empirical observations that market pioneers maintain their leadership in some cases, and later entrants eventually dominate in other cases.

An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means - end chains laddering framework, the ""voice of the customer"" approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography.

Using data published in Harshman and colleagues’ (1982) work, the authors examine the U. S. car market and find brand-loyal segments for all car types except those favored by first-time buyers, a universal market, and five switching segments that consider car groups differing in the nation of origin, size, and luxury level.

Data from 92 new product development projects indicate that higher organizational memory levels enhance the short-term financial performance of new products, whereas greater memory dispersion increases both the performance and creativity of new products. They also find, however, that under some conditions of high environmental turbulence, high memory dispersion actually detracts from creativity and has no effect on financial performance. Under conditions of low turbulence, high memory dispersion promotes higher levels of creativity and short-term financial performance. These findings provide some initial evidence that knowledge is not an unconditionally positive asset and suggest that developing and sustaining valuable organizational memory may require attention not only to the appropriate levels of memory but also to managing subtle aspects of memory dispersion and deployment.

Empirical studies lead to the additional hypothesis that a competitor orientation is detrimental to performance. To examine these hypotheses, the authors conduct two studies. The first is a laboratory study in which 1016 subjects made pricing decisions. When information about the competitor's profits was provided, over 40% of the subjects were willing to sacrifice part of their company's profits to beat or harm the competitor. Such competitor-oriented behavior occurred across a variety of treatments.

The internal supplier receives a larger bonus for a higher evaluation. The authors examine two internal customer-internal supplier incentive systems. In one system, the internal customer provides the evaluation implicitly by selecting the percentage of its bonus that is based on market outcomes (e.g., a combination of net sales and customer satisfaction if these measures can be tied to incremental profits). The internal supplier's reward is based on the percentage that the internal customer chooses. In the second system, the internal customer selects target market outcomes, and the internal supplier is rewarded on the basis of the target. In each incentive system, some risk is transferred from the firm to the employees, and the firm must pay for this; but in return, the firm need not observe either the internal supplier's or the internal customer's actions. The incentive systems are robust even if the firm guesses wrongly about what employees perceive as costly and about how employee actions affect profit.

Each latent segment represents a particular preference state characterized by a set of segment-level choice probabilities. The modeling framework is based on a class of dynamic latent class models that explicitly recognize two major types of preference heterogeneity: (1) heterogeneity caused by before-after changes in latent preferences for the brands (i.e., time-varying relative choice probabilities) and/or (2) heterogeneity caused by consumers changing their latent preference segment in response to a new product (i.e., time varying latent segment probabilities).

The authors demonstrate that the appropriate measure of choice design efficiency requires probability centering and weighting of the rows of the design matrix, and they illustrate how this criterion enables the analyst to appropriately trade off utility balance against three other principles: orthogonality, level balance, and minimal overlap. Two methods, swapping and relabeling attribute levels, provide complementary ways to increase the utility balance of choice designs. The authors apply a process for generating utility-balanced designs to five different choice designs and show that it reduces by 10–50% the number of respondents needed to achieve a specific error level around the parameters. A sensitivity analysis reveals that these gains are diminished, but still substantial, despite strong misspecifications of prior parameter estimates. © 1996 American Marketing Association.","",""

Data from 92 new product development projects indicate that higher organizational memory levels enhance the short-term financial performance of new products, whereas greater memory dispersion increases both the performance and creativity of new products. They also find, however, that under some conditions of high environmental turbulence, high memory dispersion actually detracts from creativity and has no effect on financial performance. Under conditions of low turbulence, high memory dispersion promotes higher levels of creativity and short-term financial performance. These findings provide some initial evidence that knowledge is not an unconditionally positive asset and suggest that developing and sustaining valuable organizational memory may require attention not only to the appropriate levels of memory but also to managing subtle aspects of memory dispersion and deployment. These results imply that if organizations fail to understand the subtle ways in which different features of organizational memory influence product development, they may fail to harvest the full value of organizational learning. © 1997 American Marketing Association.","",""

Their study, involving 788 nonmarketing managers in high-tech equipment manufacturing companies, suggests that both dissemination frequency and formality have nonlinear effects on perceived intelligence quality. In addition, they find evidence of a mere formality effect; that is, intelligence received through formal channels appears to be used more than that obtained through informal channels. The authors also find that the frequency with which market intelligence is disseminated is related to interfunctional distance, joint customer visits, senders' positional power, a receiver's organizational commitment, and trust in a sender. Additionally they find the formality of the dissemination process is shaped by interfunctional distance, receivers' trust in senders, and structural flux. Interestingly, the effects of internal environmental volatility (i.e., structural flux) appear to be different from those of external environmental volatility (i.e., market dynamism). For example, structural flux is found to affect dissemination formality, but not frequency, whereas the opposite is true for market dynamism.","",""

The authors investigate factors that moderate the impact of a new feature on brand choice. Building on two principles, multiattribute diminishing sensitivity and performance uncertainty, they propose that the characteristics of the products to which new features are added are important determinants of the impact of these features on sales and market share. Specifically, in six studies, they show that a new feature adds greater value and increases the choice share of a brand more when the brand (1) has relatively inferior existing features, (2) is associated with lower (perceived) quality, (3) has a higher price, and (4) is both high-priced and high-quality. The results also suggest that the addition of a new feature reduces buyers' price sensitivity for low-quality, but not for high-quality, brands and that multiattribute diminishing sensitivity is a more important moderator of the effect of new features than performance uncertainty.

The authors call these variations branded variants and suggest that manufacturers offer branded variants for the benefit of their most direct customers—retailers. With branded variants, a consumer must remember, evaluate, and process a wider variety of product features to make comparisons across variants and retail outlets. The authors suggest that as branded variants increase, some consumers experience an increased cost of shopping for a branded product across retail stores. Consequently, fewer consumers shop across retail stores. This reduced shopping translates into reduced competition across retail stores, which encourages (1) more retailers to carry a branded product and (2) retailers to supply that branded product with more retail service support. The authors use data from three retailers across 14 product categories to demonstrate that a branded product with more variants often has greater retail availability and higher levels of retail service. © 1996 American Marketing Association.","",""

These techniques can be extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers, which might result in misinterpretations of the segments, and subsequently to inferring incorrect relationships of segments to independently defined, actionable variables. The authors propose a general approach to market segmentation based on the concept of overlapping clusters (Shepard and Arabie 1979), wherein each pattern of overlap can be interpreted as a distinct partition. Both K-means and K-medians clustering procedures are special cases of the proposed approach. The suggested procedure can handle relatively large data sets (e.g., 2000 entities), is easily programmable, and hence can be gainfully employed in marketing research.","",""

When applied to Venkatesh and Mahajan's (1993) data, the number of events held is shown to have a substantial impact on firm profits. The authors also study the pricing strategies of a nonprofit organization that seeks to maximize usage subject to a nondeficit constraint. Using the same data, the authors show that compared to a profit maximizing firm, a usage-maximizing nonprofit organization (1) charges lower prices, (2) holds more events, and (3) takes fixed costs into account in setting prices. For the distributions considered by Venkatesh and Mahajan (1993), there is a reversal in the order of preferred strategies, with the pure-bundling strategy dominating the single ticket strategy, though mixed bundling is still the most preferred strategy. In addition, the authors find that attendance is nor maximized by offering the greatest possible number of events.

The authors address a variety of issues involved in defining and using SKUs in a choice model, as well as the unique benefits that arise from doing so. They discuss how a set of discrete attributes (e.g., brand name, package size, type) can be used to characterize a large set of SKUs in a parsimonious manner. They postulate that consumers do not form preferences for each individual SKU, per se, but instead evaluate the underlying attributes that describe each item. The model is shown to be substantially superior to a more traditional framework that does not emphasize the complete use of SKU attribute information. Their analysis also highlights several other benefits associated with the proposed modeling approach, such as the ability to forecast sales for imitative line extensions that enter the market in a future period.

However, in industries facing rapid technological change, stiff competition, and uncertain customer needs, specifications set too early could become outdated by the time of market launch, thereby decreasing the product's benefits to the customer. The authors discuss an alternative approach, in which a firm delays commitment to product specifications and finalizes them just in time for the market launch after careful deliberation, thereby benefiting from the evolution of core technologies and customer preferences. Because such an approach introduces new managerial challenges, it would be appropriate only under certain circumstances.

The findings suggest that using cross-functional teams is more important in projects in which less of the design is a carryover from a previous generation. Teams then had a large impact in reducing product development cycle times. In contrast, implementing a well thought-out process is more important in firms (or divisions of firms) developing complex products or services.

The author substantiates such concerns: Subjects who saw comparative price claims mistakenly infered that the advertised brand was least expensive overall and made suboptimal choices, though they could have found the omitted prices.

To examine this central hypothesis, the authors conduct a controlled experiment that compares experts with novices when solving a complex problem that had characteristics of a moderately ill-structured problem. Relative to novices, the authors find that experts select fewer, but more diagnostic, information inputs and are more consistent when evaluating nonquantified inputs. As a result, they make more accurate and tightly clustered judgments than do novices, and also are more confident in their decisions.

In these markets, consumers' expectations about the future installed base and the resultant externality benefits play a critical role in their product adoption decisions. The authors investigate the strategic implications of consumer uncertainty regarding network externality and show that a firm can credibly convey private information about future installed base through its new product introduction strategy. The authors initially consider a market in which consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of quality. They show that under complete information the optimal strategy entails provision of full (efficient) quality in the first period itself, providing any upgrade in the second period is suboptimal. However, under asymmetric information about externality, a high-externality firm provides less than full quality initially and then makes up for the quality differential through provision of an upgrade in the second period. Thus, underprovision of introductory quality (i.e., withholding quality) serves as a signal of high externality, and upgrades serve as the mechanism for implementation of the signaling strategy. The authors demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in quality valuation. The additional insight here is that signaling entails sequential targeting of segments in addition to sequential provision of quality.","",""

The authors propose a model of coupon redemption that extends previous models of coupon usage by considering the joint effects of coupon attractiveness and coupon proneness on redemption, and does not require explicit measurement of these variables. Empirical application of the model shows that it correctly predicts redemption intentions for nearly 90% of consumers in a holdout sample and substantially outperforms a logit model that includes traditional measures of coupon proneness, coupon characteristics, and demographics.

Free-standing insert coupons are typically composed of two parts: the coupon per se and a print advertisement. Using two laboratory experiments and a separate analysis of coupon measurements from scanner panels, the authors investigate whether the content of the print advertisement influences the effectiveness of the coupon. Theoretical arguments suggest that the impact on consumer attitudes will depend on the executional cues of the copy, the brand loyalty of the consumers, and the consumer's involvement with the product category. The results support the theoretical framework and suggest that it is possible to make FSI coupons more effective by choosing appropriate executional cues for their advertising copy.","",""

These diagrams, charts, maps, pictures, and other figures help elucidate the nature of the relationships and structural patterns involved. However, their ability to communicate is partially limited by their typical restriction to the two-dimensional plane of the printed page. As an aid to overcoming such problems, stereographic techniques permit the construction of three-dimensional representations whose vividness and depth provide greater clarity and enhance interpretability to strengthen the reader's grasp of key concepts. The author illustrates the stereographic approach to three-dimensional communication using general examples closely analogous to relevant applications in marketing research.","",""

The authors present a decision-support system for managing the NPD process in this industry, which explicitly evaluates the financial prospects of new line extension concepts. The system developed is based on an in-depth analysis of 51 new product projects launched over a three-year period at a major food manufacturer. It embodies historical knowledge about the productivity of the firm's NPD process and captures some key research and development resource inputs that can affect this productivity. It also provides shipment forecasts at various stages of the NPD process and thus can be used at new product project review gates to evaluate line extension concepts systematically. Finally, the system also can be used to improve the practice of the NPD process by enabling its users to take a product line perspective, using incremental sales evaluation, and by facilitating cross-functional and inter-project learning. Although the system has been developed specifically for a packaged food company environment, its underlying design principles are generic and applicable to a wide range of industries. © 1997 American Marketing Association.","",""

The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action. However, none of the tested decision procedures completely reduces commitment to a losing course of action relative to the control condition.","",""

Ad duration is related only weakly to overall ad judgments, though longer advertisements have an advantage as long as they build toward a peak emotional experience. In Study 2, the authors replicate these findings under more realistic viewing conditions and demonstrate that the results cannot be attributed solely to memory artifacts that are based on recency.

In addition, they find evidence of a mere formality effect; that is, intelligence received through formal channels appears to be used more than that obtained through informal channels. The authors also find that the frequency with which market intelligence is disseminated is related to interfunctional distance, joint customer visits, senders’ positional power, a receiver's organizational commitment, and trust in a sender. Additionally they find the formality of the dissemination process is shaped by interfunctional distance, receivers’ trust in senders, and structural flux. Interestingly, the effects of internal environmental volatility (i.e., structural flux) appear to be different from those of external environmental volatility (i.e., market dynamism).

In one system, the internal customer provides the evaluation implicitly by selecting the percentage of its bonus that is based on market outcomes (e.g., a combination of net sales and customer satisfaction if these measures can be tied to incremental profits). The internal supplier's reward is based on the percentage that the internal customer chooses. In the second system, the internal customer selects target market outcomes, and the internal supplier is rewarded on the basis of the target. In each incentive system, some risk is transferred from the firm to the employees, and the firm must pay for this; but in return, the firm need not observe either the internal supplier's or the internal customer's actions.

When applied to Venkatesh and Mahajan's (1993) data, the number of events held is shown to have a substantial impact on firm profits. The authors also study the pricing strategies of a nonprofit organization that seeks to maximize usage subject to a nondeficit constraint. Using the same data, the authors show that compared to a profit maximizing firm, a usage-maximizing nonprofit organization (1) charges lower prices, (2) holds more events, and (3) takes fixed costs into account in setting prices. For the distributions considered by Venkatesh and Mahajan (1993), there is a reversal in the order of preferred strategies, with the pure-bundling strategy dominating the single ticket strategy, though mixed bundling is still the most preferred strategy. In addition, the authors find that attendance is not maximized by offering the greatest possible number of events. The effects of alternative objective functions, such as surplus maximization, and additional bundling policies (adding bundles consisting of only some of the events scheduled) are also examined.","",""

In many cases, manufacturers have tens to hundreds of models. Seiko wrist watches, for example, may come with different bands, chimes, and special features. The authors call these variations branded variants and suggest that manufacturers offer branded variants for the benefit of their most direct customers - retailers. With branded variants, a consumer must remember, evaluate, and process a wider variety of product features to make comparisons across variants and retail outlets. The authors sug-gest that as branded variants increase, some consumers experience an increased cost of shopping for a branded product across retail stores. Consequently, fewer consumers shop across retail stores. This reduced shopping translates into reduced competition across retail stores, which encourages (1) more retailers to carry a branded product and (2) retailers to supply that branded product with more retail service support. The authors use data from three retailers across 14 product categories to demonstrate that a branded product with more variants often has greater retail availability and higher levels of retail service.","",""
"Measuring the dynamic effects of promotions on brand choice","1996","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030493268&doi=10.2307%2f3152010&partnerID=40&md5=8254a593be9c7c1c82f6c767a5587aa4","Promotions are being used with increasing frequency by manufacturers facing highly competitive markets, which is causing concern among some marketers who feel that frequent promotions can hurt a brand. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to either support or dispel such fears. To fill this gap in the literature, the authors propose a brand choice model that provides an estimate of the dynamic effects of promotions on loyalty to the brand and customers' sensitivity to the price of the brand, and measures whether promotional purchases reinforce or reduce subsequent response to similar promotions. They estimate a random effects heteroskedastic covariance probit time-varying parameter model on household scanner panel data from the liquid detergent category. Their results indicate that increased purchases using coupons erode brand loyalty and increase price sensitivity. In addition, the authors find that the effect of features and displays on brand choice is reinforced by prior feature and display purchases, respectivly, as well as by feature and display purchases associated with price cuts. Future research directions are also discussed.","",""

Using public domain U.S. Census Bureau geodemographic data for Sioux Falls and the state of South Dakota, they apply the approach to four specific marketing problems, two involving direct mail advertising campaigns and two involving the location of a retail site. The empirical applications illustrate the serious bias that results from the assumption that the demographic variables are independent of each other. Overall, the Bayesian approach recovers the underlying joint distribution of the variables of interest well and is unique in its ability to provide a measure of uncertainty about the resulting estimates. Hypothesis testing and the construction of confidence intervals are illustrated in the context of a retail site location application. The results of a Monte Carlo experiment indicate that the Bayesian approach recovers joint densities under a variety of conditions in a robust manner.","",""

Researchers, however, suggest that managerial skills may account for the relationship and underscore the need to control for such skills. The authors develop efficiency measures to represent a firm's managerial skills, employing the data envelopment analysis framework as well as a regression-based approach. Furthermore, they account for unobserved, firm-specific factors that include unobserved managerial skills. With such systematic control for observed and unobserved managerial skills, they reexamine the impact of pioneering on market share and find that it is robust even after they control for managerial skills.","",""

This may lead managers to focus on comparative measures such as market share. Drawing on game theory, the authors hypothesize that managers are competitor oriented under certain conditions, in particular, when they are provided with information about competitors' performance. Empirical studies lead to the additional hypothesis that a competitor orientation is detrimental to performance. To examine these hypotheses, the authors conduct two studies. The first is a laboratory study in which 1016 subjects made pricing decisions. When information about the competitor's profits was provided, over 40% of the subjects were willing to sacrifice part of their company's profits to beat or harm the competitor. Such competitor-oriented behavior occurred across a variety of treatments. The second is a field study used to examine the performance over a half-century of 20 large U.S. firms with differing objectives. Firms with competitor-oriented (market share) objectives were less profitable and less likely to survive than those whose objectives were directly oriented to profits.","",""

The authors' purpose is to enhance the understanding of outcome-and behavior-based coordination efforts of supplier personnel in relationships with distributors. The authors use primary data from a national survey of industrial distributors to test the conceptual framework. Empirical results suggest that a supplier's use of such coordination efforts is affected by environmental uncertainty, supplier familiarity with distributor markets, supplier replaceability, and supplier resource constraints, as well as by distributor experience and distributor value added.","",""

The authors propose a two-stage choice process in which the consumer first identifies a subset of brands within the universal set of brands called the choice set and then evaluates only those brands that are in the choice set relative to one another to select a single brand. The authors find that, consistent with reports of the extent of external price search of consumers, response to shelf price variations is limited to the brands in the choice set (local price response). Their results indicate that employing the assumption of global price response may lead to biased estimates of price elasticity and derived measures of clout and vulnerability. To enable a managerially meaningful and useful assessment of a brand's competitive clout and vulnerability, the authors provide a brand-level approach to integrate local price response into the derivation of these measures.","",""

The authors show that if there are reasonable nonzero priors for expected coefficients, then these can be used to generate more statistically efficient choice designs, because the alternatives in their choice sets are balanced in utility - they have more similar choice probabilities. The authors demonstrate that the appropriate measure of choice design efficiency requires probability centering and weighting of the rows of the design matrix, and they illustrate how this criterion enables the analyst to appropriately trade off utility balance against three other principles: orthogonality, level balance, and minimal overlap. Two methods, swapping and relabeling attribute levels, provide complementary ways to increase the utility balance of choice designs. The authors apply a process for generating utility-balanced designs to five different choice designs and show that it reduces by 10-50% the number of respondents needed to achieve a specific error level around the parameters. A sensitivity analysis reveals that these gains are diminished, but still substantial, despite strong misspecifications of prior parameter estimates.","",""

The author applies the model to store-level data on fabric softener and illustrates the steps involved in the estimation and usefulness of model results. In particular, he shows that the Separate Effects Model can (1) identify the source of the discount effect observed in the conventional model, (2) uncover discount effects not detected in the conventional model, and (3) guide managers' decisions related to discount sizes and provide some insights about brand strength. An interesting substantive finding from the empirical analysis is that the leading national brand can draw sales from competing brands without reducing its price below the price of the other brands.","",""

The authors present methods based on three-mode factor analysis and multivariate regression that can help both analysts and managers make better decisions regarding whether UPCs should be aggregated into brand units and, if so, how should the aggregation be done; which marketing instruments to track; and how to disentangle correlated promotional strategies. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to UPC-level data (25 UPCs, seven marketing instruments, and 156 weeks). In this example, to aggregate UPCs within a manufacturer into brand units would distort the relations between the marketing instruments and market responses. A multivariate regression from the competitive-component scores provides a methodologically sound and practical method for calibrating market response in such cases.","",""

The changes would address long-standing concerns that such claims erroneously imply that the advertised brand is superior, not only on the featured attribute, but also on omitted and seemingly related attributes. The author substantiates such concerns: Subjects who saw comparative price claims mistakenly infered that the advertised brand was least expensive overall and made suboptimal choices, though they could have found the omitted prices. As predicted, subjects were most likely to overgeneralize the most reliable-looking and informative claim -the one that (1) named the targeted competitor and (2) specified the savings amount. In addition, a disclosure was ineffective. The author concludes with recommendations for limited added regulations.","",""

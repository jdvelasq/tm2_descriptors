"Optimal and dysfunctional turnover: toward an organizational level model.","1984","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021416336&doi=10.5465%2fAMR.1984.4277675&partnerID=40&md5=04fe47dcde490951f73d71095cc85ff7","Dysfunctional turnover is defined here as the level that produces a divergence between the organization's optimal balance of costs associated with turnover and the costs associated with retaining employees. Under this approach, the optimal level of aggregate turnover for most organizations will be (1) greater than zero and (2) variable across organizations, contingent on particular factors influencing retention costs and quit propensities. The model presented posits that individual, organizational, and environmental attributes influence individual quit propensities of employees and, hence, expected turnover rates for the organization.","","Models, Theoretical; Personnel Management; Personnel Turnover; article; economics; personnel management; theoretical model"

To facilitate future studies of the effectiveness of managerial behavior, a framework of fourteen propositions which describe the process of managerial diagnosis is presented. The author says that: 1) the manager will defer those perceptions where performance exceeds expectations; 2) decision-makers are goaded into evaluation (a process used to measure performance or comparative alternatives) by stimuli such as conflict, uncertain performance, and uncertain expectations; and 3) evaluation findings are deemed acceptable only when they reduce conflict.","","Administrative Personnel; Decision Making; Humans; Organization and Administration; Problem Solving; administrative personnel; article; decision making; human; organization and management; problem solving"

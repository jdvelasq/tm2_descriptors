A Modification of Talbot's Method for the Simultaneous Approximation of Several Values of the Inverse Laplace Transform,1995,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000799469&doi=10.1145%2f212066.212068&partnerID=40&md5=70d33d3e7f248b63ecb4d532d7a4a3c6,"In recent years many results have been obtained in the field of the numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. Among them, a very accurate and general method is due to Talbot: this method approximates the value of the inverse Laplace transform f(t), for t fixed, using the complex values of the Laplace transform IVs sampled on a suitable contour of the complex plane. On the basis of the interest raised by Talbot's method implementation, the author has been induced to investigate more deeply the possibilities of this method and has been able to generahze Talbot's method, to approximate simultaneously several values of f(t) using the same sampling values of the Laplace transform. In this way, the only unfavorable aspect of the classical Talbot method, that is, that of recomputing all of the samples of IVs for each t, has been eliminated.

The basic idea is to avoid not only numerical approximations, which are expensive with respect to CPU time and contain round-off errors, but also hand-coded differentiation. This article introduces the forward and backward accumulation methods and describes the numerical implementation of a computer code with the name PCOMP. The main intention of the approach used is to provide a flexible and portable Fortran code for practical applications. The underlying language is described in terms of a formal grammar and is a subset of Fortran with a few extensions. Besides a parser that generates an intermediate code and that can be executed independently from the evaluation routines, there are other subroutines for the direct computation of function and gradient values, which can be called directly from a user program. On the other hand, it is possible to generate a Fortran code for function and gradient evaluation that can be compiled and linked separately. © 1995, ACM.

Since asymptotically the inverse cubic interpolation is always chosen by the algorithms, they achieve higher-efficiency indices: 1.6529 … for the first algorithm, and 1.6686 … for the second one. It is proved that the second algorithm is optimal in a certain family. Numerical experiments show that the two new methods compare well with recent methods, as well as with the efficient solvers of Dekker, Brent, Bus and Dekker, and Le.

It is well known that allowing some fill-in during the incomplete factorization can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. Allowing fill-in, however, increases the time for the factorization and for the triangular system solutions. Additionally, it is difficult to predict a priori how much fill-in to allow and how to allow it. The unpredictability of the required storage/work and the unknown benefits of the additional fill-in make such strategies impractical to use in many situations. In this article we motivate, and then present, two “black-box” strategies that significantly increase the effectiveness of incomplete Cholesky factorization as a preconditioner. These strategies require no parameters from the user and do not increase the cost of the triangular system solutions. Efficient implementations for these algorithms are described. These algorithms are shown to be successful for a variety of problems from the Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection. © 1995, ACM.

The method minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors, subject to nonnegativity of second divided differences, in two phases. First, an approximation close to the optimum is derived in O1995 operations. Then, this approximation is used as the starting point of a dual-feasible quadratic programming algorithm that completes the calculation of the optimum. The constraints allow B-splines to be used, which reduce the problem to an equivalent one with fewer variables where the knots of the splines are determined automatically from the data points due to the constraint equations. The subroutine benefits from this reduction, since common submatrices that occur during the calculation are updated suitably. Iterative refinement improves the accuracy of some calculations when round-off errors accumulate. The subroutine has been applied to a variety of data having substantial differences and has performed fast and stably even for small data spacing, large n, and single-precision arithmetic.

Although many of these facilities were originally produced by the authors in conjunction with the software package LANCELOT, we believe that they will be useful in their own right and should be available to researchers for their development of optimization software. The tools can be obtained by anonymous ftp from a number of sources and may, in many cases, be installed automatically. The scope of a major collection of test problems written in the standard input format 1995 used by the LANCELOT software package is described. Recognizing that most software was not written with the SIF in mind, we provide tools to assist in building an interface between this input format and other optimization packages. These tools provide a link between the SIF and a number of existing packages, including MINOS and OSL. Additionally, as each problem includes a specific classification that is designed to be useful in identifying particular classes of problems, facilities are provided to build and manage a database of this information. There is a Unix and C shell bias to many of the descriptions in the article, since, for the sake of simplicity, we do not illustrate everything in its fullest generality. We trust that the majority of potential users are sufficiently familiar with Unix that these examples will not lead to undue confusion. © 1995, ACM.

The solution of these problems is coordinated via a simple, dense, nonlinear master program to obtain a solution that is feasible within some user-specified tolerance to the original multicommodity network flow problem. Particular emphasis is placed on the mapping of both the subproblems and master problem data to the processing elements of a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine CM-2.

The package is intended for problems where n is not too large—say, n 100—so that the cost of storing one n × n matrix, and factoring it at each iteration, is acceptable. The software allows the user to choose between a recently developed “tensor method” for unconstrained optimization and an analogous standard method based on a quadratic model. The tensor method bases each iteration on a specially constructed fourth-order model of the objective function not significantly more expensive to form, store, or solve than the standard quadratic model. In our experience, the tensor method requires significantly fewer iterations and function evaluations to solve most unconstrained optimization problems than standard methods based on quadratic models, and also solves a somewhat wider range of problems. For these reasons, it may be a useful addition to numerical software libraries. © 1994, ACM.

Specifically, solutions are found in two dimensions for the nonseparable self-adjoint elliptic problem [Formula Omitted], where g and f are given functions of x and y, in two-dimensional polygonal domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Helmholtz and Poisson problems in polygonal domains and the general variable coefficient problem [Formula Omitted] in a rectangular domain may be treated as special cases. The method of solution combines the use of the capacitance matrix method, to treat the irregular boundary, with an efficient iterative method 1994 to deal 2 with nonseparability. Each iterative step thus involves solving the Poisson equation in a rectangular domain. The package includes separate, easy-to-use routines for the Helmholtz problem and the general problem in rectangular and general polygonal domains, and example driver routines for each. Both single- and double-precision routines are provided. Second-order-accurate finite differencing is employed. Storage requirements increase approximately as p2 + n2, where p is the number of irregular boundary points and where n is the linear domain dimension. The preprocessing time (the capacitance matrix calculation) varies as pn2 log n, and the solution time varies as n2 log n. If the equations are to be solved repeatedly in the same geometry, but with different source or diffusion functions, the capacitance matrix need only be calculated once, and hence the algorithm is particularly efficient for such cases. © 1994, ACM.

The Evaluation of Trigonometric Integrals Avoiding Spurious Discontinuities,1994,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028387004&doi=10.1145%2f174603.174409&partnerID=40&md5=e0831e6bf76ae5b74188c5bbcd0a279e,"The tan1994 substitution, also called the Weierstrass substitution, is one method currently used by computer-algebra systems for the evaluation of trigonometric integrals. The method needs to be improved, because the expressions obtained using it sometimes contain discontinuities, which unnecessarily limit the domains over which the expressions are correct. We show that the discontinuities are spurious in the following sense: Given an integrand and an expression for its antiderivative that was obtained by the Weierstrass substition, a better expression can be found that is continuous on wider intervals than the first expression and yet is still an antiderivative of the integrand. The origin of the discontinuities is identified, and an algorithm is presented for automatically finding the improved type of antiderivative. The new algorithm also enlarges the set of functions that can be used in the substitution. The algorithm works by first evaluating the given integral using the Weierstrass substitution in the usual way and then removing any spurious discontinuities present in the antiderivative. © 1994, ACM.

Sparse QR Factorization in MATLAB,1994,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028385461&doi=10.1145%2f174603.174408&partnerID=40&md5=fbd05e7c0e7ee99ecf56681ece0698a6,"In the recently presented sparse matrix extension of MATLAB, there is no routine for sparse QR factorization. Sparse linear least-squares problems are instead solved by the augmented system method. The accuracy in computed solutions is strongly dependent on a scaling parameter δ. Its optimal value is expensive to compute, and it must therefore be approximated by a simple heuristic. We describe a multifrontal method for sparse QR factorization and its implementation in MATLAB. It is well known that the multifrontal approach is suitable for vector machines. We show that it is also attractive in MATLAB. In both cases, scalar operations are expensive, and the reformulation of the sparse problem into dense subproblems is advantageous. Using the new routine, we implement two methods for the solution of sparse linear least-squares problems and compare these with the built-in MATLAB function. We show that the QR-based methods normally are much faster and more accurate than the MATLAB implementation of the augmented system method. A better choice of the parameter δ or iterative refinement must be used to make the augmented system method as accurate as the methods based on QR factorization. © 1994, ACM.

Any such matrix H of order n, normalized so that its subdiagonal elements are nonnegative, can be written as a product of n–1 Givens matrices and a diagonal matrix. This representation, which we refer to as the Schur parametric form of H, arises naturally in applications such as in signal processing and in the computation of Gauss-Szego¨ quadrature rules. Our programs utilize the Schur parametrization to compute the spectral decomposition of H without explicitly forming the elements of H. If only the eigenvalues and first components of the eigenvectors are desired, as in the applications mentioned above, the algorithm requires only O1994 arithmetic operations. Experimental results presented indicate that the algorithm is reliable and competitive with the general QR algorithm applied to this problem.

A principal advantage of this approach is that most manufacturers provide at least an efficient serial version of GEMM so that our implementation can capture a significant percentage of the computer performance. A parameter which controls the blocking allows an efficient exploitation of the memory hierarchy of the various target computers. Furthermore, this blocked version of Level-3 BLAS is naturally parallel. We present results on the ALLIANT FX/80, the CONVEX C220, the CRAY-2, and the IBM 3090/VF.

This property makes the analysis of rounding errors particularly simple. To show this, some principles for analyzing the propagation and generation of rounding errors in algorithms containing no subtraction are discussed first. These principles are then applied in the context of a simple recursive algorithm involving the transient solution of discrete-time Markov chains, Jensen's algorithm, and state reduction. Jensen's algorithm, also known as randomization or uniformization, is an algorithm for finding transient solutions of continuous-time Markov chains.

An efficient algorithm for this Sparsity Problem (SP) would be a valuable preprocessor for linearly constrained optimization problems. In a companion paper we developed a two-pass approach to solve SP called the Hierarchical Algorithm. In this paper we report on how we implemented the Hierarchical Algorithm into a code called HASP, and our computational experience in testing HASP on the NETLIB linear-programming problems. We found that HASP substantially outperformed a previous code for SP and that it produced a net savings in optimization time on the NETLIB problems.

Both of these classes of methods have certain drawbacks, however, and it has long been the aim of numerical analysts to derive a class of formulas that has the advantages of both Adams and Runge–Kutta methods and the disadvantages of neither! In this paper we derive a class of modified Adams formulas that attempts to achieve this aim. When used in a certain precisely defined predictor-corrector mode, these new formulas require three function evaluations per step, but have much better stability than Adams formulas. This improved stability makes the modified Adams formulas particularly effective for mildly stiff problems, and some numerical evidence of this is given. We also consider the performance of the new class of methods on the well-known DETEST test set to show their potential on general nonstiff initial value problems. © 1993, ACM.

Presented here is a new method for computing this function that applies prime number factorization to the factorials. We also apply cancellation to the numerator and denominator to reduce the computational complexity of the initial, the tail end, or weighted probabilities to achieve maximum accuracy. The new method includes two algorithms, one using recursion and the other using iteration. These two algorithms are machine independent; precision is arbitrary, subject to storage limitation. The development of the algorithms is discussed, and some test results and the comparison of these two algorithms are given. To implement both algorithms, we use the Ada programming language that is an American National Standard Institute standardized language. The language has special features such as exception handling and tasks. Exception handling is used to make programming easier and to prevent overflow or underflow conditions during the execution of the program. Tasks are used to compute the numerator and denominator concurrently, and to maximize the possible number of integer multiplications in the numerator and denominator. All of the computations can be done on currently available machines, and the time consumed by these computations remains reasonably small. © 1993, ACM.

BTN is a general-purpose algorithm, capable of solving problems with a large numbers of variables and suitable for users inexperienced with parallel computing. It is designed to be as easy to use as traditional algorithms for this problem, requiring only that a (scalar) subroutine be provided to evaluate the objective function and its gradient vector of first derivatives. The algorithm is based on a block truncated-Newton method. Truncated-Newton methods obtain the search direction by approximately solving the Newton equations via some iterative method.

There are several widely available computer codes based on this approach, all of which have at their core a particular choice of basis representation for the piecewise polynomials used to approximate the solutions. Until recently, the most popular approach was to use a B-spline representation, but it has been shown that the B-spline basis is inferior, both in operation counts and conditioning, to a certain monomial basis, and the latter has come more into favor. In this paper, we describe a linear algebraic equations which arise in spline collocation at Gaussian points with such a monomial basis. It is shown that the new package, which implements an alternate column and row pivoting algorithm, is a distinct improvement over existing packages from the points of view of speed and storage requirements.

Using Newton's and Newton-like methods, we solve typical spline configurations, and hence infer that the procedure will reliably yield precise extremum-energy solutions to nonlinear splines of arbitrary 1992 size and complexity. In order to distinguish between stable and unstable states of spline equilibria, we evaluate the energy change resulting from a perturbation, and we briefly discuss aspects of spline existence and uniqueness in relation to the solved examples. We demonstrate the abrupt transition which occurs at the threshold between spline existence and nonexistence, and conclude that proof of a spline's existence is implicit in the solution set of constants yielded by the method. The procedure may be regarded on the one hand as a precise and efficient research instrument for investigating the properties of true splines and elastica, and on the other as an everyday method for obtaining “the smoothest interpolating curve of all. Contact is always maintained with the physical analogue to the curve, the thin uniform elastic beam, since the four assignable parameters used in each spline interval comprise the necessary and sufficient three angles and one length dimension of the actual physical spline.

Since their basic unit of data is a submatrix rather than a scalar, they have a higher level of granularity than point algorithms, and this makes them well suited to high-performance computers. The numerical stability of the block algorithms in the new linear algebra program library LAPACK is investigated here. It is shown that these algorithms have backward error analyses in which the backward error bounds are commensurate with the error bounds for the underlying level-3 BLAS 1992. One implication is that the block algorithms are as stable as the corresponding point algorithms when conventional BLAS3 are used. A second implication is that the use of BLAS3 based on fast matrix multiplication techniques affects the stability only insofar as it increases the constant terms in the normwise backward error bounds. For linear equation solvers employing LU factorization, it is shown that fixed precision iterative refinement helps to mitigate the effect of the larger error constants. Despite the positive results presented here, not all plausible block algorithms are stable; we illustrate this with the example of LU factorization with block triangular factors and describe how to check a block algorithm for stability without doing a full error analysis. © 1992, ACM.

GENCRAY is a code generator written in the C language for portability. GENCRAY defines a LISP-style input language that is translated into either FORTRAN 77 or CRAY FORTRAN. By defining its own input syntax, GENCRAY becomes a free-standing code translator that can be made to work with any symbolic manipulation system. GENCRAY is portable to any computer system with a standard C compiler. Input to GENCRAY can come from a file or directly from a symbolic system through a pipe. On UNIX systems with Berkeley networking, GENCRAY also runs as a network server. The input syntax is customizable to allow both Common and Franz LISP input styles. In addition to generating easily vectorizable CRAY FORTRAN code, GENCRAY also provides high-level, easy-to-use parallel programming macros to produce parallel code for the multiprocessor CRAY systems.

The problem statement may include simple bounds or more general linear constraints on the unknowns. The algorithm uses a trust-region defined by a box containing the current values of the unknowns. The objective function 1992 is allowed to increase at intermediate steps. These increases are allowed as long as our predictor indicates that a new set of best values exists in the trust-region. There is logic provided to retreat to the current best values, should that be required. The computations for the model-problem require a constrained nonlinear least-squares solver. This is done using a simpler version of the algorithm. In its present form the algorithm is effective for problems with linear constraints and dense Jacobian matrices.

By the technique known as automatic differentiation, theoretically exact results are obtained using numerical 1992 manipulation. The key ideas are a hyperpyramid data structure and a generalized Leibniz's rule. Any expression in n variables corresponds to a hyperpyramid array, in n-dimensional space, containing the numerical values of all unique partial derivatives (not wasting space on different permutations of derivatives). The arrays for simple expressions are combined by hyperpyramid operators to form the arrays for more complicated expressions. These operators are facilitated by a generalized Leibniz's rule which, given a product of multivariable functions, produces any partial derivative by forming the minimum number of products (between two lower partials) together with a product of binomial coefficients. The algorithms are described in abstract pseudo-code. A section on implementation shows how these ideas can be converted into practical and efficient programs in a typical computing environment.

The generalized inverse has numerous important applications such as regression analysis, filtering, optimization and, more recently, linear associative memories. In this latter application known as Distributed Associative Memory, stimulus vectors are associated with response vectors and the result of many associations is spread over the entire memory matrix, which is calculated as the generalized inverse. Addition/deletion of new associations requires recalculation of the generalized inverse, which becomes computationally costly for large systems. A better solution is to calculate the generalized inverse recursively. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the well known algorithm due to Rust et al.

It overcomes one of the main problems encountered in elementary mathematical functions computations: achieving last bit accuracy. The results obtained are correctly rounded for almost all arguement values. Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use “nonstandard tables,” which are different from the natural tables of equally spaced points in which the rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In order to achieve a small error we use the following idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in such a way that the table value 1991 will be very close to numbers which can be exactly represented by the computer (much closer than the usual double percision representation). Thus we were able to control the error introduced by the computer representation of real numbers and extended the accuracy without actually using extended precision arithmetic. © 1991, ACM.

The program decomposes the function into subexpressions which are recursively tested for intervals where they are undefined, negative, or fractional, or points where they equal zero. The intervals in which the subexpressions are undefined are then united to create the boundaries of the domain of definition of the whole function.

The first approach is to find an inclusion of the integrand, then integrate this inclusion to obtain an inclusion of the indefinite integral. Inclusions for the integrand may be obtained from Taylor polynomials, Tschebyscheff polynomials, or other approximating forms which have a known error term. The second approach finds an inclusion of the indefinite integral directly as a linear combination of function evaluations plus an interval-valued error term. This requires a self-validating form of a quadrature formula such as Gaussian quadrature. In either approach, composite formulae improve the accuracy of the inclusion. The result of the validated indefinite integration is an algorithm which may be represented as a character string, a subroutine in a high-level programming language such as Pascal-SC or Fortran, or as a collection of data. An example is given showing the application of validated indefinite integration in constructing a validated inclusion of the error function, erf(x). © 1989, ACM.

The local mesh-refinement method recursively divides the time step and spatial cells of the moving base mesh in regions where error indicators are high until a prescribed tolerance is satisfied. The static mesh-regeneration procedure is used to create a new base mesh when the existing one becomes too distorted.

However, high-order Runge-Kutta methods require more function evaluations per integration step than, for example, Adams methods used in PECE mode, and so, with RKMs, it is expecially important to avoid rejected steps. Steps are often rejected when certain derivatives of the solutions are very large for part of the region of integration. This corresponds, for example, to regions where the solution has a sharp front or, in the limit, some derivative of the solution is discontinuous. In these circumstances the assumption that the local truncation error is changing slowly is invalid, and so any step-choosing algorithm is likely to produce an unacceptable step. In this paper we derive a family of explicit Runge-Kutta formulas. Each formula is very efficient for problems with smooth solution as well as problems having rapidly varying solutions. Each member of this family consists of a fifty-order formula that contains imbedded formulas of all orders 1 through 4. By computing solutions at several different orders, it is possible to detect sharp fronts or discontinuities before all the function evaluations defining the full Runge-Kutta step have been computed. We can then either accpet a lower order solution or abort the step, depending on which course of action seems appropriate. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the DETEST test set as well as on some difficult test problems with sharp fronts or discontinuities. © 1990, ACM.

The Influence of Relaxed Supernode Partitions on the Multifrontal Method,1989,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024901312&doi=10.1145%2f76909.76910&partnerID=40&md5=507b9cab1a5e6c1e8b9a86dd60bd5062,"In this paper we present an algorithm for partitioning the nodes of a graph into supernodes, which improves the performance of the multifrontal method for the factorization of large, sparse matrices on vector computers. This new algorithm first partitions the graph into fundamental supernodes. Next, using a specified relaxation parameter, the supernodes are coalesced in a careful manner to create a coarser supernode partition. Using this coarser partition in the factorization generally introduces logically zero entries into the factor. This is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of sparse vector computations and data movement and an increase in the number of dense vector operations. The amount of storage required for the factor is generally increased by a small amount. On a collection of moderately sized 3-D structures, matrices speedups of 3 to 20 percent on the Cray X-MP are observed over the fundamental supernode partition which allows no logically zero entries in the factor. Using this relaxed supernode partition, the multifrontal method now factorizes the extremely sparse electric power matrices faster than the general sparse algorithm. In addition, there is potential for considerably reducing the communication requirements for an implementation of the multifrontal method on a local memory multiprocessor. © 1989, ACM.

We consider techniques for the adaptive refinement of triangulations used with the finite element method with piecewise linear functions. Several such techniques that differ mainly in the method for dividing triangles and the method for indicating which triangles have the largest error have been developed. We describe four methods for dividing triangles and eight methods for indicating errors. Angle bounds for the triangle division methods are compared. All combinations of triangle divisions and error indicators are compared in a numerical experiment using a population of eight test problems with a variety of difficulties (peaks, boundary layers, singularities, etc.). The comparison is based on the L-infinity norm of the error versus the number of vertices. It is found that all of the methods produce asymptotically optimal grids and that the number of vertices needed for a given error rarely differs by more than a factor of two. © 1989, ACM.

The RS method generates a new grid by recursively subdividing a rectangular domain. We use a heuristic approach which attempts to equidistribute a given density function over the domain. The resulting grid is used to generate an adaptive grid domain mapping (AGDM), which may be applied to transform the PDE problem to another coordinate system. The PDE is then solved in the transformed coordinate system using a uniform grid. We believe parallelism is most easily exploited when computations are carried out on uniform grids; the AGDM framework allows the power of adaptation to be applied while still preserving this uniformity. Our method generates good adaptive grid domain mappings at a small cost compared to the cost of the entire computation. We describe the RS algorithm in detail, briefly describe the AGDM framework, and illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme on several realistic test problems. © 1989, ACM.

Solving Systems of Nonlinear Equations Using the Nonzero Value of the Topological Degree,1988,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024141611&doi=10.1145%2f50063.214384&partnerID=40&md5=e6b21a8878221bc553a396fa02add530,"Two algorithms are described here for the numerical solution of a system of nonlinear equations <?Pub Fmt F(X)<?Pub Fmt = Θ, [formula omitted], and <?Pub Fmt F<?Pub Fmt is a given continuous mapping of a region [formula omitted] in [formula omitted] into [formula omitted]. The first algorithm locates at least one root of the sy stem within n-dimensional polyhedron, using the non zero value of the topological degree of F at θ relative to the polyhedron; the second algorithm applies a new generalized bisection method in order to compute an approximate solution to the system. Teh size of the original n-dimensional polyhedron is arbitrary, and the method is globally convergent in a residual sense. These algorithms, in the various function evaluations, only make use of the algebraic sign of F and do not require computations of the topological degree. Moreover, they can be applied to nondifferentiable continuous functions F and do not involve derivatives of F or approximations of such derivatives. © 1988, ACM.

Shepard's method for fitting a surface to data values at scattered points in the plane has the advantages of a small storage requirement and an easy generalization to more than two independent variables, but suffers from low accuracy and a high computational cost relative to some alternative methods. Localizations of this method have reasonably low computational costs, but remain relatively inaccurate. We describe a modified Shepard's method that, without sacrificing the advantages, has accuracy comparable to other local methods. Computational efficiency is also improved by using a cell method for nearest-neighbor searching. Test results for two and three independent variables are presented. © 1988, ACM.

Here A is assumed to be symmetric, and B symmetric positive definite. A combination of block Cholesky and block Householder transformations are used to reduce the problem to a symmetric banded eigenproblem whose eigenvalues can be computed in central memory. Inverse iteration is applied to the banded matrix to compute selected eigenvectors, which are then transformed back to eigenvectors of the original problem. This method is especially suitable for the solution of large eigenproblems arising in quantum physics, using a vector supercomputer with fast secondary storage device such as the Cray X-MP with SSD.

A key feature is that handlers are attached to operators that can raise exceptions (including user-defined functions and procedures, as well as built-in operators), rather than to expressions or statements. The programmer has a great deal of freedom in specifying what action is to be taken in case an exception arises.

Thus, a standard, or robust, or L1 regression algorithm is converted into the corresponding standard, or robust, or L1 orthogonal algorithm. Such orthogonal procedures are important for three basic reasons. First, they solve the classical errors-in-variables (EV) regression problem. Standard L2 orthogonal regression, obtained by converting ordinary least squares regression, is the maximum likelihood solution of the EV problem under Gaussian assumptions. However, this L2 solution is known to be unstable under even slight deviations from the model. Thus this routine's ability to create robust orthogonal regression algorithms from robust ordinary regression algorithms will also be very useful in practice. Second, orthogonal regression is intimately related to principal components procedures. Therefore, this routine can also be used to create corresponding L1, robust, etc., principal components algorithms. And third, orthogonal regression treats the x and y variables symmetrically. This is very important in many science and engineering modeling problems. Monte Carlo studies, which test the effectiveness of the routine under a variety of types of data, are given. © 1988, ACM.

However, no test has been done on the performance of some recently developed Rosenbrock codes in a situation in which the dimension of the system is large, for example, over one hundred equations.

The hybrid algorithm makes use of two families of univariate algorithms, one Karatsuba based and the other DFT based, which are applied recursively to solve the multivariate problem. The hybrid algorithm is adaptive in that particular univariate algorithms are selected at run time to minimize the time complexity; an order-of-magnitude speedup with respect to classical multiplication is achieved over the entire practical range except for very small problems. Empirical investigation shows that most of the theoretical superiority is maintained in actual implementation. The largest contribution to the space requirements of the total algorithm is determined by the univariate algorithm used for the outermost variable; except for quite small problems, selecting univariate algorithms to minimize run time almost always leads to situations where the space requirements of the total algorithm are extremely close to the space required merely to store the result. © 1987, ACM.

On threshold pivoting in the multifrontal method for sparse indefinite systems,1987,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023415779&doi=10.1145%2f29380.31331&partnerID=40&md5=c468ac8916c053e1ef1f942a1942399e,"A simple modification to the numerical pivot selection criteria in the multifrontal scheme of Duff and Reid for sparse symmetric matrix factorization is presented. For a given threshold value, the modification allows a broader choice of block 2 X 2 pivots owing to a less restrictive pivoting condition. It also extends the range of permissible threshold values from [0, 1/2) to [0, 0.6404). Moreover, the bound on element growth for stability consideration in the modified scheme is nearly the same as that of the original strategy. © 1987, ACM.

Space is subdivided into boxes of smallerand smaller diameter, and each subbox is tested for the existence of solutions by a test that eithereliminates it from further consideration or marks it for subdivision. Simple bisection uses a test forthe exclusion of subboxes, but no test that guarantees the existence of a unique solution in a subbox. Using this simple bisection, we show that the passed boxes tend to cluster in geometrical configurations whose number is stable under subdivision. This implies for many problems that the workrequired to do simple bisection may be prohibitive. However, improvements may be possible bygrouping clusters and dynamically redefining the box proportions. The restriction to second-degreesystems is sufficient to display this behavior. © 1987, ACM.

The concept of a model management system (MMS) is introduced and compared to traditional modeling systems. An MMS is seen as a much more generalized software system that requires the confluence of existing operations research, database management, and artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating powerful, abstraction-based representation structures, an MMS can support multiple levels of model abstraction, only one of which corresponds to traditional, solution-oriented modeling software. The database structures required to implement a knowledge-based MMS are discussed and a prototype system for mathematical programming, the Generalized eXperimental Math Programming system (GXMP), is described. An algebraic language developed for use in GXMP is described in detail. © 1986, ACM.

Extrapolation can be viewed as a variable order Runge-Kutta method. It is plausible that variation of order could lead to a much more efficient Runge-Kutta code, but numerical comparisons have been contradictory. We reconcile previous comparisons by exposing differences in testing methodology and incompatibilities of the implementations tested. An experimental Runge-Kutta code is compared to a state-of-the-art extrapolation code. With some qualifications, the extrapolation code shows no advantage. Extrapolation does not appear to be a particularly effective way to vary the order of Runge-Kutta methods. Although an acceptable way to solve nonstiff problems, our tests raise the question as to whether there is any point in pursuing it as a separate method. © 1986, ACM.

If the original system is positive, definite, and symmetric, so is the reduced system. It is solved in a second phase, and the remaining variables obtained through local back substitution in a third phase. With a sufficient number of processing elements, there is no first and third phase. We investigate the arithmetic and communicationcomplexity of Gaussian elimination and block cyclic reduction for the solution of the reduced system on boolean cubes, perfect shuffle and shuffle-exchange networks, binary trees, and linear arrays.

The four versions are very similar and each version implements one of the sets of CLMFs being studied. We compare the performance of these codes with that of a widely used code, LSODE. One of the new sets of CLMFs is not only much more efficient in solving stiff problems that have a Jacobian with eigenvalues close to the imaginary axis but is almost as efficient as LSODE in solving other problems.

An overview of the method is given for general domains, followed by a discussion of the improved efficiencies and simplifications possible for rectangular domains. A very-high-level description is given of three specific collocation algorithms that use Hermite bicubic basic functions, (1) GENCOL (collocation on general two-dimensional domains), (2) HERMCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with general linear boundary conditions), and (3) INTCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with uncoupled boundary conditions). The linear system resulting from INTCOL has half the bandwidth of that from HERMCOL, which provides substantial benefit in solving the system. We provide some examples showing the range of applicability of the algorithms and some performance profiles illustrating their efficiency. Fortran implementations of these algorithms are given in the companion papers [10, 11]. © 1985, ACM.

Special treatment of bound constraints in the implementation of a null-space active-set method yields significant advantages in computational effort and storage requirements. In this paper, we describe a particular implementation of the constraint-related steps of a null-space active-set method when the constraint matrix is dense and bounds are treated separately.

By treating quadras the generation and search of a tree whose nodes represent intervals, a unified nonalgorithmic framework is developed which encompasses both approaches. This framework provides a method for improving the numerical properties of local adaptive quadrature with respect to termination of intervals by relative error criteria, and total algorithm termination due to excessive function evaluations. The framework also suggests heuristics for interval selection in global adaptive quadrature that bring the actual error closer to the requested tolerance. Extensive computational experience with several heuristics for global adaptive quadrature is described. © 1984, ACM.

Calculations of the results of operators or functions apphed to GRADIENT variables are carried out according to the well-known rules for evaluation and differentiation of sums, differences, products, and so on. Since the differentiation is performed at compile time, the code produced is comparable in compactness and execution time to that obtained if numerical approximations are used for derivatives, and the theoretical and practical problems associated with numerical differentiation are avoided. Pascal-SC source code is given for the necessary operators and standard functions, and it is shown how to prepare code for arbitrary differentiable functions to add to the hbrary if desired. The effectiveness of the use of type GRADIENT is shown by an example of the solution of a system of nonlinear equations by Newton's method.

The purpose of NITREE is to convert a decision tree or flowcharts into a format that may be transmitted to a user at a computer terminal. The actual transmission is performed by the companion routine NIT. By responding at the terminal to the questions displayed in NIT, the user is guided through the corresponding path in the tree.

Significance arithmetic takes into account the inexactness of the operands of a calculation, but can lead to loss of significant digits after a long senes of operations. A new technique is described which alleviates the overhead of multiple-precision arithmetic by allowing nonsignificant digits to be discarded, while limiting the significance loss per operation to a controllable and acceptable rate. The technique IS based on storing an inexact number as an interval, usmg a criterion of significance to determine the precision with which the limits of the interval should be stored. A procedure referred to as a significance rule uses this criterion to remove some of the nonsignificant digits from the limits of an interval prior to storage. A certain number of nonsigmficant digits are retained as guard digits. Calculations are performed using exact interval arithmetic and the significance-rule procedure is invoked after each operation to remove superfluous digits. Round-off in the procedure causes a slight increase in the interval width on each operation. This results in a cumulative loss of significance at a rate related to the number of guard digits. © 1984, ACM.

On vector machmes it is not immediately obvious, if sufficient memory is available, whether one should treat banded matrices as dense matrices and use algorithms that have vector operations, or take advantage of the band structure of the problem. Most of the algorithms for banded matrices are chasing schemes in which unwanted elements are flushed out the bottom of the matrix using planar similarity transformations. We show that it is possible to chase several elements simultaneously down the matrix and to use vectorhke operations to compute the planar transformations and to apply the transformations. The length of the vectors depends on the ratio of the dimension of the problem and the bandwidth. For large problems with narrow bandwidths, it is definitely advantageous to use these new algorithms. © 1984, ACM.

The user specifies an accuracy parameter and the method attempts to produce a solution consistent with this accuracy requirement. The relationship between the global error in the numerical solution and the prescribed accuracy requirement IS problem dependent and very difficult to quantify precisely. On the other hand, most variable-order Adams methods provide the user with a piecewise polynomial approximanon to the solution and use this to provide mtermediate solutions at specified output points. Since the piecewise polynomial IS dtfferentiable at all but a fimte number of points, one can define the defect of the numerical solution as the amount by which the piecewise polynomial fails to satisfy the differential equation The maximum magnitude of the defect can then be used as a measure of the accuracy of the solution and, smce the defect can be shown to be directly related to the local error, it provides a measure of accuracy that is relatively msensitrve to the specific problem.

Concepts using linear digital convolution are introduced, where Bessel function evaluations are not required. Related convolution is defined over a set of transforms whose integrands are related algebraically. Given any transform argument range, fast lagged convolution is performed m place within a predeslgned digital filter By arranging related and lagged convolutions m matrix form, a whole matrix of complex Hankel transforms is evaluated with a minimum of integrand function calls. For each point in the matrix, an adaptive convolution algorithm (based on function behavior and a given truncation tolerance) further reduce unnecessary evaluations along the decreasing digital-filter tails. The class of mtegrands (excluding the Bessel factor) must be continuous monotonic decreasing complex (or real) functions of a real variable defined in (0, oo). Higher integerorder Hankel transforms may be expressed in terms of orders 0 and 1 by recursion, and can be rapidly evaluated by related convolution. Several elementary and practical examples are given to demonstrate convolution accuracy and efficiency (m terms of total functmn evaluations), where minimum relatwe errors are approximately 10 -s using 32-bit floating-point words. (A double-precision real version is also provided, which yields minimum relative errors approximately 10-12.) Some suggestions are made for future algorithm enhancements.

It supplements a mathematical programming system to fullfill some of the functions of Computer-Assisted Analysis (CAA): documentation/verification, debugging, interpreting results, simplification, and sensitivity analysis. These functions are described and illustrated with the ANALYZE commands used to assist the analysis. (The language ofANALYZE is mterpretIve, similar to Its predecessor system, PERUSE.) Beginning with perspectives of the anatomy of a model, the ANALYZE aids for verification and documentation are described and applied to models used by the Energy Information Admmistration (EIA). Then, extensions of conventional sensitivity analysis in hnear programming are described, based upon the digraph of a linear program's matrix. With the structural descnption that Includes path tracing the next CAA function is model simphfication. Two approaches are described. dimensional reduction and search for embedded structures, notably netforms. Throughout the paper the ANALYZE system is illustrated and its commands, hsted in the appendix, are apphed to real cases.

To help assess their practical value, the author wrote an item of mathematical software based on one such formula. This required a variety of algorithmic and software developments Those of general interest are reported in this paper Among them is a way to select automatically, at every step, an explicit Runge-Kutta formula or a Rosenbrock formula according to the stiffness of the problem. Solving linear systems is important to methods for stiff ODEs and is rather special for Rosenbrock methods. A cheap, effective estimate of the condition of the linear systems is derived.

A portable translator program accepts statements of the system of differential equations and produces a portable FORTRAN object code which is then run to solve the system. At each step of the integration, the object program generates the series for each component of the solution, analyzes that series to determine the optimal step, and extends the solution by analytic continuation. The translator is easy to use, yet it is powerful and flexible. The computer time required by this approach consists of time to run the translator plus time to run the object code, CPU time and storage requirements depend on the size and complexity of the system of ODEs.

The model involves only simple familiar concepts, expressed in a small set of environment parameters. Using these, both a program and its documentation can tailor themselves to the host computer. First, the model numbers, a conventional four-parameter system of floating-point numbers, are introduced. The parameters are the base, the precision, and the minimum and maximum exponents. They must be chosen so that the result of a basic arithmetic operation on model numbers is no less accurate than the result that would be obtained by chopped arithmetic in the model system. Also, the result of a basic operation on operands between model numbers must be bounded by the results of the same operation on the neighboring model numbers. These ideas are summarized in a few fundamental axioms, which enable the machine-independent properties of numerical programs to be stated and proved. The main conclusion is that the model supports conventional, worst case, forward or backward error analyses with only minor qualifications. The model is simple in the sense that its axioms are more easily stated and understood than the detailed operational rules of most floating-point processors. It is realistic in the sense that real computers exhibit most of the forms of behavior (or misbehavior) that it allows, but nearly always conform to its rules. © 1981, ACM.

The step choice algorithm is based on minimizing a local quadratic model of the sum of squares ftmctmn constrained to an elhptmal trust regmn centered at the current approximate minimizer This is accomphshed using ideas chscussed by Mor6, together with a special module for assessing the quahty of the step thus computed. These and other ideas behind NL2SOL are discussed, and its evolution and current implementation are also described briefly. © 1981, ACM.

Control of Interpolatory Error in Retarded Differential Equations,1981,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019656607&doi=10.1145%2f355972.355974&partnerID=40&md5=01e582a8bb3949f145919953c88f06f8,"The numerical solution of several large subclasses of functional differential equations requires interpolation over the discrete history of the solution. For example, interpolation is required to evaluate retarded arguments in FDEs with lags or perform quadrature in integrodifferential equations. The interpolatory process can be severely hampered by naturally occurring derivative discontinuities at possibly unknown points. In this work the class of retarded ordinary differential equations (RODEs) with state-dependent lags is considered. For such equations the propagation of derivative discontinuities has been completely characterized as the zeros of odd multiplicity of certain nonlinear equations involving the solution. It has been shown elsewhere that under liberal hypotheses these propagated zeros can be successively calculated to an (order of) accuracy that will preserve high-order convergence whenever the calculated (approximate) zeros are included in the integration mesh. This result depends on a key relation between the order of the discontinuous derivative and the multiplicity of the corresponding jump-point zero. Unfortunately, in vector equations the bookkeeping and overhead logic involved in solving these nonlinear equations is at best onerous. Another approach is to employ an automatic step-selection algorithm and to depend on the error control process to sense discontinuities and thereby use sufficiently small steps in the neighborhood of discontinuities to prevent large degradation in accuracy. It was conjectured elsewhere that this process of “ignoring the jump points” would not prevent a previously reported algorithm from obtaining the solution to the requested accuracy. In this work it is shown that the conjecture is dramatically false. The issue of derivative discontinuities as discussed is not peculiar to retarded differential equations. With proper interpretation these results also apply to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is shown that the detection of derivative discontinuities is not always reliable. Two methods are analyzed: the Merson method and the more popular Runge-Kutta Fehlberg (4, 5) formulas. It should be emphasized that the intent of using two methods is to illustrate that the conclusions are not peculiar to just one method. There is no intent to compare their relative performance in this discontinuous setting. Finally, an approach (also applicable to ODEs) is proposed that does not require the user to keep track of the potential cascade of jump points that occurs in RODEs or to be directly involved in setting up and/or solving the nonlinear jump-point equations. An error-control algorithm that estimates the. effects of a discontinuity through interpolation is suggested. Results are given using these modifications. © 1981, ACM.

In keeping with this requirement, we selectn, the integer closest to x within the constraint N ≤ n ≤ N + M - 1, and use E,(x) to start the recursion E,(x) Is computed by means of the power series on 0 - x : 2 and the confluent hypergeometnc function U(n, n, x) on 2 < x < 0. U(n, n, x) is, in turn, computed from the backward recurswe Miller algorithm for U(n + k, n, x), k = 0, 1,…, with a normalizing relatmn derived from the two-term recursmn relation satisfied by E,(x) and E,+l(x).

The algorithm is based on a sequence of similarity transformations and successive range-nullspace separations, following a suggestion by Kublanovskaya.

The current contents of the chapter are dmcussed in detail, with emphasis on the overall design of the chapter and on the design of the individual routines in the Runge-Kutta section. This section and the Adams and backward differentmtion formula sections were all designed to simplify switching between calls to routines m the different sectmns. Within each sectmn there is a main routine with a number of novel interrupt features and also a collection of driver routines which exploit these interrupts. Each of these routines has essentially the same calling sequence as the corresponding routine in the other sections. To achieve this standardization between sections of the chapter, It was necessary to provide an intermediate output facility for the Runge- Kutta routine. The implementation of this novel facility IS discussed in some detail. Also discussed in a new test used in a Runge-Kutta routine to determine whether a differential system is stiff. The same routine independently calculates global error estimates. Finally, plans for the immediate future development of the chapter are outlined. © 1979, ACM.

The cost of the matrLx operations in the iteration scheme of these methods can be quite high. A new iteration scheme is developed which exploits the structure of the system and also allows fast updating of the iteration matrix after a stepsize or order change. The technique is particularly useful when the stiffness is due to only a few components of a large system, and is applicable to most methods for stiff systems. It is based on an automatic partitioning of the system into subsystems corresponding to stiff and nonstiff parts. This partitioning is then exploited in the solution of the system of equations that must be solved on each time step. © 1979, ACM.

In this way, roughly speaking, one attempts to minimize the number of steps, Le., to select the largest possible stepsize according to a prescribed error tolerance. Very often, however, the selectmn of the stepsize depends not so much on the accuracy requirements but rather on the absolute stabdlty properties of the formulas included in the particular VSVFM. Therefore, at least for problems where the absolute stability requirements dominate the accuracy requirements, it Is unportant to use only formulas with the best possible absolute stability characteristics in the VSVFM. Moreover, it is important to find an algorithm which predicts the largest possible stepslzes so that the next steps will be successful (the local truncation error estimator is enurely unable to do this when the absolute stability requirements are dominant).

This paper is concerned with the application of a given set of Householder transformations to a sparse matrLx X. Normally, the application of the first transformation rmns the zero structure of X. Despite this fact it is shown that the transformed matrix has some algebraic structure which might be exploited. Algorithms are given which exploit this structure during computation of the orthogonal decomposition of a matrix, the null space of a matrix, and the singular value decomposition of a matrix. © 1979, ACM.

For the prognostic equations the I/O can easily be limited to reading and writing the data once for each time step. A method which reduces the size of the Poisson system to one that can be core contained is required in order to calculate the Poisson equation along with the prognostic equations without increasing the I/O. Using Hockney's Fourier analysis/cyclic reduction (FACR) to reduce and solve the Poisson equation, the entire convection problem can be solved by reading and writing the data only once every time step.

The package is carefully designed to be reliable and robust and to provide high performance; hence it is highly machine dependent. Nevertheless, it is available for three lines of large scale computers. The package is organized into small packets of computationally related subroutines with only one entry point each, together with a separate error handling packet containing all I/O statements. This organization promotes compatibility with a large community of operating systems on a given machine line and localizes the changes necessary for use with variant operating systems. Sophisticated error monitoring facilities are provided, but they employ appropriate default conventions so that casual users need not be concerned with them. Although programming for all machines was done at one central location, tuning tests were run at remote sites. Additional field testing was done at computing centers representing a variety of hardware-software configurations for the three machine lines before the package was released for general distribution. © 1975, ACM.

Comments on the Nature of Automatic Quadrature Routines,1976,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0016930848&doi=10.1145%2f355666.355671&partnerID=40&md5=f052a9c2af6eff3699f0a231bf5c6bc0,"General properties of automatic quadrature routines are described, and the conflict between reliablhty and economy whmh arises when one constructs such a routine is discussed m detail. The concept of the “performance profile” is introduced; this serves as an aid understanding how such routines may fail for some problems and why the cost IS so much higher than in a nonautomatic routine. The relationship (often tenuous) between analytic results from numerical analysis relating to quadrature rules and the actual strategy used in these routines is discussed. Attention is drawn to the fact that an automatm quadrature routine is based on an unrehable exact arithmetic algorithm and, unlike simpler routines, is not based on a finite decision process. In this paper, those aspects of automatm quadrature routines which are relevant in the context of testing routines are gathered together as an introduction to forthcoming specific testing techmques. © 1976, ACM.

This paper presents a useful and reliable software interface which can ehminate much of the expensive and time consuming effort involved in the solution of nonlinear PDEs. The software interface provides centered differencing in the spatial variable for time dependent nonlinear PDEs, giving a semidlscrete system of nonhnear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which are then solved using one of the recently developed robust ODE integrators. Besides being portable, efficient, and easy to use, the software interface along with an ODE integrator will discretize the problem, select the time step and order, solve the nonlinear equations (checking for convergence, etc.), and maintain a user specified time integration accuracy, all automatically and reliably.

The algorithms are suitable for computers such as ILLIAC IV and CDC STAR. For array computers slmdar to ILLIAC IV, the cychc odd-even reduction algorithm has the least operation count for highly structured sets of equations, and the recursive doubling algorithm has the least count for relatively unstructured sets of equations. Since the difference in operation counts for these two algorithms is not substantial, their relative running times may be more related to overhead operations, which are not measured in this paper. The third algorithm, based on Buneman's Poisson solver, has more arithmetic operations than the others and appears to be the least favorable. For pipeline computers similar to CDC STAR, the cychc odd-even reduction algorithm appears to be the most preferable algorithm for all cases. When the tridiagonal system satisfies a strong diagonal dominance condition, the intermediate values computed by the cychc odd-even reduction algorithm form a rapidly convergent sequence, and thus the algorithm can be terminated early when values are correct to within machine accuracy. The convergence is linear until off-diagonal terms fall below one-third the magnitude of the diagonal element, at which pomt the convergence becomes quadratic. The quadratic convergence is superior to the linear convergence reported by Traub for several parallel lteratlve tndmgonal solvers. © 1975, ACM.

By using the optimization function described, the user may simply supply symbolic expressions for the objective function and constraints. The function then automatically (1) converts inequality constraints to equality constraints by the addition of squared slack variables; (2) uses Lagrange multipliers and symbolic differentiation to form simultaneous equations satisfied by all stationary points; and (3) uses algebraic manipulation to attempt solution of these possibly nonlinear equations. If solutions are found, the function uses algebraic manipulation to derive a symbolic Hessian matrix, which is used in a second-order test to determine whether the stationary point is a minimum, a saddle, or a maximum. Alternatively, the user may first reduce the size of the problem by using built-in functions (4) to make changes of the variable to eliminate certain inequality constraints; (5) to analyze a set of problems where each possible active set of inequality constraints is treated as equality constraints, with the other inequality constraints ignored, checking each stationary point for violation of the ignored constraints; (6) to use some or all of the equality constraints to eliminate some of the unbounded variables from the other constraints and from the objective function. The effectiveness of these techniques is compared, and results are presented for some of the standard test cases used for numerical optimization programs. © 1975, ACM.

Usage and Argument Monitoring of Mathematical Library Routines,1975,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976759284&doi=10.1145%2f355644.355646&partnerID=40&md5=79a427a7bd5a92b69caa2a7a264c8486,"Usage of mathematical library (MATHLIB) routines on the Control Data 6600 system at Sandia Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, has been momtored for over three years. The value of one input argument during the first execution of each library routine in each job along with the identification number of the user has been monitored for about two years. The selection and implementation of the method used for monitoring and the impact of monitoring on the user and on the system are discussed. The significance of the usage data is discussed for several actual applications, and additional possible uses of the data and planned extensions of monitoring are mentioned. © 1975, ACM.

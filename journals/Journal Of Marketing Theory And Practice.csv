"How, when, and why do stores’ humor climates affect retail customer purchase?","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134595285&doi=10.1080%2f10696679.2022.2080712&partnerID=40&md5=ea7a6854e966de7ba0c6155562316e3a","This study examines the influence of affiliative and aggressive humor climate levels and variability of humor climates on customer purchase, and the mediating effect of customer perceptions of service quality on such relationships. Sixty-seven store managers assessed 615 employees’ use of humor, while 3533 customers were surveyed to assess the quality of service received and their purchase behavior. Results show that a high affiliative humor climate was associated with a decrease in customer perceptions of service quality when variability in this humor usage was low in stores. Furthermore, high usage of aggressive humor was associated with a decrease in customer purchase. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"An exploration of first-time dads’ sharenting with social media marketers: implications for children’s online privacy","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123773337&doi=10.1080%2f10696679.2021.2024441&partnerID=40&md5=ed0a1d1a425e0ab45a4c0646d5fee089","This paper explores first-time dads’ (FTDs) decisions to engage in sharenting, or posting information about one’s child on social media, as marketers seek to connect with new parents via engagement tactics that prompt sharenting. We report survey results for 75 FTDs and eight semi-structured interviews from a separate FTD group. We find that FTDs are likely to perceive their own and their child’s information as sensitive yet be willing to share it with marketers when prompted. Marketers should appeal to FTDs’ role as “Involved Protector” via protecting their child’s digital footprint. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Brand authenticity: literature review, comprehensive definition, and an amalgamated scale","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123772763&doi=10.1080%2f10696679.2021.2018937&partnerID=40&md5=d5bd02a509fec2f027c4f5f380315088","Amidst a rapidly changing marketplace, sharp behavioral changes, and increased social media usage, brand authenticity, already an important attribute, has become an essential asset for brands. Even though marketing researchers have been studying the topic for more than 25 years, our extensive literature review shows that a widely accepted definition and scale is still lacking. Many extant definitions and scales only address specific aspects of brand authenticity, thus only providing partial coverage. This paper proposes a new definition and amalgamated scale that addresses authenticity holistically in a germane/relatable manner. The disjointed, and often dated, extant definitions and scales require a re-conceptualization of brand authenticity to meet the needs of today’s consumer in relevant, meaningful manner. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

However, the literature focusing on the antecedents and outcomes of brand love in collaborative consumption is not well documented. Drawing on value co-creation theory, this paper has developed and tested a model capturing the role of brand love with data collected from Airbnb consumers. The results from 380 Airbnb consumers show that consumer brand engagement, perceived authenticity, and value co-creation are key drivers of consumer’s love of Airbnb. Brand love then positively influences consumers’ intention to revisit Airbnb. However, consumer brand engagement does not directly affect revisit intention. The paper concludes with theoretical and managerial implications. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Drawing on the theoretical framework of regulatory focus, we conducted three experiments to explore these dynamics. The findings reveal that individuals primed with promotion focus display a higher likelihood of choosing an option when presented with a separate evaluation than those with prevention focus. Conversely, in joint evaluation mode, the pattern reverses. Specifically, activating promotion orientation renders individuals more susceptible to an attractive yet risky (extreme) option. Conversely, when a prevention orientation is activated, individuals tend to avoid extreme options and gravitate toward a low-risk, low-return option or even abstain from making a choice altogether. Joint evaluation mode effectively facilitates promotion-focused individuals in selecting an attractive but extreme option, whereas it prompts prevention-focused individuals to opt for a compromise option. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between regulatory orientation and evaluation mode in shaping consumer decision-making processes. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Three studies were conducted using undergraduate students and Amazon MTurk samples (n = 416). The results demonstrate that benign envy and wishful identification mediate the relationship between followers’ materialism and their purchase intention, and malicious envy moderates the mediating effect of wishful identification. As the first research that empirically tested the effects of followers’ benign envy, wishful identification, and malicious envy toward influencers, this paper provides a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind the intricate relationship between materialism and purchase intention in the context of influencer marketing. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In such situations, salesforce change agility can be a key to success. However, scant research has examined the factors that promote the development of change agility, or the consequences thereof. We address these notable omissions by using a sample of 237 B2B salespeople to explore the effect of idiosyncratic deals on work absorption, change agility, behavioral performance, and sales performance. The findings indicate that a salesperson’s idiosyncratic work arrangements (i.e. Flexibility and Development Idiosyncratic Deals) enhance work absorption, which in turn increases salesperson change agility. Moreover, we find that while development idiosyncratic deals are positively related to change agility, flexibility idiosyncratic deals do not impact change agility. Finally, our analysis also shows that change agility is positively related to behavioral performance, with subsequent downstream effects on sales performance. Collectively, these findings offer a glimpse into the importance of agile behaviors as salespeople deal with the changes impacting the sales function. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

We investigate a multidimensional structure of brand coolness and show how it mediates the effects of product quality on word of mouth communication and on intentions to buy/use cool brands. We also demonstrate under what conditions brand coolness influences WOM and intentions. The self-concept, rooted in materialism and expressed as the desire to impress other people and to compare oneself to others so as to emulate them, serves to regulate the effects of brand coolness in a negative way on WOM and intentions, thereby fulfilling the autonomous function of brand coolness for consumers described in the past as one important aspect of brand coolness. In order to show the incremental contribution of brand coolness in predicting WOM and decisions to buy/use cool brands, the effects of brand coolness are tested in head-to-head comparisons with the influence of self-brand connections and attitudes toward cool brands, which are classically studied brand drivers, on a representative sample of 400 adult Americans aged 20–40 years inclusive. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Using the attractiveness of alternatives as a moderator, this study aims to determine how users’ perceptions of app quality affect their propensity to use the app in the future through measures of performance confirmation and trust. The study analyzed the 435 acceptable responses using a hybrid approach incorporating partial least squares structural equation modeling and deep learning (artificial neural network). Results showed that utilitarian and hedonic performance confirmation and trust drive the use of retail apps. Service and information qualities validate trust and utilitarian and hedonic performance confirmation. System quality solely influences utilitarian performance confirmation. The attractiveness of alternatives adversely moderates utilitarian performance confirmation and continuation intention. The novel theoretical model integrating stimulus–organism–reaction model and information system success model reveals the relative importance of specific aspects, providing a better understanding of retail app users’ continuation intention. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Earlier literature on brand engagement suggests that BESC not only influences different consumer response variables, generating mixed outcomes and questionable results, but also plays a mediating role in connecting constructs. The authors extend this line of literature by (1) developing a theoretical framework that includes the influence of materialism and consumer age on consumer response variables through BESC, (2) analyzing the antecedents and consequences of BESC, and (3) testing specific moderators that influence the effect sizes involving BESC. In terms of data collection and analyses, the authors present a meta-analysis of 40 studies that generate 449 effects with 142,808 respondents. To test the theoretical mediating framework, the authors convert all effect sizes in a covariance matrix and use structural equation modeling for estimating the mediating effect of BESC on consumer response. Findings suggest that the indirect effect of materialism and age boost loyalty, behavioral intention, and interactivity through BESC. Second, BESC positively increases the levels of attitude, shopping behavior, quality, and status. Third, our moderating analyses reveal that type of good (product vs. service), type of respondent (students vs. non-students), and data collection mode (online vs. face-to-face) interact with BESC in explaining other variables. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

However, there is a paucity of research exploring the distribution and impact of emotional content in “online” consumer reviews (OCRs). Hence, in this study, an attempt is made to examine the emotional content in OCRs and to study the influence of discrete positive and negative emotions on the perceived OCR helpfulness, by classifying them based on their valence and arousal. Further, the impact of the inconsistency between the star rating of a review and the qualitative review-related factors (i.e. emotions and valence) is analyzed.

When organizational leaders establish diversity goals, they frequently rely on internal marketing teams to implement them. Internal Marketing’s ability to influence Diversity Outcomes and Self-Rated Employee Performance may differ due to the moderating effects of the organization’s Diversity Ecosystem. The Diversity Ecosystem is a novel construct that involves an employee’s interpretation of an organization’s openness, aspects of organizational justice and voice.

Practitioners and scholars are focusing on the power of social media to affect change, and the popular press has begun to refer to entrepreneurs as influencers and influencers as entrepreneurs. As such, the current research examines the power of influence in terms of influential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial influencers. Influential entrepreneurs have the power to encourage others to believe in themselves and to ignite passion for personal success, while also garnering support for their own ventures. Entrepreneurial influencers generally begin as marketing influencers who develop a following on a digital platform and then begin to build their own entrepreneurial endeavors by promoting to their followers. We contribute to the entrepreneurial marketing literature by bringing together similar, yet disparate, research to understand people identified as both influencers and entrepreneurs and suggest that influential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial influencers are not two sides of the same coin. While both possess characteristics of attractiveness and the ability to connect people and communities, findings suggest that influential entrepreneurs are perceived as more credible than entrepreneurial influencers.

Specifically, the sense of immersion significantly mediates the effect of input devices on consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions for high haptic products. In contrast, the mediating effect of the sense of immersion becomes weaker for low haptic products. These findings make important theoretical contributions to the HCI and touch literature.

In the literature, a positive link has been found between value co-creation and firm performance. However, the impact of sales team value co-creation on performance has been largely unexplored. This study explores drivers of value co-creation by sales teams and its performance outcomes, with market turbulence as a contingency factor. Using a sample of 201 salespeople in 24 sales teams, the results indicate that when sales teams co-create value with customers, they can increase their sales performance. This effect is magnified when sales teams are working with customers operating in turbulent environments. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

While existing research reveals a relationship between upward social comparisons and compensatory consumption, there has been minimal focus on how BOP consumers react to such comparisons. By conducting multiple studies targeting low-income but educated employees of different organizations, this research demonstrates that BOP consumers engage in conspicuous consumption behavior; in particular, they prefer conspicuous material goods when undergoing reference group comparisons (both upward and downward), which is a marked contrast from their more affluent peers and the western population. Furthermore, while incidental envy explains the underlying mechanism of the relationship between upward reference group comparison and conspicuous material consumption, anxiety is the mediator between downward reference group comparison and conspicuous material consumption for BOP consumers. Overall, this research significantly contributes to the BOP and compensatory consumption literature and has managerial implications for marketers serving BOP markets. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Extant studies exploring the consequences of corporate environmentalism predominantly measured its effects on firm performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study thus far has explored whether or not the key pro-environmental initiatives pertaining to corporate environmentalism carried out by industrial firms have any effect on market-based assets, namely, brand value. This study endeavored to address this gap in the literature. Drawing on natural resource-based view of the firm (NRBV), this study argued that industrial firms committed to corporate environmentalism reap rewards in the form of higher brand value. This study investigated three salient areas of corporate environmentalism, namely, environmental innovation, efficiency in using natural resources and emission reduction. The findings of this research demonstrate that industrial firms that outperform in environmental innovation, use fewer natural resources, and reduce emission have a higher brand value. Interestingly, while environmental innovation and efficiency in using natural resources contribute fairly equally to brand value, ability to reduce emissions contributes the least to brand value creation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Some emotional antecedents of FOMO, such as anticipated elation and anticipated envy from other people, can boost FOMO. Other emotional antecedents, such as comforting rationalizations, can decrease FOMO. Because FOMO can influence consumers’ experience-related attitudes and behaviors meaningfully, it behooves marketing scholars and practitioners to understand FOMO and the potential of FOMO-laden appeals to increase sales. Although social scientists generally treat FOMO as a personality trait, FOMO-laden appeals that extol the future experiences of close friends or family members can induce a FOMO spike. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Our study employs an inductive approach to understand how firms relying on deep personal relationships between salespeople and customers manage the succession process. Interviews with 41 managers in the financial services sector and 12 financial industry experts reveal a customer-engagement paradox where an element often considered essential to sales success–a high level of salesperson-customer affinity developed through successful customer engagement–becomes the proximate cause of impediments in sustaining the relationship post-succession. Our study indicates when deeply engaged salespeople are simply replaced on a one-to-one basis, firms may encounter a high incidence of failure and significant risk to client relationships. Thus, we suggest sales leader succession is more appropriately viewed as a function of long-term relationship management strategy and presents an opportunity for strategic adjustment of the sales function. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Recent studies show that there is a strong research interest in developing analytical models to increase the firms’ profit, by considering either key variables of specific advertising forms in isolation or cross-channel effects of online and offline channels. This article proposes a new analytical model, which assumes a trade-off between concurrent online marketing channels. Despite their different models, search engines and e-commerce platforms can be seen as competing in the same market when they are targeting the same set of consumers. Accordingly, advertisers need to constantly analyze which of the online activities perform better and why. The proposed model aims at capturing the main parameters a firm should carefully master in order to assess the effectiveness of alternative online channels in a comparative perspective, by suggesting the maximum cost per click that a firm should pay to benefit from search engine marketing, as much as from e-commerce platform. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Consumer forgiveness seeking is conceptualized as a face management strategy adopted by FLEs to facilitate face restoration for consumers who suffered a loss of face due to deficiency in services provided by the FLEs, and for prevention of further face loss for FLEs who have faced consumer anger provoked by deficient services. Post-consumer forgiveness, FLEs experience positive emotions which have a constructive impact on their work attitudes and behavior. Consumer forgiveness seeking is revealed to be interwoven with power distance, the subjugation of self and mythical autonomy of FLEs. Qualitative research has been undertaken using the critical incident technique.

An experimental study using a consumer panel demonstrates that inducing imagery–by instructing participants that the pretest ad is a draft–increases pretest scores. This imagery effect, however, depends on participants’ level of product involvement. Low-involvement participants, who lack a schema around the product, are more susceptible to imagery effects when evaluating animatics; high-involvement participants, who have a schema around the product, are more susceptible to imagery effects when evaluating a finished ad. Furthermore, a moderated mediation test supports a categorization tension process by showing that the conditional effects of imagery on pretest scores were fully explained by ad credibility.

We conducted an online survey among 990 people, and we tested the structural path relationships using AMOS. The results show that, first, status consumption and conspicuous consumption relate to perceived symbolic status. Second, the product symbolic status of the self relates to the product symbolic status of others. Third, the average product symbolic status of the self is higher than the average of the product symbolic status of others. Finally, when consumers are susceptible to normative interpersonal influences, they are more susceptible to status consumption and conspicuous consumption. Thus, consumers have a higher tendency to attribute the symbolic status of self to product and brand use than others.

More elaboration by multiple-brand consumers for their current brand choice increases the likelihood of future switching, whereas single-brand consumers are unaffected. For single-brand consumers, need for cognition decreases switching intent under high elaboration conditions, whereas multiple-brand consumers are unaffected. Lastly, the effect of cognitive processing on brand switching is greater for single-brand consumers for high elaboration advertisements, and greater for multiple-brand consumers for low elaboration advertisements.

The issues identified include limited academic access to the original methodology/data underlying a managerial practice, different vocabularies used by academics and practitioners, the inability of academics to disprove unfalsifiable claims, and the lack of any precise specification of theory. Finally, academics’ failure to pay detailed attention to dependent variables leads to confused messages being sent to managers.

The perceived possibility of overspending mediates the impact of temporal frames on purchase intentions. However, the impact of temporal frames on purchase intentions is pronounced only if consumers’ budgeted amounts are small, alternative temporal frames are not salient, and consumers have low self-control.

Older white male consumers have significantly more positive attitudes toward products endorsed by white celebrities versus black celebrities while young males make no such distinction.

Specifically, when a failure has low controllability, consumers are more forgiving when it is attributed to an individual service provider than when it is attributed to a service enabling organization. Empathy toward the service provider explains the increased forgiveness. However, no difference in forgiveness is observed in the case of highly controllable failures, irrespective of the source of attribution.

In particular, it examines the impact of a proenvironmental demarketing effort which calls attention to potential electricity saving ideas, on perceptions, and consumption. A pair of cross-validated studies indicates that proenvironmental demarketing may enhance consumers’ perceptions of the firm and subsequently affect consumption behavior. Specifically, study one suggests that proenvironmental demarketing leads to enhanced perception of an organization’s trustworthiness, market orientation, and environmental-sensitivity, while study two indicates that proenvironmental demarketing may lead to a reduction in electricity consumption.

For example, how will laptop owners evaluate a configuration that increases (decreases) processing speed but shortens (lengthens) battery life? The overall findings show that when provided with a subsequent opportunity to alter their initial choices, customers who initially choose an extreme option, in which the level of one attribute dominates another, subsequently prefer configurations that increase the level of their secondary attribute at the expense of their dominant attribute. This occurs because of an asymmetric assessment of perceived gains and losses. ©, Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This study investigates altruistic punishment from consumers in contexts of service recovery. Two experiments were conducted by adapting the structure of the Ultimatum Game to consumer situations. It was possible to identify altruistic punishment through perceptions of injustice in the form of a rejection of a company’s proposal for recovery combined with retaliation. From the findings, it is evident that attention to altruistic punishment in a consumption scenario is advisable, as its occurrence is costly for consumers and businesses.

Using commitment theory and an experimental design, this study determines that calculative commitment, power asymmetry, and various forms of loyalty commitment have significant decision-making impacts. With greater power asymmetry, calculative commitment exerts a stronger impact than comprehensive loyalty commitment; in low power asymmetry conditions, comprehensive loyalty commitment has more impact.

Two factorial experiments are conducted to study how marketers can influence consumers' preferences between a product and price bundle in an efficient choice set by manipulating the choice context. Results suggest that reference and price framing shift preferences in favor of the product bundle, and the two framing effects interact synergistically.

For this reason, theory about LWT has been almost exclusively developed in the sales literature. The current literature has largely assumed that lone Wolfism is an innate characteristic, and results have been mixed with regard to the relationship between LWT and sales performance. This study considers an alternative to this prevailing assumption and proposes a nurture model of LWT in which one's level of exposure to social workplace interactions (i.e., social comparison and career mentoring) may influence LWT. Our research questions are tested in a sample of 279 business-to-business (B2B) and business-toconsumer (B2C) salespeople using structural equation modeling. Results support our social learning-based hypotheses and reveal a positive association between LWT and job involvement and performance via the mechanism of concern over mistakes.

In this paper, we explore both the motivation (i.e., why people process choice information the way they do) and the choice-processing strategy (i.e., how people process choice information) underpinning the phenomenon of attraction effect. Our results indicate that in the case of promotion-focused individuals, the desire for a choice that can be easily justified (ease of justification) influences the attraction effect, whereas for prevention-focused individuals, the desire for a choice that maximizes overall utility (overall attractiveness) influences the same effect. Furthermore, promotion-focused people rely on lexicographic-processing strategy, whereas prevention-focused individuals use an equal-weight processing strategy as a means of demonstrating their motivations. © 2014 M.E.

In this article, we unpack the mechanism by which individuals use PO to express aspects of their identity and explore how PO manifestations can display congruence as well as incongruence between layers of self. As a conceptual foundation, we develop a dynamic model of individual identity that differentiates between four layers of self, namely, the “core self,” “learned self,” “lived self,” and “perceived self.” We then bring identity and PO literatures together to suggest a framework of PO manifestation and expression viewed through the lens of the four presented layers of self. In exploring our framework, we develop a number of propositions that lay the foundation for future empirical and conceptual work and discuss implications for theory and practice. ©, Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This dependence can result in consumer ambivalence toward the sales encounter-consumers may feel torn between their distrust and suspicion toward salespeople, and yet they need their help and expertise to make an informed decision. Using both qualitative and sequential experimental methods, we investigate how ambivalence manifests itself in the buyerseller encounter, how and when it can be reduced, and its effect on attitudes and intent to purchase. Our results demonstrate that positive message amplification can be a potential help but also a hindrance in the initial buyer-seller encounter.

We examine several models of cross-buying and failure/recovery characteristics using a large-scale experiment and secondary transaction data from a Fortune 100 computer systems firm. We find that customers integral-affective responses dominate their cognitive responses. Further, customers are more willing to cross-buy when the firms recovery effort increases for more severe product failures or those with unstable attributions. Yet, greater recovery effort does little to diminish the negative effect of attributing the failure to the firm. Overall, understanding the relative dominance of a sequence of affective versus cognitive factors and the critical role that contextual factors play in customer cross-buying decisions will help managers design PFR encounters to increase the odds of cross-selling. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Neutral ads provide boundary conditions for this effect: reexposure to neutrally valenced advertisements does not differentially affect recall of brands in neutral ads, and recall of brands in neutral ads is not affected by reexposure to positively or negatively valenced ads. Our findings indicate that repetition of a target ad may be able to impair recall of competitors' brands in subsequent like-valenced ads in addition to having the well-understood benefit of enhancing recall of the advertised brand.

Drawing on interviews and the literature, a middle-range theory is developed, suggesting that consumers' dispositions and perceptions of offerings' characteristics thwart adoption, whereas perceptions of marketers' competencies and consumer benefits engender adoption.

In addition, it determines how centrality of visual product aesthetics (CVPA), an individual difference variable that captures a consumer's interest and involvement in aesthetics, affects these processes. Results indicate that the influence of natural designs on consumer price expectation is mediated through judgments of quality and attractiveness, harmonious designs exert a direct effect on price expectation and an indirect effect through quality judgments, and elaborate designs exert both direct and indirect effects via quality and via attractiveness. Compared to low-CVPA consumers, high-CVPA individuals base both quality and attractiveness judgments to a greater extent on design, and base their price expectation more strongly on the package's attractiveness. However, high-CVPA individuals do not infer higher quality from attractive packages than do individuals low in CVPA.

Status consumption does influence price sensitivity; and this influence is largely, but not totally, mediated by involvement, innovativeness, and brand loyalty.

Recently, researchers have started to question the traditional conceptualization by noting that service quality may be better represented by formative rather than reflective indicators. We undertook a study of e-service quality and analyzed the data using a formative conceptualization, as well as a traditional reflective conceptualization. The results of our comparison demonstrated very different managerial conclusions for the two specifications.

Our findings, based on data from retail pharmacies, demonstrate that only under conditions of symmetric independence, trust, as a governance mechanism, completely mediate the relationship between fairness and loyalty. Under conditions of both perceived independence (i.e., lack of interdependence) and asymmetric buyer dependence, however, trust does not mediate but fairness directly influences loyalty. Thus, fairness and trust influence loyalty, strengthening relationships in different ways under different conditions of interdependence.

Much work focused on market orientation in the 1990s, but recent research in marketing management and strategy shifted to other topics, thus, important issues have been neglected by the research community. Theoretical foundations drawn from social exchange theory and the dynamic capabilities view offer a framework for examining the influence of organizational factors, joint alliance factors, and relational factors on interfirm relationships under various external and internal environmental contexts relevant to current and emerging environmental conditions. Alliance market orientation is introduced as a key variable that moderates the relationship between the alliance factors and new product alliance performance, external environmental factors moderate the relationships between organizational factors and joint alliance factors, and relational factors moderate both sets of relationships. The proposed conceptual model offers a foundation for investigating the patterns of influence between firm- and alliance-level variables on new product alliance performance.

This relationship is, however, strongly moderated by the purposes for which airline passengers travel (i.e., either for business or pleasure).

However, some survey researchers warn that forced answering should not be used as it could increase nonresponse error. These researchers suggest one way around this is to provide a ""prefer not to answer"" (PNA) option, which, if used, would allow respondents to continue without providing a substantive response to each question. This study examines the effects of using forced answering and ""prefer not to answer"" in Web surveys from a field experiment conducted with a general U. S. population.

In such an environment, this paper proposes that marketers can prosper if they more fully understand the connections between sales quotas and other important organizational issues (i.e., trust in the organization, customer-oriented selling, and sales performance). The significance of sales quotas as a directing force has been noted by researchers and practitioners for some time. Yet beyond their obvious influence (e.g., as sales goals), little is understood as to what extent these frequently utilized performance objectives connect and impact other critical organizational issues within the selling group. Using a sample of 345 business-to-business salespeople, this study explores how the application of sales quotas have far-reaching organizational implications, beyond goal setting and reward mechanisms, to include issues of organizational trust, customer-oriented selling, and sales performance. To explore these connections, a model grounded in both sales force control theory and goal-setting theory is developed and then tested using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that perceptions of quota difficulty are negatively related to salespeople's trust in the organization and their sales performance, and trust in the organization positively affects customer-oriented selling, which positively affects sales performance.

While the customer relationship dimension is driven by factors that trigger voluntary usage, the internal coordination dimension is explained by factors imposed from outside. Consequently, sales technology should be designed to enable customer relationships rather than being perceived as a cost-cutting tool. In addition, sales managers should not impose technology usage.

While two of its three main hypotheses have received consistent empirical support, the same is not true for the remaining relationship (i.e., the influence of perceived ease of use on the behavioral intention to adopt a system; PEOU-BI). Previously, this empirical contradiction has been explained by introducing the concept of task motivation borrowed from Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1992). Our paper provides a different explanation. We show that for the same task (and, hence, the same task motivation), the significance can also depend on observed population heterogeneity. We do this by applying partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) to data stemming from a survey among approximately 2,000 individuals regarding their intention to adopt a customized newspaper.

A qualitative survey of marketing job specifications in companies as well as a study of marketing managers in large South African firms were undertaken. The results are reported and a list of important competencies are identified and discussed. Recommendations are made to management. © 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

A sample of 243 African-American consumers was used to test the relationships between the four independent variables and the two dependent variables. Results confirm that culture affects moral orientations. Specifically, findings suggest a positive relationship between collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and idealism, and a negative relationship between masculinity and idealism. Results also suggest a positive relationship between collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and relativism. Although the study is U.S. based, the results should prove valuable to global marketers because Hofstede's cultural framework allows managers to identify differences in personal moral philosophies of consumers across different cultures and thus provides a theoretical base for designing more effective global marketing strategies. © 2008 M.E.

This study identifies the characteristics associated with skeptical adolescents and links these to various environmental factors focusing in particular on Internet use and the type and intensity of parenting communication adopted in the adolescent's household. In doing so we monitor the role of the Internet in the consumer socialization process and are thereby able to update previous studies based on a more limited range of media. The empirical results suggest that the Internet hampers the development of skepticism to advertising unless it is used in the context of telewebbing (simultaneous Internet and television use). We also find as parental communication moves toward a concept-oriented approach, the development of skepticism to advertising increases.","",""

We examined the effects of innovativeness and attention to social comparison information on these dimensions. We hypothesized that innovativeness would negatively affect both types of social influence and that attention to social comparison information would positively affect them. Data from 305 student participants were used in a structural equation model containing these hypotheses, which fit the data well. One surprise emerged from the analysis: innovativeness was positively related to informational influence. The findings suggest that innovativeness is associated with susceptibility to informational influence despite a resistance to normative influence. © 2006 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Building on 14 key propositions, our model expands the recent notion on the effects of company identity on competitive advantage by unveiling the ""black box"" of how company identity, as perceived by three key company stakeholders (senior managers, employees, and customers) constitutes the central evaluation of the company by those stakeholders, thus influencing their cognitive, interpretive, and behavioral consequences. Such consequences would help the company to achieve and sustain superior performance.

Subjects (n = 697) were shown an ad for a fictitious new cell phone featuring either novice or expert endorsers. The results showed that there was a significant interaction between endorser expertise and innovativeness with respect to all three dependent variables. The non-innovators were more positively influenced by the expertise of the endorser than were the innovators. The findings suggest that innovators react differently to expert endorsement for new products than later adopters and thus might require different advertising tactics to appeal to them successfully.","",""

The results indicate that enjoyment, avoiding shopping bother, saving money, and quality are significant reasons consumers make products/services at home rather than buy them.","",""

Customer and employee interdependence or shared responsibility is often needed to complete a service transaction. Although shared responsibility is an integral part of service exchanges, few studies examine its effect on customers. Based on existing theory, we propose that perceptions of shared responsibility for service exchanges create value for customers and positively affect their responses to the service. We conduct three studies to evaluate this idea. In Study 1, we find empirical support for the direct and indirect effects of shared responsibility on willingness to pay a price premium for the service received in a full-service restaurant setting. In Study 2, we find that perceptions of shared responsibility for student learning lead to favorable emotional and attitudinal responses toward the educational experience. In Study 3, we show that for unsuccessful service exchanges, customer perceptions of shared responsibility positively influence customer responses to the service and brand; additionally, we identify key antecedents of shared responsibility. The implications of these findings for service marketers are discussed. © 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

More sales managers are recognizing the need for their salespeople to shift from a transaction selling approach to a more consulting-oriented approach. However, few studies have investigated how to modify sales management programs to develop consulting behaviors or the potential impact from these behaviors. This study sought to investigate the potential mediating influences of consulting times and sales force involvement in product modification on the relationships between sales management programs, consulting performance, and firm performance. Results indicate that the influence of consulting-oriented sales training on consulting effectiveness is indirect through sales force consulting time and involvement in product modification.

This paper briefly reviews the historical evolution and the modern conceptualization of scholarship, and presents an inclusive process model of marketing scholarship that attempts to address these pressures. Suggestions are made for implementing the model. © 2006 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""
"Risk, trust and the problem solving approach: A cross cultural negotiation study","2005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33751078562&doi=10.1080%2f10696679.2005.11658538&partnerID=40&md5=216aba988576b6e07c526a98799d98f7","This study investigates three antecedents to the problem solving strategy in negotiations - risk, trust and perceptions of counterpart's strategy. Using two culturally diverse sample groups - Americans and Filipino industrial exporters - we found that these groups only had one variable common. Both groups' problem solving orientation was greatly influenced by their impressions of their counterparts. Traits relating to risk and trust influenced only the American sample.","",""
"A test of strategic orientation formation versus strategic orientation implementation: The influence of TMT functional diversity and inter-functional coordination","2005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33749526879&doi=10.1080%2f10696679.2005.11658540&partnerID=40&md5=052db53c6eab4a9a3bd6bbf33421c095","The authors argue that strategic orientation formation and strategic orientation implementation are different. The authors also assert that they require different levels of the same antecedents. More specifically, the proposed model posits that strategic orientation formation and implementation are a function of top management team's (TMT) functional diversity and interfunctional coordination. This two-stage model of strategic orientation suggests that on the one hand strategic orientation formation is about consensus making based on diverse views. Strategic orientation implementation underscores the significance of efficient and seamless operationalization of the strategic orientation formed in the first stage of the model. Data obtained from TMTs support our empirical results in that moderate to high TMT functional diversity and high inter-functional coordination are important in the strategic orientation formation stage while low to moderate TMT functional diversity and inter-functional coordination are critical in the implementation stage.","",""

This study examines psychological climate as a boundary condition of the salesperson customer orientation - salesperson performance relationship. We apply Mischel's (1976) theory, which suggests that the impact of individual differences (such as salesperson customer orientation) is less pronounced when situational conditions (such as psychological climate) are strong. In addition, we introduce the concept of a strong balanced psychological climate to the marketing literature. Our findings suggest that the salesperson customer orientation - salesperson performance relationship is moderated by psychological climate such that the relationship is weakened in strong balanced psychological climates. Implications of this research are discussed.","",""

Signaling theory suggests that heavy advertising spending for an unknown brand may be ineffective in signaling quality because the brand has no reputation at stake. More recent theorizing, however, holds that advertising spending may itself serve as a bond and, therefore, influence quality judgments even for unknown brands. The results of a laboratory experiment are consistent with the latter position as we observe strong signaling effects on perceived quality for a new, unknown brand. Interestingly, though, this effect is moderated by subjects' prior perceptions of brand differentiation, such that a negative effect of very high ad spending occurs when differences between brands in a product category are perceived as small. The results suggest that new brands, as well as established reputable.brands, may be able to successfully signal quality by strong spending on advertising. However, the results also indicate the potential for a backlash effect of high ad spending on new brand evaluations when the brand competes in a category where competitive offerings are perceived by consumers to be relatively undifferentiated.","",""

Much of academic research during this period focused on such issues as whether global companies should standardize, adapt, and/or the degree to which they should adapt their marketing strategies to international markets. This study takes a different approach; instead of adapting firm-specific factors to the environment that firms encounter in developing markets, it focuses on how global companies can improve the infrastructure, the level of education, and the legal systems in order to improve the standard of living in developing countries while expanding markets.","",""

This study uncovers customer perceptions of university-corporate partnerships and examines how beliefs about university-corporate partnerships influence attitude toward the university brand. The results of focus groups and a survey are presented demonstrating that university customers have conflicting beliefs about university-corporate partnerships and that attitude toward the university is influenced (1) positively by beliefs about the benefits provided by university-corporate partnerships, (2) positively by beliefs about the importance of shopping with university-corporate partners, and (3) negatively by beliefe about university-corporate partnerships creating limitations on customer choices.

Results indicate that idealism and Machiavellianism are strong predictors of managers' perceptions of the ethical appropriateness of negotiating tactics.

Based upon the resource-based perspective of the firm, this study suggests that the primary reason for the survival of the well-established EMCs would be their market-based assets. By intertwining these assets with e-business, EMCs would not only reintermediate, but would also become more efficient and effective. This study advances the literature by analyzing the impact of e-business proliferation on the exporting services, product portfolio, and international market coverage of EMCs.","",""

Past studies have examined consumer socialization primarily from the perspective of the mother (e.g., Carlson, Grossbart, and Walsh 1990; Rose, Bush, and Kahle 1998; see Palan 1998 for an exception). This study extends this research by examining the relationship between family communication and parental control over children's television viewing among multiple family members (the mother, the father, and the child). The results generally support the convergent validity of the measures across raters. The criteria for discriminant validity (Campbell and Fiske 1959) were generally met, but some complexities were found, particularly for the ratings or perceptions of the child.","",""

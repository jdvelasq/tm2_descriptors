"DEVELOPING DECOLONIAL REFLEXIVITY: DECOLONIZING MANAGEMENT EDUCATION BY CONFRONTING WHITE SKIN, WHITE IDENTITIES, AND WHITENESS",2024,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197891720&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0387&partnerID=40&md5=24b757b72ed0e2787226137d13b54c94,"This article explores the potential contribution that White academics based at a Western institution might offer to decolonizing management and organizational knowledge (MOK). We consider how racial hierarchies underpin MOK and shape existing privileges embedded in higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. We reflect on how confronting having White skin and White identities and critically engaging with Whiteness can contribute to decolonizing management education. We address two questions: How can we, and more broadly, White academics, play a constructive role in debates on decolonizing MOK and education? What kind of reflexivity does decolonizing MOK require of us so that we can engage in these debates without colonizing them? The article consists of four sections: (a) introducing the broader context in which we make our contribution; (b) historicizing and exploring issues of identity, Whiteness, Blackness, and otherness; (c) considering how these issues may or may not be embedded in management and organizational education; and (d) developing the new concept of decolonial reflexivity and exploring what this means for White scholars, particularly in relation to ideas of discomfort. By engaging in decolonial reflexivity, we hope to encourage stronger engagement with issues of race, Whiteness, and White privilege in MOK and education. Questo articolo esplora il contributo potenziale che accademici bianchi, affiliati ad istituzioni occidentali, possono offrire ai dibattiti sulla decolonizzazione degli studi organizzativi. In particolare, analizziamo le gerarchie razziali che sottendono GLI studi organizzativi e come queste siano incorporate e riflesse nelle istituzioni accademiche nel Regno Unito e altrove. L’articolo risponde principalmente a due domande: possiamo avere (noi autori e più in generale, accademici bianchi) un ruolo costruttivo nei dibattiti sulla decolonizzazione? E, che tipo di riflessività puó consentirci di contribuire a questi dibattiti senza colonizzarli? L’articolo é organizzato in quattro sezioni. Nella prima introduciamo il contesto del nostro contributo, focalizzandoci in particola modo sulla persistenza di logiche e dinamiche coloniali negli studi organizzativi e nelle istituzioni accademiche che li producono; nella seconda esploriamo aspetti relativi alle identità e il ruolo del colore della pelle nel costruirle e definirle, sia a livello individuale che collettivo; nella terza sezione analizziamo se e come questi aspetti siano riconosciuti o considerati nei curricula di management e studi organizzativi; infine, nella quarta sezione proponiamo il concetto di ‘riflessività decoloniale’, e il ruolo centrale che occupa in tale processo, la sperimentazione di vissuti di disagio, in particolare modo per accademici bianchi. Nel delineare la ‘riflessivitá decoloniale’ speriamo di incoraggiare altri accademici a esplorare criticamente e riflettere sulle persistenti ineguaglianze razziali negli insegnamenti di management and studi organizzativi. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
CODESIGNING MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH ONLINE COURSE READINGS: IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING MANAGEMENT COURSES,2024,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197892316&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0364&partnerID=40&md5=f09351fb49b9845e85f1b21746f784e2,"This paper reconceptualizes student engagement with course readings in management education. We challenge the perception of assigned readings as a solely student-centered issue, and propose a codesign approach that emphasizes the relational and intersubjective nature of various stakeholders contributing to the engagement design. The paper extends prior research by identifying concepts of quality of participation, connecting practices, and digital engagement that impact meaningful engagement with course readings. Grounded in action research theory, we propose a framework to design meaningful student engagement that is structured around six dimensions: (1) usefulness, (2) enjoyment, (3) quantity, (4) access, (5) intent, and (6) participative integration. These dimensions are entangled and viewed through three lenses: (a) what, (b) how, and (c) why. This paper presents theoretical and practical contributions, and importantly offers a paradigm shift in how educators and educational developers can enhance engagement with course readings in management education and beyond. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
AN IVORY TOWER OF BABEL? THE IMPACT OF SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF TEAMS ON RESEARCH PERFORMANCE IN BUSINESS SCHOOLS,2024,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197882086&doi=10.5465%2famle.2021.0063&partnerID=40&md5=39f59a8a99fb7c367d74e31df022edc3,"Despite the prevalence of teams in research, there is a lack of a good understanding of how their size and diversity affects their performance. We develop a theoretical framework that distinguishes two dimensions of research performance for an academic paper: impact (i.e., subsequent citations) and prestige (i.e., ranking of the journal where research is published). We propose that, while larger teams will enhance linearly the impact of research, they will affect its prestige in a nonlinear fashion. We further contend that these effects will be moderated by knowledge and international diversity of the teams. We test these hypotheses using bibliometric data between 1990 and 2020 on more than 1.4 million papers and 18 million citation counts across 22 subfields in management. Our results confirm significant benefits for research impact from both team size and diversity, but also highlight drawbacks when teams become very large and heterogeneous. Moreover, we find a nonlinear positive effect of team size on research prestige that can be offset only by high levels of knowledge diversity. These findings are robust to a variety of proxies, controls, and estimation techniques, including instrumental variables and propensity score matching. We discuss practical implications for stimulating research performance in business schools. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
DOING SILENCE: HOW SILENCE IS PRODUCED IN MEETINGS,2024,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186612506&doi=10.5465%2famle.2021.0521&partnerID=40&md5=4b4ce3b3d1dd212a878403b27676d245,"Authoritarian management and dysfunctional practices and processes have long been seen as the underlying systemic causes of silence within organizations. Individual responses to these causes, rooted in fear and futility, have been the accompanying explanations. While both types of factors contribute to a climate of silence, their dominance in certain contexts—such as consultative meetings among high-performing independent professionals—should not be taken for granted. Our study looks into the context of higher education, and business schools more specifically, and unpacks the mechanisms of silence reproduction beyond the (perceived) fear and futility in voice articulation. More specifically, we present a multidimensional processual model of silence, where we unearth the forces driving and reinforcing silence as the mode of being. We point to how structural, cultural, and individual elements interact, and how social situations act as drivers of silence rather than as voice activators. We advance numerous recommendations for practice and discuss how unaddressed silence could contribute to the progressing deterioration of the professional ethos. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
SPARKS AND DYNAMIC CO-EMERGENCE—HOW FACILITATORS MAKE SENSE OF AND LEARN FROM CRITICAL INCIDENTS IN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND TEACHING,2024,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189620724&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0004&partnerID=40&md5=9ee3c70bc2edb35074294849046cc2e8,"While existing notions of experiential learning help reveal the key process and components of learning from a student’s perspective, how facilitators make sense of and learn from the dynamics of experiential learning are often overlooked. Given their crucial role in shaping experiential learning, it is important to create a deepened empirical understanding of instructor experiences, challenges, and practices for experiential teaching. In this paper, we examine instructors’ reflection, sensemaking, and lessons learned as they encounter critical incidents in their own practice. We present our data through a process model that describes instructors’ dynamic interactions with learners, starting with what we call “the spark.” By revealing how instructors engage in and respond to unscripted moments in experiential teaching, we offer a fuller picture of the relational dynamics that shape their practice. Our findings problematize the existing notions of experiential learning by showing how co-emergence plays out in intra- and interpersonal interactions with the surrounding ecosystem. By introducing an enactive lens, we provide a novel perspective that we present as a “dance,” linking vulnerability and the creation of brave—not merely safe—spaces for learning. We highlight the need for adaptive approaches for instructors to help build experiential expertise. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
HOW TO SUPPORT STUDENTS' SELF-REGULATED LEARNING IN TIMES OF CRISIS: AN EMBEDDED TECHNOLOGY-BASED INTERVENTION IN BLENDED LEARNING PEDAGOGIES,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174311961&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0188&partnerID=40&md5=5d3224009c70c29d2b9d3c8e0324b768,"With the increasing prevalence of technology-enhanced learning environments, selfregulated learning (SRL) has become a crucial skill for management students and graduates in the 21st century. Self-regulated learners can take control of their own learning process by setting learning objectives and selecting appropriate learning strategies. As a result of the recent COVID-19 crisis, universities were compelled to shift to online course delivery, which greatly reduced social interaction between educators and learners and challenged educators' feedback practices. To address this issue, we developed and embedded a technology-based intervention with temporal-proximate and regular formative feedback assessments in a large-scale management course to promote graduate students' SRL practices. We evaluated the intervention in a quasi-experiment, which found that studentswith the embedded SRL intervention had higher self-assessment and learning outcome scores and lower absolute self-assessment deviation. Our study makes at least three contributions. First, we shed light on students' SRL strategies in times of emergency remote learning, highlighting their extensive need for social support and comparison. Second, we extend the literature on SRL and social-cognitive theory by unveiling a hidden effect when embedding temporal-proximate and regular interventions. Third,we contribute an empirically evaluated intervention to foster students' SRL in blended learning and online pedagogies. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
REBORDERING THE TOTAL INSTITUTION: DESIGNING THRIVING BUSINESS SCHOOLS THROUGH CREATIVE RESOURCING AND EDUCATOR AGENCY,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174291133&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0205&partnerID=40&md5=34fa855a5b93a845afb1b147c1c9ab46,"COVID-19 has exacerbated vulnerabilities in the ways business school educators work, resulting in isolation, exhaustion, and broken communities. After examining the current state of institutional challenges, I characterize pandemic lockdown as amanifestation of Goffman's total institution, describing how disculturation, isolation, fear, and loss of agency conflated life spheres and initiated a loss of self. As we emerge from lockdown conditions, I argue that a dramatic expansion of academic work and persistent nonwork life responsibilities required during COVID have created an unbordered total institution that is no less immersive and no less disorienting than lockdown.Employing activity theory as a practical tool, I offer ways of rebordering work by redefining life spheres for business school educators, recapturing agency and creativity as a ""new normal"". © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
VIRTUOUS EXEMPLARITY IN BUSINESS ETHICS EDUCATION: INSIGHTS FROM THE PLATONIC TRADITION,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174288144&doi=10.5465%2famle.2022.0333&partnerID=40&md5=85400796a993f278be8a3aa379ae2764,"Following the discussion in the literature on virtue ethics, this study aims to explore how exemplarity can foster the development of virtues in business ethics education. We propose to draw on the Platonic and Neoplatonic view of exemplarity to determine how knowledge of the virtues can aid students' moral development. This examination of the complex but unified system of virtues derived from the Platonic tradition helps us to elaborate educational principles prioritizing (a) positive exemplification over negative exemplification, (b) exemplarity over exemplification, and (c) virtuous exemplarity over moral exemplarity. We thereby show that business ethics education based on these three principles avoids the pitfalls of negative or artificial exemplification and encourages students to engage in a contemplative, imitative, and reflexive approach that is conducive to the development of moral excellence. © 2023 George Washington University.

This research explores the leadership knowing-doing gap, which we define as a discrepancy between managers' leadership knowing and the extent towhich they transfer it into leadership doing. Taking a phenomenological approach, we explore how and whymanagers experience the leadership knowing-doing gap, analyzing 65 critical incidents frominterviews with 22 managers in leadership roles across various organizational levels in the United Kingdom. We present the leadership knowing-doing gap as a multifaceted, dynamic, and complex experience involving cognitive, affective, and behavioral elements. We discuss how these elements interplay in influencing the dynamics of creating or widening the gap on the one hand, and preventing or closing the gap on the other hand. We shed light on factors that influence the leadership knowing-doing gap: motivation, prioritization, and confidence to enact leadership. We also highlight the role of context in leadership knowing-doing discrepancies. Our definition and proposed framework offer a conceptualization that advances understanding of the leadership knowing- doing gap. We end with our theoretical contributions and practical implications for both management learning and leadership development. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

However, widely used approaches to business ethics education, rooted in conceptualizations of ethical development as objective and quantifiable, often neglect students’ subjective involvement in moral matters. In this case study, we investigated subjective aspects of moral development of MBA students in a business ethics course using an alternative pedagogy based on world literature as course material. The findings elucidated that the use of literary narratives stimulated the development of “moral muscle,” a dynamic moral capability that needs to be developed through regular reflection and practice. Additionally, the development of moral muscle during the course showed heterogeneity among students with different starting positions, learning routes, and end states of their moral development. The findings contribute to a new theoretical understanding of moral development as a dynamic process—as moral muscle—with different individual change trajectories, and shed new light on how the use of literary narratives in business ethics education can stimulate this development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Using data collected from in-depth interviews with 35 executive learners who took a transformative learningoriented course, we found four affective experiences-feeling respected, safe, excited, and energized-interacting with two cognitive processes-self-learning and peer learning- culminating in transformation-inducingmomentum. Thismomentuminvolved cognitively realizing the limits of their habit ofmind and feeling ashamed by its limits yet feeling courageous about transforming it. The theoretical model derived from this inductive study demonstrates howexecutives can resolve the dilemma of transforming their habits of mind when an educator provides an arena in which they can learn about others' varying habits of mind, critically reflect on their own habit of mind, and develop the shame and courage to challenge it. Executives who reached this transformation-inducing momentum interpreted familiar situations with a different habit of mind or enacted a new habit of mind. The findings on the interplay of cognitive and affective experiences leading to these accomplishments of transformative learning contribute to management learning and education literature by illuminating the role of affect in the transformative-learning building process. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
THE ADOPTION OF MBA PROGRAMS IN GERMANY: AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164348831&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0289&partnerID=40&md5=72ab299d968bf764c9d791b892c8acff,"This study examines the adoption of MBA programs by higher education institutions in Germany. Using arguments from neo-institutional theory and imprinting theory, we propose that private ownership, mimetic processes, and founding period are likely to impact MBA adoption. In an empirical analysis of 86 German universities over the period 1999-2015, we show that private universities are more likely to offer MBA programs. For public universities, we find that prior adoption by other universities and an early foundation period (prior to World War II) positively influence MBA adoption. Interaction analyses show that the positive impact of prior adoption by other universities is attenuated by organizational status and augmented by the regional density of academic institutions. Our findings thus elucidate the major role of institutional factors for the diffusion of MBA programs among German universities. © Academy of Management Learning & Education 2023.",,

As the world is increasingly challenged by social and economic events, organizational actors must better understand and manage inherent emotions and not be limited by bounded rationality. By teaching the transgenerational transmission of collective traumas to two cohorts in an internationally renowned business school in Europe and in Asia, this study explores howhistorical consciousness can be construed in the context of an executive educational program and the learning consequences of this process over two years. Our findings distill five themes describing the executives' learnings. First, the intervention allowed the participants to experience historical consciousness through (a) personal connectionswith collective traumas, (b) awareness of the effects of the transgenerational transmission of collective traumas, and (c) the development of narrative competence. After two years, the participants identified two additional learnings in their organizational contexts: (d) they becamemore aware of howtheymanage their emotions, and (e) they identified perceived changes in their role as leaders.Wepropose that business schools encourage historical consciousness to better equip individuals in their roles as executives and leaders. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

By the time the COVID-19 pandemic struck, business schools had become bastions of managerialism. In Australia, this dominant paradigm was challenged through three phases of the pandemic. In the first, managerialist controls were greatly loosened, with positive results. In the second, Australian business schools' leaders reintroduced managerialist control and embedded this in the third phase, the ""new normal,""revealing how pernicious they are. First, we question why leaders missed an opportunity to build on themotivational benefits of the first phase when academics demonstrated their capacity to self-manage and adapt quickly. Second, we question why academics did not capitalize on the loosening of control they experienced early in the pandemic and failed to assert themselves as the pandemic subsided. By exposing the differences between current leaders and academics in their ability to overhaul the managerialist paradigm, we theorize how managerialism might be unseated. We clarify the mechanisms through which this can occur: infiltrating the system and collective action. Recognizing the interdependence of academics, business schools, and society, such action can erode managerialist control and hasten the arrival of a sustainability-oriented future. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

By taking an autoethnographic approach, as a departmental head of a U.K. business school myself, I reflect upon the cultural, political, and individual tensions that emerged over a year from my attempt to develop a liminal space or place for my colleagues. This was initially framed as research development, called the “Shoreside Sessions,” organized around a disconnected social and physical space. The intention was to understand whether this would lead to a respite from managerialism or any contestation to managerialist practices. Looking through a Lacanian conceptual lens, the research findings offer a tempered hope that middle management, which has been demonized by much of the critical management studies literature, could play a partial but pivotal role in providing a hysteric, questioning space for contestation to emerge. Such emergence is limited in a temporal sense, due to the growing conflicting managerialist, institutional agendas that department heads are increasingly expected to deliver. The paper’s other main contribution lies in the role played by Lacanian discourses and psychic registers, which will help academic managers with the process of reflexivity around intent and impact of liminal spaces. © 2023 George Washington University.

VENTRILOQUIAL AUTHORITY IN MANAGEMENT LEARNING AND EDUCATION: A COMMUNICATION AS CONSTITUTIVE OF LEARNING AND EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163399060&doi=10.5465%2famle.2019.0191&partnerID=40&md5=12e0d0d557d251ea3d9b93290b74b995,"This theoretical essay argues that management learning and education (MLE) is fundamentally accomplished by means of communication. Specifically, we utilize a communication as constitutive of organization perspective to advance MLE as a communicational accomplishment, which we label “communication as constitutive of learning and education.” We focus on authority in the sense that all classroom conversations are authored, showing that the educator who faces students is but one of many participants authoring classroom conversations. Authority becomes an emergent claim on action shaped by multiple interrelating texts that compete to influence practice. Classroom practice is, thus, a site of ventriloquial authority: when someone or something is made to speak in a specific way by a present or distant other that makes a difference to a conversational trajectory. We argue that management classrooms are replete with ventriloquial authority, and that this is consequential for what educators teach and what students learn. We support our argument by illustrating ventriloquial authority in the classroom through the use of textbooks and visual media. We end with a call to action for educators to appreciate communication's constitutive quality and to rethink how authority in MLE acts. © Academy of Management Learning & Education 2023.",,

Reactions vary, but compliance and hidden resistance are common responses. In this paper, we seek to understand compliance and hidden resistance as responses to objectionable management practices in business schools. To explore this problem, we present a case study of a business school where a new dean brought about aggressive and abrupt managerialist changes toward which faculty were broadly hostile. Faculty eventually failed to resist these changes and ended up resorting to exits and workplace disengagement while complying with management expectations regarding work outputs. To make sense of compliance and hidden resistance as responses to objectionable management practices in business schools, we propose the following concepts: “mercenary mentality” and “resipliance” (a combination of expressing resistance attitudes to peers-and to self-and complying with management demands for work outputs). The presence of a mercenary mentality and the related tendency to resipliance-which we argue are both common in business schools-undermines the capacity for resistance against objectionable management practices at the workplace, reminding us that resistance is fragile and elusive. © Academy of Management Learning & Education 2023.",,

Milgram and other Jewish scholars who lost friends and family in the Holocaust are regarded as pioneers of social psychology, yet they and the context that inspired them are muted within our field. Employing a comparative case analysis, we contrast the representation of Milgram's studies in introductory textbooks in psychology and management and consider how the fields' ideological commitments explain differences in coverage. Given their relevance to contemporary social movements that involve the abuse of authority by those in positions of power, we make the case for the inclusion of Milgram's experiments in the management curriculum. Beyond Milgram, our study encourages critical reflection on what we are teaching, and not teaching, our students about management. © Academy of Management Learning & Education 2023.",,
CRAFTING PUBLIC NARRATIVE TO ENABLE COLLECTIVE ACTION: A PEDAGOGY FOR LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139175361&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0224&partnerID=40&md5=4eaae5eaaeb85e4b707212ac57ed1764,"We propose a new theory of public narrative, its practice, and its pedagogy that can prepare leaders to mobilize collective action toward tackling grand challenges and respond to the call for humanizing leadership development. We define “public narrative” as a process of accessing, articulating, and communicating shared values. We argue that, through crafting their public narratives, leaders can enact their moral resources to motivate others to choose collective action. By conceptualizing “values” as affective commitments, we propose that public narrative is constructed through the articulation of specific narrative moments-stories of hurt (why I care) and hope (why I can act)-that communicate one's moral resources. We then argue that our pedagogy can be used in leadership development by enabling leaders to articulate a story of self, a story of us, and a story of now: the experiential communication of one's values that have called one to leadership, of overlapping values shared by one's constituency, and of challenges to those values that require urgent collective action. Last, we describe our core pedagogical principles and discuss the implications of our pedagogy. © Academy of Management Learning & Education 2023.",,

Leaders should use the crisis as an opportunity to transform their institutions into digital platformbusinesses, resembling Spotify or YouTube. By critically analyzing these reports this essay seeks to make three contributions. First, at the university level, I conceptualize these recommendations as an expression of extreme neoliberalism, consisting of ""crisis opportunism""and ""libertarian utopianism.""Second, moving to the business school level, I argue that the influence ofmanagement consultants provokes a professional paradox, especially among management educators. This has significant implications for the legitimacy of business school academics. And thirdly, I propose that the business school community is uniquely positioned (vis à vis other schools in the university) to challenge extreme neoliberalism. Three avenues of resistance are posited, focusing not only on consulting firms but their clients too - senior university executives. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

This study employed anthropomorphized letter writing as a narrative trigger to invite management students to write to elements of their educational environment. We examined 49 letters penned by international students, addressing entities such as classmates, classrooms, and online tools. Our findings illustrate that students reveal their emotions, reflect upon their interactions with these targets, and ultimately reconcile their relationships with these entities, navigating the emotional complexities associated with remote education through their nostalgic narratives. This research contributes to the literature on emotional aspects ofmanagement education, the self-help benefits of letter writing, and the adaptive functions of nostalgia, offering practical guidance for educators who aim to support students' emotional well-being and autonomy during pandemic-related challenges and beyond. © 2023 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

According to the dominant narrative, the anachronistic views of Britain’s industrial leaders and disdain of its universities for practical learning constrained developments in the field. Through the lens of elite theory, we offer a reinterpretation of the formation of Britain’s first business schools informed by archival research, suggesting that they arose from an evolutionary process rather than a crucible event. The story of the creation of Britain’s first business schools has never been told from the perspective of elite agency. Our study reveals the emergent managerial elite of the post-war era growing into something altogether more powerful. Our main contribution to theory is to demonstrate that, while expanding management education ostensibly contravened elite interests, elite interaction in the field of power at a time of national urgency amplified elite influence, prefiguring their role as “influence elites” today. © 2023 George Washington University.

To investigate this, we employed thematic narrative analysis of qualitative data from an extreme sample: women survivors of violence. At the outset, the women storied that their sense of self was destabilized, yet, through the program, they began to understand and accept the self, believe in their own agency, and experienced a newfound vitality for their ventures and life. These conditions were amplified by the high-quality connections the women forged with one another, their mentors, and other actors associated with the program. We identify three different types of authentic endeavors—lived experience, reflected image, and rewritten meanings—that ultimately enabled the women to reflect their true selves in the ventures they created. This study extends prior research on authenticity by identifying the diverse ways in which authentic endeavors become manifest in entrepreneurial activities. We contribute to research on management education by explicating the program components and mechanisms that enable this to occur. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
HOW ARNSTEIN’S LADDER OF CITIZEN PARTICIPATION CAN ENHANCE COMMUNITY-ENGAGED TEACHING AND LEARNING,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151876179&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0284&partnerID=40&md5=1bf409c06789f84ebbe268debe8c49c3,"Community-engaged teaching and learning (CETL) is an educational approach that has been heralded as fostering student learning and social responsibility. However, prior research has noted the absence of consideration for the “community” component of the approach, including whether there is mutual benefit in the relationship between institutions and their community partners, and the extent to which the community has voice or power in the process and outcomes of CETL. To address this issue, we introduce a process-oriented framework based on theory that should help to advance best practices and scholarship in CETL: Arnstein’s (1969) Ladder of Citizen Participation. We then “test” this framework adapted for CETL by using it to assess examples of community participation in CETL, as evidenced in a purposeful cross-section of cases published in business and management education literature. Our findings suggest that the Ladder provides meaningful differentiation among various forms of CETL and can offer valuable guidance for achieving partnerships with mutual benefit, voice, and empowerment, and for identifying approaches that could limit community engagement in CETL. In this context, the framework can guide instructors to reflect on their practices and to explore what greater involvement of community partners in CETL may mean. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Concerns have been expressed about the culture of competition, self-interest, greed, and short-termism that still dominates the business school, despite the irreparable ecological damage that this culture has contributed to creating, and the innumerable business scandals it has generated. To navigate the grand challenges of our time, management education needs to be shaken at its very foundations. In this essay, I unpack the process that generates these dysfunctional consequences to expose the root of the problem: assumptions of self-interest, instrumental rationality, capitalist organizing, and mechanistic worldviews generate self-fulfilling prophecies. Only once this harmful process is better understood is it possible to move beyond critique and support the virtuous cycles enabling functional outcomes. Contributing to the current debate around building civic universities and reframing the concept of civility systemically, I propose reconfiguring management education around four different principles: generalized reciprocity, substantive rationality, diverse organizing, and a system approach. I suggest that these are the pedagogical foundations for civic management education capable of producing cooperative humans, substantive business schools, fairer societies, and thriving ecosystems.

This paper presents the lessons from an action research inquiry designed to reconfigure the internal auditing function to address the problem of a conformance mindset and compliance-based approach. We show how cultivating a “reflexive mindset” becomes a critical catalyst in developing an internal auditing approach that leads to the identification of misconduct, conduct risk, and deficiencies in the organization’s conduct risk–management and governance frameworks. We contribute to advance reflexivity as a practice that can support the reconfiguration of management functions like internal auditing, not only by readjusting operating routines but also by encouraging internal auditors to critically (re)consider how their activities may contribute to the common good of the organization’s members and customers.

This article explores how “unconferencing,” which aspires to the participatory ideals of Habermasian deliberative exchange, can contribute to inclusivity within conferences and critical management education (CME) more generally. Informed by empirical data collected at four unconferences, we explore how they encourage a move (a) from exclusion toward inclusion of individual voices, (b) from hierarchical toward horizontal group learning, and (c) from passive disengagement toward a spirit of engagement and inclusion. Drawing on the deliberative feminist critique of the Habermasian foundations of CME, we highlight the implicit assumptions around inclusion within unconferencing at the individual, group, and structural levels. We argue that, by adopting these more explicitly inclusive practices, management education can be opened up to a broader range of voices. In doing so, the article demonstrates the potential of unconferences as a way of rethinking professional management education that challenges power relations and can increase inclusivity. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Despite the growing need for improved management decision-making, managers continue to demonstrate a lack of reflexivity and revert to formulaic practices that have contributed to previous events. In response, we employ the institutional logics perspective to explain causes of managers’ nonreflexive decision-making, and as a basis for a new historical focus within business schools. Specifically, we extend the model of collective memory-making to develop a pedagogical model that outlines how management educators can develop students’ historical sensibility—that is, their sensitivity to and appreciation of possible pasts and the impact of managerial actions on history—to overcome the constraining influence of dominant logics on managers’ decision-making. To this end, we advocate that management educators develop students’ abilities to procure and evaluate historical documents with reference to context; critically analyze retrieved documents and synthesize narratives; and communicate those narratives. The harnessing of historical sensibility is assisted by articulation of specific action foci. By focusing on both the development and harnessing of historical sensibility, we go beyond the presumption that more history will (and should) ensure better management practice.

When these schemas are entrenched, they can impede creative idea generation, multiperspectival problem-solving, and adaptation to organizational change. With its emphasis on surfacing schemas, design thinking (DT) within executive education represents a potentially powerful way to address the apparent trade-off between expertise and flexibility. We studied three DT executive education courses to answer how, if at all, executive students’ schemas change during DT education. Drawing on constructivist learning theory, including the learning modes of assimilation, tuning, and restructuring, we found that tuning in particular fostered flexibility in expertise. Our study contributes to the DT literature, executive education, and the expertise versus flexibility debate, and provides advice on how management educators might revise how they teach DT and similar topics.

Analysis of 39 coaching RCT samples, with a total sample size of n 5 2,528, yielded a statistically significant effect of workplace coaching across all leadership and personal outcomes. Our best estimate of a standard effect size for coaching of g 5 .59 fell well within the moderate range, although there were indications of significant publication bias, as expected. Furthermore, we develop a model that is based on the leverage from coregulation between coach and coachee. The model was confirmed in five different predictions: moderation analyses indicated that effects are larger with self-reported outcomes, as distinct from observed outcomes; they are larger with qualified coaches in nonleadership applications; and they are somewhat larger with female coachees, while they do not depend much on the length of the overall coaching assignment. Taken together, these findings provide clear and new evidence of the efficacy of coaching interventions in a variety of applications. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
DYNAMIC BOUNDARIES IN VIRTUAL STUDENT TEAMS: IS PARTICIPANT ALIGNMENT THE NEW TEAM COHESION?,2023,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178201447&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0524&partnerID=40&md5=3a0f67047e757b5e778506c516d7b2f0,"Distance education is becoming a global phenomenon affecting student teamwork, especially since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, research in management education on changes in team cohesion in student teams remains limited, and even less is known in the context of dynamic forms of modern virtual team collaboration. We address this gap by exploring how dynamic boundaries affect team cohesion via a study conducted across two editions (spring 2018 and spring 2019) of a cross-university course. Results from the qualitative triangulated data collected from a multiple holistic case study composed of 11 virtual student teams (n 5 65 participants) suggest that in the virtual student teams, dynamic boundaries (such as dispersion, subteam formation, boundary spanning, multiteaming, and moving on and off the team) diminish team cohesion in favor of “participant alignment” and have differential relationships with this novel concept. Our results contribute to the literature on management education and team dynamics and can be applied in academic and management practice by shifting the focus away from team cohesion and toward participant alignment as a new individual-level, multidimensional concept. This has the potential to become an important aspect of successful virtual teams operating under modern dynamic conditions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Using panel data from a cohort of PhD students who completed PhDs in business, economics, law, or social sciences in the 2014 academic year in Germany, we find that, in general, intrinsically motivated PhD students are more likely to choose an academic career. However, they need to be embedded in a specific social context—that is, a specific set of social relationships—for the intrinsic motivation to have its positive effect. In particular, our results show that the positive relationship between the PhD students’ intrinsic motivation and their probability of pursuing an academic career is strengthened when they collaborate more with others. Further, we find that social relationships such as mentoring aimed at developing the PhD students’ career identity are favorable, whereas mentoring targeted at increasing their knowledge and skills or exposure to networks becomes irrelevant, or even dysfunctional, when their collaborative working environment is considered. By disentangling the interplay of intrapersonal factors and social context in the academic career choice, our findings contribute to a more comprehensive, multilevel view of the factors that lead to the choice of such a career.

Scholars have begun to agree that heteronormativity is constituted in and through management education, reproducing heteronormative binaristic notions of sexuality and gender in management curricula, teaching activities, academic scholarship, and business schools. Research has demonstrated the negative outcomes for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer* (LGBTQ*) people, but questions remain about how heteronormativity is constituted as normative in management education. Addressing this, we demonstrate how heteronormativity is performatively constituted as normative through language, and what management educators can do to disrupt it. Analytically, Judith Butler’s (1990) theory of performativity, which emphasizes the constitutive power of language and repetition of speech acts, is pivotal to conceptualizing heteronormativity as performative. We interrogate the performative effects of LGBTQ* injurious speech acts, which have been lamented by scholars as ubiquitous and harmful, and show how they constitute and sustain heteronormativity as normative in management education. As a remedy, we derive insight from Butler’s ideas about reworking the power of injurious speech to inform management educators how they can disrupt the performativity of heteronormativity. The essay contributes novel theoretical ideas about conceptualizing and disrupting the performativity of heteronormativity in management education.

However, evidence suggests that many recent business degree graduates struggle with underemployment, highlighting the importance of examining how postsecondary institutions can better prepare students for the transition to work. In the current study, we investigated how including a personal strengths-driven intervention, the Reflected Best Self Exercise, in management curricula may help better prepare students for securing employment by increasing students’ confidence in their ability to succeed in an employment interview (i.e., by enhancing interview self-efficacy). Using a pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design with a control group (N 5 190 undergraduate students), we found that the Reflected Best Self Exercise increased students’ interview self-efficacy and that this effect was moderated by pretest levels of general self-efficacy and career choice confidence. Moreover, we found that students with lower levels of general self-efficacy and career choice confidence experienced greater benefits from the Reflected Best Self Exercise. Our results contribute to the management education literature by demonstrating how strengths-based interventions with a reflection component can be leveraged to develop interview self-efficacy in business students.

While this is to the detriment of learning, management educators also collude in this silencing. In this essay, I propose that a process philosophical perspective offers educators one resource that can voice, legitimize, and foreground the fallibility central to management practice to unleash its learning potential. I offer three contributions. First, I highlight how a processual lens allows us to see managerial fallibility anew as an inevitable effect of a world which is constantly “becoming,” rather than as a sign of individual weakness which is pathologized and denied. Second, I show how this rethinking invites an alternative focus for management practice—one that avoids the pursuit of perfection and instead focuses on “practical adequacy.” I suggest that this expands the possibilities for management practice by providing a relieving power that enables managers to work with, not against, fallibility. In doing so, I highlight the unstated value of the processual lens as a resource for coping. Third, my call to action considers how management educators might embrace fallibility to reimagine their teaching stance, content, and methods to lay the foundations for the development of the “adequate manager.” © 2023 George Washington University.

Specifically, we theorize that stakeholder intervention with respect to university teaching and learning, scholarly research, and entrepreneurship enhances the contribution of universities to regional economic growth. We test this theory using data from the United Kingdom’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), an evaluation of the research impact of British higher education institutions. We find that business school graduates, as well as graduates in STEM and health fields, have a positive impact on regional human capital development. On the other hand, stakeholder influence, through the REF, appears to have a negative effect on the retention of human capital but a positive effect on commercialization in the region. Our findings provide new evidence of positive economic spillovers arising from university research and education and the role of fields, such as business administration, in enhancing human capital development and economic growth. They also lend credence to the notion that graduates are an important channel of knowledge and technology transfer. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

However, odds are that such arrangements will be filled with tensions that characterize the academic–practitioner gap. Against this background, our study investigates how academics and practitioners’ micro-practices shape turning points in response to paradox in six collaborations. We assume a process ontology and employ a comparative case study approach to explore the evolving relationships between academics and practitioners in collaborative settings through 34 semi-structured interviews conducted during the second year of joint work in a social program. Our findings demonstrate how small and seemingly mundane acts at the micro level can affect turning points during the collaborative process by shaping their trajectories. With their day-to-day actions, our informants created significant change in organizational settings characterized by paradox. We found that multiple independent paths to generative responses to paradox exist. However, cultures of impactful collaboration do not evolve quickly and are not attributable to single discrete events. We propose a process model of turning points in academic–practitioner collaborations and offer implications for both theory and practice. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Previous research has found that EPA is lower for women than for men, which is related to the acknowledged gap between women and men in entrepreneurial activity. The present work builds on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine how nine different entrepreneurship-focused academic activities in school impact on students' EPA, paying special attention to gender differences. We use a sample of 918 students from a French business school to analyze gender differences in the mechanisms based on ELM central and peripheral routes to promote EPA through academic activities. Post hoc tests are also performed to explore differences by gender at various academic levels. The results have important implications for academic institutions wishing to promote entrepreneurship, since we unpack entrepreneurial education into individual academic activities. In particular, results suggest that students' gender and academic level should be considered when designing activities to promote entrepreneurship. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

This invalid practice occurs because of confusion about the definition and measurement of impact at different levels of analysis. Specifically, JIF is a journal-level measure of impact, computed by aggregating citations of individual articles (i.e., upward effect), and is therefore inappropriate when measuring impact at lower levels of analysis, such as that of individual researchers, or of individual articles published in a particular journal (i.e., downward effect). We illustrate the severity of the errors that occur when using JIF to evaluate individual scholarly impact, and advocate for an immediate moratorium on the exclusive use of JIF and other journal-level (i.e., higher level of analysis) measures when assessing the impact of individual researchers and individual articles (i.e., lower level of analysis). Given the importance and interest in assessing the scholarly impact of researchers and articles, we delineate level-appropriate and readily available measures. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
IMPACT AND UNIVERSITY BUSINESS TRAINING COURSES DELIVERED TO THE MARGINALIZED: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,2022,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140232787&doi=10.5465%2famle.2021.0244&partnerID=40&md5=6c5f3fd9aaa2e52a3b87949e775c8a56,"Scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and accreditors challenge business schools to extend their impact beyond academia and into the real world. Many management academics have responded by becoming involved in business training programs that seek to improve the well-being of marginalized individuals. However, work that conceptualizes and measures the efficacy of these activities has not been systematically analyzed. In this article, we provide the first review. We find that the research is dominated by examinations of short-term, individual-level outcomes, such as securing employment. Yet little is written about the impact of business training programs (especially over time) at either a collective or system level. We use our review to argue for theoretically informed approaches to redress this gap, highlighting underemphasized directions for future research. We also provide recommendations to assist program design, noting that good practice involves hybrid models of education that build capacity within marginalized communities. Further, program designs ought to support broader social goals, such as helping these communities to thrive. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
STUDENT CHEATING GONE INTERNATIONAL: THE ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE IN AFFECTING THE FATE OF THE DEVIANT,2022,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149470995&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0557&partnerID=40&md5=54b964f9bce0b5046856ecdce3ccc42e,"The continuing internationalization of business education offers MBA students a unique cross-cultural environment in which to develop their business acumen. This pluralistic context can produce uncertainty regarding appropriate ethical norms among the cohort, and uncertainty in how students react to peers who are perceived to violate ethical norms. In this paper, we explore the violation of ethical norms through peer reactions to academic cheating and examine the effects of peer ostracization on perceived cheaters' overall academic performance. We further explore how cultural intelligence may help cheaters avoid their peers' social sanctions. In a three-part longitudinal study of an international MBA cohort, we predict and find that cheating leads to diminished academic performance, mediated by a reduction in friendship ties. Moreover, we find that cultural intelligence moderates the loss of friendship ties, attenuating the negative effect of reduced friendship ties on performance. In general, our findings suggest that peers can apply effective social sanctions to those they perceive as violating social norms, but that the impact of such sanctions may be lessened by the deviant individuals' cultural intelligence. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Yet the mechanisms through which abstract management concepts are built from embodied practice require further exploration. How individuals work reflexively through bodily practices in their evolving understandings of management, and the implications of these practices for learner agency and control of the body, are not well-understood. By examining an empirical case of a yoga-based leadership course, we explore how reflexive embodied practices ground leadership concept development. Focusing on embodied analogy as our analytical lens, we explore how participants mapped abstract concepts through bodily postures, inner sensations of bodily intensity, and reflection on bodily experience. We explore three mechanisms by which embodied leadership concepts were constructed-performative analogization, intentionality through bodily intensity, and unlearning by analogization-highlighting the role of analogy in enacting reflexive embodied practices around leadership. We discuss the implications for pedagogies of embodiment, while theorizing the critical implications of techniques of the body for understanding management learning. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We challenge ideas that the curriculum should be the almost sole focus of attention with regard to the relevance of management education. Rather, what is more important is students’ meaning-making, accompanied by emotion, and how these result at least in part from the degree to which course materials and activities affect students’ academic self-concepts and identities. These, in turn, affect the extent to which students experience self-enhancement and self-protection, and all of these are conditioned by the social nature of the classroom. We illustrate this argument through three vignettes. In addition, we show the applicability of, and extend, Pelz’s (1978) three types of usefulness of research findings (instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic) for classroom settings, especially in light of meaning-making and emotions. Finally, we discuss what this recognition requires of management educators and suggest strategies that management educators can consider for playing a more proactive role in cultivating students’ meaningful engagement with course materials. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

As management scholars and teachers, we need to know our stuff. Our relationship with expertise, however, is tricky. Observers have expressed frustration with our field's epistemological perspective and wondered why existing ways of knowing and teaching are so resistant to change. One plausible explanation is that how we enact expertise in management studies makes sense-literally. That is, prevailing forms of expert behavior help professors construct and protect sensical understandings of self in relation to others. Drawing on constructive-developmental theory, I treat scholarship and teaching as meaning-making activities. Subject-object fusion in the context of the professor-expertise relationship means that many of us do not so much have our expertise as we are our expertise. This essay explores how meaning-making structures interact with the demands of academia to sustain disciplinary commitments to traditional ways of knowing and teaching. We are limited by commitments to expertise we have ourselves enacted. Many professors feel stuck; this essay outlines a path toward getting unstuck. I explain how a distinct double-loop learning methodology designed to promote subject-object separation can enhance our capacity to make meaning in more expansive ways, such that we have our expertise without it having us. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We draw on studies from both linguistics and sociology to develop a conceptual framework that explains how language affects the institutional and social processes involved in the evolution of academic fields. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the evolution of organization studies (OS). It includes a textual analysis of the field's communication of research knowledge to the academic community over a 50-year period, a review of the institutional and social processes that shaped the field's research development, and an examination of how the words used to communicate OS knowledge affected those evolutionary processes. Because OS evolved mainly in professional business schools, it also creates knowledge for practitioners. We further explore how the language used to communicate OS knowledge to students and practitioners shaped the practice side of the field's evolution. This linguistic perspective clarifies the growing divergence between OS's research and practice sides and suggests how they might be strategically aligned for the field's successful development. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

There is an ethical position that, if we could contribute to policy change impacting on work, society, and environment, then some of our resource and effort should be focused in this way, to bring the benefits of our research to the world of policy and practice and to gain insights about the use and potential direction of our research. We argue that there are significant cultural incompatibilities between academia and policymaking, but we propose an approach that establishes a learning zone in which key cultural rules are suspended (not “solved”) and groups can contribute input and extract learning insights as if they were collaborating with shared understanding, when this may only partially be the case. We explore the theoretical grounds and design principles for this new kind of learning zone, which we term the “paradox box.” © 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.",,

Analyses of 206 students in 47 project teams revealed that the density of team advice-seeking networks was positively related to collaborative norms. In contrast, the centralization of advice-seeking networks was negatively associated with collaborative norms when the level of perceived expertness of the central member in the team was higher. Subsequently, collaborative norms had a positive effect on both student learning and project performance. The findings suggest that research on team-based learning effectiveness can be advanced by attending to the norming process for collaboration, through which network structure shapes learning and performance in teams. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We examine how, by distancing ourselves from this concept of a “relevance gap” to be crossed by academics translating their research outputs for practice, additional modes of scholarship may lead to impact. We present the findings of a multimethod qualitative study of the management practices of DBA graduates and add to an understanding of scholarly impact, proposing that through teaching, academics can develop managers who generate impact without requiring a translation of original research or without an academic working alongside them. Our theoretical contribution is a processual view of the interweaving of scholarship and practice, drawing on the ontological stance of Mary Parker Follett. This conceptualization of interweaving leads to a new understanding of the scholar-practitioner that eschews current dualist framings of scholarship plus practice to one of scholarship with practice. We also add to the literature on the DBA by showing that graduates of the program have the potential to be these scholar-practitioners. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Not only has business contributed to these problems but it also plays an important role in addressing them. Problems are “wicked” because they are embedded in complex systems that are continuously evolving. As no single actor can understand and solve a wicked problem, prior research has suggested that multiple actors, such as researchers and managers, come together to cocreate solutions. The cocreation process typically relies on the existing knowledge of the actors involved in the process. Yet, the dynamic nature of wicked problems requires actors to not just rely on cocreating on past knowledge but to cocreate tools that address future emerging or evolving problems. In this paper we seek to explain how researchers and managers can cocreate forward to address wicked problems. We illustrate the concept of cocreating forward through an innovation lab located at a Canadian business school. The lab brings together researchers, managers, and practitioners from various sectors to cocreate corporate innovation processes for addressing wicked problems. By cocreating forward, we show that research, learning, and practice need not be sequential but rather simultaneous activities. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

It has been argued that having a paradox mindset can help individuals to work creatively and productively with tensions to produce solutions. Increasingly, paradox scholars have also begun to highlight the relational element of paradox mindsets, or how we work through paradoxes with others. Less explored, however, is how individuals examine paradoxes through collective processes that help them to understand the tensions they are experiencing. This paper offers a deliberative approach to paradox mindsets that integrates individual development with the novel forms of collective deliberation that are a feature of democratic organizations (those that use collective and deliberative decision-making procedures). Based on the learning processes involved in our own experiences in setting up a democratic organization, we consider how paradoxes became more salient through collective collaboration with experienced practitioners within the field. We offer suggestions to how management education can be developed to help practitioners begin the process of learning to live with, and indeed thrive collectively in, paradoxical situations. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Part of this progression stems from the simultaneous growth of business school accreditation bodies, which offer third-party endorsement that schools adhere to high standards and engage in continuous improvement. For these accredited schools, the development of a well-articulated mission statement and subsequent delivery on its tenets are integral components of accreditation success. Thus, the current study uses signaling theory as a framework for understanding howmission statement content provides essential information regarding unobservable performance-related qualities of the institution to stakeholders using a sample of 253 Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB) accredited business schools fromoutside the United States. Consistentwith signaling theory, the results demonstrate thatmission statements act as a complex rhetorical bundle of signals or signal set that conveys credible performance-related information and reduces information asymmetry between the institution and its stakeholders. Overall, the study examines mission statement practices from AACSB accredited business schools outside of the United States and offers critical practical implications and suggestions for future research as business education expands internationally. © 2022 George Washington University.

Teams with charters saw improved process performance metrics only at the forming stage of team development. They also reported higher conflict levels. However, more conflict did not negatively affect peer evaluations or teamoutput quality, suggesting that such conflict was not entirely negative. Team charter use was not directly associated with output quality,measured as the final report's grade. However, teamnational diversitymoderated the solution creativity presented in the team's final report. These findings suggest team charters may initially aid process improvement but not necessarily the quality of output. We propose that the difference between the two groups studied is essentially one of formal written contracting versus informal psychological contracting, defined as a set of unwritten expectations of team members with regard to team behaviors and goals. These two forms of contracting provide for equifinality (the same result) in performance over the lifecycle of a project. The study contributes to research on team charter use, particularly with respect to formal versus informal psychological contracting within the context of global virtual teams. © 2022 George Washington University.

In this essay, we explore the strengths and limitations but also the neglect of George Herbert Mead's analysis of self and identity for developing a pedagogy that facilitates critical management learning. Through a sociology of knowledge, we trace this neglect to earlier research wherein, with limited exceptions, Marxian inspired critical research tended to eschew a concern with processes of the self-formation of subjects. We argue that Mead's ideas on reflexivity and indeterminacy are central to learning to think differently, which is the benchmark for teaching from a critical management perspective. Drawing on Michel Foucault's ideas, we theorize identity work in the context of power/knowledge relations in ways that help us to transform our pedagogy. Overall, we seek to challenge not only our students but also ourselves in reflecting on identity work to facilitate ways of thinking and feeling differently in teaching and learning. © 2022 George Washington University.

This essay outlines the risks and rewards associated with interdisciplinary scholarship within the context of business schools.

Sharing examples from the authors' journeys as ECAs from different disciplinary backgrounds who study leadership and management through interdisciplinary approaches,we identify four challenges to interdisciplinarity that ECAs face and propose four corresponding solutions at both the individual and structural levels. Our goal is to inform, inspire, and engage ECAs who want to pursue interdisciplinary research, while encouraging senior scholars, department chairs, and deans to foster interdisciplinarity in their departments and schools.We urge individual ECAs to be proactive in managing their promotion and tenure process, and departments to develop a more flexible understanding and evaluation of interdisciplinary scholarship. © 2022 George Washington University.

Building on action regulation theory, we model the feedback loop as a recursive cycle of changes in the business opportunity, goals, performance outcomes, and feedback. Furthermore, we hypothesize that error orientation and monitoring can strengthen or weaken the cycle, and that going through the feedback loop during training explains short- and long-term training outcomes. To test our hypotheses, we collected data before, during, and after an entrepreneurship training program. Results support our hypotheses, suggesting that the feedback loop of the opportunity development process is a concept that can explain why entrepreneurship training is effective. © 2022 George Washington University.

We study their internationalization by examining the process that led to Harvard Business School's first international strategy and its first foreign direct investment. The study elaborates how internationalization theories are applicable to research on the internationalization of business schools by exploring the role of environment and agency. The analysis shows that in an academic organization characterized as a loosely coupled system, individuals may influence the collective cognition in a strategy process by using newtheoretical insights to conceptualize experiences and legitimize decisions. This demonstrates that agency is a multifaceted concept, and its function depends on who has agency and how it is used. By exploring how a new academic discipline, international business, contributed to both the conceptualization and the legitimization of a new strategy, the study provides new insight into the process that leads to the formation of an international strategy. © 2022 George Washington University.

In investigating whether and how online mindfulness training works, and which students it most benefits, we conducted a large quasi-experiment with a custom-designed active control group (physical exercise) and multiple waves of data collected over two semesters of an academic year. Results show that online mindfulness training improved psychological well-being by helping students cultivate authenticity, but that such rewards were only realized by those who were relatively high in trait conscientiousness. In presenting our theory and findings, we shed new light on the role of personality in helping management students integrate experiential learning into their sense of self, and we offer novel, practical, and empirically substantiated guidance to management educators on how to help students develop authenticity and psychological well-being through an innovative, engaging, and ready-made online solution that requires little extra effort or cost to implement. © 2022 George Washington University.

Participants were asked to read a relevant business ethics case, identify critical causes and constraints, forecast downstream consequences, and provide a final decision for the problem. Furthermore, participants reflected on various components of the case in a written format. All responses were content-coded by raters blind to the study's hypotheses. Findings indicated that students with SL experience utilized many more ethical sensemaking strategies to aid in the EDM process than the control group, demonstrated increased consideration for the welfare of others, and their reflections considered community needs and discussed personal goals and values. Additionally, an exploratory analysis revealed the impact of reflection on EDM. Specifically, quality of participants' reflections and their consideration of community needs within those reflections positively predicted EDM. The implications of these findings for understanding the impact of SL and reflective activities in teaching business ethics are discussed. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
REVISITING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COACHING AND LEARNING: THE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES,2022,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142635197&doi=10.5465%2famle.2019.0345&partnerID=40&md5=65c50b2065ba14d8c29ef09eb4eade72,"There is considerable interest in how coaching contributes to the education and development of managers, especially when it is claimed that learning is at the heart of coaching. However, with limited explicit consideration of theories of learning in the coaching literature, there is the temptation to fall back on habitual practice or to cherry-pick as coaching tools and techniques proliferate. There is a danger that both academics and practitioners will overlook the implicit worldviews underpinning different theories of learning that have contrasting implications for the ontological “reality” of the coaching issue being considered, the epistemological focus of the coaching inquiry and role of the coach, as well as the axiological purpose or fundamental value of coaching. In this essay, I expose four learning theories to scrutiny as a call to researchers and coaches to consider more explicitly the possibilities and problems of learning theories for coaching. I also call for greater engagement with a more extensive repertoire of learning theories, including more reflexive social and critical perspectives, to help develop additional innovative coaching practice. This appeal aims to enhance the rigor of the coaching discipline as well as inform debates about other strategies purporting to enhance management education and development. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
DECOLONIZING THE BUSINESS SCHOOL: RECONSTRUCTING THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP CLASSROOM THROUGH INDIGENIZING PEDAGOGY AND LEARNING,2022,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120324027&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0366&partnerID=40&md5=16f9fa6ba93c3a07578a9711166d0322,"Decolonization is an ongoing process of addressing power imbalances and knowledge hierarchies that require critical self-reflection from those teaching in business schools today (Joy & Poonamallee, 2013; Smith, 2012). As educators, if we are to take decolonizing seriously, we must create space for Indigenous Peoples to reconnect and engage with their own knowledge systems and ways of knowing. We present a teaching and learning case in entrepreneurship that explores an indigenizing process thatmakes visible Indigenous knowledge frameworks, practices and language in a business school classroom. Drawing on the suggestions from extant literature that research examining business school education should include micro-level studies, we examine the use of a virtual learning platformby Indigenous students engaged in entrepreneurship education. Three specific questions are addressed: (a) Whatmight indigenizing look like? (b) How is learning created that supports active indigenizing practices? and (c) What is the role of the business school educator in the indigenizing journey? In answering these questions, we explore how Indigenous knowledge and wisdom can thrive alongside Western knowledge in a decolonized business school, and, in so doing, be part of the widermovement of decolonization of academia and society. © 2022 George Washington University.

In this study we pay particular attention to the community of scholars involved in entrepreneurial education. The aim of the paper is to explore how scholars within the field have integrated into larger scholarly communities. Based on a unique database and Web-based responses from 313 entrepreneurial education scholars, we demonstrate that scholars within the field exhibit great variety in their scientific outlooks and appreciation of communication systems. However, we find that the field consists of four scholarly communities characterized by a specific combination of scholarly inspirations, favorite meeting places, and publication channels, of which three clusters are anchored in the field of entrepreneurship, and only one cluster shows a strong entrepreneurial education research identity. Finally, the results indicate a low consolidation across the scholarly communities, which highlights the need for reflections on how the field can achieve increased integration and cohesion in the future. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

It has important implications for the activities, strategies, structures, and decision-making processes of firms. Yet despite its undeniable impact on management, migration has been all but ignored in business school teaching curricula. In this essay, we seek to make two contributions. First, we clarify the grounds for integrating migration issues into management education. Second, we delineate how to achieve this. Specifically, we suggest that teaching migration as a threshold concept can provide a way to reshape students’ ways of thinking about the complex and often paradoxical relationships between companies, nation states, intergovernmental organizations, civil society, and industry.

Under the illusory veneer of retaining control over algorithmic reckoning, we are concerned that algorithmic reckoning may substitute human judgment in decision-making and thereby change morality in fundamental, perhaps irreversible ways. We present an ontological critique of artificially intelligent algorithms to show what is going on “under their hood,” especially in cases when human morality is already co-constituted with algorithmic reckoning. We advance a twofold call for (in)action. First, we offer a call for inaction as far as the substitution of judgment for reckoning through our teaching in business schools and beyond is concerned. Second, we advance a reinvigorated call for action-in particular, to teach more pragmatist judgment in our curricula across subjects to foster social life (rather than stifle it through algorithmic reckoning). © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Specifically, we consider how material objects can shape team learning processes. We conducted an inductive qualitative study exploring how teams in an undergraduate strategy course worked together using two types of material objects: (a) whiteboards and (b) flip charts. Our findings indicate that how students interact with material objects when participating in team learning processes is influenced by four properties: (a) object location (static, mobile), (b) record-keeping (temporary, permanent), (c) form (whole, segmented), and (d) sensory awareness. These properties were found to afford student teams different possibilities for using the object which, in turn, shapes team learning processes through the level of agency over embodied learning, the nature of problem-solving behaviors (expansionist or reductionist), and approach to conceptual understanding (synergistic or discrete). The study contributes nuanced insight into the role of material objects in team learning processes and has pedagogical and practical implications for researchers and educators.

Seeking to recenter the Global South in the making of these histories, this paper aims to analyze the history of BS in Brazil via dependency studies. Dependency is the condition of a hierarchical relationship between two or more economies that become entangled for the benefit of the richer countries. Dependency studies aim to examine dependent conditions prevailing since colonial times to overcome them. We analyze the creation and dissemination of five BS from 1937 to 1961, a period marked by the emergence of the first undergraduate courses in the field and a heavy push towards industrial development in the country. We argue that dependency macro factors were the main drivers behind the creation, implementation, and dissemination of BS in Brazil. We posit local agents performed dependency ambiguity, that is, exploring context drivers within the Brazilian technological-industrial dependency and seeking external support to establish early BS in the country. We claimthat through dependency lenseswe can reposition the narratives about the development of BS in the Global South away from a U.S.- centric explanation, emphasizing the role of local contextual factors and actors within Global South countries dependency longue duree. © 2021 George Washington University.

A total of 285 students participated in a peer-feedback assessment process twice during their MBA program. Results show that promotion-focused individuals evaluate themselves at higher levels and receive higher peer ratings of teamleadership than do prevention-focused individuals. Interestingly,we also found that regulatory focus has a moderating effect on satisfaction with the feedback process and on leadership improvement. Promotion-focused individuals were equally satisfied with positive and negative feedback but improved their leadership ratings after receiving positive feedback (high peer ratings). In contrast, prevention-focused individuals showed satisfaction only with positive feedback and showed no improvement in their leadership skills regardless of the type of feedback. We include implications of results for research on regulatory focus and feedback, as well as their practical implications for leadership development. © 2021 George Washington University.

In this paper, I trace the historical trajectory of MO education from the traditional era, wherein ancient civilizations, empires, and kingdoms rife with commerce, education, and epistemologies were displaced, during the modern era, by colonialism and European domination, which contributed to the adoption and focus on Western education (management practice and knowledge systems). In the post-modern era, I propose reconfiguration of MO education based on greater societal embeddedness and a circular structure-integration of formal, nonformal, and informal education-consistent with the traditional principles and values of Africa on business conduct and education. I contend that the knowledge arising fromthe reconfiguration ismore likely to be relevant and meaningful to themultiple constituents of Africa. It will also enable MO scholarship in the future to help rebalance the extant epistemic tilt. © 2021 George Washington University. All rights reserved.",,

To generate knowledge, one can rely not only on independent observation but also on methods that draw directly on lived experience. I detail how a lyrical approach can open us up to new experiences, new voices, and new ideas. Lyric is complementary to history and narrative, as well, since it does not depend on plot or story or events. Instead, the knowledge it captures is that of a lived experience- immediate, interior, intense. I provide several examples of how lyric can be used in management and organizational studies to broaden our experiences and understanding. © 2021 George Washington University. All rights reserved.",,

Espoused learning practices engage a top-down causal approach involving goal-setting and identifying resources, while enacted learning practices involve a bottom-up effectuation process that is about discovery, improvisation and reflexivity. For the first contribution, I offer a more nuanced view of learning practices in the formof practices for learning that involves 'doing to learn'. The second provides insight from the coalescence between sociomateriality and self-directed learning to shape bespoke practices for learning in support of early-career success. Third, I offer more granularity to the notion of learning careers.

We suggest that the service-dominant logic (SDL) allows us to shed light on these concerns and advance this debate. In SDL, value creation is an emergent process, and co-production, co-creation and value-in-use are central dimensions in this process. This focus on process represents a departure from the traditional business schools' position, which conceptualizes value as an output. Some schools have begun to embrace process through collaborative engagement such as engaged scholarship, service-learning or the public value model. However, SDL allows us to demonstrate that these approaches tend to focus on co-production and miss opportunities to extend value creation activities by engaging with a more diverse set of stakeholders as part of the value creation process. We contend that business schools' strategies need to shift towards developing more direct and intense interaction with their stakeholders. In so doing, they can help support, create and maintain unique value in use for these stakeholders on an ongoing basis. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Examining the impact of distributed ethical training and individual characteristics on ethical decision-making,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088049631&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2018.0157&partnerID=40&md5=5331991c5f12e47649b4d26eeeccf334,"In this study we examine multiple antecedents of business students' ethical decision-making. We first describe, and examine the effectiveness of, an ethical training program in which ethical reasoning skills are taught across the undergraduate curriculum in multiple courses and via extracurricular and cocurricular activities. We find that exposure to this distributed method of ethical training is significantly related to improvements in ethical decision-making among graduating seniors. Second, we examine the impact of personality traits and personal values on ethical decision-making, and find that conscientiousness and universalism values are positively related to ethical decision-making while power values are negatively related. Finally, we examine whether personality interacts with training, and find that more conscientious students benefit more from ethical training. Our results suggest that ethical training programs can have beneficial impacts on ethical decision-making, and that individual characteristics-both traits and values-also influence ethical decision-making. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
It⇔s not a lonely journey: Research collaboration strategies for knowledge production with allies,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109457154&doi=10.5465%2famle.2020.0318&partnerID=40&md5=4cc827a9ac9fd64e58c4d3c114762da5,"This article examines research collaboration in business schools for knowledge production with allies. It is based on a qualitative study that shows how and why researchers collaborate in their research and how their relationships with key allies—organizations and students—vary according to the collaboration strategy used. The study draws from personal interviews with business school researchers and explores the worth experienced through their relationships with allies. The article offers contributions to two discussions. First, it adds to the discussion on research collaboration in business schools’ knowledge production by identifying three research collaboration strategies: fair play, organic dialogue, and efficiency template. Second, and importantly, the article extends the discussion of values in business school research beyond the type of knowledge produced (what) and its audience (for whom) by examining with whom, how, and why researchers produce knowledge. To make business school research more impactful, we suggest that business schools should pay more attention to teaching collaboration skills and understanding the variety of values that can underpin them.

Business school professors' teaching approaches and how they change,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103570007&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2018.0018&partnerID=40&md5=be53a33966f2ba94497957a4d32ca655,"This study investigates business school professors' approaches to teaching, how those approaches change over the course of their careers, and to what extent they perceive those changes as growth. Building on the phenomenographic tradition of educational research, we interviewed forty-nine professors at four business schools. We found four teaching approaches based on the educators' primary objective: (1) student satisfaction, (2) educator satisfaction, (3) short-term student learning, or (4) long-term student learning. These four teaching approaches can be placed on a continuum indicating a growing awareness of potential tensions between these four objectives. Rather than switching completely from one objective to the next, educators in the sample balanced those tensions by monitoring several objectives at the same time. The most sophisticated teaching approach was multifocal and integrated the four objectives. These results enable us to contribute to current higher education theories on teaching approaches and, more specifically, on the distinction between student-centered and teacher-centered approaches as well as the process of changing teaching approaches. Practical implications relate to the importance of student evaluations of teaching, the assessment of long-term impacts of management education, and the developmental activities business schools could offer to promote teaching excellence. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Our argument is grounded in practice theory and draws on Bourdieu's concept of field. We examine the effect of metrics, targets, and rankings on human resource development, a conjunctive field associated with the management learning and education (MLE) field. We examine the ways in which boundaries of the MLE field are shaped by journal ranking lists and how, irrespective of seniority in the field, scholars simultaneously experience both power and powerlessness as a result of journal ranking processes. We contribute a new perspective on issues of academic practice with consequences for specialized areas of scholarship. We conclude by proposing practical interventions that senior scholars and journal editors can undertake to challenge the undesirable effects of ranking systems and encourage scholarly diversity. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
"Challenging social inequality in the global south: Class, privilege, and consciousness-raising through critical management education",2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109464699&doi=10.5465%2famle.2019.0294&partnerID=40&md5=c6761425b02b8b5dafe6aabe04328884,"In this article, we study the nexus between class privilege and social inequality through management education. To do so, we conducted exercises with management students at an elite private business school in the Global South (i.e., Pakistan) with the specific intent to invoke reflexivity among these students about their own class privilege. These exercises prompted students of elite socioeconomic backgrounds to consider how they relate to toilet cleaners—those untouchables doing the most culturally stigmatized of work in Pakistani society. Drawing on findings from the exercises, we sought to answer two interrelated questions: How is class privilege enacted to reproduce social inequality through discursive identity-making processes by which individuals make sense of self and other? and What are the possibilities for reflexivity in business school settings to disrupt, or otherwise undo, the cultural taken-for-grantedness of class privilege? By juxtaposing these two questions against the toilet as the empirical location, we illuminate the subversive power of knowledge produced at the most marginal of sites. This study identifies pedagogical trajectories through which to move toward redressing social inequality in the Global South specifically, and contributes to important debates in the field of critical management education on the significance of reflexivity more broadly.

Negotiating a sense of fit in elite higher education: Exploring the identity work of ⇜widening participation⇝ students,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099164733&doi=10.5465%2famle.2019.0358&partnerID=40&md5=3067388845bce582b7789015cdb7a020,"Elite higher education institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States are under increasing pressure to intensify their widening participation (WP) efforts and improve access for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and other underrepresented groups. Through a case study of business and law students who participated in a WP scheme at an elite university in the United Kingdom, we examine how WP candidates undertake identity work to negotiate a sense of fit in an elite higher education setting. We make two theoretical contributions. First, we show the complex identity work that social minorities undertake to negotiate a sense of fit in diversifying organizations—dynamically backgrounding and foregrounding their minority identity as the situation befits. Second, we illustrate how diversity and inclusion practices form an integral component of a higher education institution’s identity workspace to crucially shape the identity work that social minorities undertake to negotiate a sense of fit, illuminating how an elite university’s inclusive practices facilitate the rhetoric of diversity and enable elite higher education institutions to maintain their exclusive status. We also discuss the practical implications of our findings. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
Embodied phronetic pedagogy: Cultivating ethical and moral capabilities in postgraduate business students,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103540055&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2019.0034&partnerID=40&md5=e867c415034c1b0a79f56b4f7197e491,"Scholars have debated the issue of how to improve business ethics education so that it impacts managerial practice. We contribute to this discussion by proposing a pedagogy that we denominate “embodied phronesis.” We developed the pedagogy and applied it for over five years at an Australian business school. Embodied phronesis is based on experiential learning and cultivates students' ethical-moral capabilities by integrating normative aspects (a reflection on ethical principles informing decisions), behavioral factors (the role of emotions and preconscious reactions in shaping ethical behavior), and social determinants (a consideration of power relations enabling and constraining ethical practice in organizations). To understand the impact of this pedagogy, we analyze reflective diaries written by postgraduate business students who completed a course designed according to these principles. We find that embodied phronesis enables students to shift from a technical, values-free conception of managerial action to a view of management as ethical and moral practice. Our pedagogy allows students to deal with the complexities inherent in business ethics while simultaneously illustrating that there are not simple answers to the problem of how to be ethical in a business context. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
"Attention, please: How the attention-related stories we tell our students in class influence their performance at work",2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103571848&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2018.0325&partnerID=40&md5=548a727ba6eaefa45bb1e9642f98b199,"In recent years, two narratives surrounding attention in the workplace have generated much discussion in academia and the popular press. The first concerns the value of “mindfulness” and the practices associated with it-most notably, meditation. The second involves the claim that our ability to pay attention has reached a crisis point. In this paper, I consider the nature and theoretical foundations of these stories and suggest that despite their insights, each one carries unappreciated limitations in the context of management education. To help our students marshal their attention more effectively in the workplace, I argue that we need to start offering additional narratives based on what are termed qualities of attention. To make this case, I explore the implications and potential workplace consequences of the two common narratives mentioned above. I then lay the groundwork for telling a new story, one focused on specific qualities of attention we can teach our students to cultivate; namely, attentional stability and attentional vividness. I conclude with an appeal to fellow management educators to consider reshaping the current classroom discourse around attention in order to better inspire and equip our students for the workplace. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Business schools and hubris: Cause or cure?,2021,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102510838&doi=10.5465%2famle.2019.0289&partnerID=40&md5=96a9caa3f4660c5603170ff6257ed543,"The attributes of hubris are over-confidence, arrogance, pride, and contempt for the advice and criticism of others. Hubris is fuelled by prior successes and media praise and aided and abetted by complicit followership. It manifests as recklessness and is potentially destructive in that it creates the conditions for unintended negative consequences to arise, leading potentially to destructive outcomes for individuals, organizations, and entire industries. Given the possibility of destructive outcomes emanating from hubris, its prevention and cure through management learning and education could be an important way of tempering the risks associated with a hubris hazard in business. In this essay we offer the ""provocation""that business schools may have contributed inadvertently to the emergence of hubris, and a ""proposal""that management learning and education is an important means for preventing hubris from taking hold in business. In doing so, we contribute to ongoing debates about business school epistemologies, curricula and pedagogies, and about the nature and purpose of business education and the institution of university business schools. We offer novel theoretical and practical contributions regarding epistemic hubris and epistemic humility, the status of humility as ameta-virtue, and howit may be possible to temper hubris by educating for humility.  © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Experiential learning and the moral duty of business schools,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089781957&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2018.0335&partnerID=40&md5=0607e934f96b869a4c181aa286e90fec,"To support the types of learning outcomes that management students need in today's organizations, business schools increasingly call for faculty to engage in experiential pedagogy. However, teaching practices that are consistent with experiential pedagogy deliberately engage students' emotions and may breach expected teaching norms. We discuss what we believe are the unaddressed moral responsibilities of business schools that advocate for and embed experiential pedagogy in their programs. We frame business schools' experiential pedagogy advocacy as an explicit moral duty (Hosmer, 1995), arguing that a dilemma exists in encouraging experiential-teaching approaches without knowing how faculty use them and what student safeguards are in place. Drawing on Nicolini's (2012) practice theory, we describe experiential pedagogy as teaching practices, structures, and rules that would benefit from community-based standards. We conclude with recommendations for crafting an experiential-teaching community of practice, delineating important research questions by which to develop this community. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Hannah arendt and the raising of conscience in business schools,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099202927&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2020.0147&partnerID=40&md5=b19b61a55a44367cff36158abef6ecb4,"Business schools should be grounded in questions of meaning, not knowledge. Using this basic distinction, inspired by Hannah Arendt, I argue the scientific (e.g., economic and financial theory), moral (e.g., codes of conduct) and practical (e.g., training) forms of knowledge being taught in business schools corrode students' ability to think. They are corrosive because they are unthinkingly governed by a singular view of education: To instill habits that eliminate mystery, thereby making the world a more certain place. The aim is to realize organizational conditions of control, order, and uniformity, which in management practice equates to the conscious pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness. Given the extensive critique of this pursuit, both in terms of its hubris and of its pernicious effects on human relations and the wider environment, I ask “What if questions of knowledge were subsumed by ones of meaning?” Here, control, order, and uniformity make way for thoughtfulness. For Arendt, thinking is the capacity and willingness to refuse the monopolizing force of truth, and to keep truths in the company of their contraries. Education that institutes thinking rather than knowledge, encourages a plural, open awareness of a world that is, essentially, ungovernable. To relate to things thoughtfully, rather than knowledgably, is to develop what Arendt calls conscience. The conscience she speaks of is not a restraining force that pushes away untruths and installs certainty. Rather, it arises from the experience of questioning the certainties woven into human practices by considering how to begin them anew. If instituted though business schools, it places unruliness at the heart of management practice. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Ladders for learning: Is scaffolding the key to teaching problem-solving in technology-mediated learning contexts?,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099193084&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2018.0078&partnerID=40&md5=c4bcd634f3ad670930750813ad6ab7be,"The success of innovative teaching/learning approaches aiming to foster problem solving in management education depends on useful and easy-to-use IT components in the learning process. However, the complexity of problem solving in self-regulated learning approaches may overwhelm the learner and can lead to unsatisfying learning outcomes. Research suggests the implementation of technology-enhanced scaffolds as a mechanism to guide the learners in their individual problem-solving process to enhance their learning outcomes. We present a theoretical model based on adaptive structuration theory and cognitive load theory that explains how technology-enhanced scaffolding contributes to learning outcomes. We test the model with a fully randomized between-subject experiment in a flipped classroom for management education focusing on individual problem solving. Our results show that technology-enhanced scaffolding contributes significantly to the management of cognitive load as well as to learning process satisfaction and problem-solving learning outcomes. Thereby, our paper provides new conceptual and empirically tested insights for a better understanding of technology-enhanced scaffolds and their design to assist problem solving and its respective effects in flipped classrooms for management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Specifically, we propose a framework of coaching principles and narrative practices that can support leaders through the identity transitions of separation, liminality, and the integration of a new leader identity. In doing so, this paper provides actionable practices for coaching new leaders as well as directions for research on coaching and leader development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Given the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is imperative to comprehend how collaboration can be fostered in such Online Learning Environments (OLEs). Synthesizing theories on individual cognition and collective interaction, we advance separate research models for pre- and post-intention that differentiate between the antecedents affecting one's intention to collaborate in OLEs and the consequences arising from the manifestation of such collaborative intention. Hypothesized relationships were subsequently validated with survey data collected from a MOOC course. Analytical results reveal that participants' attitude and intention toward collaboration at the outset of the course are predicted by collaborative outcome expectancy and communal support expectancy, which in turn are precipitated on their perceived ability to work in groups (collaborative process efficacy) and peer influence (communal influence) respectively. Additionally, we uncover that collaborative intention influences course participants' inclination to engage in group work and its three ensuing pedagogical outcomes: a higher rate of retention for course participants, increased production of novel ideas, and an enhanced learning experience. By elucidating the individual and communal factors shaping one's engagement in collaborative processes, findings from this study attest to the impact of collaboration on learning and behavior within online learning environments. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Although governmental agencies are crucial actors that have unquestioned coercive power to influence the whole legitimation process, most studies mainly focus on their gatekeeping activities in the legitimation process, such as approval and rating, and little research has been done on how they influence the legitimation process at its outset. We conduct a case study on the development of Chinese business schools to investigate this problem. Based on the legitimacy theory of organizations, we identify two key legitimacy activities of governmental agencies-defining the desirability and appropriateness of judgments-in the legitimation process. These findings indicate that regulatory agents can play active roles in the legitimation process, rather than evaluating specific actions passively, as an observer, as indicated in existing studies. We also develop a process model of legitimation in which the governmental agencies play a dominant role and highlight the decisive function of national-level factors. The results contribute to the study on the legitimacy process in general as well as in the Chinese context, which has been rarely examined. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

How one evaluates managerial decision making will partly depend on what conception of the corporate function one endorses. Agency Theory and its accompanying shareholder conception of the corporate function has long dominated management. Voices in management learning have called for a change, but we argue that such change has been hampered by the lack of a theory of managerial deliberation, which is compatible with the alternative stakeholder conception of the corporate function. Here, we develop a novel theory of managerial deliberation: one that is suited to stakeholder theory. We argue that if genuine ethical deliberation is to become prevalent within management, then we must conceive of managerial deliberation as a creative, yet rational, learning process, while we assure that this process is adequately constrained to allow for managerial accountability. By taking inspiration from modern philosophical theories of deliberation, we provide such a theory of rational managerial deliberation. Copyright of the Academy of Management, All Rights Reserved.",,

Our leading hypothesis is that the commodification of rationality into its utility-driven manifestation expunged the application of epistemological doubt from it, which, because epistemological doubt was originally the precondition of rationality’s ethical, political, and societal potential, shut down access to this potential in the process. By tracing this process of commodification from Adam Smith to Max Weber’s critical diagnosis of it, we offer the suggestion of re-radicalizing rationality and thus re-introducing epistemological doubt to it to secure the future of academic management education.

The current failure to provide a comprehensive and systematic response to this transition does not result from a lack of reason, but is instead the manifestation of a generalized crisis in communication. Drawing from the work of Michel Serres, we analyze how the roots of this crisis lie with “parasite logic,” which has prevented reasoned responses to the Anthropocene. To work through this crisis, it is necessary to adopt different forms of reasoning and imagination to reshape the rational basis of management education. We propose to do this through an engagement with pataphysics, a science that subjects dominant modes of rationality to a divergent thinking of the absurd and proposing playful forms of reasoning. Pataphysics provides a mechanism for developing “imaginary solutions” to the current situation, which can disrupt anthropocentric forms of reason and reasoning, and further serve to slow down the endless cycles of inclusion and exclusion that arise from parasite logic. Finally, we propose slow design as an example of an “imaginary solution” that comes from this process of conceptual and practical deacceleration.

We develop a critique of the dominant and widespread conceptualization of heuristics as flawed and error-prone and argue that this poses unnecessary constraints for the field of management. We discuss consequences of that interpretation of bounded rationality and propose ecological rationality as an alternative, positive interpretation. Ecological rationality considers a decision maker’s environment and aims to identify how and when heuristics generate good outcomes. Evidence suggests that heuristics perform best when problems are ill-defined, many information cues are available, but they are not equally valuable, and there are many possible courses of action, that is, in the uncertain environments that are characteristic of managerial decision making. We contribute by (1) highlighting the distinctiveness of the ecological rationality framework for management learning, (2) acknowledging how it can help rehabilitate bounded rationality in the field of management against its widespread characterization as an inferior form of rationality; and (3) by identifying how it can provide practicable recommendations for managerial learning and decision making.

The Leviathan of rationality: Using film to develop creativity and imagination in management learning and education,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096476070&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2019.0197&partnerID=40&md5=ae6066cd2b4f38f563e79166b3200110,"Dogma is an ever-present danger to reason and rationality. In times of climate emergency and the dawn of a new geological era known as the Anthropocene, dogma becomes particularly disabling and dangerous for business and management. However, recent research findings in the study of creativity and imagination in management learning and education provide some promising ways of responding. Here I draw on techniques in experiential learning and contribute to the call for “disciplined imagination” (Weick, 1989) to explore what can be learned from the study of film for stimulating classroom creativity. The paper is devoted to a close analysis of Leviathan (2012), an experiential and avant-garde contemporary masterpiece in ethnographic filmmaking. I find that existing approaches to creativity need to be supplemented with greater attention to the technological apparatus of cinema and its affective materialities. Drawing on the work of Gilles Deleuze, this essay shows that cinema can produce what we call an event of thought. This requires the generation of original concepts, and we propose “becoming Go-Pro” to best harness the affects and heightened existential awareness stimulated by Leviathan and to help delimit the contours of this event. With this concept, we produce findings that challenge prevailing concepts of reason and rationality in management studies. Copyright of the Academy of Management, All Rights Reserved.",,
"Lessons from creating a business school for public good: Obliquity, waysetting, and wayfinding in substantively rational change",2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096461282&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2019.0195&partnerID=40&md5=4af4cf3e73f124fc4d11331ee0ea7764,"We apply Weber’s distinction between instrumental (outcome focused) and substantive (values driven) rationality to offer both a conceptually underpinned explanation for the mounting criticism of business schools and to provide the basis for a new business school model. We begin by extending Brewer’s (2013) treatise on the public good of social science to articulate a substantively rational public value business school. We then report how processes of waysetting, wayfinding, and strategic obliquity informed the iterative development of this approach at Cardiff Business School in the United Kingdom. Our case study illustrates the significant challenges and tensions that arise from trying to introduce a substantively rational approach and change process within an institutional context of instrumental rationality. Our analysis underscores the importance of combining both purposive action (away from the current) and substantively rational purposeful action (a direction of travel informed by particular values). It also highlights the potential for some business schools to combine substantive rationality with strategic obliquity in attempts to enhance public good through systemic, institutional change.

Diverse rationalities of entrepreneurship education: An epistemic stance perspective,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094174369&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2019.0201&partnerID=40&md5=3c3ee61b4774dae2eb2db06d904f3b8a,"There is a healthy skepticism regarding whether one can learn entrepreneurship in a business classroom setting. One unique challenge of entrepreneurship education is that at least to some degree, entrepreneurship involves disruptions of the usual business rules, norms, and models. Furthermore, entrepreneurship may not conform to the scientific management rationality that is promoted in most management education. This underscores a dilemma: In a business school, how do we teach a discipline that may not conform to our traditional ideas of rationality? Prior research has observed a variety of definitions and approaches taken to teaching entrepreneurship, yet scholars have given less consideration to how we are constructing and disseminating knowledge in entrepreneurship and the nature of rationality we are enacting during the educational process. In this field study, we show that three MBA programs address the challenge of entrepreneurship education by enacting distinct attitudes toward knowledge in entrepreneurship—or epistemic stances—each aligning with the notion of scientific rationality to a different extent. We offer the epistemic stance lens as a new avenue for understanding the practiced rationality of business education. Using this lens, we show the breadth of what is “rational” in entrepreneurship education beyond scientific management rationality. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
Management learning in historical perspective: Rediscovering rowntree and the British interwar management movement,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091801930&doi=10.5465%2famle.2018.0301&partnerID=40&md5=42370e0b8f86939a1f5b8c2e936da546,"British interwar management (1918-1939) has been criticized as overly conservative, comprising a core of progressive firms amid a mass of conservatively run, familydominated businesses. According to the dominant narrative, British firms exhibited little interest in new managerial approaches. Our study of the Rowntree business lectures and British interwar management movement challenges this view, suggesting British managers displayed greater openness to innovation than is commonly recognized. We uncover and analyze a network of British firms engaged in management education through organized peer-to-peer communication, facilitated by lectures and management research groups initiated by Seebohm Rowntree. Our primary contribution to the literature is to offer a more nuanced perspective on the evolution of British management learning in the interwar years. This reveals dynamic knowledge networks reflexively engaged in advancing and codifying practice-based learning to promote the diffusion of effective solutions to shared problems: building communities of practice, codifying management knowledge, and drawing on an ethos of ""business as service.""By undertaking archival research to create a coherent body of documentary material, and making this available to others, we also make a methodological contribution, creating a new ""space""for future researchers to explore, from which they can write new management histories of their own.  © 2020 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
How business students think about leadership: A qualitative study on leader identity and meaning-making,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092397653&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2017.0290&partnerID=40&md5=f77d27b2ca30ff68c24fb2e9a04fe764,"Business schools face increasing criticism for their one-size-fits-all approach to leadership development. Too much emphasis is placed on knowledge and skills building and the developmental needs of managers while insufficient attention is paid to purposeful student leadership development and to the underlying cognitive components that drive leadership development. The present study takes a cognitive approach to leadership development and explores how cognitive schemas of leadership manifest in students. We collected qualitative data from 510 undergraduate business students to analyze students' leader identity and its relatedness to their leadership-structure schema and implicit leadership theory. Results show that students' leader identity is related to their leadership-structure schema and their implicit leadership theory. More specifically, alignment between these cognitive schemas of leadership strengthens leader identity. In addition, results show that the content of the leadership-structure schema serves as a constraint or a catalyst for possible future alignment between the cognitive schemas of leadership. Implications for leadership development are discussed. © 2020 George Washington University. All rights reserved.",,

Our aim is to draw on the French psychodynamics of work perspective to argue that reflection on concrete experiences and processes of work is important because work has significant implications for workers' health and for society. We also use two vignettes to discuss the implications of French psychodynamics of work for the practice of critical management education. © 2020 George Washington University. All rights reserved.",,

Based on comprehensive data of French academics, we examine various factors-career-related and demographic factors like gender-that play a role in determining academic research performance in an increasingly global academia. The role of the English language is positively related to citations, but not to the volume of papers or their global or national recognition. Higher institutions' reputations were positively associated to number of papers, citations, and national recognition. Strikingly, there was no relationship with global recognition, suggesting that the reputation of institutions plays a role, but only insofar as the national context and without spillover into the global academic scene. Finally, men (as opposed to women) were over-performing both in publications' quality and quantity. Career experience had a positive effect, although this reduced gradually over time. Our findings can help individuals' career decision-making and institutional investment in human-capital. We offer an original contribution to facilitate the understanding of factors that may influence research performance outside of Anglo-Saxon academia by opening of the black box of knowledge development, exposing the role of academic publications and recognition. © 2020 George Washington University.

We build on this scholarly corpus to present-for the first time-a metahistory of the 20th century role of U.S. philanthropy in shaping management education around the world. Having outlined the meaning and purpose of ""periodization,""we propose three periods. First, within the US from the 1920s post-Progressive Era up to the 1960s, where philanthropic foundations used management education to address U.S. internal social problems and establish its economic preeminence worldwide. Second, Europe post-WWII to the 1980s, where management education was intended to enable Western European reconstruction and fight communism, and later to integrate the Soviet Bloc into the west. Third, the Third World from the post-1945 development era up until the onset of neoliberal globalization, where U.S. foundations' management education interventions sought the technocratic modernization of former subject nations. In each of these, we conclude, the U.S. foundations' programs for management education worked to preserve U.S. international interests, and promote U.S. ""soft power,""in ways unique to each time/place as well as in ways common across them.  © 2020 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Given that such journals insist on the primacy of theory development, we also increasingly resort to pretentious and long-winded prose to at least create the illusion of ""theory development.""The result is writing that can only be understood by those already on the inside of the debates it references.

This study explored how combining learning cycle theory with the perspective of knowledge types could enable scholars to better understand managerial knowledge processes. This model argues that learning processes may significantly affect the knowledge types obtained. The results showed that the learning processes experienced by learners have a positive influence on attaining knowledge types. Thus, learners can acquire all the types of particular knowledge through experiencing a complete learning cycle. © 2020 George Washington University. All rights reserved.",,

Some writers attribute the current state of undergraduate education to a ""perfect storm""caused by an improbable convergence of forces. My purpose here is to argue that climate change should replace the perfect storm framework for understanding the undergraduate business education crisis. First, I explain howmetaphors guide our thinking and actions. Second, I examine a perfect storm as a dominant metaphor for disasters and introduce climate change as an alternative. Although both meteorological metaphors entail a crisis caused by a convergence of forces, they differ in terms of probability, duration, and responses. Third, I describe the crisis and several of its causes. Finally, informed by climate change literature, I suggest that because a perfect storm is a brief unlikely event, climate change is more apt. The state of undergraduate business education reflects a ""new normal""that requires sweeping top-down change. However, in the face of institutional inertia (Khurana, 2007), I pragmatically suggest small but meaningful bottom-up tactics that should appeal to many stakeholders without provoking ""solution aversion""(Campbell & Kay, 2014). © 2020 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Marketization is synonymous with performative management practices that require universities to report on an expanding range of metrics designed to demonstrate value to students and the general public. It is also changing the way educational provision is delivered and managed, including the way in which teaching practice is managed to meet the challenges of marketization, managerialism, and student demand. We use the concept of Organization Climate (OC) to examine the challenges facing U.K. business school academics particularly in their teaching role, focusing on the factors shaping the climate for teaching across different institutions. Using focus groups, we identify the determinants of OC for teaching practice to explore how academics perceive their role and the effect of marketization and performative systems on the changing conceptions of teaching in higher education. Our work has wide-ranging implications for business schools globally in understanding how marketization affects teaching practice, where managerialism and metric outputs are already impacting other key agendas facing the delivery of academic subjects with a strong business orientation. © 2020 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Regarding this, we focus specifically on the role of local, native intermediaries, who enable foreign domination by promoting the interests of the Western autonomous, dominant pole within their postcolonial business schools. We call these intermediaries local, native doxosophers (or malinchistas), and suggest that any effort to set postcolonial business schools free, requires first the awakening of doxosophers. Thus, we ask, how may local, native doxosophers in postcolonial business schools wake up from their doxa-aligned roles and start enabling heteronomous poles to defend who they are?

We differentiate between two types of value: direct and indirect. Most of our projects generated some indirect value for our partners, but a smaller number of projects generated direct value.

These dimensions (Specialization, Semantics, and Autonomy) showed different bases for BME knowledge recognition, the extent knowledge is borrowed from other business disciplines, and factors that influence field development. The origin of LCT can be traced to sociological research in education, where perspectives of social control, position, and prestige of ideas were highlighted in the learning environment. We first identified a list of 250 highly cited articles from BME research by way of Harzing's (2013) Publish or Perish, and then categorized abstracts from these articles into research streams through the TxtViz clustering software. Next, we developed operational definitions of LCT dimensions for the BME field. We then calculated measures to position and assess characteristics of different BME research streams within the field. We expect this study to provide a theoretical framework that will contextualize BME research streams in relation to each other along different LCT dimensions, with consequent insights on within- and across-stream developmental implications. The findings should help BME researchers take a wider perspective and adopt a more cross-disciplinary approach to their work within the emerging LCT framework. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

In studying the relationships between informal and incidental learning in this space, we uncovered a process whereby participants, at times as the result of experiencing a disorienting dilemma, had the opportunity to reflect on old “habitual” ways of being and, through reflexivity, engage with new “re-authored” ways of being.

Old wine in new bottles: Exploring pragmatism as a philosophical framework for the discipline of coaching,2020,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066883124&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2017.0268&partnerID=40&md5=4f27c4bdc788aa37f71b36fe078f5733,"The practice and industry of organizational coaching are now well-established, but how it is understood theoretically continues to lag behind. Here, we analyze possible reasons for this state of affairs and argue that the development of coaching as an academic discipline will benefit from adopting philosophical pragmatism as an overarching theoretical framework. This move will enable coaching academics to utilize the contributions to knowledge that different paradigms generate. Positioning pragmatism as a theory of action, we argue that organizational coaching is by default a pragmatic enterprise and provide three examples of the considerable benefits to be gained by conceptualizing it this way: (1) Drawing from the pragmatists' ideas, particularly those of John Dewey, we demonstrate how the theoretical understanding of organizational coaching can be enhanced by considering its nature as a joint inquiry; (2) Pragmatism suggests development as an ultimate purpose for organizational coaching, which also helps to resolve fundamental conceptual debates; and (3) In light of the complexity and diversity involved in the way that organizational coaching is practiced, pragmatism offers coaches a useful framework for developing the flexibility required for navigating the multiplicity of influences on their practice. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
FILMS AND CRITICAL PEDAGOGY IN MANAGEMENT EDUCATION: A TOURISM STUDIES CONTEXT,2019,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073072588&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2015.0134&partnerID=40&md5=d46425406eacfdd70af26232fd61521b,"We examine and critically assess the role of films in the practice of critical pedagogy in undergraduate management education, by using tourism studies as a context. Utilizing online focus groups, we aim to gain an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the role of films as effective pedagogical mediums in enhancing experiential approaches to learning. We argue that films play an important role in facilitating critical analyses of the phenomenon studied, illustrating and problematizing abstract concepts and ideas, as well as in facilitating students’ ability to discern multiple and alternative discourses about management. Our findings highlight the role of films in context-specific critical engagement with the content being delivered and in stimulating emotionality in learning development, thereby enhancing deep approaches to learning. Emotional responses, even negative ones, prove to be critical in engaging with intellectual and critical reflection after watching films. The findings yield new and empirical insights into the pedagogic use of films in management education, thereby contributing to some of the goals of critical management studies. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We offer an expanded conceptualization and measurement of scholarly impact by investigating knowledge transfer to a critical management education constituency: students. To do so, we investigated which sources (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, business periodicals); individual items (e.g., journal articles, book chapters); and authors are most frequently cited in 38 widely used organizational behavior, human resource management, strategic management, and general management undergraduate-level textbooks. By extracting all endnotes and references, we created a database including 7,445 sources, 33,719 articles and book chapters, and 32,981 authors (and their affiliations) cited at least once. Results showed a weak relationship between journals, articles, and authors cited most frequently in journals and those most frequently cited in textbooks. We also found that students are exposed to knowledge and content originating both in academic and non-academic outlets. Results have implications for theory and practice regarding the science–practice gap and a consideration of students as stakeholders, the conceptualization and measurement of scholarly impact and the design of academic performance management and reward systems, and choices regarding what knowledge academics create and disseminate. © 2019 George Washington University.

In answering calls for a more rigorous approach to the rigor–relevance debate and for management scholars to look to the past to think differently about the future, I conducted a critical hermeneutic analysis of the Gordon–Howell Report and the context in which it was written to construct a counterhistory to the dominant narrative. Whereas scholars have claimed that the Gordon–Howell Report was the origin of the current U.S. business school, my analysis shows that an intertwined set of forces acting on U.S. business schools during the 1950s, including the Ford Foundation, the Cold War, the adulation of science, and the search for legitimacy by these business schools, were also acting on Gordon and Howell and the readers of their report. Little in the report had not already been said. With a broader understanding of the history of the report, we create opportunities for re-framing the rigor–relevance debate moving forward, with new questions and a greater awareness of our own context. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Indeed, its absence has also been implicated in the plethora of recent scandals and the global financial crisis. We suggest that such issues are, in part, attributable to a continued overreliance on a scientific and detached form of knowing that displaces particular “human characteristics” and in so doing, downplays our inherent connections to others. In contrast, we identify the importance of embracing a supplementary form of knowing, collaborative inquiry, which potentially restores our connections to others in ways that provide opportunities for a more heartfelt and soulful management practice. Specifically, we extend Van de Ven and Johnson’s (2006) notion of collaborative inquiry to consider how it is mobilized in the context of a U.K. DBA program and in turn we examine the impact this move accomplishes. Drawing upon a detailed analysis of 20 students’ reflective journals, we illustrate the ways in which they develop a form of empathy. Crucially, we found that this was one important means for (re)connecting to others in ways that begin to bring a sense of heart and soul back into management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

The issue of accreditation of African universities, in general, and of business schools, in particular, is only now beginning to be addressed on a continental level. There is also a growing concern about the quality of higher education in Africa. We examine international business school accreditation from a post-colonial theory perspective. We argue that simply applying Western accreditation standards in a post-colonial context does not address relevant African business problems, nor does it examine educational needs in this environment. Our discussion focuses on these issues as well as on recommendations to assist many, if not most, African business schools in meeting the needs of their stakeholders given the socioeconomic and cultural realities of Africa. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

It is one of the first and most remembered models encountered by students of management. Despite gaining little support in empirical studies and being criticized for promoting an elitist, individualistic view of management, Maslow’s theory remains popular, underpinned by its widely recognized pyramid form. However, Maslow never created a pyramid to represent the hierarchy of needs. We investigated how it came to be and draw on this analysis to call for a rethink of how Maslow is represented in management studies. We also challenge management educators to reflect critically on what are taken to be the historical foundations of management studies and the forms in which those foundations are taught to students. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
Reading the TED talk genre: Contradictions and pedagogical pleasures in spreading ideas about management,2019,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082135449&doi=10.5465%2famle.2017.0323&partnerID=40&md5=5a2a2c2c3ff6e8667a61c8d3548b6483,"Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) talks have become a powerful way of communicating management ideas to global audiences. This raises questions about how management educators should engage with TED talks. We use literary theory to understand TED talks as a distinct genre to explore how students “read” TED talks and the pleasures they gain from this. Based on an analysis of TED talks, books about TED talks, focus groups and interviews with management students, we identify three contradictions in the genre: (1) freedom to learn, (2) authenticity of speakers and texts, and (3) emotional connection as a source of pleasure. The kind of reading pleasure that TED talks encourage is characterized by plaisir, an easygoing enjoyment which does not challenge readers’ assumptions and supports surface learning. This is contrasted with jouissance, a pleasure that produces disturbance and leaves the subject altered. We suggest that management educators can work to enable students to become critical, reflexive readers who understand the importance of these new genres in producing meaning. By exposing the contradictory nature of reading TED talks, we contribute to understanding the storied nature of scientific knowledge and the role of power in communicating ideas about management. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Toward a non-essentialist approach to management education: Philosophical underpinnings from phenomenography,2019,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082135455&doi=10.5465%2famle.2017.0401&partnerID=40&md5=f988afdd50212515296ee5749471c701,"The classic approach to management education is managercentric and assumes an essential nature to management. Drawing on ideas from interpretivist epistemologies, the social construction of leadership, phenomenography, and variation theory, we discuss the implications for management education of taking a non-essentialist approach and regarding the nature of management as unknown and unknowable. We focus on phenomenography for two reasons: First, when applied to the task of defining management, it is built on interpretivist roots where the knowledge and understanding of the observer is paramount. Second, it is also a theory of learning with direct application to management research and teaching. Building on these insights, we highlight the importance of students becoming active investigators of management and offer practical teaching implications on how students might be encouraged to engage in experiences that identify variations in the ways that management is conceptualized and performed. We also consider how such an approach brings a fresh perspective on what management education is about, the role of the educator, and how it informs the ongoing debates relating to the institutional pressures that business schools face. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

However, there is little theorization and empirical evidence to support these claims. Drawing upon cognitive load theory to develop learning-related hypotheses, this manuscript reports on a multicountry experiment that tests the effects of different modes of strategy communication on student learning. The results show the learning benefits to students of multimedia presentations of strategy and suggests how strategy professors should further encourage students to draw strategies in class. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

However, despite the popularity of coaching, the effect of coaching on relevant leadership performance measures remains unclear. We report on the development of a model for coaching effectiveness predicting that aspects common to all approaches are the main active ingredients, mediated by the working alliance as the single-best predicting common aspect. To test this model, we conducted a (waiting-list) randomized controlled trial within a global healthcare corporation, involving 180 coachees, 66 coaches, and 140 line managers of the coachees, which we contend is the largest randomized controlled trial in executive coaching to date. The study demonstrated substantial impact with effect sizes up to d 5 1.1. We also tested several aspects that are common to coaching contracts and found more evidence for the central importance of the strength of the working alliance as seen from both the coachee and (to a lesser extent) the coach perspectives, which mediated the effects for coachee well-being and perceived social support. In addition, we found some significant impact for coachee self-efficacy, resilience and “bright side” personality aspects. Finally, we found some first significant indications that personality and career derailment aspects may show demonstrable improvement through coaching. We discuss the implications of these findings for coaching theory and practice. Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of coaching in an organizational setting, the importance of the working alliance, and that coaching may mitigate the risks of leaders derailing in large organizations.

We question the assumption that faculty–student coaching (FSC) is beneficial and propose that there may be some limitations in the use of FSC that have yet to be adequately acknowledged and discussed in the literature. In particular, we propose that there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that coaching can produce knowledge acquisition, and therefore, ask why we persist in the use of FSC when we have limited evidence of its efficacy in delivering a core education outcome. We suggest that the theory of academic capitalism provides a useful, critical lens through which to view the growing trend in FSC, identifying that FSC may be utilized as a method of increasing student satisfaction, perceptions of value for money, and as a useful marketing tool for business schools competing for students. However, academic capitalism may also explain the use of coaching via its ability to enhance the skills and attitudes of students, providing outcomes that are valued by students, employers, and governments. We conclude our essay by providing recommendations to mitigate these proposed dangers and consequently maximize the effectiveness of coaching as a development tool in management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

This is expressed in growing disquiet about the lack of value in our research outputs and increasing frustration about the nature of teaching in business schools. This crisis of confidence can be understood as a response to a series of developments, including an apparent lack of practical or academic impact from most published research, a narrowing of focus in the field, increases in unethical behavior, the downgrading of teaching, and increased pressure in both publishing and teaching. Traditional academic values are coming into conflict with processes of rationalization in business schools and universities. The changes driving these outcomes are long-term and reflect powerful institutional pressures, rendering them difficult to change. Nonetheless, established management studies scholars have a responsibility to address them. One way they can show leadership in this regard is by setting a good example. Three suggestions can be made about how to do this: rejecting the fiction that what we do is analogous to laboratory science; rejecting the myth of what this essay calls “the heroic workaholic publishing machine;” and refusing to promote flawed approaches to assessing academic success. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We argue that theoretical developments on the concept of student engagement offer a critical opportunity to revise this stance and problematize online activity. Through the lens of engagement, we depict online engagement as a multidimensional concept that encompasses behavior, emotion, and cognition. We further argue that the focus of online engagement may be dual in nature: Engagement with online pedagogies, and separately, with the substantive knowledge being acquired. Our study draws on qualitative data from postgraduate management research students in an online research methods course. To tease out the complexity of engagement, we use evidence of online activity to categorize learners into three distinct types: hogs, possums, and horses. We juxtapose these behavioral categories against narrative accounts of engagement in eLearning to reveal a rich set of textures as well as misalignment among behavior, emotion, and cognition. The findings seem to question the privileged status of interactivity in online pedagogy and tentatively suggest the possibility that online disengagement may not be detrimental to learning. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

Drawing upon the theory of planned behavior, we examine one specific entrepreneurship education intervention designed to increase resilience and investigate its effect on entrepreneurial intention. Using a quasi-experimental design, we find that our intervention has an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intention through resilience and the antecedents of intention (perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norm). This study contributes new ideas for learning methods to foster resilience and entrepreneurial intention, such as the design-thinking approach or learning from failure. © 2019 George Washington University.

While prior research describes early career researchers’ isolation in their institutions, we theorize early career researchers’ isolation in their academic fields and reveal how they attempt to mitigate isolation to improve their career prospects. Using a collaborative autoethnographic approach, we generate and analyze a dataset focused on the experiences of 10 early career researchers in a globalizing business academic field known as consumer culture theory. We identify bricolage practices, polycentric governance practices, and integration mechanisms that work to enhance early career researchers’ perceptions of agency, and consequently, mitigate their academic isolation. Our findings extend discussions on isolation and its role in new academic careers. Early career researchers, in particular, can benefit from a deeper understanding of practices that can enable them to mitigate isolation and reclaim agency as they engage with global academic fields. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We scrutinize the validity of this assumption, focusing on the language barriers internationally mobile management scholars are facing. Based on qualitative interviews with foreign faculty working at leading business schools in Finland, Japan, Spain, and the United States, we investigate how careers in different national academic systems are bounded by the dual challenge to speak both English and the local language. In revealing different degrees of linguistic challenges across national academic systems, we contribute to career research by presenting language barriers as an impediment to global careers in business schools and by establishing “knowing where” as a previously neglected career competency. Our study also maps the process of academic “Englishization,” shows that different career antecedents are influenced by different types of language barriers, and suggests a classification scheme for national academic systems according to their “linguistic difficulty level” for foreigners. On this basis, we develop important practical recommendations for internationally mobile management scholars and business schools aiming to attract international faculty. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We contribute to the understanding of the problems involved and to potential solutions by developing a theoretically informed approach to the rhythms of academic life and drawing on interviews with 32 critical management studies (CMS) early-career academics (ECAs) in 14 countries. Bringing together Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis (and his concepts of polyrhythmia, eurhythmia, and arrhythmia); Zerubavel’s sociology of time; and identity construction literature, we examine the rhythm-identity implications of the recent higher education changes. We show how the dynamics between the broader pressures, institutional strategies, and our interviewees’ attempts to reassert themselves are creating a vicious circle of arrhythmia: a debilitating condition characterized by rhythmic disruption, dissonance, and conflict. Within the circle, identity insecurity and regulation, CMS ECAs’ identity work, and arrhythmia are mutually co-constructive, so that it is hard for individuals to break out. We consider the possibilities and limitations of individual coping strategies, and drawing out lessons for business schools, advocate for more collective and structural solutions. In so doing, we contribute to the reimagining of business schools as more eurhythmically polyrhythmic places where ECAs of all intellectual orientations have the time to learn and develop. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We test the hypothesized model controlling for a number of alternative predictors and with survey data collected from an international sample of 1,644 Academy of Management members. Results reveal that family-to-work conflict indirectly, negatively relates to career satisfaction through work engagement; role overload (negatively), directly relates to career satisfaction, and positively to salary. Several positive and negative career shocks indirectly relate to career satisfaction through work engagement, and relate directly to salary. We also explore differences by career stage and for nontenure track faculty. Our findings extend the predictors of academic career success to include various job demands (stressors and negative shocks) and resources (positive shocks), extend the generalizability of previous findings on the predictors of academic career success to academics outside the US, and empirically validate Arthur Bedeian’s advice in his essay in the Rhythms of Academic Life.

Choices and consequences: Impact of mobility on research-career capital and promotion in business schools,2019,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070417941&doi=10.5465%2famle.2017.0389&partnerID=40&md5=c332454c16ed0fa43af6ee99a251aefe,"We focus on the role that domestic and international mobility play in achieving a business academic’s career outcomes. We seek to advance existing research by taking a more-nuanced approach to the study of mobility. Using a sample of 376 tenured faculty members from 20 highly research-visible European business schools in 10 countries, we explore different patterns of mobility and highlight their link to research-career capital and the speed of academic promotion. Our findings show that mobility has a positive impact on research-career capital, but multiple moves delay academic promotion. In making decisions about international mobility, it is important to know that moving internationally for one’s first post-PhD job undermines research productivity. However, moving internationally between year 2 and year 7 post-PhD is better than moving later on. The ability to move between countries is deeply rooted in gender, with female faculty less likely to access international mobility. Female academics also take longer to be promoted to a tenured rank and to full professorship. Our findings have implications for academic researchers who consider domestic and international mobility, and for PhD supervisors whose duty it is to prepare their students for successful careers in academia. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Yet, pathways to achieve success and impact remain nebulous. We employ a comparative case study approach to examine in detail the careers of five highly successful and impactful business school academics. We uncovered two different career pathways in academia: structured and organic. The academics taking a structured pathway impact the field by creating and shaping institutions. Those taking an organic approach impact by nurturing and cultivating people. Specifically, we found that three metacompetencies and three relational dimensions support success and impact in academia. Our findings can help doctoral students and early-career academics craft their success and impact journeys based on their career contexts and individual circumstances. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Student understandings of evidence-based management: Ways of doing and being,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060055250&doi=10.5465%2famle.2016.0249&partnerID=40&md5=fd9b897ee5512d36baf8590af23a2012,"This paper advances the literature on evidence-based management (EBMgt) by exploring how students understand it. We conduct a qualitative inductive study of undergraduate students who were introduced to EBMgt and applied evidence-based processes as part of an introductory management course. Our findings identify four qualitatively different student understandings of EBMgt: (1) EBMgt as an unrealistic way of doing management; (2) EBMgt as a way of doing management in particular situations; (3) EBMgt as a generally useful way of doing management; and (4) EBMgt as an ideal way of being a manager. We find that variations in student understanding are based upon perceptions of the utility of evidence-based processes, the stance taken toward scientific evidence as a form of knowledge, and the focus of reflection about the practice of EBMgt. By opening up insight into how undergraduate students understand and make sense of EBMgt as ways of doing and being, we contribute to the theoretical literature on EBMgt, to the practice of EBMgt teaching and learning, and offer new paths for future research. © 2018 George Washington University.

Strategy education does not do enough to help students overcome it, and some teaching methods may even reinforce it. Yet, organizations highly value problem formulation- and solving-skills and complain of their paucity. By bringing together research, teaching, and practice, we present several remedies to alleviate the plunging-in bias, and thereby, elevate strategic problem-solving skills. We propose frameworks for framing problems, deciding whom to involve in problem-solving, and determining the best approach for solving it; we describe ways in which problem-solving and strategic management can be taught integratively, and list ideas for new course material and research. By raising awareness of an insidious cognitive bias, we hope to advance teaching and research on strategic problem-solving. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,
“Why’d you wanna study that?” A process model of the under-legitimation of a research topic,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059861045&doi=10.5465%2famle.2016.0015&partnerID=40&md5=90ec8cd22cd4f2d8c57f49125676322f,"Legitimacy is a desirable evaluation that confers substantial benefits to the subject. Although there is recognition that certain research topics struggle to gain legitimacy, the process through which this struggle is sustained remains unclear. To shed light on these dynamics, we analyzed data from an interview study of 31 gender in management scholars located on five continents. We find that gender in management scholarship is granted varying degrees of exchange, procedural, and comprehensibility legitimacy by both academic and non-academic groups. In response to these conflicting legitimacies, gender scholars are subsequently subjected to multiple rhetorical delegitimation strategies by the dominant academic community. To explain how these dynamics persist, we outline an overall process model of the under-legitimation of a research topic comprising four components: value-incongruence, mixed-legitimation, delegitimation, and negative outcomes for the production and dissemination of knowledge. Further, we introduce the concept of privilege legitimacy to describe the distinctive legitimacy afforded to the research topic by male gender in management scholars. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the under-legitimation process and recommend that interventions are needed on the part of the dominant academic community to fully legitimate gender in management scholarship. r Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

It does so by examining one key question: how and why, and across which dimensions do firms differ?

Unfortunately, these students often receive conflicting advice about whether they should bide their time by conducting incremental research until they reach tenure (play “small ball”), or try to write impactful research early in their careers (“swing for the fences”). We explore the characteristics of high-impact management articles and examine whether early-career scholars are capable of publishing them. Our analysis shows that over half (53%) the authors of 235 high-impact management articles published them in the pre-tenure period of their careers. We use the results of this study, along with the lessons from previous research, to provide recommendations to faculty mentors and advisors on how PhD students can increase their chances of conducting high-impact research. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Entrepreneurs' mental health and well-being: A review and research Agenda,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054752533&doi=10.5465%2famp.2017.0001&partnerID=40&md5=b68da6b5f246c965dd6026ca1dfaad56,"Interest in entrepreneurs' mental health and well-being (MWB) is growing in recognition of the role of MWB in entrepreneurs' decision making, motivation, and action. Yet relevant knowledge is dispersed across disciplines, which makes what we currently understand about entrepreneurs' MWB unclear. In this systematic review I integrate insights from 144 empirical studies. These studies show that research is focused on three research questions: (1) Do different types of entrepreneurs differ in their MWB? What are the (2) antecedents and (3) consequences of entrepreneurs' MWB? The review systematizes evidence on known antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurs' MWB but also reveals overlooked and undertheorized sources and outcomes of entrepreneurs' MWB. The review provides a mapping and framework that advance research on entrepreneurs' MWB and help to position entrepreneurs' MWB more centrally in management and entrepreneurship research. It calls for researchers to go beyond applying models developed for employees to understand entrepreneurs. Instead, the findings point the way to developing a dedicated theory of entrepreneurial work and MWB that is dynamic, socialized, and open to considering context and acknowledges variability and fluidity across entrepreneurs' life domains, as well as the centrality of work for entrepreneurs' identity. © 2018 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Yet, limited attention has been given to explicating, first, why we need to teach these skills; second, which skills we need to teach; and third, how they can to be developed in the classroom. To help answer these three questions we need to understand the linkages between theory-based and skills-based approaches to strategy teaching. We begin with the proposition that the purpose of the core strategic management is to develop the strategic management competency of our students. We then adopt a systematic approach to identifying the why, what, and how components of strategic management competency. We show why analytical tools need to be complemented by judgment, insight, intuition, creativity, and social and communicative skills. We outline what these skills are and where they come from. Finally, we derive implications for how we should design and deliver of the core strategic management course. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

These help to set a research agenda that more fully addresses a potential ""dark side"" psychological factor among some entrepreneurs. © 2018 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,
A CRITICAL DIVERSITY FRAMEWORK TO BETTER EDUCATE STUDENTS ABOUT STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075170686&doi=10.5465%2famle.2017.0150&partnerID=40&md5=347ea18140edb9adfb205c01fe645d21,"We present a conceptual framework for strategic management instructors to enhance teaching of strategy implementation. Strategy textbooks are valuable in teaching certain aspects of implementation such as organizational structure. Much less attention is paid, however, to preparing students for the microlevel challenges and ambiguities of the tricky final stage of putting strategic plans into practice: the action and interaction of individuals when collaborating with and coordinating others. We explain how strategy instructors can use “critical diversity” as a threshold concept to enhance students’ understanding and empathy for the microlevel complexity of strategy implementation and thereby develop their capacities to enact strategies successfully. Critical diversity is an umbrella term for studies of the contentious effects of strategic managerial approaches to workplace diversity. It relates to concerns with the social categories used in such approaches, the politics of diversity in the workplace, and the emotion this engenders. These three areas of complexity, which we label boundary, political, and emotion complexity, comprise our conceptual framework and can be adapted to address implementation issues in the classroom. To put this framework into practice, we suggest learning outcomes and activities for advanced undergraduates and postgraduates, and implications for instructors and strategic management textbook authors.

We examine the mediating effect of project efficacy belief and the moderating effect of the responsiveness of partner organization representatives (PORs). The context is a capstone BBA course at a university in Hong Kong. We administered three waves of questionnaires to 491 senior-year students and obtained 275 matched responses. Among this sample, 56% of the students were undertaking service-learning projects, and the remaining 44% were undertaking a comparable type of field-study project, but without service-learning. Our quantitative results indicate that engaging in the service-learning mode of learning, in comparison to the nonservice-learning mode, is more effective in inducing service leadership emergence and meaning schema transformation. Project efficacy belief mediates the effect of project experiences (i.e., service-learning versus nonservice-learning) on service leadership emergence. POR responsiveness moderates the indirect effects of project experiences on service leadership emergence and meaning schema transformation through project efficacy belief. A qualitative case illustration that was drawn from students’ end-of-semester reflective reports provides further support for our hypothesized model. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,

We build a novel dataset of students’ evaluations of 922 strategic management courses in a top-ranked business school in Spain during the period 2011–2016 and link it to the publication outcome of each professor. We find a significant positive association between research performance, measured by the number of publications in a 6-year interval, and students’ evaluations of teaching. Specifically, an increase of two standard deviations in our variable for research performance is equivalent to a jump from the median of students’ evaluations to the top quartile. Also, publishing four papers within 6 years significantly increases the likelihood that the professor’s students in a required course will subsequently choose strategy elective courses. We also find a positive and strongly significant interaction of research performance with course length, suggesting that the benefits of research may emerge specifically in longer courses. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

This activity is devilishly difficult, yet profoundly rewarding. The difficulties come from our still-new and emerging discipline, from change and uncertainty in the business world, and from various institutional factors. The rewards arise during the process of pursuing a worthy goal with one's students. This essay outlines a process-involving teaching tools such as “flipping” the classroom, examining past and current strategy narratives, evidence-based management, and case studies-aimed toward “nudging” strategy students onto a continuing path of improving their critical thinking. No summit exists that, once reached, represents goal achievement for professors or for students. Instead, profound satisfaction can result simply from deep engagement in the process of becoming more complete teachers and learners of strategic management. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We discuss the links between these two processes in terms of (1) opportunity recognition, (2) opportunity exploitation, and (3) associated outcomes. We then illustrate how future research should incorporate the interaction between the two processes using a morphological box and discuss how such research would change the way we specify entrepreneurial process models and study entrepreneurial behavior. © 2018 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

We are motivated by persistent critiques of heroic and leader-centered—or leaderist—positions, and informed by arguments for doing leadership and leadership development “differently.” We draw on the practice turn in management and organizational studies to introduce socio-material relationism as an epistemology that can inform new critical engagements with relational leadership through management education. Socio-material relationism—in the form of relationist leadership—enables (a) greater consideration of material aspects of practice that may be denied or deferred in more social-relational approaches; and (b) a distinct identity to assist critical analysis of and education on the workings of leadership in contemporary settings. We demonstrate throughout how these contributions have implications for leadership development and teaching. To do so we recast leadership work as everyday managerial work that is developed through routine or emergent practice, done through the working of nonroutine practices, and as a subject that is itself worked by being constituted and potentially deconstructed through analysis of intersecting discourses.

This paper outlines a conceptual framework and develops detailed propositions for the multifaceted influence of impulsivity on entrepreneurial action. Previous literature mostly shows entrepreneurship as a deliberate cognitive process without sufficiently accounting for how uncertainty may influence action. Our paper sufficiently accounts for how uncertainty influences action and moves beyond entrepreneurship as a deliberate cognitive process. In so doing, this paper constitutes a counterweight to the extensive examinations of positive personal attributes in entrepreneurship research. It also suggests a context in which a common trait with strong negative connotations may be advantageous. © 2018 Academy of Management Perspectives.",,

Our findings suggest that to deal with relational insecurity, academics and practitioners use a set of planned and emergent strategies according to trial-and-error logics. In the beginning of an interaction episode, they draw intentionally on planned boundary-building strategies. If these are refused, they draw on emergent strategies of boundary breaching, which connect inside classroom roles with outside classroom roles in a more creative way. We show that each strategy triggers a different type of knowledge exchange, and that intentional boundary building triggers more limited knowledge exchanges (knowledge transfer) than emergent boundary breaching (new understandings). Our findings contribute to the boundary work literature and to the debate in management about a theory–practice gap by emphasizing the relational potential of academic–practitioner exchanges. We also suggest that if business schools loosen their programs’ infrastructure and encourage trial-and-error interaction, they can increasingly become trading zones for academic–practitioner boundary work. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Pedagogically, these two theories are often incorporated into a grand integrated framework that describes the strategic management process. However, in terms of their respective profit-generating mechanisms, these theories are largely contradictory, and integrating them into a single framework for teaching strategy is problematic. Firms that try to apply both approaches to profit generation at the same time within the same business are likely to be unsuccessful. We identify these contradictions in the profit-generating process between these two theories and specify the pedagogical implications of these contradictions. We then argue that strategic management pedagogy should consider acknowledging these fundamentally different models of profit generation and help students understand when one approach or the other applies. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We suggest that it is time to bring institutions into strategy teaching. Specifically, how can strategy teaching be enriched with enhanced institutional flavors? What topics can particularly benefit from bringing more institutional flavors into teaching? We argue that injecting more institutional flavors will make strategy teaching-and ultimately learning-more insightful, realistic, and balanced. To substantiate our case, we leverage progress in four areas of new institutionalism research to shed light on a series of topics widely taught in strategy courses: (1) market entry, (2) strategic alliances, (3) mergers and acquisitions (M&As), (4) corporate governance, and (5) corporate social responsibility (CSR). Overall, we suggest that bringing institutions into teaching will enhance both the rigor and relevance of strategy courses. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

However, we argue that Disney animations are likely to significantly shape children's learning about organizations. This is because the Disney animated canon regularly provides children with consistent and vivid impressions of the nature of working life-impressions that will have important implications for them and the staff who teach them, when they eventually enter business schools as undergraduates.",,

We provide a systematic approach to selecting and reading women's fiction for the purpose of introducing management educators to the vast untapped potential of women's fiction, which is suited to addressing a wide range of issues related to women's leadership experiences. We show how the 18 texts presented in this study were selected and briefly introduce the themes they explore. One text, the play, Welcome to Thebes, is analyzed to illustrate how the text provides opportunities for developing more gender-aware leadership learners. We also explore leadership learning opportunities that arise from reading fiction in groups. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Demystifying the genius of entrepreneurship: How design cognition can help create the next generation of entrepreneurs,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043385212&doi=10.5465%2famle.2016.0040&partnerID=40&md5=23326635fb332d24935eaacd870f9aaa,"Entrepreneurship education is a key beneficiary of design thinking's recent momentum. Both designers and entrepreneurs create opportunities for innovation in products, services, processes, and business models. More specifically, both design thinking and entrepreneurship education encourage individuals to look at the world with fresh eyes, create hypotheses to explain their surroundings and desired futures, and adopt cognitive acts to reduce the psychological uncertainty associated with ambiguous situations. In this article, we illustrate how we train students to apply four well-established cognitive acts from the design-cognition research paradigm-framing, analogical reasoning, abductive reasoning, and mental simulation-to opportunity creation. Our pedagogical approach is based on scholarship in design cognition that emphasizes creating preferred situations from existing ones, rather than applying a defined set of tools from management scholarship. In doing so, we provide avenues for further development of entrepreneurship education, particularly the integration of design cognition. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Developing managerial dynamic capabilities: A quasi-experimental field study of the effects of design thinking training,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050111324&doi=10.5465%2famle.2016.0187&partnerID=40&md5=fab319cc5f4915ae602bd82f9b10a24c,"Deeply rooted in practice, design thinking lacks theory-driven empirical research on its effects. In this article, we combine the practical experience of design thinking with the theoretical advances of the dynamic capabilities framework. We examine how training team leaders in design thinking can develop their managerial sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities; stimulate innovation in their teams; and influence team operational capability. We test the model using a quasi-experimental field study with a control group and a 4-month time lag. The intervention is a design thinking training program presented in six geographically isolated business units of a large multinational telecommunications company. We found that the training had a positive effect on the participants’ sensing and seizing capabilities, which had a positive effect on their transforming capability, team innovation output, and team operational capability. These positive effects were paralleled by a direct negative effect of the training on the operational capabilities of the participants’ teams. © 2018 George Washington University.

SHAKING THE STATUS QUO: BUSINESS ACCREDITATION AND POSITIONAL COMPETITION,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050094674&doi=10.5465%2famle.2015.0199&partnerID=40&md5=4b30f4e554af971cf5ea9f7071f86dd6,"Modern business schools exist in a complex world of rankings, ratings, and credentials. Some argue that in increasingly competitive global higher education markets, signaling status and quality has actually become more important than having them (Gioia & Corley, 2002; Trank & Rynes, 2003). For many contemporary business schools, international accreditations have become key means and first steps in pursuing legitimacy and global status. In this essay, we elaborate in detail on a business school’s international accreditation process, including its motivations and outcomes. We conclude that while accreditation processes are, at best, fruitful quality improvement exercises, the inherent motivations stemming from the urge for organizational legitimacy, status, and reputation should not be overlooked by either the accrediting agencies or business schools themselves. Ironically, while accreditation agencies (AACSB and EQUIS are those focused on here) rarely explicitly encourage competition, their exclusivity seems to generate it between schools that aspire to belong to “the club.” For schools that gain access to the process, this means that on the flip side of the happy and collaborative jump in quality there is a much more serious demarcation and revealing redefinition of the accredited entity’s future supporters, collaborators, partners, and competitors. © 2018 George Washington University.

The framework can also be utilized to gain insights for course designs that more effectively promote student engagement in environmental sustainability management classes. © 2018 George Washington University.

Predicting CQ Development in the context of experiential cross-cultural training: The role of social dominance orientation and the propensity to change stereotypes,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044029479&doi=10.5465%2famle.2015.0096&partnerID=40&md5=1df884116b62dcdb45d4ea79810f309d,"With increasing globalization and multicultural diversity comes a need for better understanding of the factors that predict cultural intelligence (CQ) development. Previous literature identifies cross-cultural contact and experiential contact-based training as effective in CQ development; however, individuals differ in their propensity to engage in and benefit from intergroup contact. Drawing on social dominance theory research and cultural learning models, I examine the relationships between individual social dominance orientation (SDO), the propensity to change stereotypes, and CQ development in the context of experiential cross-cultural training involving contact with a culturally different group. A pre- and postdesign study conducted among 122 postgraduate students demonstrated that SDO is directly and negatively related to the propensity to change stereotypes and indirectly and negatively related to CQ development following contact-based training. The propensity to change stereotypes mediated the negative relationship between SDO and CQ development. My findings here suggest that socially dominant individuals are less likely to benefit from experiential contact-based cross-cultural training; on the other hand, individuals with greater propensity to change stereotypes are likely to develop greater CQ. Education and training professionals should carefully consider the role of individual variables in CQ development and experiential cross-cultural training. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Repairing leaks in the pipeline: A social closure perspective on underrepresented racial/ethnic minority recruitment and retention in business schools,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044060395&doi=10.5465%2famle.2015.0215&partnerID=40&md5=55cb991f4f1c343653ebcae5111c0c39,"Despite initiatives to diversify business school administration, faculty, and doctoral student bodies, challenges to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented racial/ ethnic minorities (URMs) persist. A “leaky pipeline” metaphor is often leveraged to describe these challenges, whereby disproportionately few racial/ethnic minorities initially “enter” the pipeline (i.e., academic career), and this initially low supply dwindles (“leaks”) at more advanced stages of the pipeline. Beyond simply describing leaks in the business school pipeline, we seek to explain why leaks occur and how they can be repaired. Specifically, we contend that mechanisms of social closure-discriminatory evaluation, knowledge- and resource-hoarding, and the preservation of dominant group identities-not only restrict URMs' access to the academic pipeline, but also contribute its “leaks.” After discussing these mechanisms, we conclude with recommendations to the AACSB, an institution that can facilitate change and reduce social closure within business schools. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,
Does leadership development need to care about neuro-ethics?,2018,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029299404&doi=10.5465%2famle.2016.0220&partnerID=40&md5=d2a26abd291d2d61036dc4f9e74c8843,"We ask whether leadership development needs to care more about neuro-ethics in an era when neuroscientific interventions gain credence at work. Informed by emerging discussions among neuroscientists, we address two main issues. First, recent debates cast significant doubt on the validity of neurofeedback (especially neurofeedback using electroencephalography). These studies argue instead that it works through placebo rather than real effects. Second, further ethical concerns arise in response to (a) questionable commercial practice, (b) issues of organizational (in)justice, and (c) tendencies to ignore or downplay practical wisdom. Our discussion incites us to be both critical of neuro-feedback's scientistic credentials and aware of its broader historical conditions of possibility.

We show how globalization, combined with the historical legacy of colonialism, renders Indian scholars’ positions precarious in their interactions with Western business schools. Based on a qualitative interview study, we explore how Indian business school scholars perform their identities in the context of neo-colonial relations, which are characterized by the dominance of the English language and a pressure to conform to research norms set by globally ranked journals. Drawing on postcolonial theory, our argument focuses on mimicry as a distinctive form of identity work that involves maintaining difference between Western and non-Western identities by “Othering” Indian scholars, while simultaneously seeking to transform them. We draw attention to ambivalence within participants’ accounts, which we suggest arises because the authority of Western scholarship relies on maintaining non-Western scholars in a position of alterity or “not quite-ness.” We suggest that hybridity offers an opportunity to disrupt and question current practices of business school globalization and facilitate scholarly engagement that reflects more diverse philosophical positions and worldviews. © 2018 George Washington University.

Here I focus upon the experiences of MBA students who are conducting qualitative research for an assignment, many of whom are using qualitative research methods for the first time. Through an inductive analysis of students’ reflective accounts of the process, the challenges encountered in conducting qualitative research as a novice are highlighted and the links between the skills required for competent practice in this area and those required for more general managerial effectiveness demonstrated. I argue that learning to conduct qualitative research offers a number of additional benefits beyond the substantive content of the domain. These are enabling the development of skills similar to those required for effective managerial practice; opportunities to learn to manage complexity as associated with the current managerial climate; an understanding of the performative nature of management; and the opportunity to challenge existing mind-sets in a creative manner. © 2018 George Washington University.

This gender disparity in the higher ranks of academe can lead to masculinized organizational practices that frame tenure-and-promotion cases in business schools, leading to biased decision making that can undervalue female faculty members' scholarly contributions that do not conform to the taken-for-granted patterns established by successful males. We examine the evidence to determine the extent of the gender balance problem in senior positions in colleges of business in the US. In addition, we provide several conceptual frameworks; namely, homophily and hegemonic masculinities, and expectations state theory, social role theory, and shifting standards theory, which provide theoretical insights into how gender bias can unintentionally enter the promotion process in business schools. We provide a framework that business schools can implement to make decision making on promotion and advancement more equitable and engender a more welcoming environment for female faculty, ultimately caulking the ""leaky pipeline"" and allowing more female faculty to advance to the highest ranks of academe.

Submissions are usually judged according to Anglophone norms of communication-a situation that would seem to privilege good English, and thus, often, although not always, privileges native speakers. Building on insights from stigma research, my work here examines how Anglophone conventions affect experiences of scholars in peer-review processes. This study advances a framework that considers personal and situation-specific dispositions surrounding feelings of vulnerability associated with less than excellent English expression. Specifically, the study distinguishes between communicative competence, stigma consciousness, self-efficacy, and identity-threat appraisal. Using data from 27 interviews and 411 surveys of international business scholars, I find that scholars agree that peer-review processes privilege native speakers. What differentiates scholars, however, is the degree to which they worry about bias toward good English. Andworry leaves scholars with a sense of insecurity about their capacity to compete in Anglophone settings. The study concludes with suggestions as towhat professional associations, journal editors, and higher education organizations can do to reduce these undesirable effects. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

I meta-analyzed 72 study-abroad investigations (N = 7,820) reporting on three learning areas: cognitive or language acquisition, affective or multicultural attitudes, and behavioral or intercultural adaptation. Meta-analytic results ranged from large (cognitive δ = 0.975) to mid- (attitude, δ = 0.457; behavioral, δ = 0.649) effect sizes with no 95% confidence intervals including zero values. To contrast learning abroad to efforts at home, I conducted a second meta-analysis (19 studies, N = 3,740) on similar affective and behavioral outcomes in at-home instruction. I also benchmarked against an existing meta-analysis on language acquisition (Plonsky, 2011). I found that outcomes from studying abroad surpass what Plonsky reports for cognitive learning at home (δ = 0.55) and what the meta-analysis for at-home instruction shows for affective (δ = 0.253) and behavioral (δ = 0.532) learning. I also found that two features of study-abroad programs-type of immersion and program content-moderate the effectiveness of studying abroad.

To identify the origins of network diversity, a key question for theory and practice is whether majority or minority groups are more likely to develop diverse personal networks. We provide a partial answer to this question by integrating network theory with three conceptual dimensions of diversity: variety, dissimilarity, and status. This conceptualization suggests that individuals can display three distinct types of diversity in their networks with different theoretical antecedents and outcomes. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find systematic differences between the networks of high-status majorities and low-status minoritiesin a longitudinal study of MBAstudent networks. Specifically, minorities show more variety, greater dissimilarity, and lower status centrality in their networks compared to majorities. Tie strength and time period affect the findings in predictable ways. These results demonstrate the value of integrating diversity theory with network theory for understanding the development of inclusive networks in business schools. We conclude by discussing potential remedies to enhance the diversity of MBA student networks. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

In studies at two universities, we found that trained participants are better able to classify team-member behaviors into the appropriate categories of a sciencebased model of teamwork and more accurately identify the performance level of those behaviors. Using round-robin data from studentsworking on a highly interdependent task,wealso utilized the social relations model (SRM) to test whether trained participants provide higher quality peer ratings. The SRM analysis estimates the variance in team members' ratings of teammates' performance attributable to various effects (rater, group, error, etc.).

We argue that management scholars not only suffer from the detachment of labor from product (e.g., research and teaching) as material economic relations determine, but by adding a psychoanalytic perspective, we claim that they also must enjoy this process as a necessity of a neoliberal logic that reinforces anxiety. Hence, we argue that alienation should be approached as a potential to fulfill when considering troubling production relations in business schools. In terms of the implications addressing primarily our colleagues, we suggest hystericizing our alienation from our labor with simple acts of critique in management education and research. In other words, by hystericizing, we mean not only asking questions to produce more knowledge for the market, but also always staying in a questioning mode and being dissatisfied with the answers. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

We elaborate a student moral development theory of how universities influence the moral development of business undergraduates by moving from a strictly American to a cross-cultural perspective. Applying the same instrument used in Hanson and Moore's (2014) student moral development theory, we compare qualitative data from three universities: one American, one Moroccan, and one Brazilian. These universities differ substantially in identity, comprising secular and religious as well as public and private institutions. Sample participants range from 16 to 71 traditional business students enrolled as juniors or seniors at each university. Using qualitative coding methods, our work confirms the fundamental concepts of the original theory and improves the model by elaborating nuances in cross-cultural settings. We expand detail in two of the five original factors: moral cultural identity and institutional moral reinforcement. We also create a construct explaining relational dynamics governing student development between the student and model factors. Findings support that students are morally developed by the university system, showing ethical character outcomes. Implications suggest universities might maximize environmental artifacts and student-university relationships to develop students as effective moral agents in university, business, and community settings. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

What we have yet to see, however, and what we would like to begin with this essay, is a meaningful discussion regarding the overarching goals of sustainable and responsible management education as they relate to the available teaching and learning resources in this domain. To achieve this, we first identify the tensions between teaching sustainability to change the world for the better and those aimed at making companies better off. We propose a balance between these two aspirations. We then turn to the thoughts of academic practitioners in the field with a survey of 169 management and sustainability instructors. Results indicate that respondents use papers, cases, and videos to teach courses in this field, while textbooks and electronic resources (i.e., databases, simulations, and apps) are only marginally utilized. The respondents are only moderately satisfied with most of the available teaching resources and the integration of existing resources within general curricula. The results show some interesting differences between postgraduate and undergraduate courses, and also between junior and senior instructors. In this essay, we argue that the moral enthusiasm for teaching in the sustainability domain must not take away from precise analysis of problems, solutions, their implementability, and their interconnected complexity. As such, we propose a set of five recommendations for the design and selection of sustainability management teaching resources that will effectively address issues related to planet, people, and profits. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

Despite these efforts, corporate diversity training oftentimes is not effective, as it does not sufficiently enable training participants to constructively deal with diversity. We specify the underlying barriers to learning that may cause diversity training to fail: The trainees' tendency to keep quiet about their thoughts or to voice them in a dogmatic manner, which is likely to lead to latent or manifest conflicts, hindering learning. We also show why the currently dominant diversity-training models-labeled according to their objectives as ""equal opportunities,"" ""integrating minorities,"" and ""inclusion via 'me' within 'we'""-do not suffice to overcome these barriers to learning, largely due to dysfunctional beliefs of the trainers, as these shape learning processes, and thus, training success. Proposing that tolerance acts as a vehicle to overcoming the barriers to learning in diversity training, we introduce a training model focused on fostering tolerance and sustained by tolerance-supportive trainer beliefs. We discuss training measures that could aid the development of tolerance in trainees, limitations of our tolerance-centered diversity training, and venues for future research. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

Economics education and value change: The role of program-normative homogeneity and peer influence,2017,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031765141&doi=10.5465%2famle.2014.0280&partnerID=40&md5=a187fb84973948a2c2b5dfb82193a8ea,"In the light of corporate scandals and the recent financial crisis, there has been an increased interest in the impact of business education on the value orientations of graduates. Yet our understanding of how students' values change during their time at business school is limited. In this study,weinvestigate the effects of variations in the normative orientations of economics programs. We argue that interaction among economics students constitutes a key mechanism of value socialization, the effects of which are likely to vary across more-or-less normatively homogeneous economics programs. In normatively homogeneous programs, students are particularly likely to adopt economics values as a result of peer interaction. We specifically explore changes in power, hedonism, and self-direction values in a 2-year longitudinal study of economics students (N 5 197) in a normatively homogeneous and two normatively heterogeneous economics programs. As expected, for students in a normatively homogeneous economics program, interaction with peers was linked with an increase in power and hedonism values, and a decrease in self-direction values. Our findings highlight the interplay between program normative homogeneity and peer interaction as an important factor in value socialization during economics education and have important practical implications for business school leaders. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2017.",,

Drawing from general strain theory,we find that certain features of the social and national institutional context in which these scholars are embedded provides motivation for and facilitates rationalization of engagement in the double-dipping practice. Specifically, our results show that the incidence of conference paper double dipping is greater for junior scholars and for those currently affiliated with research-intensive universities. We also find that authors who received their highest educational degree in countries with higher levels of corruption are more likely to engage in double dipping. The study provides a better theoretical understanding of contextual factors that may lead individuals to engage in questionable academic practices.We hope our findings will raise this issue to fuller scrutinywithin the Academy, and motivate some potential remedies to reduce the frequency of this questionable behavior. © Academy of Management Learning & Education,2017.",,

Due to their negative valence, stories about other peoples' failures as compared to stories about other peoples' successes should elicit a more pronounced motivational response, such that people elaborate the content of failure stories more actively. As a consequence, the knowledge gained from failure stories will more likely be applied on a transfer task. We expect this motivational response to failure stories and its benefits for learning to be most pronounced for people who view failures as valuable learning opportunities. We report an experimental study, in which participants were exposed to a managerial training with stories about either managerial successes or managerial failures that delivered the same learning content. Results showed that stories about managerial failures led to more elaboration and learning transfer, in particular for participants who see the learning potential of failures. We discuss how failure stories can be used to stimulate managerial learning in educational and organizational settings.",,

Defining researcher care as what scholars are concerned and passionate about, we consider the extent to which individual researchers lose their personal voice in researching organizations. This bounding of care by the research community is a reflection of the way that researchers knowingly alter their care in researching organizations to gain associated career and reputational benefits. We describe how the field's institutional logic for researching organizations enables this devolution to take hold and how larger institutional forces reinforce how it progressively moderates organizational knowledge. We offer preliminary suggestions for addressing the devolution of researcher care in organization studies and ameliorating its threat to knowledge development.",,

Faculty disseminate new knowledge to stakeholders using a range of different mediums and activities. However, a question of growing importance to scholars, administrators, policy makers, and practitioners remains: knowledge for whom? To address this question, we build on institutional theory and institutional work and argue the value that individual faculty ascribe to these different mediums (e.g., academic journals, books) depends on both institutional biographical and contextual factors. We analyze individual's biographical factors of academic socialization (graduate training, ranking of graduate program, career tenure); practitioner socialization, and interdisciplinary appointments. We assess contextual factors of the school's strategic orientation and accreditation. Our biographical analysis of 740 faculty members from 13 elite and non-elite Canadian business schools suggests that different knowledge-dissemination activities are anchored in a faculty member's scholarly socialization and are influenced by both individual and contextual factors. Our results suggest the divide between academics and practitioners in business schools can be bridged by individual faculty members who possess both academic and professional qualifications. © Academy of Management Learning & Education,2017.",,

Human resource development programs for employees from different generations may help address these challenges. However, there is a lack of insight into what types of knowledge employees in intergenerational training groups acquire from one another, as well as how these learning processes differ at different time points. Over a span of 3 years, we conducted 31 interviews at an automobile company involving young (16-19 years) and experienced participants (41-47 years) of a full-Time intergenerational learning program and their instructors. Our findings show that both generations possess distinct expert, practical, social, and metacognitive knowledge, and that they exchange different types of knowledge at different time points. We integrate these findings into a phase model of intergenerational learning comprising three phases: (1) familiarization, (2) assimilation, and (3) detachment. Our results suggest that intergenerational learning should be conceptualized as a bidirectional process with different foci of mutual knowledge exchange across different temporal phases. To facilitate intergenerational learning, instructors should adapt their teaching methods to employees' phase-specific needs and find ways to systematically map older and younger employees' specific knowledge contents. © Academy of Management Learning & Education,2017.",,

Spurred by the meteoric rise of behavioral ethics over the last decade, the interview probes whether normative and behavioral ethics can and should be integrated as a matter of pedagogy. Although the panelists diverge in the extent towhich theyemphasize normative or behavioral ethics in their teaching, a consensus emerges around the proposition that a business ethics course must tackle the integration of normative and behavioral approaches. In the course of the interview, a variety of strategies for doing so are introduced, and we conclude with two different conceptions for synthesizing the approaches, each proposed to make these insights accessible to instructors, whether trained in social science, philosophy, or law. The ""map-And-car"" conception relies upon normative ethics to define one's desired path and behavioral ethics to address the means for getting there given what we are like as humans, whereas the ""spaghetti"" model-drawing precedent from virtue ethics-conceives as intertwined the numerous threads of normative and behavioral ethics.

But such examples of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP) serve to obscure the less flagrant, more subtle cases of possible misconduct: what some have called ""questionable research practices"" (QRPs). Where FFP is seen as inherently negative, QRPs fall into an ethical ""gray zone"" between permissible and impermissible. We draw on semistructured interviews with business school scholars to explore the occurrence of QRPs. Prevalent QRPs include playing with numbers, playing with models, and playing with hypotheses. Scholars explain the existence of QRPs in three ways: the inadequate training of researchers, the pressures and incentives to publish in certain outlets, and the demands and expectations of journal editors and reviewers. We argue that a paradox is at work here: To live up to the positivist image of ""pure science"" that appears in academic journals, researchers may find themselves-ironically-transgressing this very ideal. Ultimately, this challenges the individualistic account of academic misconduct by drawing attention to the role played by institutional actors, such as academic journals, in encouraging forms of QRPs.",,

In this article I seek to clarify the pedagogical grounds for integrating poverty issues in management education by examining the intellectual and personal development benefits of doing so. By critically discussing four thematic modes of business involvement in poverty reduction, I showhowsuch initiatives can be used as lenses throughwhich to view complex and often paradoxical interconnections between socioeconomic and environmental systems. Thus I conclude that a consideration of poverty issues is not a marginal matter, but is key to grasping the 21st century complexities of global business and management.",,

First, the career benefits associated with engaging in noncredible research practices (NCRPs; e.g., data manipulation, fabricating results, data hoarding, undisclosed HARKing) result in many academics choosing self-interest over collective welfare. These perverse incentives derive from journal gatekeepers who are pressed into a similar social dilemma; namely, an individual journal's status (i.e., its ""impact factor"") is likely to suffer from unilaterally implementing practices that help ensure the credibility of management science claims (e.g., dedicating journal space to strict replications, crowd-sourcing replications, data-submission requirements, in-house analysis checks, registered reports, Open Practice badges). Fortunately, research on social dilemmas and collective action offers solutions. For example, journal editors could pledge to publish a certain number of credibility boosting articles contingent on a proportion of their ""peer"" journals doing the same. Details for successful implementation of conditional pledges, other social dilemma solutions-including actions for management academics who support changes in journal practices (e.g., reviewer boycotts/buycotts), and insights on credibilitysupportive journal practices from other fields-are provided.",,

Published articles sometimes report only some hypotheses that researchers tested, or some statistical analyses that researchers made. Articles often imply that researchers formulated all hypotheses before they examined their data, when in fact they added or deleted hypotheses after they made some data analyses. Indeed, such covert practices are so common that new entrants into management research may think they are correct behavior. Yet, these practices create false impressions about the validity of research and they undermine the openness that ought to create trust among researchers. Researchers have tried to halt these practices by labeling them ""unethical,"" but their continued prevalence questions the effectiveness of wholly critical approaches. We propose a constructive path toward reform: advocating honesty about actual research processes by adding discussions of inferences drawn after data analyses. Post hoc data analyses can stimulate important theoretical ideas; running alternative statistical models can deepen understanding of empirical patterns; lack of support for hypotheses can identify incorrect or incomplete theories. The management research culture should encourage these practices. Their negative effects result from the lack of explicit reporting about them.",,

Rather than institute actual change and include sustainability in organizational activities, business schools may merely indicate that such change is taking place. We examine the key organizational and strategic conditions under which business schools decouple their sustainability policies from their practices. We draw on interviews with 40 deans of U.K. business schools and analyze the data using fuzzy set (fs) qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA), a method that investigates combinations of individual conditions.

We highlight examples of successful relationships between business schools and other academic departments, which offer some optimism for a reimagined public interest mission for business schools. Finally, we draw out some boundary conditions to take a more contingent view of possibilities for such interdisciplinary collaboration encompassing business schools. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

"Study abroad programs: Individual motivations, cultural intelligence, and the mediating role of cultural boundary spanning",2016,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995484525&doi=10.5465%2famle.2015.0128&partnerID=40&md5=3bf206353ac45ced86afa62b330e04d0,"Studying abroad is recognized as a key strategy in preparing students for future international engagements and increasing their cultural intelligence (CQ). Although several studies explore the impact of demographic factors, little is known about the impact ofpsychographic determinants such as the motivation to go abroad. We analyze the role of cultural boundary spanning (CBS) abroad as a mediator in the relationship between individual motives and CQ in this context. Guided by self-determination theory, we surveyed 901 university students from 46 countries. The results indicate that CBS positively affects all four dimensions of CQ. Structural equation modeling further reveals that intrinsic motivation and high self-determined extrinsic motivation are positively related to CBS and that the impact of these motivations on CQ is mediated by CBS. These findings contribute to our understanding of processes that improve CQ and the roles of motivation and CBS in intercultural interactions abroad. Based on our findings, we recommend that educators include motivation tests in the selection process of exchange students. Moreover, they should consider the negative effect of accompanying friends, and therefore, mix foreign and local students in dormitories, as well as courses and extracurricular activities to support intercultural interactions. CBS skills may be improved through intercultural training, compulsory multicultural team assignments, and university ambassador programs. Further implications of our findings for business schools, international offices, and students are discussed, and future research avenues are highlighted. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

Given this diversity in disciplines underlying the management field, we argue that management scholars are likely to have difficulty in understanding the intellectual foundations of these fields and how to integrate them effectively into their work. Providing meaning, perspective, and insight is the purpose of academic research; however, if this is done without an understanding of background or context, results and interpretations might not prove to be as valuable- or even as accurate-as they could be. Thus, we suggest that academics and students of management would be well served by creating their own ""intellectual genogram,"" which describes those individuals who have influenced and mentored them and how the disciplines and schools of thought that they represent have affected their thinking. The process of creating an ""intellectual genogram"" allows individuals to better understand their intellectual heritage and gain insight on how they became who they are. We provide an illustration of an intellectual genogram of one academic and a 5-stage learning model to encourage such a learning process. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,
Coming full circle with reactions: Understanding the structure and correlates of trainee reactions through the affect circumplex,2016,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995422416&doi=10.5465%2famle.2014.0012&partnerID=40&md5=d2077fcec9932d82fe9b9e10d45a9c56,"Research suggests that the structure of trainee reactions is captured with as few as one or as many as 11 dimensions. It is commonly understood that reactions contain both affective and cognitive components. To date, however, training research focuses largely on affective reactions that range from pleasant to unpleasant (i.e., valence). Here, we expand and further refine the construct of affective trainee reactions by including reactions that are more and less activating versions of pleasantness (e.g., excitement and calm, respectively) and unpleasantness (e.g., stress and boredom, respectively). We develop and validate a new measure based on this model and argue that the structure of affective reactions has implications for better understanding learning and course reputation outcomes. Results from a short online training indicate that reactions were best explained by four factors: pleasant activation (e.g., excitement), pleasant deactivation (e.g., calm), unpleasant activation (e.g., tension), and unpleasant deactivation (e.g., boredom). In addition to these four factors, results also show a general activation factor underlying all items, which produces a bifactor measurement model. The relationships between these reactions and training outcomes suggest what is most beneficial for course reputation outcomes (i.e., pleasant activating reactions) may not benefit learning; what is most beneficial for learning (i.e., pleasant deactivating reactions) may benefit course reputation outcomes but slightly less so. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

We follow with a brief reminder of extant literature on the utility of business education and its seeming misalignment with the competencies and skills specified by practitioners. Key pressures and trends on and within this system, such as internationalization, accreditation, and a greater emphasis on publications are identified and discussed. We then combine these threads in a partial replication of the work of Dierdorff and Rubin (2006; Rubin & Dierdorff, 2009). Specifically, we present collated information on 1582 classes from 542 programs at the top Grandes Ecoles de Commerce alongside further secondary data and then analyze it in respect of alignment with Rubin and Dierdorff's identified behavioral competencies. We argue that theoutcome of these pressures may well be that inherent and historical strengths of great value are being discarded, and that the degree of irrelevance and misalignment between educational provision and required managerial competence will stay the same or even get worse. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

We draw upon sociology of science research, ""new careers"" literature, and social capital research to build a multilevel model of individual research productivity emergence. The study looks at the interplay between organizational scripts and individual strategies as part of a microfoundations research program, and seeks to create consensus on the relative importance of each antecedent in supporting research outcomes. Our hypotheses are tested using a sample of 500 academics randomly selected from 25 research-intensive U.S. business schools ranked at the top of the University of Texas at Dallas ranking. The findings of the study demonstrate that both organizational environment and individual behavior influence the research performance of U.S. business school faculties, with collaboration behavior being the most important driver of research outcomes. These findings can inform decision making for academics at all stages of a research-active career. We hope that the developmental practices based on these results will become part of doctoral students' training and will facilitate the students' socialization into the research profession. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

In this investigation, we used a predictive, quasi-experimental design with 246 students from a business school in Colombia who were enrolled in 10 sections of a leadership course to examine expected effects of instructional methods that promoted different levels of social interaction and reflection on self-reported learning behaviors (dialogue and reflection activities), self-efficacy for class performance, and instructors' assessments of students' skill demonstration (team work, communication, influence, and work proficiency and effort). In comparisons to students participating in instructional conditions with less social interaction and fewer reflective activities, students participating in an instructional condition that promoted higher levels of these activities exhibited considerably greater student-student dialogue, instructor-student dialogue, and reflection. These learning behaviors in turn led to enhanced self-efficacy for class performance and skilled activity. In addition, students' perceptions of psychological safety partially mediated relationships between instructional method and dialogical and reflective activities. The implications of these findings for coupling action, dialogue, and reflective activities in management education and training as well as avenues for future research are discussed. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

But can business schools rise to this challenge? Comparing a business school to another professional school, social work, that encourages prosocial values, we investigated value profiles as reflected in school websites and among their students. The findings show that the business school expresses self-enhancement values (power and achievement) more, and prosocial values (benevolence and universalism) less than the social work school. We further investigated self-selection and socialization as complementary organizational processes that may lead to and sustain the value profile of each school. Our findings show that as early as the first week of studies, freshmen's values are congruent with the value profile of their departments, indicating a value-based self-selection process. To investigate socialization, we compared freshmen and seniors and conducted a yearlong study among freshmen. The findings revealed a small change in students' values throughout their training, providing only some support for value socialization. Altogether, our findings suggest that business schools that are interested in prosocial students should attract and select students that emphasize these values, rather than rely on socialization attempts. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

We accomplish this by employing critical discourse analysis on a collection of New York Times articles. In the first stage of our analysis, we focus on how interns are characterized by the New York Times, which leads to the identification of three subject positions: (1) The intern as cheap labor, (2) the intern as a non-employee, and (3) the overworked intern. In the next stage, we expose the discourses or discursive strategies that are being employed to construct these subject positions. In the final stage, we discuss the implications of these subject positions as they apply to questions of power. Specifically, we show how the discourses surrounding the internship and the resulting subject positions serve to privilege the organization or manager while marginalizing and disempowering the intern. We conclude with a discussion of new avenues for change, suggesting that educators be more engaged in reshaping the internship discourse by disseminating counterdiscourses that disrupt the discursive and otherwise problematic nature of the internship. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

However, although narrative pedagogical methods are widely employed in business education, and there are literature-focused electives, business seems to be too busy to require students to read novels. Novels may be perceived to be too long to generate an immediate return on investment. Few great novels are about business, and fewer still are set in a business environment relevant to the economic and technological context of the 21st century. The ones that are, however, are worth the investment, as they just might turn our business students into better business people. This ""novel"" claim builds upon the widely accepted thesis that narrative pedagogy cultivates better business people, as well as the increasing scientific evidence of the benefits of reading great novels. It goes further to suggest that great novels might belong in the core ethics requirement in that the form and quality of a narrative determines its enduring, ethical effectiveness. In particular, novels explore in a distinctive way the intersection of what to do and how to live that management education needs to develop better persons and more responsible professionals. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

Although these suggestions may be particularly beneficial for non-U.S. authors who lack visibility in high impact journals, the suggestions are usually not based on empirical data. Thus, we argue that writing advice should be evidence-based and explain what the field of applied linguistics has to offer in this regard. Using the linguistic concept of hedges (words reducing commitment to claims), we analyze 1,991 management research articles written by U.S., European, and Indian scholars. We find that European and Indian researchers use hedges less often, suggesting that expectations of reviewers from U.S. journals are likely unmet. More generally, our research implies that research socializations might influence authors' and reviewers' perceptions of the necessity of rhetorical devices. Our hope is that the results of this study might raise the awareness forsuch peculiarities of language and convince editors and reviewers to become more tolerant of them.

To this end, we develop a curriculum matrix based on social-practice wisdom to assist students in learning appropriate knowledge and skills, enact social entrepreneurship goals, and integrate competing logics in innovative and sustainable ways. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

In both the success and failure accounts, our analysis revealed a striking black-and-white picture that resulted in the institutionalization of Nokia's metanarratives of success and failure.

Through a longitudinal, participant-observer study of a collaborative setting concerned with interdisciplinary research, we develop an understanding of the interpretive dynamics of learning in collaborative contexts. From these findings we develop insights on the outcomes associated with two interpretive modes of engagement-instrumental collaborative exchange and curiosity-driven dialogue-enacted through three learning practices: exploring limitations, developing connections, and developing shared interpretive horizons. We conclude that the consequences for learning can vary with the interpretive approach and articulate the implications for interpretation theory and management education that arise from this. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

Posttest data were used to assess the relationships among critical thinking, simulation performance, and the problem-solving approach. We found that participation in the simulations was an effective way to develop critical thinking skills. Critical thinking was also related to performance, but only in one of the three simulations. The problem-solving approach did not mediate the relationship between critical thinking and performance; however, a competitive approach to problem solving was predictive of lower performance, and significant relationships were found between critical thinking subcategories and both problem-solving approaches. We discuss the implications of our results and identify web-based simulations as a useful supplemental pedagogy for developing the important skill of critical thinking.

While previous research largely concentrated on the effects of different types of rewards on motivation, we focus on the smallness of rewards. Based on a quasi-experiment in an online learning environment, our research shows that small rewards enhance autonomous motivation. The behavioral measures used to assess autonomous and initial controlled motivation to learn suggest that a small number of bonus points increases persistence in rewarded behavior, as well as persistence and performance on nonrewarded behavior. Apart from its empirical contribution, our work also adds to the literature on this topic by integrating two previously unrelated perspectives. First, based on the concept of insufficient justification and on self-determination theory, we explain that in the case of small rewards that students perceive as inadequate justification for exerting effort, the informational aspect outweighs the controlling aspect.Our research also highlights the practical implications for online educators in that small rewards serve as a substitute for personal feedback, making it possible to achieve desirable learning outcomes in a learning context where personal interaction is limited. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

A term coined by the Romantic poet John Keats, NC is an imaginative, intuitive, and aesthetic approach to life in a state of diligent indolence and passive receptivity that invites one to be comfortable with uncertainty, mystery, and doubt. NC provides space for doubt to flourish in organizations and promotes a culture of inquiry and learning. We propose that NC is important in leadership because it helps shift the awareness of leaders from ego to eco, creating excellence with its aspects of intensity and aesthetics and bringing in a moral commitment to others, both human and nonhuman. We argue that an NC-based approach to management teaching would lead to an awakening of the senses and openness to possibilities and potentialities.

Helping networks reflect the mobilization of social capital where network contacts exchange social and material resources. As such, helping networks are distinct from friendship networks, which represent access to social capital but not necessarily its use. We identify three dimensions of social capital mobilization with different effects on status, specifically, mutual helping, nonmutual help giving, and nonmutual help receiving. Findings indicate that social capital mobilization through nonmutual help giving is a positive predictor of influence among peers at a later point in time. Nonmutual help receiving and mutual helping are unrelated to influence when nonmutual help giving is controlled. Gender moderates this relationship, but international student status does not. Nonmutual help giving does not enhance the perceived influence of women, particularly among domestic men. These findings support theories of status devaluation for marginalized groups and have implications for the value of the MBA for female students relative to their male peers. Future research on the predictors and outcomes of social capital mobilization can enhance understanding of the organizational experiences of diverse identity groups. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

Further, the importance of innovation is a romantic theme; accepting one's personal responsibility for one's decisions is a distinctively existentialist demand; and the idea that the world and human existence are without firm foundations is the dominating message of postmodernism. Knowingly or not, in one way or another, all important management authors inscribe themselves in at least one of these traditions. No management education is complete if it is not anchored in their understanding. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,
Taking off the blinders: A comparative study of university students' changing perceptions of gender discrimination in the workplace from 2006 to 2013,2016,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978923787&doi=10.5465%2famle.2014.0139&partnerID=40&md5=7e41892a12efc3f1c1bd3214582d4964,"As evidenced by recent legislation and various forms of media attention, eradicating gender inequity in the workforce is of significant importance today. However, this interest in justice stands in bold contrast to the continued gender wage gap, the steady number of gender discrimination suits filed each year, and the plethora of high-profile cases exposed in the media. Previous data collected in 2006 suggests that the very group readying to enter the workforce does not perceive gender discrimination as a threat of major significance to themselves or others. University students tend to minimize or even disregard the likelihood that they will witness or experience gender bias or discrimination in their careers. Our work here serves as a continuation of and a comparison to the 2006 study, with the goal of determining whether the perspective of university students has shifted, or whether they continue to consider themselves immune to the injustice of gender discrimination at work. Our findings suggest that students in this cohort are not only more aware of these issues, but that this awareness has expanded to include increased concern over gender discrimination against men as well. However, the reluctance of students to believe that they personally will be affected by gender discrimination has been and continues to be surprisingly high. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

International students now constitute an important component of the student body at many universities, especially in their business schools. The increased presence of international students has generated newdemands, challenges, and opportunities for these business schools, and a number of issues related to international students have been identified in the literature. However, this increased presence has not led universities and business schools to develop adequate responses to these issues or to make subsequent changes in the curriculum. Diversity on campus continues to be managed in roughly the same way as in business organizations. Drawing on the notion that diversity should be defined and understood in terms of context, this conceptual article redefines diversity on campus, identifies limitations of current diversity education in the higher education context, and develops a competency-oriented approach to improve inclusion and academic performance of international students. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

The results of two experiments show that business school students in low academic ability scenarios anticipate experiencing higher negative emotions when their consumption of cognitive enhancements is known by others than when it is unknown, while business school students in high academic ability scenarios are less sensitive to such social awareness concerns. The results of the third and final experiment demonstrate that business school students in high academic ability scenarios anticipate experiencing higher negative emotions when the consumption of cognitive enhancements is considered an act of academic dishonesty than when it is not, while business school students in lowacademic ability scenarios are unaffected by suchmoral concerns.

Within the context of our critically informed teaching practice, we see moments of deep learning and reflexivity in classroom discussions and assessments. Yet, these moments of criticality are interspersed with surface learning and reflection. We draw on dichotomous, linear developmental, and messy explanations of learning processes to empirically explore the learning journeys of 20 international Chinese and 42 domestic New Zealand students. We find contradictions within our own data, and between our findings and the extant literature. We conclude that expressions of surface learning and reflection are considerably more complex than they first appear. Moreover, developing critical reflexivity is a far more subtle, messy, and emotional experience than previously understood. We present the theoretical and pedagogical significance of these findings when we consider the implications for the learning process and the practice of management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

As yet, there is limited understanding of how operating in a native or a foreign language impacts students' propensity to free ride in group settings. Building on general dual process theory of higher cognition and using a unique dataset of 276 Dutch business school students, we find that students are more inclined to free ride in a foreign language setting than in a native language setting. A student's conscientiousness attenuates this relationship such that this effect is stronger for studentswho are less conscientious, and weaker and almost absent for those who are more conscientious.After a student decides not to free ride but to positively contribute to the group, the specific level of contribution is not affected by foreign language.

There are compelling arguments on both sides. On one hand, advocates for the transformative role of IT can point to several success stories. On the other hand, skeptics of the role of IT in management education can also point to support for their view. This lack of consensus has led researchers in Academy of Management Learning & Education to call for scholars to confront the bias against online education (Redpath, 2012) and engage in serious research on online education (Arbaugh, DeArmond, & Rau, 2013). In this article, we respond to these calls for research by using adaptive structuration theory to develop a conceptual model of three factors that influence the use of IT in business education. We review prior research for each factor and use the conceptual model to identify implications for the design and delivery of business education. Based on the implications, we offer recommendations and recognize challenges for business schools and faculty related to the use of IT in business education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,
Questioning neoliberal capitalism and economic inequality in business schools,2015,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958762533&doi=10.5465%2famle.2014.0182&partnerID=40&md5=17d1cb032a3a6acce2d9f27d77f8b117,"The burgeoning economic inequality between the richest and the poorest is a cause of concern for social, political, and ethical reasons. While businesses are both implicated and affected by growing inequality, business schools have largely neglected to subject the phenomenon to sufficient critique. This is, in part, because far too many management educators rely on orthodox economic perspectives - often represented by neoliberal capitalism - which have dominated the curricula and the teaching philosophy of business schools. To address this issue, we underscore the need for business schools to critically examine the relationship between neoliberal capitalism and economic inequality, and to overtly engage with this nexus in pedagogical practice. We conclude by revisiting the concepts of relationality and answerability as paths by which to address the current predicament. Relationality and answerability collectively offer (1) conceptual and reflexive tools by which to reimagine business school education, and, (2) space for business schools to debate important questions about the taken-for-granted, but problematic, assumptions underlying the ideology of neoliberal capitalism. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

But how can greater diversity of thought be encouraged when educating management students beyond the advocacy of affirmative action and relating the research on the link between multiplicity and creativity? One way is to think again about how we introduce the subject. Introductory textbooks often begin by relaying the history of management. What is presented is a very limited monocultural and linear view of how management emerged. This article highlights how this history may limit the view of management scholars in contrast to the broader perspectives that the histories of other comparable fields, like medicine and architecture, encourage. We discuss how a wider, deeper, and more engaged understanding of management history can foster thinking differently in our field. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2016.",,

To better understand the drivers of interns' work outcomes, we hypothesize that supervisor humor plays a signaling role related to interns that sends implicit messages about organizational and supervisory relationships, and thereby, affects interns' attitudes and behaviors. Using a sample of 184 students enrolled in internship programs, through structural equation modeling, our study empirically examines the relationship between supervisor humor use and intern satisfaction, intention to stay, and negligent behavior at work. Our findings suggest that the use of positive humor is associated with a higher level of intern satisfaction, whereas the use of negative humor has the opposite effect. Intern satisfaction, moreover, is found to mediate the relationship between humor and interns' attitudes at work, suggesting that a supervisor's use of appropriate humor can, through satisfaction, reduce negligent behavior and improve willingness to accept permanent employment at the organization. Based on these findings, we discuss the importance of the dyadic intern-supervisor relationship as a key determinant of internship effectiveness. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

Engagement in cultural trigger events emerged as a central category. In a second study, we trained 130 employees using the emergent definition of a cultural trigger event from Study 1. Specifically, we predicted and found an increase in cultural intelligence and a decrease in ethnocentrism following training on a series of cross-cultural trigger events replicating those experienced during international work assignments. The findings of these two studies collectively present an innovative and viable supplement to international immersion experiences for the development of cultural intelligence and provide a useful tool for organizations in our rapidly changing global marketplace. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

It has great ambition: All manner of organizational problems are held to be amenable to an evidence-based approach.

Indeed, in the longer term, such narrowness may limit our capacity to engage withmany reallife issues in organizations. Having repeatedly heard the case for evidence-based management, we invite readers to weigh the case against. We also set out an alternative direction - one that promotes intellectual pluralism and flexibility, the value of multiple perspectives, openness, dialogue, and the questioning of basic assumptions. These considerations are the antithesis of an evidence-based approach, but central to a fully rounded management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

However, college students do not always accept even well-documented research findings. Among the reasons this might happen, we focus on the potential role of psychological mechanisms triggered by scholarly arguments that affect students' self-concepts, leading them to engage in self-enhancing or self-protective responses. We investigated such processes by examining students' reactions to a research argument emphasizing the importance of intelligence to job performance, in comparison to their reactions to research arguments emphasizing the importance of emotional intelligence or fit. Consistent with our predictions, students were less likely to accept the argument for the importance of intelligence compared to the alternative, less threatening, arguments (i.e., the importance of emotional intelligence or fit). Further, acceptance of the argument about the importance of intelligence was affected by students' grade point average (GPA) and moderated by their emotional stability. Specifically, consistent with self-enhancement theory, students with lower GPAs were more likely to reject the argument for intelligence and give self-protective reasons for their responses, whereas students with higher GPAs were more likely to accept the argument and give self-enhancing reasons.

We contend that business schools sustain this disconnect through a dehumanization of leadership that is manifested in the reduction of leadership to a set of skills and its elevation to a personal virtue. The dehumanization of leadership, we suggest, serves as a valuable defense against, but a poor preparation for, the ambiguity and precariousness of leadership in contemporary workplaces. We propose ways to humanize leadership by putting questions about the meaning of leadership - its nature, function, and development - at the center of scholarly and pedagogical efforts. Reflecting on our attempts to do so, we argue that it involves revisiting not just theories and teaching methods, but also our identities as scholars and instructors. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

Contributing to the literatures on the FF and the Americanization of management education, we show how the aspirations of Thomas Carroll, a leader in postwar management education for the FF's idealized, and still prevalent, form of ""scientific"" business school were thwarted in Brazil. We also show that Carroll secretly engaged with the U.S.-supported Brazilian military dictatorship, suggesting the FF was actively supportive of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America. Yet, while Brazilian EAESP actors shaped the school according to their own priorities and ignored Carroll's, they managed to spend the FF's money. Broader understandings of the FF as a ""dominating"" power in management education, must therefore, be nuanced, taking this subversion into account.More generally, this ""first wave"" case in the internationalization of management education has lessons for today's management educators, particularly given the burgeoning interest in global management and global management education.

In relation to this we address two questions business schools don't ask: ""What is the experiential nature of power? How are we teaching power?"" We use experiential, aesthetic developments on power in the social sciences to critique the rational-utilitarian stance on power found in business schools, drawing on the work of Dewey and French philosopher Levinas to treat power as a lived phenomenon. We overview and critique approaches to teaching power in business curricula informed by our own research on Executive MBA students learning through choral conducting. Taking an appreciative-positive stance, this research showed students developing new, nonrational, nonutilitarian understandings of power. They developed nuanced learning on the feeling, relationality, and responsibility of exercising power.

We ask whether the perceived wisdom relating to what business should be is ""wise,"" and whether the models and frameworks used in management education enable wisdom to flourish. The distinction between means and ends (i.e., terminal goals, such as human welfare and instrumental goals, such as money) is highlighted. We argue that management models that measure success in purely financial terms demonstrate foolishness by conflating the means with the end. If business is to retain its legitimacy and benefit society, profit needs to be seen as a means to the end of sustainable business not an end in itself. This should in turn be reflected in the metrics used to measure success in management models and theories. Cross-cultural comparisons with economies based on different value systems offer insight into alternative approaches. We highlight examples of how business schools are adjusting their curriculum and conclude that changes need to go beyond superficial inclusion of ethical issues. Recommendations include updating the business curriculum with more prosocial management theories and a reprioritization of the goal of social welfare over individual business profit maximization. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,

Narcissus' errors highlight the risks of noncritical reflection, involving the deceptions of familiarity and the appropriation ofmeaning. Narcissus' journey from reflection to critical reflection triggers an ethical crisis, but for us, such a journey can be a spur to reflexivity, emphasizing the contingency of our knowledge claims and the ethics of our presence in the world. Woven through our discussion is the theme of power. Narcissus' initially naïve reflection incorporates the power to controlmeaning, and he proves incapable of relinquishing control over others to develop greater control over himself. We call for a softening of the distinctions in the management literature between (individual-psychological) reflection and (relational-political) critical reflection, arguing that our exploration of narcissism reveals the political-in-thepersonal.

Teaching leadership critically: New directions for leadership pedagogy,2015,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958746943&doi=10.5465%2famle.2014.0079&partnerID=40&md5=0eb215d2bc4ce5e76097ecdbe3437d5a,"Conventional approaches to teaching leadership in business schools have overrelied on transformational models that stress the role of charismatic individuals, usually white men, in setting compelling visions to which all organizational actors are expected to subscribe. Such approaches pay insufficient attention to the dynamics of power, the influence of context, and the significance of follower dissent and resistance. This article examines the pedagogical potential of critical leadership studies: an emergent, alternative paradigm questioning deepseated assumptions that power and agency should be vested in the hands of a few leaders and exploring the dysfunctional consequences of such power dynamics for individuals, organizations, and societies. It also recognizes that follower compliance and conformity, as well as resistance and dissent, are important features of leadership dynamics. Informed by our own experience of trying to teach leadership more critically, this essay highlights a number of guiding principles that we have used in the classroom to encourage a more questioning approach from our students in their study of leadership. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2015.",,
Managing employees with mental health issues: Identification of conceptual and procedural knowledge for development within management education curricula,2015,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926623736&doi=10.5465%2famle.2012.0287&partnerID=40&md5=4b363bc9b450db571c94b2f950357590,"Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety are prevalent and costly on both social and economic levels. Because a large proportion of the costs are borne by employers, organizations need to develop effective responses. We frame dealing with employee mental health issues as a reasonably common, but complex, managerial job demand that requires adequate preparation. Hence, we position the development of applied management knowledge (AMK) for effectively managing employee mental health issues as a critical objective for management education. Our study presents an analysis of qualitative data related to managers' experiences of working with an employee with a mental health issue that identifies forms of knowledge used and needed in these situations. Our findings indicate that managers reference specific forms of conceptual and procedural knowledge when (1) becoming aware of the employee's mental health issue; (2) exploring the workplace implications and developing an action response; (3) implementing the response and managing it as an ongoing situation, and (4) engaging in reflective learning. In order to begin the work of curriculum development, we provide a preliminary discussion of educational strategies that may aid in the development of this form of AMK and outline a number of priorities for future research and practice.

The intellectual link between management research and popularization media: A bibliometric analysis of the Harvard Business Review,2015,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926669299&doi=10.5465%2famle.2012.0397&partnerID=40&md5=e9f3f65af08c1011313de39797b31742,"We explore the intellectual link between management research and popularization media. In the ""dominant view"" of popularization in the sociology of science, the process of popularization is understood as a one-way movement of ideas from the field of science to the general public. Thus, it is seen as unlikely to influence management research. However, more recent research has challenged the assumptions of this view and has offered an alternative perspective, which can be termed the ""revised view"" of popularization. In this view, interactions between science and popularization media are much more complex, and relevant feedback effects from popularization media to scholarly journals are possible. Against this theoretical background, we investigate the role played by an important example of popularization media in the field of management, the Harvard Business Review, in management discourse. Using a bibliometric analysis of 231 Harvard Business Review articles, we analyze the degree, direction, and type of intellectual influence of the publication. Our findings suggest that this magazine's role differs significantly from the traditional view of popularization. According to our results, the Harvard Business Review is not only a widely quoted scientific source, but it also has a significant impact on the scientific discourse in management research.

We use a quasiexperimental design, comparing a MSc entrepreneurship program with a comparison group from a MSc supply-chain management program to test the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education, relying on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The findings suggest that entrepreneurship education is effective. Specifically, students participating in entrepreneurship education show an increase in attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, they have higher entrepreneurial intentions at the end of the program. Finally, entrepreneurial intentions mediate the effect of entrepreneurship education on subsequent behavior associated with the creation of new business ventures. These results suggest that entrepreneurship education emphasizes increasing antecedents of intentions and behavior. © 2015 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
The legitimacy paradox of business schools: Losing by gaining?,2015,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938585260&doi=10.5465%2famle.2013.0106&partnerID=40&md5=58e93cf1fa463872c70c070093865159,"In recent years, many scholars have argued that business schools have jeopardized their legitimacy and identity. However, business schools have also been praised as a success story of higher education. To understand the legitimacy-related contradictions faced by business schools, we examine the historical development of the business school as an academic and professional institution. Specifically, we argue that certain transitions in the ethos and practices of business schools that were aimed at strengthening their legitimacy have subsequently produced challenges and threats to that legitimacy. We then discuss three sequential but interrelated periods, namely, the scientification, politicization, and corporatization of business schools, which have created legitimacy paradoxes and challenges for their management. We conclude by discussing how the legitimacy paradoxes contribute to our understanding regarding the challenges of managing business schools. © 2015 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Drawing on theory related to communication interactivity, we differentiate three types of OC: presenting, listening, and conversing. In reviewing prior empirical research, we found that listening was the most important of these OC types in the workplace, followed by conversing and presenting, respectively. We review and analyze learning goals of U.S. undergraduate business programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. We found that 76% of the business programs had an oral presentation learning goal, 22%, a conversing goal, and 11%, a listening goal. Our research reveals a misalignment between the OC skills needed in the workplace compared to those emphasized in business curricula. We discuss potential reasons for the misalignment and offer suggestions for closing the gap. © 2015 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Based on action regulation theory, we developed an action-based entrepreneurship training. The training put a particular focus on action insofar as the participants learned action principles and engaged in the start-up of a business during the training. We hypothesized that a set of action-regulatory factors mediates the effect of the training on entrepreneurial action. We evaluated the training's impact over a 12-month period using a randomized control group design. As hypothesized, the training had positive effects on action-regulatory factors (entrepreneurial goal intentions, action planning, action knowledge, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy) and the action-regulatory factors mediated the effect of the training on entrepreneurial action. Furthermore, entrepreneurial action and business opportunity identification mediated the effect of the training on business creation. Our study shows that action-regulatory mechanisms play an important role for action-based entrepreneurship trainings and business creation.

Harrison's ideas remain relevant and important, but little has been done to recognize his call for a bill of rights. In response, I propose that it is time to formally recognize a set of basic rights manuscript submitters should be granted during peer review. I explore the basis for five such rights and analyze the forces that are likely to make abiding by these rights difficult in practice. There is much to be done in our journals and in the Academy to shore up protections granted to manuscript submitters during peer review.

The key feature of moving toward the integration required at the individual level is focusing on developing students' capacity for moral and cognitive maturity. To effect this, the practice of genuine dialogue is the focus of our interpersonal method for educating management students. In supporting such education, business schools must, however, first transform themselves. As transformative social enterprises, they model critical questioning as well as improve the impact and relevance of management on flourishing wider society and an ethically oriented economy. We offer practical suggestions and implications for future business education reform. © 2015 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Critics suggest the need for greater emphasis on development of relevant management skills appears just as evident today as it was decades ago (Mintzberg, 2004; Rubin & Dierdorff, 2009).

Only a subset of scholars engage in scientific misconduct despite conditions of procedural injustice; therefore, I also explore the direct and indirect effects of individual differences and local work context. © 2015 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
Why do students choose English as a medium of instruction?

Our work focuses on students with a non-native English-language background in a business school setting. Although proponents argue that EMI generally increases graduates' employability, they do not sufficiently consider that study strategies differ substantially across social milieus and between the sexes. Failing to account for cultural distance of students to the educational system in choosing EMI can foster social inequality and contribute to the reproduction of elites. Using a survey, we conduct a quasi-experiment in two identical bachelor's degree programs that differ only in their instruction language. Using structural equation modeling, we find that students from higher social strata are much more likely to choose EMI. As suggested by the Bourdieusian perspective, this relationship is not directly observable but operates through hidden mechanisms, such as cultural capital (relative English proficiency) and a better sense of gaming and positioning (career orientation). Business students from the lowest stratum self-select against EMI due to a pronounced fear of failure despite their awareness that EMI leads to higher employability. Our findings support the successful introduction of EMI while ensuring social equality. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

In this article, we argue for recognizing the existence and influence of the informal management curriculum, which consists of those elements of the educational environment outside formal goals and assessments. The informal management curriculum is a potentially powerful factor in student learning, and our field's current lack of discussion about it suggests that we are not using its influence as well as we might. We offer a definition of the informal management curriculum, including a comparison to related constructs. Our definition provides the foundation for a conversation among three management education experts, Kenneth G. Brown, Rakesh Khurana, and Robert S.

Its sociopolitical history as well as its location in the global south, in juxtaposition to the global north, raises different challenges. South Africa's multilayer context creates differences in both the challenges faced by universities and management academics and the responses required. The dominant prescriptions for changing management and business education are inadequate where the challenge is transformative nation building across all sectors of society.

Grounded in experiential learning theory, the case study, and critical incident methodology, staff rides involve a preliminary study of the historical event, a visit to the field, and an integration phase. Popular today for wildland, fire, and public health in addition to military instruction, staff rides are unique in engaging participants in active exchange of information, reflective thought, and collective analysis of the event under study.

We argue that this approach is narrow and insufficient, and thereby threatens the credibility and long-term sustainability of the management research community. We offer a solution in the form of a broader and novel conceptual and measurement framework of scholarly impact: a pluralist perspective. It proposes actions that depart from the current win-lose and zerosum views that lead to false trade-offs such as research versus practice, rigor versus relevance, and research versus service. Our proposed pluralist conceptualization can be instrumental in enabling business schools and other academic units to clarify their strategic direction in terms of which stakeholders they are trying to affect and why, the way future scholars are trained, and the design and implementation of faculty performance management systems. We argue that the adoption of a pluralist conceptualization of scholarly impact can increase motivation for engaged scholarship and design-science research that is more conducive to actionable knowledge as opposed to exclusive career-focused advances, enhance the relevance and value of our scholarship, and thereby help to narrow the much-lamented chasm between research and practice. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2014.",,

We propose that entrepreneurship education might be particularly valuable for prisoners because selfemployment as an occupational career path can help overcome potential employers' discriminatory attitudes toward ex-prisoners, and by developing an entrepreneurial mindset, individuals whose career paths have been terminated can begin to form an attitudinal foundation from which to rebuild a future. Using a multiple case study method to analyze 12 participants of a European prison entrepreneurship educational program, we find that without a ""personal agency mind-set - namely, the set of assumptions, belief systems, and self-regulation capabilities through which individuals intentionally exercise influence (i.e., act) as opposed to residing as a discrete entity (i.e., acted upon) - prisoners were unable to make sense of the past or orient themselves toward the future, both of which are necessary to identify and develop opportunities and ultimately to persist with an entrepreneurship educational program. Rather than being an outcome of an entrepreneurship education program, recognizing a potential opportunity was a critical input to successful completion. We found that recognizing a potential opportunity is an important vehicle for transforming prisoners' attitudes toward entrepreneurship, imprisonment, and other individuals. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2014.",,

Since a landmark colloquium convened by Boland and Collopy in 2004, interest in ""design thinking"" has gained ground in both the academic and practitioner communities. This has led to some notable educational innovations, but overall progress remains desultory, and the danger arises that design thinking may be seen as another management fad. This essay reports an imaginary dialogue between Socrates and a novice manager (Archarios) that reaffirms the continuing relevance of the design perspective in management education and practice. Design science is well-established in the field of information systems (IS), and it is argued that IS research provides a valuable repository of design theory and techniques.

Research findings offer insight toward a comprehensive approach to student ethics reform.

The results indicate that perceived social identity, expected rewards, and expected associations directly affect knowledge-withholding intention, and that extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience indirectly influence knowledge-withholding intention through the mediation of perceived social identity. In addition, expected associations enhance the negative effect of perceived social identity on knowledgewithholding intention. The findings provide several important theoretical and practical implications regarding students' knowledge-withholding behaviors in the context of management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2014.",,

Specifically, we hypothesize that intern ingratiation leads to higher internship performance ratings from supervisors when coupled with high levels of political skill and to lower ratings from supervisors when coupled with low levels of political skill. We further hypothesize that these relationships are mediated by supervisor liking of the interns. We gathered three rounds of survey data from college students undertaking retail internships and their supervisors. The results demonstrate overall support for the proposed mediated moderation model, but also indicate patterns likely unique to the internship context. Implications for theory and research, strengths and limitations, directions for future research, and practical implications are provided. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2014.",,

More recently, the use of cases in business schools has extended beyond the classroom setting. Students around the world invest considerable time and energy to prepare for and compete in case competitions. We argue that an annual case competition should be established that embodies an evidence-based management (EBMgt) perspective. We extend previous suggestions about adapting case-based teaching to better support EBMgt (e.g., Goodman & O'Brien, 2012; Rousseau & McCarthy, 2007), recognizing that such a shift requires a fundamental change to how many business educators use cases (Mesney, 2013). We believe an EBMgt-focused case competition can promote greater awareness and use of the EBMgt concept, benefiting students and other stakeholders.

An academic text - the write-up of academic research whether in book or journal article form - is at center stage in evidence-based management (EBMgt) and in virtually all forms of evidence-based practice; yet, we know little about how academic work is read. Starting from the assumption that all scholarship is inherently rhetorical, I argue for the usefulness of rhetorical criticism - particularly reader response theory - to opening conversations between academics and practitioners - including our students who will be practitioners - on the use and limits of academic research. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We review why the management discipline may not have trustworthy evidence and how this widens the divide among educators, practitioners, and researchers. Next, we review the implications of untrustworthy cumulative knowledge, focusing on how educators can critically assess evidence and teach this process in the classroom. We close with recommendations for improving the trustworthiness of our literature to enhance teaching and practice from an evidence-based perspective.

We review relevant literatures from information sciences and medical education to examine the lessons learned and explore how they can inform the design and practice of evidence-based management education. We focus our review specifically on bibliographic search training because searching academic literatures to locate the best available research evidence is central to the practice of evidence-based management. Research shows that searchers often have great difficulty developing effective search strategies and retrieving relevant information from electronic databases. Despite wide variation in research designs and training programs, studies examining the effectiveness of bibliographic search training show that training typically enhances search quality. Although the extant research is informative, on its own it provides insufficient guidance for the design of bibliographic search training. Therefore, we use a combination of our findings from the literature reviewed and Goodman and O'Brien's (2012) evidence-based instructional strategies to develop a set of recommendations for designing bibliographic search training for evidence-based management education. We also provide suggestions for future research intended to yield more precise instructional design recommendations. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

The concept of action principle is central to this intervention, and we describe this concept with the help of action regulation theory. We conducted a randomized controlled field intervention with a theory-based 3-day program to increase personal initiative (using a pretest-posttest design and a randomized waiting control group). The sample consists of 100 small business owners in Africa (Kampala, Uganda). The intervention increased personal initiative behavior and entrepreneurial success over a 12-month period after the intervention. An increase in personal initiative behavior was responsible for the increase of entrepreneurial success (full mediation). Thus, the training led to an entrepreneurial mind-set and to an active approach toward entrepreneurial tasks. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
From passively received wisdom to actively constructed knowledge: Teaching systematic review skills as a foundation of evidence-based management,2014,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907438688&doi=10.5465%2famle.2013.0222&partnerID=40&md5=ba9cc7421c96ffc6f9029a9fb4911162,"One of the four sources of evidence used in evidence-based management (EBMgt) is academic research. However, rather than taking evidence from single studies or arbitrarily selected studies, EBMgt uses findings from systematic reviews that methodically summarize the body of evidence relevant to a specific question. This allows for conclusions to be drawn about the quantity, quality, relevance, and meaning of the available evidence. Although conducting such reviews is important for EBMgt and academically, the skills required are rarely taught. Drawing on our experiences of teaching courses on conducting rapid systematic reviews to a range of students, we include four goals here. First, we describe the nature and purposes of systematic reviews and consider the multiple benefits of teaching students how to perform them. Second, we describe a course on rapid systematic reviews delivered to a group of master's students. Third, we report students' reactions to different aspects of the course and the outcomes for students and teachers. Last, we discuss the implications of these experiences for teaching systematic review skills across business school curricula and how they may in the future play a more prominent role in developing EBMgt skills in students and in management education more generally. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Yet, research that corroborates the assumed learning outcomes, particularly with respect to advancing multicultural competence, is inconclusive. Null-to-small effect sizes are often reported and are based on unidimensional assessments of multicultural competence that have limited our knowledge of the benefits of academic work abroad. Building on Earley and Ang's (2003) conceptualization of cultural intelligence (CQ), we test the effect of studying abroad on the metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions of multicultural competence. Following a pretest-posttest design, we tracked 84 business students who completed academic coursework abroad. To isolate the effect of the sojourn, we controlled for individual and contextual variables that might influence learning outcomes. Results confirm the multidimensional nature of our dependent variable and indicate that studying abroad acts differently on its dimensions. While participants exhibited development of the cognitive-based components of the competence, studying abroad was innocuous in advancing participants' motivational and behavioral cultural intelligence. We discuss the theoretical implications of these outcomes in light of existing conceptualizations of multicultural competence, as well as their practical implications for academic efforts that seek to advance global competencies in management education. © 2014 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

A thematic analysis of student reflections (N = 96) based on their experience of material presented in their Business Ethics/Corporate Social Responsibility modules, interpreted through the framework of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, revealed that while negative role models led to intentions to avoid unethical behavior and engage in ethical practices such as ethical purchasing, they also increased cynicism and undermined students' self-efficacy in the ethical business domain. Exposure to positive role models offset the negative consequences arising from negative role models, protecting against reduced selfefficacy by showing that unethical behavior is neither necessary nor inevitable in business, thus undermining the common justification for unethical behavior that ""everybody does it."" PRMs increased awareness that business can be both ethical and profitable and provided inspirational role models that led to increased intentions to engage in ethical business practices. With reference to social-psychological literature, these results suggest that positive role models are necessary to counter the impression created by negative role models that ethical business is unachievable or unlikely, as such beliefs can become self-fulfilling. © 2014 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

As collaboration is the foundation of business operations, executives consistently rank interpersonal skills as a critical competency for a successful workforce. Yet, relying on training and development efforts after hiring is not enough-especially when funding for ""soft skills"" training is being cut across work domains. Because organizations need to select interpersonally competent individuals who can successfully engage in interactions immediately upon hire, students must acquire effective interpersonal skills before entering the workforce. To help achieve this goal, we utilize a taxonomy of interpersonal skills derived from a comprehensive review of the literature to recommend educational techniques that instructors can use to add interpersonal skills training in their teaching. The overarching goal of our work here is to use the science of training as a steppingstone to facilitate instructors' integration of interpersonal skills into existing MBA courses. © 2014 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Briefly reviewing the (somewhat limited) literature on judgment in management studies, we conclude that its mainly rationalist orientation prevents us (scholars and practitioners alike) from properly grasping important features of the hermeneutical- developmental process involved in coming to a judgment. In particular, the role of emotions, moral agency, language use, and, especially, the selective and integrative nature of perceptual processes, are far too easily ignored. We make the case for a particular notion of judgment understood as Aristotelian ""phronesis"" (practical wisdom). Phronetic leaders, we argue, are people who, in their search for a way out of their difficulties, have developed a refined capacity to intuitively grasp salient features of ambiguous situations and to constitute a ""landscape"" of possible paths of response, while driven by the pursuit of the notion of the common good. We seek to shed light on how this is accomplished, by drawing on neo-Aristotelian, phenomenological, and Wittgensteinian philosophy. © 2014 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Following this method, students learn an evidence-based problem-solving cycle for addressing business cases. In executing this cycle, students use and produce scientific evidence through literature searches and the design of local, experimental tests of causal hypotheses. We argue the value of teaching EBMgt with a focus on producing local evidence, how it can be taught, and what can be taught.

Using this integration, we then explore simulation-based training as a means to teach and assess crisis management team capabilities.

Drawing from theories on social loafing, social compensation, and trait activation, I propose that both the level of conscientiousness and agreeableness in teams could compensate for social loafing tendencies, in terms of team performance. In a study among newly formed student teams (N = 209 teams; n = 644 persons) working on a complex task that exceeded their current skill level, I found support for this idea. Consistent with predictions, social loafing tendencies were positively related to team performance when the level of conscientiousness was high rather than low. A significant 3-way interaction between social loafing tendencies, conscientiousness, and agreeableness in predicting team performance indicated that especially if there is a high degree of conscientiousness and agreeableness within the team, team members will compensate for social loafingtendencies, and performance will stay up to par. If there is little tendency to social loaf, the level of conscientiousness becomes less important, while agreeableness stays important for team performance. Given the extensive use of team projects in business schools, the implications of these findings are discussed. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Furthermore, we ask: ""Why did business school leaders decide to enter the overcrowded Dubai market in particular, precipitating its boom-and-bust cycle? Our novel integration of institutional logics and bubble literatures produces a detailed theoretical understanding of why business school bubbles have emerged in the past and may emerge again in the future.

While research has identified several individual- and organizational-level factors that promote participation, to date, the role of human resource management (HRM) in facilitating informal learning activities is not well understood. We investigate the effects of perceptions of performance appraisal quality and HRM system strength on three informal learning activities: reflection on daily activities, knowledge sharing with colleagues, and innovative behavior. Using a sample of 238 employees from 54 work teams, we examine over a year changes in levels of participation in the informal learning activities. Performance appraisal quality was found to be positively associated with increased participation in each activity over time, and HRM system strength positively moderated these relationships.

A study of 508 MBA interns working in over 245 organizations showed learning mediated the relationship of intern learning goal orientations to performance, while intern performance goals only had direct effects on performance. As situational inducements, supervisor concern for learning and performance explained unique variance in performance beyond interns' own goal orientations. Support was found for a supplementary fit perspective between interns with prove-performance goals and supervisor concern for performance. Interns also performed better when they viewed their supervisors as advocating a balance of concerns for both learning and performance during the internship.

Our sample included 31 of the 32 journal editors from the mid-1950s to the mid-2000s of Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Management, and Personnel Psychology who have not retired or passed away studied by Aguinis, de Bruin, Cunningham, Hall, Culpepper, and Gottfredson (2010). Results based on robust regression analysis indicate that post editorship productivity does not involve a simplistic dichotomy and mutually exclusive choice between research performance versus other types of contributions. Results show that past editors can do well - be productive researchers - and also do good - make meaningful nonresearch contributions to their universities as well as their professions in general.

The total sample of 1221 graduate management students, assigned to 312 virtual multicultural teams, consisted of four cohorts, each participating in one 4-week project; one project was conducted every year between 2008 and 2011. All projects were designed in the same way, according to principles of collaborative experiential learning, and offered a psychologically safe learning environment that enabled trust building. Data on cultural intelligence, global identity, and local identity were collected by way of web-based questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the project, as well as 6 months later. Team trust was assessed in the middle of the project. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that cultural intelligence and global identity, but not local identity, significantly increased over time and that this effect lasted for 6 months after the project had ended. Trust as a team level factor moderated the project's effect on team members'cultural intelligence and global identity, with significant effects under moderate to high rather than low levels of trust. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.",,

However, little is known about factors and processes supporting its development. In a longitudinal study involving pre-and postintervention measures of CQ, we explored the role of the individual perception of optimal cross-cultural contact and the experience of expectancy disconfirmation. The study was conducted among 212 management students and professionals who partook in an experiential CQ education intervention encompassing cross-cultural contact as part of a university management course. The results of our work reveal that the relationship between participants'perception of optimal cross-cultural contact and CQ development is mediated by the experience of expectancy disconfirmation. When participants perceived optimal cross-cultural contact, which involved a number of conditions including equal status among participants, personalized contact, establishment of common goals, and support of the contact by authorities, they were more likely to experience expectancy disconfirmation. In turn, greater experience of expectancy disconfirmation was associated with greater CQ development. Researchers, educators, and managers who understand the factors and processes supporting CQ development are better equipped to prepare individuals for greater effectiveness in a variety of cultural contexts. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.",,

While we applaud this movement from the domestic to the global and from the classroom to the field in business education, we raise a fundamental question that is seldom asked when global service-learning projects are chosen: ''Are some cultural contexts better suited for effective cultural learning and the creation of a global mind-set?'' To respond to this question, we present an exploratory study of culturally inexperienced non-U.S. business students at a U.S. university engaging in a service-learning project for U.S. military veterans. In this project, the veterans with disabilities were choosing entrepreneurship and self-employment as a way to rebuild their lives. From the qualitative data collected, we observed increases in the cultural intelligence of non-U.S. students, particularly in their development of metacognitive/cognitive strategies and the enhancement of their affective/motivational resources for learning across cultures. We examined characteristics of the cultural setting of U.S. military veterans with disabilities, and proposed that four characteristics facilitated the crosscultural learning achieved by the non-U.S. students. These include a moderate level of cultural distance, a tight culture, low context, and high moral desirability. While we hesitate to generalize beyond this cultural context and beyond culturally inexperienced students, we argue for further discussion about, consideration of, and research on the idea that cultural contexts may differ in their ability to stimulate cultural learning and global mind-set development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.",,

Cultural intelligence (CQ) refers to individual's abilities and skills to effectively manage interactions in cross-cultural situations. It includes four dimensions: metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral. In two multinational longitudinal studies using matched samples and pre- postintervention measures, we assessed the effects of academic CCM courses on students' CQ. We found that after the courses, students' overall CQ was significantly higher than at Time 1. No effects on CQ were detected in the control group, where students worked in multicultural settings but did not take a CCM course. Cross-cultural management courses had stronger effects on metacognitive and cognitive CQ than on motivational and behavioral CQ. We found an interesting pattern regarding students' international experience: While international experience in Time 1 positively related to students' CQ, at Time 2, this relationship became nonsignificant (Study 1). These findings contribute to understanding the antecedents of cultural intelligence and how educational interventions affect it, with practical implications for designing and developing international management education and training programs.

Such approaches could be described as etic or culture-general. We argue for re-centering cross-cultural management teaching and learning around a stronger emic or culturespecific component, balancing the current etic emphasis. This we call the ''situated cultural learning approach'' (SiCuLA), which focuses on the active role that the learner plays in the specific cultural contexts of learning. First, we propose to look at emic-etic as a continuum, as others have argued, rather than an opposition. Second, we reconceptualize cross-cultural management learning as situated learning and, third, we put forward ethnography of communication (EoC) as a learning epistemology that bridges the gap between situated learning and the classroom and workplace as learning contexts. More important, we propose a novel ''situated curriculum'' based on practical ideas to train students as culture learners. Last, we discuss some implications for developing an ethnography of communication-based curriculum for future cross-cultural management education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.",,

However, we empirically examine the Financial Times Global MBA Rankings and find that significant shifts have occurred at the international level: U.S. schools have declined, to the advantage of European and Asian schools. This shift corresponds to an erosion of the difference in MBA's salaries between these regions. We examine macro factors that may have played a role in this process: aggregate economic demand, overall supply of MBA graduates, student migrations, and shifts in visa policies. We observe that, over time, European MBAs have experienced a sustained rise in graduate salaries despite low aggregate economic demand and a rising supply of graduates.

Recent research with executives has found that higher cultural metacognition is associated with affective closeness and creative collaboration in intercultural relationships (Chua, Morris, & Mor, & 2012). However, little is known about the social cognitive mechanisms that facilitate the performance of individuals who score high on cultural metacognition. We propose that one important question for cross-cultural research and training is identifying which metacognitive strategies enable successful intercultural collaborations. We suggest that one such strategy is ''cultural perspective taking''-considering how another's cultural background shapes their behavior in a given context. We hypothesized that cultural perspective taking facilitates intercultural coordination and cooperation, and that a manipulation that boosts cultural perspective taking would be especially beneficial for individuals who score low in dispositional cultural metacognition. We found support for the above hypotheses in five studies using both quasi-field and experimental approaches. We discuss the implications of these findings for literatures on expatriate managers, cross-cultural training, cultural intelligence, and intercultural negotiations. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.",,

This longitudinal study explored the development of confidence in one's ability to lead (i.e., leadership efficacy) over time in the context of 40 self-directed MBA teams (198 individuals) participating in a 4-day immersive business simulation. Using random coefficient growth modeling (Bliese & Ployhart, 2002; Ployhart, Holtz, & Bliese, 2002), two manifestations of leadership efficacy were examined: the individual-level variable and team-level dispersion. Findings at the individual level indicated that extraversion and cognitive ability were predictors of the initial level of leadership efficacy, and emotional stability, agreeableness, and openness to experience were predictors of the change in leadership efficacy over time. Midpoint feedback received by the team was also related to leadership efficacy. Findings at the team level indicated that dispersion increased over time within teams, but teams that began their lifespan with strong action and transition processes experienced less dispersion from the outset. Also, more positive midpoint feedback caused greater dispersion in the second half of the team's life. Implications for leadership development are discussed.

We tell of an international education model defined by the prioritization of profit and the belief that students are consumers whose entitlements are determined by the marketplace. The crisis this perspective induced led to the emergence of a more mature governance regime, but problematic aspects of the original model remain. We argue that to achieve stability, a governance network needs to be created, a network that is comprised of a range of stakeholders who have the capacity to countervail each other's power and by so doing curtail practices that place international students and academic values at risk. We suggest the Australian case is an important exemplar of the difficulties that can be generated if the commercialization of international education is inadequately governed and that this exemplar should be accorded due heed by students, faculty, university managers and regulators.

We delineate the ""baggage"" that students may carry into our classrooms, including disparaging virtue and vilifying people who need help. Ultimately, this socialization leaves some students morally broken and suspicious of those living ethical lives. We label this phenomenon the stigmatization of goodness, a process in which moral people are condemned because they are seen as threats to an organization's bottom line. We close with suggestions to confront this problem in our classrooms, including the need to teach students the ethics of care, which emphasizes the benefits of interconnection, caring, and shared interests. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Building on a model of character strengths and their link to virtues, values, and ethical decision making, we describe an approach to develop leadership character at the individual, group, and organizational levels. We contrast this approach to existing practices that have focused on teaching functional content over character and address how business educators can enable leadership character development through their own behaviors, relationships, and structures. Most important, we provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate a focus on character development into existing business programs, both in terms of individual courses as well as the overall curriculum. We highlight that the development of leadership character must extend beyond student engagement in a course since ""it takes a village"" to develop character. © 2013 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Indeed, AMLE has become a reliable source of insightful scholarship regarding management education in general. The journal has also become an important platform for more specific scholarship directed toward the master's in business administration (MBA) degree and degree programs. Given the centrality of MBA programs in business schools and the substantial literature that has emerged on the topic within AMLE, we review this body of work to identify the broad topics and problems that have most concerned AMLE scholars with respect to MBA programs. We also explicate areas yet to be explored and offer an agenda for the next 10 years of scholarship. We conclude that the continued impact of AMLE requires ensuing scholarship that not only criticizes and describes, but also crafts and prescribes. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Formulaic research involves extreme specialization, an incrementalist and ultra\ cautious attitude toward theoretical contributions, formulaic methodologies, and a standardized article presentation targeted at very narrow and sympathetic academic communities. Formulaic research is attributed to the isomorphism that characterizes a wide range of academic practices. In the hope of galvanizing the field into transformation, we make a number of suggestions for alternative ideals and standards aimed at encouraging more diverse and imaginative ways of practicing and communicating organizational research. This is referred to as polymorphic research. We offer a number of concrete proposals to guide the practices of authors, reviewers, and editors. Polymorphic research, we argue, would reinvigorate the field of organizational studies and enhance its social relevance and impact. © 2013 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

In line with these changes, approaches to management education should also be adapted if they are to remain effective. As such, our purpose here is to reexamine a commonly used educational approach-demonstration-based training-and to explore techniques for enhancing it. Specifically, we present a theoretical framework for understanding how and when various instructional features can be used to enhance demonstration-based training and review the literature pertaining to such instructional features, linking them to current practices in the management education literature, and providing guidelines for how they can best be implemented. © 2013 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Professional doctorates were developed by some universities in the face of ising criticism about the relevance of PhD research to practice and the changing context and content of knowledge in the new economy.

Cross-disciplinary ethics education in MBA programs: Rhetoric or reality?,2013,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879477149&doi=10.5465%2famle.2011.0016A&partnerID=40&md5=6b7fa0d650ff016d85d48c1fd3f700ba,"This research-based essay offers a cross-disciplinary examination of ethics education in MBA programs. Based on data underlying the Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey we find: (1) that business schools doubled the number of ethics-related courses in different disciplines between 2005 and 2009; (2) that about 75% of all offered courses are electives; and (3) that integration of ethics varies considerably between disciplines with management-related courses exposing students more often to ethical questions. Further, we find that (2) and (3) hardly change over time. We argue that these results point toward a problem: Business schools increasingly risk creating a gap between their upbeat rhetoric around ethics education and their actual MBA curriculum. Such decoupling is likely to emerge because schools face a tension between increasing institutional pressures to legitimize their MBA programs and internal impediments to fully integrate ethics into the curriculum. We suggest that more effective ethics education requires structural changes to the curriculum, in particular more mandatory ethics courses and a stronger integration of ethics-related debates into disciplines such as finance and accounting. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We identify cognitive absorption as the construct that better describes the state of full engagement and immersion that new approaches in management training require of learners. While some research has emphasized the positive effect of absorption, we focus on the drawbacks of this individual state and on how group-level behaviors can mitigate negative effects on individual learning. We test our cross-level model on 190 individuals embedded in 38 groups. Our results show that (1) cognitive absorption presents an inverted U-shape effect in predicting participant learning; and (2) group learning behavior has a cross-level moderating influence on the relationship between cognitive absorption and participant learning, thus mitigating the negative effects of absorption. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

To date, no peer-reviewed, theoretically rigorous model of such behavior exists. Our work here presents a game theoretical model of team cheating based on rational choice, in which students choose a path with benefits or payouts typical of most university settings, given their assessment of the probability that other team members will cheat. Additionally, we show how incentives to cheat can be altered to make cheating a more or less rationally attractive choice depending on factors such as the psychological safety felt by team members, individual expectations that other team members will cheat, possible fear of group exclusion, the relationship between leader dominance and group member agreeableness, and students' expectations that harsh penalties will be applied. We then propose a general, utility-based model for considering ""subjectively"" rational choices in which students may choose not to collude in cheating despite economic payouts which would encourage such behavior. We conclude with implications for academia, applications to the workplace, and directions for future research. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

To understand how this quality can be developed from international experience, our study employs experiential learning theory to analyze the learning process. We hypothesize that the extent to which the length of overseas work experience contributes to the development of cultural intelligence varies depending on the executives' learning styles. Analyses of data collected from 294 international executives and graduate business students in China and Ireland indicated that the positive relationship between the length of overseas experience and cultural intelligence is strengthened when global executives have a divergent learning style, not when they have an assimilative, convergent, or accommodative learning style. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Both programs are underpinned by an emphasis on raising students' self-awareness and self-development. Using a variety of experiential and work-based creative pedagogical and logistical approaches, these programs emphasize core elements frequently overlooked in management education, including (1) reflective practices that develop awareness, the will to manage, and what some call ""heart and soul;"" (2) systems thinking, integration, and understanding of how to work effectively in today's globalized world; and (3) application of these attributes to understanding and implementing the broad responsibilities, purposes, and (ethical) values associated with businesses and other organizations.

We used a matched group quasi-experimental design, in which 182 students evaluated their learning group members in three different semesters, and a control group (three matched groups of 182 students each) evaluated their team members only once. Our results indicate that repeated use of a standardized peer-evaluation system provides an effective means of increasing students' confidence in evaluating their peers, as well as improving the quality of the evaluations they provide.

He suggests that social entrepreneurship is an important transitional vehicle toward the creation of shared value and a capitalist system in which meeting social needs is not just a peripheral activity but a core aspect of every business. Porter discusses the implications of this perspective on social entrepreneurship with a view to new opportunities but also responsibilities for educators in the field. I examine how this fits with but also extends current debates on social entrepreneurship.

In this manuscript, we use the community of inquiry (CoI) framework to examine the contribution of one on-line tool, a wiki, to a blended-learning course. Structural modeling techniques are used to analyze data collected from students in an undergraduate business capstone course. The results suggest that teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence (components of the community of inquiry framework) exist in a wiki environment in a manner similar to other on-line environments. Additionally, teaching presence and social presence are shown to influence cognitive presence (e.g., learning), which reaffirms that the role of the instructor continues to be paramount to student learning in technology-enhanced environments. Given that the CoI framework is a novel conceptualization recently introduced to the management education literature, we offer theoretical recommendations for researchers and practical recommendations for instructors interested in incorporating wiki technology in a blended-learning pedagogy. We believe our findings provide fresh insights on, and new possibilities for, instructional development in business education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

It would seem reasonable that attempts to transform students into leaders would rely on what the field of leadership education knows from research and practice about leader development. However, we point out the irony that university faculty, those who are usually on the cutting edge of leadership scholarship and who are also in an excellent position to apply the findings from this research, seem not to be doing this. It appears that, as they say, the ""cobbler's children have no shoes."" After disentangling some of the possible reasons for this, we observe that as university educators, we might want to remedy this curious state of affairs by turning to empirically valid models of how to transform organizations so that we really are capable of transforming our students into leaders. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Their study provides a springboard for reconciling the literature by differentiating organizational mindfulness from mindful organizing, establishing where organizational mindfulness and mindful organizing are most important, and clarifying how and when each construct can be most fruitfully deployed in research and practice. Clearer theorizing leads to a set of research questions that seek to integrate multiple conceptions of individual and organizational mindfulness, establish their individual and organizational antecedents, explore the consequences for individuals and organizations, and in so doing, further increase the relevance of organizational mindfulness for business schools. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We compare measures of task performance when participants observe a task before engaging in direct experience versus immediate direct experience without observation. Two experimental studies were conducted using different types of tasks and different levels of performance analysis. We found support for the hypothesis that experiential learning sequencing, with vicarious observation preceding direct experiential learning, enhances classroom performance. The benefits of vicarious observational learning to direct experience sequencing appeared to be generally robust across task types and levels of analysis. The article concludes with some explanations of the relative efficacy of observational learning to direct experiential learning sequencing as well as implications for management education literature and practice. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

The interview begins with a discussion of the development and evolution of social business and its distinction from social entrepreneurship. Then, we move on to the role of faculty and community engagement and student qualities that should be sought and cultivated in social business education. Next, Yunus formulates recommendations for what business schools and educators can do to prepare students to recognize and implement new social innovations for their communities.

Our model, in addition to teaching students ""about"" social entrepreneurship to allow them to acquire the knowledge and expertise required to successfully engage in social entrepreneurial activities, proposes to educate students ""for"" social entrepreneurship, by allowing them to acquire the skill of bridging three distinct and sometimes competing institutional logics: the social-welfare logic, the commercial logic, and the public-sector logic. To achieve this goal, we propose that social entrepreneurship education needs to make students aware of these different logics, to allow them to enact these competing logics and to enable them to combine logics when necessary to create innovative hybrid strategies. We explore how this overall strategy can be achieved by highlighting how various pedagogical tools can be adapted to contribute to each step. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

This is compared with the case study approach that is traditionally used within the classroom environment. Our study found that both approaches can be successful in raising awareness and improving the attitudes of participating students, increasing the probability that they will support socially oriented initiatives immediately or in the future. Interestingly, many students who participated in SBP teaching develop a local awareness of social and civic matters, while many of those who participated in case study learning develop a wider national and international perspective. In addition, it is found that many of those who participated in SBP development develop a deeper managerial and technical understanding of managing organizations within the social economy. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We assess internal as well as external factors that may influence whether AACSB-accredited business schools choose to require a business ethics course in their undergraduate core curricula. Using data from 382 universities, we find evidence of a relationship between the characteristics of a business school's leadership and the college's decision to require an ethics course. Specifically, colleges of business whose deans are female or have a background in management are more likely to require their undergraduates to take a business ethics course. In addition, we find that a school's affiliation has a direct influence on this decision. Private schools, as well as universities with religious affiliations, are more likely to require a business ethics course. Also of interest, we find a negative relationship between the resources schools possess and the presence of a required ethics course. These findings suggest that the values of a school and its leadership are the main factors influencing the role of business ethics in a school's curriculum. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

The results of the analyses of this relationship are controversial in that at least some members of some groups continue to hold different views. In their work, Pearce and Huang support the perspective that management research should inform managerial practice. However, they argue that the amount of ""actionable research"" (research that teachers can effectively use in their classrooms) that is being published in two prestigious journals ( Academy of Management Journal and Administrative Science Quarterly ) is declining. Pearce and Huang speculate as to why this is the case and propose solutions to deal with the issue.

Management education in particular may be subject to student disengagement due to learning activities that engender affective, identity-challenging responses. Using social identity theory, we model how some learning activities can trigger elements of students' identities, forcing a cognitive dissonance confrontation. We suggest that students undertake an identity-based risk-reward assessment when determining which learning opportunities to accept or reject. We argue that by increasing sensitivity to the process of disengagement, instructors can help draw students back into learning opportunities.

Drawing on the comparative research, I dispute the assumption that on-line delivery lacks the kind of interaction, collaboration, and learning outcomes that are necessary to support a quality business education. Recommendations are made to confront the bias by leveraging the research and removing some barriers that prevent wider acceptance and adoption of on-line teaching and learning. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2012.",,

Aguinis et al.'s (2010) apparently narrow focus on publications as scholarly productivity may reflect a reluctance by the academic community to acknowledge the critical importance of nonpublication scholarly contributions. If nonpublication contributions are necessary for the success of academia, that success is more likely when the nonpublication contributions that provide the foundation for publication excellence are measured, acknowledged, and rewarded. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Specifically, we offer a multilevel model of self-assessed team performance based on self-enhancement theory and on the construal level theory of psychological distance. We implemented a team decision-making task with 52 student teams, objectively measured team performance, and then asked team members and teams for assessments of team performance. Results show that relationship conflict moderates the relationship between (a) team objective performance and individual assessments of team performance (i.e., cross-level interaction effect); and (b) team objective performance and team assessments of team performance (i.e., team-level interaction effect). The moderating effect is isomorphic across levels of analysis: As relationship conflict increases, the relationship between subjective and objective performance also increases. Our results have important implications for research on management education, assessments of team performance, relationship conflict, and methodological approaches adopted by management education researchers. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

The folly of using research lacking rigor as a call to action,2012,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863096712&doi=10.5465%2famle.2012.0085&partnerID=40&md5=906009e46d5cc5a5ee6d9c4e7c1d5e29,"Management researchers need to continually work to assure that our findings and conclusions are translated into management practice. Exploring the usefulness of contemporary research for the practice of management is therefore a worthy pursuit. However, the lack of rigor associated with the analyses reported in Pearce and Huang's article (2012, this issue) leaves scholars unable to draw meaningful and useful conclusions that can guide research practice. Specifically, the authors' conceptualization of actionable is defined ambiguously and in contradictory ways, and is therefore operationalized unscientifically. We illustrate specific concerns by first describing three illustrations that collectively demonstrate why the study fails to satisfy basic criteria for rigorous research. We then explicitly illustrate why the measure fails to assess what is seemingly intended to be captured by contrasting a study classified and described as actionable (Lee, Ashford, & Bobko, 1990) with our study (Stewart & Barrick, 2000) coded as not actionable. This illustration demonstrates the arbitrary and inconsistent classification underlying Pearce and Huang's analysis, and demonstrates how two studies coded into opposite categories both used rigorously designed studies to produce actionable results. We also provide a few general comments related to the overall topic of relevance in contemporary management research. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Much theory and supporting research has been generated on the effect of service-learning on college and university students. Through meta-analytic techniques, we found support for the hypotheses that service-learning has a positive effect on understanding of social issues (Est. δ = .34); personal insight (Est. δ = .28); and cognitive development (Est. δ = .52).

Assuming that individual academics play an important role in shaping the value-related influence of business schools, I model management academics' intentions to influence values. The suggested model encompasses academics' economic and social values as internal variables, as well as perceived support for attempting to influence values and academic tenure as social and structural variables. A test with empirical data from 1,254 management academics worldwide reveals that perceived external support is most relevant for explaining intentions. Moreover, academics' social values, but not their economic ones, contribute to an explanation of their intentions to influence values. The results reveal how important it is for academics to believe that their colleagues, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders support their value-related behavioral intentions. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

In this paper, I quantify the cost of production of not-actionable articles, explain why I think that their production has flourished, discuss the difficulty of individual scholars speaking to both business and academic audiences, and provide a thought on how to stimulate production of actionable business research output. I estimate that the cost of producing not-actionable ""A-journal"" articles is on the order of US$600 million per year. It is not surprising to me that not-actionable article production has increased in that the ""customers"" for these articles are primarily other academics and not business people. I demonstrate that for this reason, it proves very difficult for a given scholar to simultaneously speak authoritatively to both fellow academics and business people. Finally, I suggest that to stimulate production of actionable business research output, the Academy needs to harness the power of case-based research methods to identify important actionable business issues and the meticulousness of scientific methodologies to generate rigorous actionable prescriptions for business people. © 2012 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

One factor that has received limited attention in the literature is that of differences in the way men and women network and that the way women network might not only disadvantage their own professional career progression but also put other women at a disadvantage as well. This study explores this phenomenon and specifically looks at how social network size varies with level of trust between parties. Our results suggest women tend to trust each other less in a risky professional environment compared to men. Though women were found to have the same scale social networks, they exhibit a greater reduction in aggregate network size at higher trust levels. We find that women socialize with each other, but when it comes to a matter of risk taking, women exclude each other and prefer to network with men.

The dominance of economic-related courses in MBA curricula led us to assess the effects of economics education on greed in three studies using multiple methods. Study 1 found that economics majors and students who had taken multiple economics courses kept more money in a money allocation task (the Dictator Game). Study 2 found that economics education was associated with more positive attitudes toward greed and toward one's own greedy behavior. Study 3 found that a short statement on the societal benefits of self-interest led to more positive ratings of greed's moral acceptability, even for noneconomics students. These effects suggest that economics education may have serious, albeit unintended consequences on our students' attitudes toward greed. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,

The personalization process, we posit, allows management education to provide the foundations for leaders' development by transforming potentially regressive experiences into material for participants' personal learning, experimentation, and growth. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,

Based on this insight, we revisit traditional approaches to standard leadership topics, such as negotiations and leading change, as well as currently popular developmental tools, such as 360-degree feedback and networking; reinterpret them through the lens of women's experiences in organizations; and revise them to meet the particular challenges women face when transitioning into senior leadership. By framing leadership development as identity work, we reveal the gender dynamics involved in becoming a leader, offer a theoretical rationale for teaching leadership in women-only groups, and suggest design and delivery principles to increase the likelihood that women's leadership programs will help women advance into more senior leadership roles. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,

I explore the role of play in leadership development processes. Drawing on theories of leader and leadership development and theories of play, I develop a conceptual framework, suggesting that play can contribute to different components of leader and leadership development processes (i.e., leadership identity, cognitive abilities, and behavioral skills). Furthermore, the role of creating safe play spaces in leadership development processes is highlighted. The discussion examines the implications and applications of play for leadership development processes, points to the dangers of misuse of play, and outlines directions for further empirical research. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,

In a longitudinal field experiment, we examined how a targeted mentorship program that unfolded over 6 months enhanced the development of protégés' leader efficacy and performance. Results showed that the targeted mentorship intervention increased protégés' level of leader efficacy more than a comparison intervention that was based on a more eclectic leadership education program delivered in a group setting. Leader efficacy then predicted rated leader performance. Both protégés' preferences for feedback and trust in the mentor served as important moderators in contributing to the development of leader efficacy. Findings from this longitudinal field experiment could be used by educational institutions and other organizations to enhance their mentorship programs in content, focus, and evaluation of impact. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,
Becoming a leader: Early career challenges faced by MBA graduates,2011,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80054080695&doi=10.5465%2famle.2011.0002&partnerID=40&md5=e1351bc63aba84c2ff1addac309171e9,"Leadership development is often cited as an important organizational priority. Despite the criticisms of MBA education, MBA graduates represent one important source of future leaders. Although we have amassed significant knowledge about the roles and functions of senior leaders, we know far less about the challenges faced by younger ones. Indeed, Linda Hill's seminal work on new managers is predicated on the study of only 19 recently promoted sales managers from two companies (Hill, 1992). Our work here investigates the early career challenges of 55 young leaders who had graduated from an MBA program in the past decade. Based on in-depth interviews, we identified three types of transition that these young leaders described as particularly important to their development, and the four most common challenges they struggled with throughout these transitions. The process of working through these challenges led many of these young leaders to fundamentally change the way they thought about and practiced leadership, thereby facilitating their evolution from individual contributor to experienced leader. Drawing on these observations, we provide suggestions for how MBA programs can be modified to help students prepare for the experiences they will likely have to navigate early in their careers. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2011.",,

In Study 2, a within-subjects laboratory experiment, we videotaped 41 MBA participants giving a speech. We then taught them how to behave more charismatically, and they redelivered the speech 6 weeks later. Independent assessors ( n = 135) rated the speeches.

He is the author of 15 books, including Process Consultation Revisited, Organizational Culture and Leadership, Career Anchors, Organizational Psychology, Career Dynamics, and Helping, as well as numerous articles in academic and professional journals. Novelty, clarity, and relevance have always been the guiding principles of his work. In this interview, Schein moves on from his key formative learning experiences to focusing on humble inquiry as the key to building and maintaining the helping relationship. Comprised of both a helper's attitude and behavior, humble inquiry embodies ""accessing one's ignorance"" and becoming open to what the helper and the helped may learn from each other through observation, genuine empathic questioning, careful listening, and suspension of judgment. Schein not only identifies several challenges within management research, practice, and education, but also offers provocative recommendations to those involved.",,

I suggest that the nature of these courses and the complexity of the issues are best addressed using a service-learning pedagogical approach. Two faculty members and eight students spent 1 month studying and experiencing poverty, malnutrition, education with dire lack of resources, and other social dilemmas and explored how one brings sustainable change, owned by the indigenous community. This case example of a business elective about sustainable community development in a third world country serves to illustrate the framework for delivering such content. The unique characteristics of sustainable community development are integrated with the strengths of service learning into a framework that may be used by others who might develop similar courses. Drawing on both literatures, the framework provides a powerful opportunity to experience the context in which development happens while learning the content.",,

Despite this fact, recent research suggests that courses designed to inculcate human capital competencies are wholly underrepresented in MBA curricula. Scholars have attributed culpability in various directions, collectively suggesting a broad devaluing of management education from one or more stakeholders including recruiters, business school policy makers, faculty members, and students. We bring forth evidence that reveals considerable agreement across stakeholder groups regarding the importance of emphasizing human capital competencies in MBA curricula. That is, contrary to conventional notions, business school stakeholders largely agree with practicing managers that human capital competencies are among the most important to be trained within MBA programs. This evidence suggests an Abilene paradox (Harvey, 1974) wherein the status quo of curricular misalignment is maintained due to a mismanagement of agreement. As such, we argue management faculty must deploy an evidence-based campaign that productively surfaces this agreement and moves MBA programs toward enacting appropriate curricular change congruent with managerial realities.",,

We also find systematic differences in how boards allocate their attention, based on whether the business school has a research or teaching orientation. We further find that boards' effort and attention affect directors' preferences of the content and approach of entrepreneurship programs, gauging student learning, obstacles to board contributions, and the relative emphasis on the skills students are taught. Our article provides a foundation for a research agenda that considers the unique and influential role that advisory boards can play in enhancing student learning and education.",,

The results, based on a sample of 167 college student interns working in the retail industry, indicate that emotional sharing is positively related to both learning and mentoring, while emotional masking is negatively related to learning. In addition, intern social activity is positively related to mentoring. We also found that the levels of learning and mentoring received are significantly related to intern job satisfaction, affective commitment to the internship sponsor, and a positive attitude toward the industry they interned with as a potential future career.

To address this challenge, we draw on the work of Pierre Bourdieu to examine MBA education as an activity with its own ""economy of exchange"" and ""rules of the game."" We argue that application of Bourdieu's theoretical ideas elucidates three key issues in debate around MBA education: the outcomes of MBA programs, the inculcation of potentially problematic values and practices through the programs, and the potential of self-regulation, such as accreditation and ranking for impeding development of MBA education. First, Bourdieu's notions of capital-intellectual, social, and symbolic-shed light on the ""economy of exchange"" in MBA education. Critics of MBA programs have pointed out that the value of MBA degrees lies not only in ""learning."" Bourdieu's framework allows further analysis of this issue by distinguishing between intellectual (learning), social (social networks), and symbolic capital (credentials and prestige). Second, the concept of ""habitus"" suggests how values and practices are inculcated through MBA education. This process is often one students acquire voluntarily, and students often regard problematic or ethically questionable ideas as natural. Third, Bourdieu's reflections on the ""doxa"" and its reproduction and legitimation illuminate the role of accreditation and ranking in MBA education. This perspective helps to understand how self-regulation may impede change in MBA education.",,

In order to understand how Ulysses participants learn from their experiences while abroad, we interviewed 70 participants and content-analyzed the learning narratives that they produced. We found evidence of learning in six areas: responsible mind-set, ethical literacy, cultural intelligence, global mind-set, self-development, and community building. We also identified a number of processes through which learning occurred at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, including the process of resolving cultural and ethical paradoxes; constructing a new lifeworld, that is, developing a new perspective of self and the world; and making sense of the emotions experienced while on assignment. The results of a postprogram survey confirm the long-term effectiveness of Ulysses in developing and enhancing competencies that are critical for responsible global leadership.

Business schools have come under increasing attack for their espousal of a strong form neoliberal belief system rooted in the discipline of economics and a lack of attention to practical and, in particular, heterogeneous national institutional contexts. A key insight emerging from a growing chorus of retrospective analyses of the crisis is the need for research and pedagogy to draw upon the breadth of social sciences to inform decision making under uncertainty and more prominently features cross-national variation in institutional context as well as systemic linkages between the behavior of individuals, organizations, academics, regulators and policy makers. While business schools are theoretically ideally positioned to offer such innovation and have done so in the past, the institutional barriers to change are substantial. Drawing on paired historical narratives of institutional changes to business schools and economic policy making, I outline a political strategy that leverages neoliberalism's legitimacy crisis to forge alliances with government and civil society actors who share an interest in fulfilling the promise of progressive management. © 2011 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Organizational mindfulness, however, is a theoretical construct that has yet to be empirically validated. We examine organizational mindfulness in U.S. business schools and provide evidence of the five dimensions of organizational mindfulness articulated by Weick and Sutcliffe (2001).

Inspiring interest, an important antecedent of learning, can be an uphill battle due to the ubiquitous presence of grades. Grades are meant to encourage interest, yet they often do just the opposite. The result is a grading paradox. We hypothesize that leveraging choice in the classroom can manage this grading paradox by increasing interest. In a field experiment in real-world MBA classrooms (N = 91 students), we found that a choice intervention, the opportunity for students to allocate the weight of several course components toward their final course grade, was associated with higher levels of two types of interest, triggered situational interest and maintained situational interest. This study corroborates and extends previous laboratory-based research documenting the positive relationship between choice and interest, and offers a practical tool that management educators can use to encourage student interest.",,

Teaching evidence-based management in MBA programs: What evidence is there?,2011,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959579612&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2011.62798931&partnerID=40&md5=43aaf4cf773a9befb92838ff4e09155b,"We examine the degree to which required management courses in U.S.-based MBA programs make reference to the emerging evidence-based management (EBM) movement. More than 800 required management course syllabi from 333 programs were reviewed for either explicit reference to the concept of EBM, or verbiage within course descriptions that was consistent with teaching evidence-based management principles. In addition, instructor, course, and institution-level characteristics were examined as potential correlates of references to EBM. Using a liberal operationalization of EBM (i.e., keywords or phrases that are consistent with evidence-based management principles), results suggest that approximately 25% of core MBA management courses utilize EBM in some form. However, there are substantial differences across categories of course content and depending on whether the instructor has a PhD. Evidence-based management-consistent syllabi are most prevalent at the MBA level in organizational behavior and least in international management and entrepreneurship. Suggestions for future research, as well as an exemplary course description from an EBM syllabus, are offered. © 2011 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Reporting on the first study comparing the characteristics of male and female business school deans, we demonstrate that women often bring different experiences and backgrounds to these positions than do their male counterparts. Further, we assess key trends that may trigger a ""perfect storm"" and significantly change the gender mix of business deans, generating benefits that extend well beyond the campus. Recommendations for structural change in business schools to expedite this outcome are provided. © 2011 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Stakeholders in this alliance include the university partners, the two faculties delivering the program, and the Chinese government and industry that share concerns about the practical skills of business graduates entering diverse industry sectors that are experiencing unprecedented growth and related skill shortages. Student stakeholders have increased freedom to choose and plan careers while competing for roles that demand practical skills and adaptive mind-sets. As stakeholders, Chinese parents are also exerting differing levels of influence over career choices of graduates.In this environment the definition, refinement, and alignment of the value proposition for respective stakeholders is central to the transnational higher education partnership model. We identify certain benefits and challenges of collaborative partnership, explain why and how value creation for stakeholders might feature as a central tenet of our respective and shared business models, and describe academic challenges in creating appropriate value for stakeholders. Our conclusions have implications for ongoing review of quality assurance frameworks and for research around relationship and culture building, to generate value creating and sustainable models of transnational higher education. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2010.",,

However, the sociology of scientific knowledge suggests that textbooks are not simply collected accounts of discrete ""findings,"" but rather represent a highly stable and institutionalized pedagogy. The question then becomes, to what extent are new areas of research that have gained traction in the academic literature moved into textbooks, particularly when that research would introduce a new paradigm to a coherent pedagogical story? To explore this question, we examine textbooks to uncover the extent and manner of integration of recent research using institutional theory to study topics in strategic management. Finding significant variation in integration among textbooks, we discuss factors that can explain this variation and suggest avenues for systematic, theory-driven research on the textbook. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2010.",,

We investigate this counterargument on a sample of 658 business schools over an 8-year period. We find that research adds significant value in that it can potentially enhance student salaries by up to $24,000 per year. However, we also observe that ""excessive"" research activity can lead to diminishing or even negative returns for students, and a research focus solely on elite journals might rob students of the benefits of exposure to a broader array of new ideas. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2010.",,

In addition, it draws from and extends previous empirical and conceptual research, and addresses the needs and weaknesses stated in earlier literature. The matrix provides a framework for discussion, as well as a framework for action-since it provides faculty, staff, and administrators with options for integrating sustainability and includes advantages, disadvantages, and recommendations for using each option. The matrix is useful for relative newcomers to sustainability, and can also help those who are analyzing past successes and failures, as well as those planning future efforts.

Extant literature provides conflicting arguments; therefore, we empirically tested the relationship using a sample of 416 S&P 500 CEOs and found a significant positive association between CEOs with MBAs and CEP, even after accounting for several firm- and individual-level characteristics.

Sustainability-related subjects (e.g., reducing energy consumption, conserving water supplies, improving air quality, preserving endangered species and ecosystems) have been added to the curricula of undergraduate and graduate programs and to strategic management textbooks. The current reforms will not, however, create deep or lasting change if the root metaphors underlying strategic management education remain unchanged. Metaphors are integral to the way we act, interact, and think about the world. They are also central to the discussion of sustainability in strategic management, as with any complex and fluid phenomenon. While various metaphors have waxed and waned in popularity over the years, the war metaphor still guides strategic management theory, research, and education. In light of the challenges of sustainability, a reappraisal of the war metaphor is overdue. We need to consider its role and impact in our approach to sustainable strategic management education. My purpose in this exercise is twofold: (1) to arrive at an enriched understanding and deeper appreciation of the war metaphor in strategic management education, and (2) to provide some insights into how new metaphors can be created, assessed, and promoted to establish sustainability as a framework for strategic management education.

European schools favored an elective-oriented approach and placed more emphasis on the graduate level; whereas American business schools placed more sustainability-related courses at the undergraduate level, mandating them as compulsory. Additional differences were found between global regions including Asia and Oceania, and between national developmental stage and university ranking with regard to the overall level of sustainability-related curriculum offered, specific sustainability content, and teaching methods. Differences were noted as well in the distribution across undergraduate and graduate levels and in compulsory and elective offerings. Our findings suggest diverse differences in sustainability-related curriculum design from business schools of different backgrounds. If curriculum design is a reflection of local circumstances, we are cautious about an accreditation-led imposition of standards on business schools, since it is only at the local level where the best ideas regarding sustainability education tailored to surrounding situations can originate.

Our study examines how MBA students talk about gender. We identify two main discursive repertoires that students use to make sense of gender. The first centers on accepting the status quo as ""the way the world is,"" and the second insists that gender does not matter. We argue that a postfeminist climate is operating in management education, so that gender is no longer seen as salient, even while it continues to shape the culture in significant ways. In this context, the gender culture in business schools can only be changed by adopting more subtle strategies for challenging the masculine norms that persist in spite of gender's ""disappearance."". © 2010 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
In the spirit of scholarship,2010,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954114716&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2010.51428549&partnerID=40&md5=fb8600de96bb368301b399236776844d,"Management scholarship has recently received an increasing amount of criticisms, centered on its alleged lack of relevance and alleged dysfunction associated with publication-based scholarly competition. In defense of the spirit of management scholarship, we make two arguments. First, the criticism that management scholarship is flawed because it is irrelevant may be irrelevant itself. It reflects a lack of awareness of the nature of scholarship. Instead of losing self-confidence, management scholars should be very proud of our scholarship, which has enabled modern business schools to abandon the highly ""relevant"" but academically bankrupt ""trade school"" model of the 1950s. Second, we suggest that our scholarly competition resembles the Olympic Games, which captivate the entire human race. Clearly, the ability to win Olympic medals (such as outrunning, outskating, and outshooting competitors) is not that relevant in the modern world. But it is the focus, the discipline, and the dedication that represent every bit of the human spirit in search of excellence-so is the spirit of scholarship that we vigorously advance and support here.

We found (1) doctoral origin prestige had a direct effect on the prestige of a graduate's initial academic appointment, (2) doctoral origin prestige interacted with perceived quality of publications such that, early in their careers, graduates of more prestigious doctoral programs obtained greater job placement benefits (in terms of more prestigious initial academic appointments) from the perceived quality of their publications than did graduates of less prestigious doctoral programs, (3) later in their careers, individuals who secured more prestigious initial academic appointments held more prestigious academic appointments than individuals with less prestigious initial academic appointments, and (4) at a later career stage, initial appointment prestige interacted with perceived quality of publications, such that individuals with more prestigious initial academic appointments obtained greater job placement benefits from the perceived quality of their publications than did individuals with less prestigious initial academic appointments. Our results suggest that recruitment patterns in the management discipline reflect an inherent academic stratification system and that doctoral origin prestige is an important determinant of early and later career opportunities. © 2010 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Self-assessment's strongest correlations were with motivation and satisfaction, two affective evaluation outcomes. The relationship between self-assessment and cognitive learning was moderate. Even under conditions that optimized the self-assessment-cognitive learning relationship (e.g., when learners practiced self-assessing and received feedback on their self-assessments), the relationship was still weaker than the self-assessment-motivation relationship. We also examined how researchers interpreted self-assessed knowledge, and discovered that nearly a third of evaluation studies interpreted self-assessed knowledge data as evidence of cognitive learning. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for evaluation practice that involve a more limited role for self-assessment. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

We combine the findings from these studies with insights from the personnel and knowledge transfer literatures to identify the different roles of three actors-students, university, and business-and to propose a multistage model of determinants of effectiveness. Exploratory analysis of a portion of the model on Portuguese internships data reveals the importance of considering the respective roles of the multiple actors and of the internship process in explaining student satisfaction, but not project implementation. Using our conceptual model and these initial empirical findings, we offer recommendations for actions each actor can take to enhance internship effectiveness and lead to suggestions for researchers interested in identifying determinants of internship effectiveness. © 2010 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

This increase in narcissism has implications for both student classroom behavior and the manner in which we, as faculty, effectively teach and manage our classrooms. We explore the personality trait of narcissism, its potential manifestations in the classroom, and offer suggestions for management educators in dealing with more narcissistic students. © 2010 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

A questionnaire-based scenario study conducted on 530 management conference presenters supported the hypothesis that the decision to share a conference paper is both a calculative and normative choice. Analysis demonstrated that academicians calculate the benefits and costs of sharing within the context of dyadic exchanges, but they also follow the social norms of sharing, thereby recognizing the context of generalized exchange. In particular, academicians have more intent to share when they perceive the more general benefits of sharing and the stronger social norms of the academic community that encourage sharing. They have less intent to share when the paper type is conceptual. A subsequent examination of actual sharing behavior for two of the four initial experimental conditions generally supported our findings. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

First-year MBA students were randomly assigned to intervention and control sections of the same course. Unfavorable information about the treatment-group professor created a negative reputation that persisted in the midst of very disconfirming actual positive performance. The naturally occurring intervention biased individuals' decision-making process and resulted in inaccurate ratings of professor performance and negative halo error judgments of course materials, grading, and the amount learned. Additional data for the treatment-group professor but without a reputation corroborated these findings. Evidence also indicated that trait emotional intelligence and assertiveness mitigated the biasing effect of the reputation. Implications regarding the use of student evaluations of teaching are shared, and suggestions are offered to help mitigate and manage reputation biases.

Some components of individualism-collectivism and power distance were related to choice of feedback channel. The number of on-line forums in which a student participated was positively related to learning performance as measured by multiple choice tests. In contrast, average number of postings per forum was negatively related to learning performance. Contrary to expectations, no direct relationship was found between the use of any of three face-to-face feedback-seeking channels and learning performance.

We propose that institutions offering reliable social defenses, sentient communities, and vital rites of passage are likely to be experienced as identity workspaces. The fluidity of contemporary corporate environments and the movement toward individually driven careers has generated an increased need for identity work, while concurrently rendering corporations less reliable as spaces in which to conduct it. As a result, we posit that business schools are increasingly invested with the function of identity workspaces. The conceptual framework presented here provides a lens to better understand how and why business schools are called upon to fulfill a function of growing importance-developing management education that goes beyond influencing what managers know and do, and supports them in understanding and shaping who they are. © 2010 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We also find evidence that student reactions to positive goal-discrepant feedback can be stronger than their reactions to negative goal-discrepant feedback, and that student reactions to in-major feedback are qualitatively different than reactions to non-major feedback.

Central to these criticisms is the contention that the MBA is wholly out-of-touch with the ""real world"" and is irrelevant to the needs of practicing managers. Examining this contention, we investigated the relevancy of MBA curricula in relation to managerial competency requirements. Relying on an empirically derived competency model from 8,633 incumbent managers across 52 managerial occupations, our results showed that behavioral competencies indicated by managers to be most critical are the very competencies least represented in required MBA curricula. Findings further indicate that institutional factors such as media rankings and mission orientation have no effect on the alignment of MBA curricula with critical managerial competencies. © Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2009.",,

Our results indicate that characteristics of the job (specifically, task significance and feedback) and characteristics of the work environment (in particular, learning opportunities, supervisor support, and organizational satisfaction) were the best predictors of internship satisfaction.

Three factors explain the under-representation of women in editorial boards: the field of study, the journal's prestige, and the editor's gender.

He retired as CEO at the end of 2008, but has remained with the firm as chairman of the board of directors. Allison attributes BB&T's success to operating by a set of principles that are embodied in the firm's statement of 10 key values. The BB&T Value Statement is a genuine source of guidance for decisions throughout the firm. For example, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a municipality's right to seize property by eminent domain for the purpose of economic development, BB&T issued a statement that it would not provide loans for any projects in which the land for the project had been taken in this manner. When making negative amortization loans became popular, BB&T also refused to participate.In this interview Allison addresses philosophy, ethics, values, and how BB&T harnesses them to guide its business decisions. Characterized as a defender of capitalism and a ""philosopher king,"" Allison often quotes the likes of Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, and Ayn Rand.

Educating new management specialists from an evidence- based perspective: A proposal,2009,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650838704&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2009.41788848&partnerID=40&md5=8b5662b45a0b5c198068946e74bfc4e7,"Rousseau and McCarthy (2007) performed a significant service to management education by outlining the history of and current circumstance for the use of evidence-based management (EBM) by U.S.-educated and trained managers: ""EBM means managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the best available scientific evidence"" (84). Although these authors contrast practices in medicine and education with those in management, they also might have contrasted management with some of the so-called functional areas of business in the same college or school, namely, finance (economics), and operations (industrial engineering), or even industrial organizational psychology (applied psychology), and electrical engineering (physics and chemistry) that are all guided by sets of principles derived from a body of empirical evidence. Compared to these professions, management does a poor job of educating students in the scientific method or training them to employ evidence generated by this method to inform their decisions.

Course research: Using the case method to build and teach management theory,2009,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650799902&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2009.41788846&partnerID=40&md5=16affd76818b4e77d5252652663993a2,"We have come to believe that instead of compartmentalizing research and teaching into separate realms, it might be more productive to think of teachers and students as partners in a collective enterprise of building, improving and using management theory. We hope that this paper can constitute the beginnings of a pyramid of its own: a prescriptive theory of course design. Case studies can comprise a solid foundation for theory-building courses because they can be structured to display the phenomena in all its complexity. Instead of a descriptive categorization of case-based versus lecture courses, we propose that faculty find themselves in one of two circumstances. The first comprises situations where instructors need to develop theory. The second circumstance is when instructors hope to teach theory, improve it, and help students practice its use. We propose that it might be helpful to begin referring to our classroom activities in these two circumstances as course research. At the peak of the pyramid that we propose is a statement of causality: What enables managers to be effective is the ability to use the appropriate theory or model, given the circumstance in which they find themselves, that will allow them accurately to predict the result of the actions they plan to take. They will be more effective managers if they are discerning consumers of theory if they can tell an invalid and unreliable theory from a valid, reliable one, and know how the tools they employ to become successful must differ by circumstance. For those steeped in the gospel of sample size, it will seem audacious that we propose a theory of course architecture that is extracted from a few case studies, all of which are tainted by the subjectiveness of personal experience and observation. But as noted above, all data are subjective, and what makes a normative theory externally valid isn't sample size, but getting the categories right. We aren't finished, of course. We simply hope that these concepts can provide willing faculty members with a start. As they use these statements of cause and effect, we hope that most of them find that the statements of causality actually do lead to the creation of better theory and more productive learning by students and faculty. We can expect, however, that anomalies will arise, as researchers follow these methods and fail. When this happens, we invite them to publish a paper about the anomaly, focusing on what it was about the circumstance of their research that caused the causal mechanism we have described here not to work. It is only by doing so that we can approach a better understanding of what methods of research and teaching can most predictably yield the most insightful theories and the best-prepared students. © Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2009.",,

I extend Leavitt's list of our enemies-the additional enemy being within our own psyche of sharing a similar value system to a certain extent-hence pointing to the challenge of combating our own way of thinking as a first priority for management learning and education.

We integrate research on experiential learning and cultural intelligence to propose a process model that focuses on how leaders translate their international work assignment experiences into learning outcomes critical for global leadership development. Our model positions cultural intelligence as a moderator that enhances the likelihood that individuals on international assignments will actively engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, reflect, conceptualize, experiment), which in turn leads to global leadership self-efficacy, ethnorelative attitudes toward other cultures, accurate mental models of leadership across cultures, and flexibility of leadership styles. Our model has major implications for the selection and training of individuals, as well as organizational practices related to international job assignments from a developmental perspective. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

However, diversity research has had limited practical effects, in part because it has not been disseminated to the public, including management students. Since at least 1991, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business has included specific statements on diversity in management education but has not mandated a course or attended to diversity as it has to ethics in business. We argue that given the persistence of discrimination, harassment, and inequality, and the importance of diversity concerns worldwide, mandatory diversity education is needed for management students. Without such education, these students stand to enter the workforce ill-equipped for participation in diverse environments. We propose that there are moral, ethical, and business reasons for diversity education and suggest that limited diversity among business faculty and administration contributes to the lack of mandatory diversity education for management students. We provide suggestions for research on factors influencing the inclusion of mandatory diversity courses and on the effectiveness of such courses. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Analysis of survey data collected from first semester freshmen business majors indicates on-line gradebook monitoring is the primary form of feedback seeking students use to assess classroom performance and is a significant, positive predictor of final course grades.

I challenge the view that organizations can readily develop the EI of individuals. I articulate a number of barriers that impair these endeavors. I propose a conceptual map, which illustrates the process of organizations attempting to develop EI, as well as the impact of these barriers. Instead of organizational endeavors to develop EI, I advocate a self-initiated modification of attitudes in order to foster enhanced self-awareness. I argue that this can give rise to the emotional and intellectual growth that lies at the heart of the ability conceptualization of EI. I conclude that the barriers identified can considerably impair the prospect of developing EI in an organizational context. Conversely, encouraging individuals to foster their EI using a personal development initiative may have great remedial effects, transcending the dichotomy of private and organizational life. © Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2009.",,

Multisource feedback research has shown, however, that the extent to which improvement occurs depends on a variety of personality variables. Researchers have both suggested and to some extent shown that providing coaching in addition to giving the multisource feedback increases the amount of performance improvement. Few empirical studies have, however, explored what it is that coaches do that leads participants to improve their performance after an executive education program. To better understand what participants find effective in the coaching they receive, we conducted a qualitative study of the coaching perceptions of managers participating in executive education programs. The key finding, which seems to contradict much of the existing coaching literature, is that participants in multisource feedback coaching sessions in executive education programs expected and wanted their coach to take an active role in interpreting their results and in making action recommendations. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Students' uncertainty about how to tackle cultural analysis in their study tasks is discussed in the light of their confusion over the concept of culture itself, the theoretical models they are taught, and the lack of conceptual integration on the IB programs. The findings indicate that even a strong emphasis on culture taught within the framework of a highly integrated, interdisciplinary international business program, with a student population that ought in theory to be particularly receptive to cultural matters, is not enough in itself to guarantee that students engage with culture seriously during their studies. I recommend strengthening conceptual integration in IB programs by providing students with readings that explicitly address business activities from a cultural perspective to avoid a situation where they opt for cultural ""short-cuts"" in their assignments in the form of overly general, values-based descriptive approaches to culture. © Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2009.",,

Students' perceptions of social loafing: Its antecedents and consequences in undergraduate business classroom teams,2009,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67649565548&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2009.37012178&partnerID=40&md5=a7c97170de7f037be721256b97b7e0b8,"We report the findings from a 2-stage study of student perceptions of social loafing as it occurs in undergraduate business classroom teams. Given the popularity of student teams as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate business classrooms, as well as the near absence of research that has focused on students' definition of the problem, our purpose was to develop preliminary findings and spur new thinking about social loafing in this context. A definition of the construct was developed, and its key antecedents and consequences identified by way of exploratory analysis of student perceptions. The resulting hypotheses and conceptual model were tested using a structural equations model by way of a survey of 349 students taking classes in an undergraduate business program. Student perceptions of social loafing seem more complex than current views suggest. They point to student apathy and social disconnectedness as antecedents, and note that they take compensatory action when members of their teams social loaf. We identify issues for future research and discuss implications for instructors and program administrators. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2009.",,

We identify four processes that are particular to the way in which arts-based methods contribute to the development of individual organization managers and leaders: through the transference of artistic skills, through projective techniques, through the evocation of ""essence,"" and through creating artifacts such as masks, collages, or sculpture, a process we call ""making."" We illustrate these processes in detail with two case examples and then discuss the implications for designing the use of arts-based methods for managerial and leadership development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2009.",,

Today it encompasses a much wider range of capabilities to address contemporary challenges such as globalization, open innovation, and the need for corporate renewal and venturing. To gain insight into the implications of this change, we conducted a number of exploratory interviews with leaders from both the demand and supply sides in Europe based in higher education institutes, the corporate sector, and public institutes. Our interviews highlight a dynamic field moving from traditional MBA-focused programs toward more entrepreneurial ""boot camps,"" from a case study-oriented teaching style toward a mentoring approach, and from an emphasis upon general business toward working across disciplines yet being sensitive to underlying technologies. We found important implications for technology management education with respect to its location within universities and identified opportunities for business schools to provide technology entrepreneurship and commercialization skills. © 2009 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

All these educational activities exist at other institutions, but they have never been combined in a single program.

Further, the use of technology for business innovation increasingly involves technologies transferred across businesses or from universities to industry, either through licensing or engagement of entrepreneurial enterprises, requiring coordination of efforts by inventors, business, and legal professionals. Recent studies in technology entrepreneurship recommend integrated approaches to educating students to operate in this space. We discuss the benefits and challenges of integrated approaches to graduate education in technology entrepreneurship in the context of an NSF-sponsored program that teams science and engineering PhD students with law and MBA students. The curriculum focuses on the technical, legal, and business issues involved with moving fundamental research to the marketplace. We draw on program assessment data, which includes pre- and post-surveys and a control group. We find significant and positive effects of the program on student perceptions of the multidisciplinary capabilities needed to operate in a technological business environment. © 2009 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We report on the development and delivery of an information technology (IT) management course designed to address these challenges. Our approach is built around a narrative, the ""IVK extended case series,"" a fictitious but reality-based story about a newly appointed, not-technically-trained chief information officer (CIO) in his first year on the job. We designed the course around a narrative and composed the narrative in a specific way to achieve two key objectives. First, this format allowed us to combine the active student orientation typical of case-based approaches with the systematic construction of cumulative theoretical frameworks more characteristic of lecture-based methods. Second, basing the narrative on the monomyth, a literary pattern common to important narratives around the world, encourages students to more fully inhabit the story's hero, which leads to fuller engagement and more active learning. We report results using this approach with undergraduate and graduate students in two universities located in different countries, and with executives at a major multinational corporation and an open enrollment program at a major business school. Student course feedback and a follow-up survey administered about 1 year after the course suggest that the extended narrative approach mostly achieves its design objectives. We suggest that the approach might be used more widely in teaching technology management, particularly with ""digital natives,"" who have come of age in an environment crowded with engaging approaches to communication and entertainment competing for their attention. © 2009 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

However, the creation of ""bilingual"" graduates who have dual technical and managerial competencies is thwarted by students' inferior teamwork and interpersonal skills. In education, what is taught is inextricably bound to how it is taught (Dewey, 1916). Current pedagogies in engineering education are insufficiently adapted to student learning style needs (Felder & Silverman, 1988), and the management component of engineering education remains underdeveloped. This problem is keenly felt in one French engineering school where students struggle with a team-based innovation project. We detail efforts made to equip students with teamwork skills by using games as a pedagogical device. Student teams compete to build weight resistant structures using only spaghetti sticks and sewing thread. Their written feedback forms the primary qualitative data for this study. Individual student interviews were subsequently carried out to further uncover potential learning outcomes. We found that students' responses to the spaghetti game were overwhelmingly positive. Their commentary also illustrates concrete learning of many crucial teamwork processes. Finally, we discuss what makes this pedagogical innovation work and how it should be further studied. © 2009 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

The opportunity to relaunch the program in the faculty of engineering provided a new opportunity to refresh the program and introduce management of technology (MOT) courses that were not feasible when the program resided in the School of Business. We discuss how this move allowed the program designers to account for the unique needs of innovation management in a small and newly developed Asian country by introducing courses into the curriculum that could only have been offered in a faculty of engineering. The unique courses include Intellectual Property Management, Management of Industrial Research and Development, Systems Architecture, and Systems Engineering. From a pedagogical perspective, we also examine the advantages of offering the program on a part-time basis to accommodate working engineers and managers. We reflect on how Singapore's experiences in designing appropriate curricula, overcoming resource constraints, and leveraging resources for management of technology programs might be useful to other developing nations. Finally, we discuss a potential approach for integrating MOT programs into the core engineering curriculum as a way to enhance the value of traditional professional degrees. © 2009 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Instruments used in the study, involving 356 Malaysian public sector employees, included Sternberg et al.'s (2000) Tacit Knowledge Inventory for Managers and a normative version of Kolb's (1999a) Learning Styles Inventory (LSI-Ill). Findings suggest that LAMTK is independent of the length of subjects' general work experience, but positively related to the amount of time spent working in a management context. Learning styles also had a significant relationship. Subjects who spent most of their time performing management functions and whose dominant learning styles were accommodating had significantly higher LAMTK than those with different learning styles. We also found support for the belief that learners with a strong preference for all four different abilities defined in Kolb's learning theory may be critical for effective experiential learning.

I challenge those arguments by showing that it is unlikely that on-line education and corporate universities will disrupt the environment of traditional business schools. I also show that two longer term trends - the growth of for-profit universities and the globalization of business education coupled with the diffusion of accreditation - are likely to have an impact on business school enrollment markets both within and outside the United States. My conclusion is that accreditation can be beneficial to many business schools for two reasons. One reason is that accreditation processes require that business schools gain clarify about the markets they serve and the services they offer, which is increasingly important as enrollment markets grow more competitive. The other reason is that the value of accreditation as a quality differentiator appears to be rising in the markets for part-time working students and international students.

Learning contracts can serve as diagnostic tools to help educational Institutions assess their effectiveness; they also can help prepare students for their university training by aligning their expectations with forthcoming experiences. We find little evidence that the main Ideas underpinning learning contracts are being implemented by business education standard-setters, management educators, or leading business programs. We discuss how learning contracts can be used In the diagnosis and redesign of management education. © 2006 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,
"Teaching value in diversity: On the folly of espousing inclusion, while practicing exclusion",2008,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-61849149410&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2008.34251674&partnerID=40&md5=3673f15c948e1cc8201f496e89c5c118,"Our experience of common approaches to teaching diversity suggests that while we espouse to teach inclusion in order to yield the potential workgroup and organizational value associated with diversity, we may be in effect teaching exciusion, perpetuating the practice of making distinctions between perspectives that are sanctioned and valued, and those that are not. We explore ways this inclusion-exclusion conundrum emerges and is reinforced, potential inherent dangers, and strategies to yield more inclusive diversity courses.

For illustrative purposes, we reanalyzed the database meta-analyzed by Kuncel, Credé, and Thomas (2007) on the validity of the GMAT and found that the validity of the GMAT has been underestimated by 7% due to the application of suboptimal range-restriction corrections. These findings have important implications for both researchers and practitioners In the field of education and learning, who should choose and use the most accurate methods available In an effort to accurately estimate validity and to ensure educational resources are targeted at those most likely to benefit. © 2008 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Thus, understanding similarities and differences in the content of mission statements of business schools is especially timely. To provide insights concerning the use of missions in colleges of business, we analyzed the content of mission statements from 408 AACSB schools and explored relations between mission content and measures of business school characteristics, including performance. Overall, there was considerable variance in the content of organizational missions. Using a previously established framework to analyze mission content, we found business school missions generally lacked comprehensiveness. Relying on a quasi-balanced scorecard approach, we found differences in business school performance were related to mission content. Last, we were able to detect distinctions among configurations of business schools in the use of mission statement components and performance. Overall, this study provides an in-depth look at the status of mission statements among business schools at a time when their use has become critical to accountability, assessment, and accreditation. © 2008 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We begin with a discussion of the relational perspective on career learning, which provides a context for peer coaching as a tool that can accelerate career learning. We distinguish between peer coaching and the related concepts of mentoring and peer mentoring and discuss factors that facilitate the development of this type of helping relationship. We offer a discussion of the key characteristics of effective peer-coaching relationships, and we provide an empirical test of the Impact of these characteristics with a survey of MBA students. We also offer a theoretical model of peer coaching, along with propositions for future research. We conclude that when peer coaching works best for a person, it happens through a 3-step process of (1) building the developmental relationship, (2) creating success In development, and (3) Internalizing the learning tactic by applying the peer-coaching process In future relationships. © 2008 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

We provide an argument for what is termed a service-dominant logic for management education. It is organized into three parts. The first reviews the current status of the management discipline's coverage in our research and teaching of the unique challenges and opportunities in managing services. The second details seven key differences in managing services that are either minimally covered or ignored in traditional management courses. The third offers some suggestions as to how management scholars and educators can add coverage of these unique challenges and opportunities of managing services to our curriculum. We suggest that the time is now for capturing the rapidly expanding knowledge base of services in management texts, teachings, and research.

We identify how a preference for abstract causal explanation over practical knowledge, and for reason and truth over what works, has led to a privileging of detached contemplation over involved action. Despite repeated calls to make management research and education more ""relevant"" to practice, many business schools continue to privilege rigor and precision as the arbiters of authoritative knowledge using representational devices such as conceptual models, case studies, and other formal classifications. We argue that risks of ignorance and detachment emerge from this singular attachment to knowledge-by-representation in business schools. We identify the need for an alternative, accompanying form of knowledge associated with the art of management that can only be transmitted through exemplary behavior within the business education process. We call this knowledge-by-exemplification: one that is demonstrative, creative and unreflectively performative, transmitted directly through the demeanor, style, and mannerism of management educators rather than through the content of lectures. For us, it is this relatively unnoticed aspect of the education process that provides one possible answer to the predicament of relevance facing business schools. © 2008 Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Trainer race and sex had no impact on trainee evaluations when the course viras focused on similarities, whereas trainees in the course highlighting differences responded least favorably to the White male trainer.

The theory-application balance in management pedagogy: A longitudinal update,2007,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38149090229&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2007.27694948&partnerID=40&md5=56ff4fc6b35af17271e2602563505a28,"We attempt to extend previous research concerning the perceptions of management educators on the relative balance between theory and applications in their classroom instruction. Specifically, this study represents an update to results of previous survey data collected in the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s published by Wren, Atherton, and Michaelsen (1980) and Wren, Buckley, and Michaelsen (1994). Based on a sample of 525 members of the Academy of Management, we conclude that there is an increasing emphasis toward teaching management theory compared to earlier data collection. In the 1970s, the theory-application balance was tipped in favor of theory. However, in the 1980s there was a significant swing away from theory toward application. Now, we appear to be back to the trends of the 1970s, with an emphasis of theory over practical application. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent concerns over the role of theory in management classrooms. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

The reality is more stark-and far more complex-a world divided into haves and have-nots, a world that is not sustainable ecologically and perhaps not politically. Management education can be an important source of new ideas about shifting toward an integrated rather than fractured knowledge economy. In the following I present background arguments about the nature of the knowledge economy, highlight some current fractures in the world, and suggest possible content in environmental, societal, and business arenas for management education, which can be used to develop leaders and managers capable of taking the types of actions needed to create both ecological sustainability and an integrated knowledge world.

A phenomenographic study of what it means to supervise doctoral students,2007,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38349171593&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2007.27694946&partnerID=40&md5=0a208e34eb9ad362325cb7d5ca5d4629,"We utilize the research methodology of phenomenography in this study to explore what doctoral supervisors understand supervision to be and how they enact this understanding in the practice of supervising students. Twenty interviews were undertaken with supervisors at three Australian universities to uncover ""lived"" experiences of doctoral research supervision. Five qualitatively different ways of conceiving supervisors' roles emerged through phenomenographic analysis of the transcripts. Our findings suggest that while supervisors undertake similar tasks when supervising, they approach these tasks differently because of their qualitatively different understandings of what supervision is.

Based upon a qualitative study of management professors' classroom responses to a world crisis, we find that there are three distinct ways in which management professors define their role. These definitions are best framed by the Greek archetypes of Athena, Prometheus, and Asclepius. After describing and contrasting these three archetypal frames, we discuss their implications for professors' enactment of their role, for student learning, and for management education in general.

Unfortunately, the true impact of the Golem effect - Pygmalion in reverse - has gone unproven and the potential negative effects are not wholly understood. Furthermore, the literature largely fails to address the extent to which Pygmalion-related effects may differ based on task design. This study examines the effect of an instructor's verbalized expectations - both negative and positive - on the performance of 351 business-school undergraduate students. Analyses using pre- and posttreatment data collected during controlled-laboratory experiments indicated, most notably, that negative expectations of students' performance on cognitively based tasks tend to degrade that performance. The effects on noncognitively based tasks were, however, positive. Positive expectations had the opposite effect. Implications for management education research and related applications are discussed. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Ultimately, we need a synthesis of theory and practice if we are to prepare thoughtful practitioners. Using conceptual and practical approaches from constructionist thought borrowing such tools as tacit knowledge, critical reflection, and mastery, I propose a means to effect such a synthesis. Needed is a new epistemology of practice that adds praxis to classroom education in order to help learners deconstruct the structures and systems that embed their social environments. I also examine the outcomes and particular competencies that emanate from a practice-based learning. Implications for teaching by learning from this practice epistemology are discussed.

Developing paradigmatic awareness in university business schools: The challenge for executive education,2007,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34748898915&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2007.26361624&partnerID=40&md5=b016aaaa7f0ac35f5e6f4d79bbd31892,"The question of how university-based forms of executive education can effectively contribute to the enhancement of practitioner capabilities using the insights of the humanities remains underexplored. The sustained pressure in business schools to adopt a teaching curriculum and pedagogical approach that appears immediately relevant to the perceived needs of practitioners is overwhelming. Yet, universities are distinct from consultancies or other professional management institutes in that traditionally they provide well-established forums for intellectual exchange and encourage crossfertilization among academic disciplines. We maintain that university-based business schools are uniquely positioned to use their internal university-wide expertise and core capabilities to inculcate paradigmatic awareness among business executives to enable them to enlarge their horizons of understanding and hence extend their decisional possibilities. For us, this is the true competitive advantage of university-based business schools over corporate universities, management training institutes, and consultancies. We maintain that university-based business schools can paradoxically be invaluable to business and industry, not by becoming overly anxious about immediate relevance, but by recognizing that the education and development of the individual as a whole through exposure to a plurality of paradigms and perspectives, is what sets universities apart and makes them distinct from other executive education providers. Their real value to the practitioner world is in offering truly fresh insights and genuine radical alternatives to executive problem situations through novel interpretations that are counterintuitive to received wisdom and best practice.

There are few. if any, reported or reported-and-evaluated attempts at the development of managers' intuitive awareness either in business school or in-company programs. We offer a justification for the inclusion of intuition in management education and go on to report the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program for the development of managers' intuitive awareness. The program used a combination of training and extended practice employing a variety of innovative experiential techniques. The program was evaluated by means of content analyses of the logs that participants compiled during the practice phase. Participants reported positively on the program and documented effects in a number of areas related to the context for intuition (inner-outer), the intuitive process (time, place, and pace), and its outcomes (sense of perspective; self-confidence; inter- and intrapersonal sensitivity; metacognition). The implications for the further application of these approaches in management education and development, and some personal reflections on their use are discussed.

With increasing demand for qualified professors and decreasing supply, however, there is an urgent need to examine our PhD education as well. We need to be preparing our future professors to meet the changing demands on business education. Our PhD students need to know how to teach MBAs and executives, how to be successful researchers and entrepreneurs (e.g., to get grants), and how to be ethical models for our student citizens. With an eye on this new future, I describe a realistic job preview: what PhDs will need to know to be successful faculty members. I cover both the needed knowledge content (e.g., teaching, research, and service skills) and the career stages that need to be successfully navigated (e.g., getting a job, surviving as an assistant professor, getting tenure and other professional roles such as being a journal editor, consultant, or department chair). I then examine the different ways that PhDs can acquire this information through informal or more formal mechanisms. This section highlights the changing demands on business school faculty. I close with an overall evaluation of these possible changes and a call for business schools to examine their PhD education with these issues in mind.

We contribute here to an integration of past research and propose and test a multifaceted construct of thinking style based on two primary dimensions: linear thinking (e.g., rationality, logic, analytic thinking) and nonlinear thinking (e.g., intuition, insight, creativity). We present and validate in four separate studies a self-report diagnostic instrument (Linear-Nonlinear Thinking Style Profile or LNTSP) for measuring an individual's linear and nonlinear thinking style profile. Validation study results across student, professional, and managerial samples reveal a 4-factor model of linear and nonlinear thinking style involving the manner in which individuals attend to a particular kind of information source (internal vs. external) and subsequent linear versus nonlinear processing of that information. The results also indicate that the LNTSP has acceptable convergent validity vis-a-vis two commonly used and conceptually related instruments, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Cognitive Style Index, as well as external validity and face validity across students from different academic major programs (e.g., liberal arts vs. business and engineering), individuals from distinctly different professional careers (i.e., professional actors and accountants), and managerial and professional workshop participants. We discuss implications of these results for future research, as well as possible beneficial use of the LNTSP for management education and business practice.

There has been, however, a concern that business schools are increasingly uncoupled from practice and that business school research lacks real-world relevance. This relevance-rigor gap affects the quality of our teaching as well as the institutional legitimacy of our business schools. We argue that executive education is an underutilized context that can enhance the quality of faculty research as well as our impact on managerial practice. Using evaluation data from variations of a single executive education program, we find that action-learning programs significantly enhance both individual and organizational outcomes compared to traditional executive education formats. Action-learning programs also enhance our teaching and research efforts. Building on these results and experiences, we suggest that executive education in general, and action learning in particular, are fertile contexts where business schools can bridge the relevance-rigor gap.

A transformational program presupposes a change in behavior of the attending executive so that the latter becomes more effective in personal or organizational change. To understand what influences the transformational process three triangular conceptual frameworks (building on the short-term dynamic psychotherapy tradition) are presented: the mental life triangle, the conflict triangle, and the relationships triangle. The first shows that cognitive and emotional processes need to be taken into consideration to create changes in behavior. The second describes the sources of thoughts and feelings that may prompt anxiety and cause defensive reactions prohibiting change and productive use of talents. The third relationships triangle explains how an individual's previous experiences create patterns of response that are repeated throughout life and can become dysfunctional. Five major challenges in program design are also examined: selecting participants; identifying the focal issue on which participants need to work; the creation of a safe transitional space that enables the change process; using the group dynamic to foster transformation and to arrive at internalization of the change process; and the educational implications for faculty, facilitators, and coaches.

Many business schools invest in executive education to generate funds for faculty research and development, internal operations, or to provide faculty members with opportunities to earn income and to gain knowledge of and exposure to specific industries, companies, and executives. Other providers view EE as a core competency that is their primary raison d'etre. The b-school rankings game has now fully incorporated EE, and providers now compete aggressively for revenue, reputation, and stature (see BusinessWeek, 2006; Financial Times, 2006). We report here on interviews with the heads of five leading EE providers. Through our interviews and analysis, we develop a picture of EE as a dynamic and evolving industry and educational process, with a diversity of players and perspectives.

In this essay I outline how a cognitive philosophy of science shift in the business school culture from Thomas Kuhn's normal science paradigm framework to Karl Popper's revolutionary science methodology would mitigate many of the dysfunctions Ghoshal catalogues.

It hit me one day - for no obvious reason - that I have never been fond of large organizations (though some - by no means all - small organizations are quite lovable). Like many colleagues, I have researched big American and overseas organizations, consulted with them, tried to help humanize them, conducted courses and seminars for their people, taught here and abroad in business schools that prepared students to participate in them, and focused my professional life around them. Despite lifting - indeed often bonding with - many of the people of big organizations, I now realize that I have long felt rather distanced from the institutions themselves, implicitly viewing them as unhealthy places for us humans, as flawed, erosive, imprisoning. I should add that - though now conscious of that standoffish posture - I do not plan to abandon if. While this is written from an American perspective, I believe that big organizations everywhere, today as well as yesterday, are psychologically unhealthy environments.

Over a period of 10 years the faculty director and program staff made changes to meet clients' needs by creating an innovative curriculum design that integrates adult learning and human resource development theory with executive education. Specifically, we present the findings from the 5-year action research project that grew out of this redesign process, demonstrating how connections between learner-focused program practices can facilitate assessment of program impact. We then discuss the implications for integrating assessment with curricular design of the program for evaluating the benefits of programs for sponsoring companies.

Bill retired in 2005 as the ITT Professor of Creative Management at the Stern School of Business at New York University and now serves as Professor in Residence at the University of Oregon's Lundguist College of Business. In the intervening decades. Bill has held faculty positions at 20 universities, taught classes on 32 different subjects, published more than 130 articles in a variety of disciplines, served on the editorial boards of 14 journals and as editor of Administrative Science Quarterly, been elected a fellow of 5 professional societies and held the position of president of the Academy of Management, and most recently, was selected as recipient of the 2005 Academy of Management Distinguished Scholarly Contributions Award. This interview draws forth the lessons Bill has learned through his personal experiences, teaching, and research over his many decades as a leading management scholar. He identifies several problems that confront learning and education within the Academy of Management and those it serves, as well as those it should attempt to serve, and he offers advice on how to address these problems.

Millions of dollars are spent each year on development initiatives that often fail to transfer into performance gains, primarily due to insufficient support given to the learning transfer process. One initiative used by companies to develop managerial skills is the 360 feedback process. This process has been recognized by some for its value because of its inherent ability to reinforce learning and create actionable knowledge. Some companies have gone so far as to assume that the 360 feedback process will apply equally across cultures. Given that different cultures hold different values, the assumption needs to be examined. The question of cultural relevance for the 360 feedback process was examined across five countries in this study. The results provide support for the overall effectiveness of the 360 process across the combined sample. Comparisons among the five countries, however, revealed important differences. The results were examined based on Hofstede's four work-related values. The 360 feedback process was found to be most effective in cultures with low power distance and individualistic values. The implications for both practice and research are discussed. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,

Technological and social changes in the wider environment can have major implications for teaching and learning pedagogies - i.e., optimal teaching and learning occur when teaching styles align with learning styles. For that reason, we consider some key learning principles in light of the learning styles of our current generation of students, who are quite facile with virtual technologies. We argue that the effective use of some electronic learning tools can provide useful and engaging means for their education by addressing this generation's preferences for virtual media while also enabling student-directed interactivity (via online searches, games, simulations, etc.). We first articulate the conceptual grounds for arguing that there has been another shift in the teaching and learning environment we now face - which implies some necessary adaptation of traditional learning principles. We then discuss: (a) some technologies and applications (mainly Internet-based tools and videogames) that can facilitate the convergence between virtual generation (V-Gen) preferences and classroom interactions; (b) some guidelines for using these technologies to fulfil these learning principles and; (c) some pitfalls that can occur and how to avoid them.

We argue here that leader sustainability is adversely affected by the psychological and physiological effects of chronic power stress associated with the performance of the leadership role. We further contend, however, that when leaders experience compassion through coaching the development of others, they experience psychophysiological effects that restore the body's natural healing and growth processes, thus enhancing their sustainability. We thus suggest that to sustain their effectiveness, leaders should emphasize coaching as a key part of their role and behavioral habits.

Status competition virtually guarantees: (1) the absence of a demonstrable connection between the amount of research produced and the amount that is actually needed or usable; (2) the excessive uniformity and practical irrelevance of business research, owing to the subordination of substantive problems to methodological commitments; and (3) the subordination of teaching to research. The overproduction of research, while irrational on a collective level, is in fact the aggregated product of ""rational"" behaviors by individual schools and faculty members facing pressures to compete with one another.

Does service learning live up to its potential? We examined the syllabi of business courses taught at universities noted for their service learning programs and courses. Surprisingly, almost half of the courses treated service learning projects like any other assignment. Only 18% emphasized civic responsibility and community involvement in their course objectives. Effective curricular design is founded upon clearly articulated, meaningful course objectives.

To ensure congruence with the emerging management teaching methods, we advocate adoption of the term andragogy. Such a word focuses on the adult learner and creation of an independent, adaptable individual. Underpinning andragogy are four assumptions regarding learning: a self-directing self-concept; use of experience; a readiness to learn; and a performance-centered orientation to learning. Management educators already use techniques that take advantage of these andragogical assumptions.

But how is such a practice developed? The author proposes the use of action learning - in its original formulation, namely, through reflection on real-time work experience dealing with unfamiliar problems - as a gateway to collaborative leadership. Action learning is portrayed as growing in acceptance as a management education and learning approach that distills knowledge from a context to be used to provide learning to the practice as well as to the practitioner. The account demonstrates how the operating practices of collaborative leadership are directly affected by action learning and proposes that the two approaches are based on common principles. © Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2006.",,

We suggest a pedagogical approach that examines aspirational as well as consequentialist antecedents of socially responsible behavior by firms. We also advance a framework where the ""dependent variable"" of firm behavior, that is, competitive advantage, can be rendered more inclusive of nonmarket and idealistic elements. Our framework suggests that social responsibility can then be rendered endogenous to firm performance. We argue that an emphasis on such an approach can offer business schools a way to make social responsibility more meaningful to students.",,

Data were gathered four times across students' first year and archivally at entry and again 4 years later. Results showed that students being peer-mentored was related to satisfaction with their university during the semester of the mentoring intervention as well as the end of the following semester, but more mixed results were found in terms of commitment and actual graduation behavior when compared to the nonmentored control group of freshmen who received only the general orientation course. Thus, the mentoring intervention seems to work well for influencing satisfaction but not for actual academic performance indicators such as overall college GPA or graduation.",,

Based on nearly 10 years of observation and deep involvement with MBA change efforts, we at the Aspen Institute's Business and Society Program believe nothing short of a new definition of rigor is needed. This new rigor would equip managers with the analytical and conceptual skills to think far outside the gate rather than at the enterprise level, to see new connections between social and environmental challenges on the one hand and firm-level growth and innovation on the other, and to plan far beyond the quarter and into the future. Further, the new rigor would be characterized by a commitment to inquiry, by the opportunity to challenge key assumptions of the MBA canon, and by teaching students how to effectively voice personal and institutional values. While much innovation is currently underway in MBA education, there is enormous potential for courageous faculty to do even more to explore this new rigor in research - and in the classroom.",,

In particular, we can help our students consider their values and realize them in practice. According to Aristotle, ethics is about virtue, which is a matter of one's own well-being primarily, but as we are rational and social creatures, this state of well-being entails having what we would consider good moral values. Does good character really serve the agent's interests? Yes, if the agent has the right interests, and interests can be cultivated to some degree. One's values must be coherent, and one must be able to discern the salient moral features of the situations with which one deals. These are marts of good character, which the culture of one's organization may nurture or undermine. We arrive at principles supportive of good character by reflective equilibrium, a process like what Aristotle calls dialectic. Case studies assist our students in developing good character and learning to bring it to bear in complex situations, as some recent research has suggested is possible. One way to protect one's character, our students may learn, is to choose a workplace that does not undermine it.",,

We develop this idea in a specific application by describing how psychological wounds sensitize executives to be anxious about getting hurt again. These vigilant and unconscious concerns distort perceptions of organizational reality and lead to unnecessarily intense emotional reactions such as anger, fear, and panic. In turn, this kind of emotional perturbation can cloud judgment and hamper performance. We present a practical psychology of the inner world of distorted beliefs, anachronistic assumptions, and misplaced fears that often lurk beneath counterproductive behavior. Considerable attention is given to what management educators can do to work at this deeper level by helping leaders become aware of, manage, and, ultimately, outgrow being hypersensitive to failure, inadequacy, rejection, dependency, and the like.",,

We found that graduate business students cheat more than their nonbusiness-student peers. Correlation results found cheating to be associated with perceived peer behavior, as well as the perceived certainty of being reported by a peer, and the understanding and acceptance of academic integrity policies by students and faculty. But, regression analysis results suggest that perceived peer behavior has the largest effect. Drawing from these findings and past research on undergraduate students, we propose strategies that business schools and faculty can use to promote academic integrity in graduate business programs.",,

Using within-class data we found that changes in grades in the last half of a term were met with systematic and corresponding changes in the evaluations students gave to their instructors. Further, we found a relationship between change in grades and change in evaluations when controlling for both student and instructor characteristics.

We also present various types of instructional situations that are suited for intuition, along with the benefits for teaching and learning and the potential limitations. Suggestions are offered such that instructors may learn to capitalize on the advantages of using their intuition, yet minimize the disadvantages, and also on how they may educate the intuitive awareness of their students.

We present four specific critiques of business education: (1) the business curriculum focuses on functional and discrete rather than cross-functional and holistic knowledge; (2) coursework emphasizes practical problem-solving ""tool kits"" rather than deep theoretical knowledge; (3) the underlying paradigm of business education views humanity and human interactions in purely transactional terms; (4) the grounding morality of business education asserts the supremacy of shareholder wealth. Based on our collective experience with service-learning, we believe that the pedagogy presents a needed counterpoint to the narrow focus of business education.

Instead, my goal was to create a useful resource guide for faculty members working in management and leadership disciplines who are interested in service-learning. I include a select group of core monographs, journal articles, boot chapters, and websites/listservs that will introduce those interested in service-learning to some of the most cited and current work in the area. In an attempt to make this as useful a guide as possible, I added my reactions and reflections to each resource discussed. The decision for inclusion in this guide was threefold. First, for general service-learning sources, each source must provide substantial enough information that the document disseminates significant theory, issues, and application of practice within higher education and be accessible either through the web, libraries, or by purchase; however, older materials (1993 and prior) and general education sources were intentionally omitted as most education literature is frequently speckled with John Dewey and retrospective historical information and is, therefore, considered commonly known. Second, for the business and management or leadership specific section of this guide, each source must provide either ""best practice,"" new or innovative concepts, or exemplary examples of application in one or more academic institutions. Third, while there are wonderfully executed programs within the K-12 market, this article is focused almost exclusively on resources for higher education.",,

Many business professors contended that this technology adversely affected students' ratings of their effectiveness, especially at the receiving sites. Our analysis of instructor-evaluation data from 406 students in 15 courses taught by 14 instructors across 3 campuses revealed that the distance learning technology per se was not the problem; rather, it was transnational distance (i.e., dialogue and structure) as defined by Moore (1980, 1991) that affected perceived effectiveness. Transactional distance refers to the quality of the teaching and learning interaction between instructors and students who are geographically separated. We conclude that although interactive technology worked well for distance education, maintaining instructor effectiveness (i.e., lower transactional distance) results in a trade-off with efficiency. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

When managers become philosophers: Integrating learning with sensemaking,2005,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33750084655&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2005.17268565&partnerID=40&md5=c4268158d5607eab3b0e081901e6c3a8,"My purpose here is to join the scholarly conversation (Huff, 1999) concerning the development of managers (Detrick, 2002; Donaldson, 2002: Pfeffer & Fong, 2002) and to introduce the reader to two similar constructs developed in differing paradigms: sensemaking and learning. Through a review of the characteristics of sensemaking and the conceptual orientations to adult learning, similarities and contradictions emerge. Both constructs deal with the creation of meaning, the necessity for action to be linked with cognition, and the importance of both subjective and objective knowledge. Differences appear with respect to the role of critical reflection and the impact of social structuring on meaning making. Although contradictions emerge, after examining each construct independent of the other, I suggest that the two constructs are actually complementary. To identify this symbiotic relationship, I offer two implications concerning the conceptualization of managerial work and the development of managers. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Developing leaders for decision making under stress: Wildland firefighters in the south canyon fire and its aftermath,2005,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247468539&doi=10.5465%2famle.2005.19086788&partnerID=40&md5=bb5ee5d0b57c8849235f03ec34af9b71,"To identify the sources of ineffective leadership decisions, we focus on ten decisions made by a leader of a wildland firefighter crew during the fatal South Canyon fire of July 5-6, 1996. The decisions of team leaders in fire zones are unusually clear-cut and consequential for the goals of the enterprise, but they are not unlike decisions faced by managers of most organizations. We suggest that three factors - underpreparation, acute stress, and ambiguous authority - can result in suboptimal decisions by team leaders on a fireline. Through detailed evaluation of the team leader's ten most consequential decisions in the South Canyon fire, we conclude that five were relatively optimal for the triple objectives of safety, speed, and suppression, but five others proved suboptimal. Much of their suboptimality is traced to the fact that the team leader was undertrained for leadership decision making, faced intense stress, and operated without clear authority. In the wake of this firefighting disaster - 14 men and women lost their lives - the fire service created a development program using both classroom and experiential methods for preparing its leaders to make good and timely decisions. The South Canyon fire and its aftermath point to the value of explicit preparation in leadership decisions by both fire services and business schools as part of their efforts to enhance strategic thinking and other essential leadership attributes for achieving organizational goals in high stress environments. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Our purpose in this study is to examine the effectiveness of three person-organization fit measures (values congruence, personality congruence, and work environment congruence) in predicting performance and satisfaction in management training and education cross-culturally, using data sets from students in India and the United States. Data was collected from 194 students in four sections of management classes taught by four instructors from higher educational institutions in the Western U.S. and India. The results indicated that student-professor personality congruence was a significant predictor of student performance, and classroom environment congruence was a significant predictor of both student satisfaction and performance in the United States.

Entrepreneurship education research revisited: The case of higher education,2005,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33744991700&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2005.16132536&partnerID=40&md5=2966dd346f3214d1816aab8a921b294f,"Our purpose in this article is to take stock of the education preoccupations that animate research on entrepreneurship focusing on the context of higher education. More specifically, we content-analyze a sample of 103 peer-reviewed entrepreneurship education articles through the prism of Bertrand's (1995) Contemporary Theories and Practice in Education. Our results indicate that this literature is articulated around four major types of education preoccupations: (1) preoccupations with the social and economic roles of entrepreneurship education for individuals and society, as well as with the institutions of higher education themselves; (2) preoccupations with the systematization of entrepreneurship education (i.e., instructional design, the use of multimedia environments, and curriculum development); (3) preoccupations with the content matter to be taught and how this content should be delivered; and (4) preoccupations with considering the needs of individual students in structuring teaching interventions. Yet, three education preoccupations remain underaddressed, that is, those proceeding from social-cognitive, psycho-cognitive, and spiritualist or ethical theories. While we consider five obstacles that may prevent management scholars from studying these dimensions, we argue that to address this limitation, scholars must develop a dual expertise in management and education research. To this aim. we highlight a number of specific theoretical and empirical references associated with different education research preoccupations.",,

Teaching history in business schools: 1982-2003,2005,Academy of Management Learning and Education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29544447364&doi=10.5465%2fAMLE.2005.16132542&partnerID=40&md5=8352c0326c93c74badee228452cff4e1,"A long tradition in business schools is teaching the history of business or business disciplines. However, surveys over the past quarter century suggest that such teaching is becoming less common - to the detriment of our students, particularly doctoral students. We trace that tradition and present the results of two major surveys that indicate a current decline in teaching the history of business disciplines. We offer reasons and examples to support our position that we need to study history not only to gain a historical perspective but also the ability to think critically about current problems.",,

We introduce the concept of learning space as a framework for understanding the interface between student learning styles and the institutional learning environment. We illustrate the use of the learning space framework in three case studies of longitudinal institutional development. Finally, we present principles for the enhancement of experiential learning in higher education and suggest how experiential learning can be applied throughout the educational environment by institutional development programs, including longitudinal outcome assessment, curriculum development, student development, and faculty development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.",,

Adapting the concept of entry barriers from industrial organization (IO) economics to explain subject matter differences, I hypothesize that subjects for which PhDs are offered significantly explain variance in course outcomes relative to subjects for which PhDs are not generally offered. The results of the study showed that while both disciplinary and course-specific effects explained significant variance in the dependent variables, course-specific effects explained greater variance. I conclude with a discussion of future research directions, including encouragement to use theoretical frameworks from mainstream management research to accelerate the quantity and quality of management education research.",,

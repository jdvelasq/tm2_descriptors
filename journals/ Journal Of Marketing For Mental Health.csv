People want to survive and succeed and, given the opportunity and the skills, they will. Health professionals seek some of the higher goals. They want to serve their fellow man without being a servant. They want to succeed by providing relief to the suffering; such success must, by necessity, be exceptionally sweet. When human lives are at stake, the word ""important"" is truly defined. To a health professional, advancement can be an organizational promotion or it can be a professional achievement. In either case, how he/she succeeds will depend on what he/she does. He/she must perform well against a yardstick that grows constantly due to the advances in medical science. He/she must also realize constantly that what he/she performs on is a human being, and must be treated as such. He/she must keep technically able without losing his/her ability to deal in human relations. This study has shown that the health professional accepts the importance of these concepts.","","Attitude of Health Personnel; Career Mobility; Goals; Personnel, Hospital; Professional Competence; Questionnaires; United States; article; attitude; competence; hospital personnel; motivation; occupation; psychological aspect; questionnaire; United States"
